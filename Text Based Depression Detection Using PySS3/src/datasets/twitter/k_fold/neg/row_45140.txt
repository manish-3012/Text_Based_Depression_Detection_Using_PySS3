a very long post, i see people fight with illness to be alive longer, i see myself fight with fear to die soonerI donâ€™t wanna commit suicide, although i think of it a lot for many years (start to think of it when i was in grade 6) i just wanna have a long sleep , or better, sleep forever. I admit, Iâ€™m scared of killing myself, but also tired of breathing.

**a girl i know**, she fakes those thoughts so that people will love her and pay her attention. she told me she gets through all of the trouble by this way. reaction? laughed so hard, in tear, i wish she knows the feeling of wanting to die, and the feeling that everything will be fine without her, after her death. Nobody cries, nobody stays, nobody remembers. Itâ€™s just a cold body.

**I wish** she knows ashamed feelings, that I canâ€™t talk to anyone about my thoughts, my death wishes, because for me, itâ€™s just so wrong, who the fuck want to die while a thousand people out there fight for their lives. Itâ€™s a shame, to think of death at such a young age, itâ€™s a proof that Iâ€™m useless, that i waste my life, but i canâ€™t help it. I find it too hard for me to breath, itâ€™s too hard to continue look at myself every day. The sun is too bright, the grass is too green, and Iâ€™m too weak to be alive.

**wish i can give all of me**, everything, breath, brain, eye, energy, health, heart to someone who need it. The one that wanna live, the one that wanna see the sky, the one that have someone to love, and beloved. .

I donâ€™t think my family will be sad when Iâ€™m gone. They are fine, without me. Who needs thing they donâ€™t need at a very beginning? Do you? They didnâ€™t want me, I was an accident. Thatâ€™s a fact. Who need me? I donâ€™t know. Why am i here? I donâ€™t know. Why life choose me to live? I donâ€™t know.

**wish i can say â€œIâ€™m sorry** that you have to loose meâ€ but I wonâ€™t never have a chance. Because I know they will celebrate. Because i know that I want to suicide, but i stuck. Iâ€™m not brave enough to do it, â€œsorry myself for hurting youâ€ someday I can do it... now iâ€™m waiting

sorry for my bad English
