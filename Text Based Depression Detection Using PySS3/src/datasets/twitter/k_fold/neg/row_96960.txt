i know i might be an asshole. but i just wish someone could give me some empathy.itd make it so much easier than being constantly villainized and cant fuel change in youruself from negativity.

i didnt grow up with any way to change myself for the better. ive told you this. 

even if i might not deserve it i wish someone could give me some empathy to help slowly fuel my need to better myself through positivity. not telling me how im horrible. the worst to be a ound. selfish. dumb.  

i really am broken beyond repair. he was right. years ago and hes still fucking right.

 i cant make myself better if all its making me feel is want to make it easier for evrryone else to just be gone
