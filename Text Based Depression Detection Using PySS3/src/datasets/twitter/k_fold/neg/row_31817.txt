I feel ashamed for relapsing on my extremely negative mental health. I just got out of the psyc ward a month ago and feel dreadful about having to maybe go back -- to the same one!My suicidal thoughts have resurfaced x100 the urges are way worse then last time, and I actually had an attempt last time. But now, a unknown "force" pushing me to do it. I've been cutting real bad, even shamefully craving words deep into my skin. Life hasn't changed since before I went in the first time....but life was doing great until now and I need help or something because I feel so ashamed for having to face the same doctors, nurses again. Fuccck.
