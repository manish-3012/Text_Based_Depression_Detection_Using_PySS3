Maybe I should goHey.
Life has been rough. Bullied at school, multiple depressions in early childhood (and til now). Loneliness. Anxiety. Constant rejection.
There was undoubtly moments of joy. But the further
I go, the more rare, short and superficial they become. That's an endless cycle that constantly goes down.
I've been fighting until now, and I'm proud of it. I survived how I could. I always remained right, tried my best to be a good person.
Recently my situation has significantly worsened. Til now I constantly analyzed my problems, myself, trying to understand what to do to get better. I writed a lot, read a lot of philosophy too.
But it's useless. My knowledge of myself expands but I don't have the strength to do what is right. And every year comes with its new and crushing problems.
My hopes for stability and more durable periods of happiness are fading. I'm really tired. Every night, it becomes harder. I tried to fight with all I have, but I'm just overwhelmed. I can't take this anymore. This is too hard.
This goes nowhere, and I tend to think that the wiser would be to stop suffering waiting and fighting for something that strays further from me every day. Maybe I should go, peacefully, go to sleep for good after reminding a last time my brightest memories. I can't save me from myself.
