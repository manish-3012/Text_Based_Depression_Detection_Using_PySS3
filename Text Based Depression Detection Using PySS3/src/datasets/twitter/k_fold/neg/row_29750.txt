So hurtI suffer from bipolar disorder. I know my story isn't as intense as some of the others here. But I don't think that it hurts any less.   

I just feel absolutely crushed and abandoned and in excruciating pain right now. A relationship ended and I know it happens to everyone now and again but with my bipolar disorder, it feels like it hurts so much deeper. I've already tried to cut myself today. I feel like I want to vomit and rip my head off.   

I don't want to die, and I won't die from a stupid thing such as a broken heart. But in this moment, I'm at an all time low. I've called the suicide hotline twice now. First person was much more helpful than the second. The second was a little patronizing. I've never called them before today. I just don't know what to do anymore. Everything. hurts.
