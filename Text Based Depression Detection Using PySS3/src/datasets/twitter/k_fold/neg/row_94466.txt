Prepared everythingI will do it tonight. Two nights ago I spent the night in the hospital because I tried to cut my wrists. I donâ€˜t have anyone. 
I have a few Xannys and pain killers left and I think it will be enough. I will drink a bottle of wine and take every pill I can find. Thank you so much for this community. You helped me so much, but I canâ€˜t do it anymore.
