Tired and scaredI am sick tired of everything. I am tired of spending every weekend alone, hoping that the next week will not be the same as the last one, but it never changes. I am tired of school. I am tired of being from another country. I am tired when I don't do anything productive whole day. I am tired of my parents and I am tired of my 'friends' that uses me to get something they want.

I am scared, scared that I will say something wrong when I speak another language. I am scared that my mom will find out that I am smoking. I am scared that I will end up alone, having no one to share my dreams with, having no one to speak before I go to bed.

The only thing that stops me from killing myself is my grandparents... When they die I don't see anything but black.
