I don't care anymoreBasically, the COVID-19 has reached my country and the area where I live. Everyone including my family is either annoyed or panicking. I don't care anymore. I'm not concerned. I was thinking if I ever get ill from it I'd either worsen my condition up and pass or wait until it gets worse and then overdose. Everyone would just assume I died from the virus. I am actually looking forward to get infected, isolate myself and just-  pass away, die, kill myself... anything...
I just feel like this is a good opportunity for it right now, few are aware of my suicidal nature but none would suspect it happened by my hand.
