Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but...I need to get this out somewhere and this seemed the most fitting place to do so.

I'm not sure if I could technically be called 'suicidal' because the way I feel about death is much more passive: on days that I want to die, I want to get hit by a car or killed by something or someone else, but I don't want to do it myself. But I really do want to die, like I feel like that's the only way it would solve my problems.

I can't really talk to anyone about this IRL because I either feel bad burdening my close friends/relatives or when I do decide to burden them I get the "stop whining so much" response because on the surface my life is going fairly well. (Good student, good internship, doing fairly well financially, good family, good relationship, etc.)

But I keep getting weighed down by other things. I'm not sure if I can describe it, but judging from some of the other posts on here, I'm sure some of you have an idea of what I mean--my brain starts going into all of these panicky thoughts and I feel like I'm never going to amount to anything so I should just die and get it over with. Stuff like that. 

I have a (physical) health issue (type 1 diabetes) that I've had since I was really young and it's just depressing having to take care of that and even more depressing knowing that it's never going to go away. I'll spare you the rant on exactly what's so depressing about it but the main points are (a) it's a lot of work, (b) it's a lot of work that none of my peers have to do, (c) everyone else seems to think that "hurr cake diabeetus" jokes are hilarious and I'm like okay that's my life you're making really wrong jokes about, and (d) it's expensive to pay for all of the medicine/supplies each month.

I'm seeing a counselor (through my school) and things have been going really well for the past couple of weeks but today this all came slamming back into me and now I just want to curl up into a ball and die rather than deal with everything that I'm anxious and stressed out about. I just feel like such a terrible person and I can't even say why, I just feel terrible. And then I hear things like "what could you possibly have to complain about" and read about terrible things happening in the world and feel even worse because it makes me feel like my entire life is firstworldproblems. So then I get guilt on top of my depression.

I guess what I'm looking for is advice. Does anyone have any coping skills that they can recommend? Nothing I already know of/do is helping me out and I hate feeling like I want to just die so that I don't have to deal with everything anymore.

tl;dr I hate my life and sometimes want to run into oncoming traffic and want advice.
