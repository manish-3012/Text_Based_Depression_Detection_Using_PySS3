Owning a gunThere's moments where I'm happy that I don't own a gun, I feel like I would have done it by now if I did. Tonight's not one of those nights, I really wish I had one even though I know I'd regret it. Sometimes it's too much and I don't know what else to do except picture pulling the trigger. But then there's good times where I'm happy to be alive. I definitely need professional help but I'm not motivated to do it, instead I'll keep everything bottled up like I've done for years. Sorry if this post isn't allowed or something, I just needed to get this out.
