I'm tired I can't anymore .Whoever reads this . I'm tired of everything . I'm trying my best at everything I do but no one seems to care , I find a job ? And after 1 day of testing and not wanting me ? My parents tell me that I'm useless and I'm just bored to work or find an another job .

I had a car accident . Nothing major . Just some car problems , I needed 200 euros . I asked for help from my parents and they don't even care to help me at all , telling me I suck and not trying hard enough . I feel alone . My parents always talked me down and I don't even remember hearing once "I'm proud of you"   


When I'm telling my friends my pain and what I'm going through . Their common answer is "Relax , everything is going to be fine" , I'm tired hearing that and nothing goes right . They go out and I feel forgotten , they don't call me , don't tell me and they have fun on their own . I feel shit for myself . No girl is getting interested in me . I try my hard to be a good guy , respectful toward someone , not cursing , being polite and gentlemen but no vail . I don't even remember when was the last time I felt wanted from a girl . My car was the best thing that happened to me . I had the most amazing memories with it . Now I see it dying outside my house just like me .   


I don't feel wanted by anyone anymore . My parents always talk me down , no girl is interested in me . I miss being loved , sexually and emotionally . I'm always there for anyone when they need someone ... but I'm always left alone when I need someone cause everyone has better things to do ...   


I don't want to live anymore . I wish I was never existed in the first place ... I hate my life ... I dont find joy in anything anymore . I just wonder everyday to nowhere . I'm tired , I just can't anymore .   


Whoever read this . Thanks for your time . I'm sorry if I wasted your time with someone's stupid emotional joy ride .
