I want to die before graduation.Long post warning.

Last night, my mom and I had a fight. We share a room, and I got really pissed at her (I hadn't had any alone time all day) since she was watching TV (I can't stand the sound of the TV--I have SPD). I was trying to find sound-blocking earbuds, but had no luck, so I was slamming drawers and doors and just acting like a two year old. Eventually, I resorted to grabbing the remote from my mom's bed.

I don't remember a few seconds after that, but I remember that my head hurt like hell and my mom was picking the remote and its batteries off the floor and yelling at me.

TLDR--fight with my mom.

She asked how I was supposed to live with a roommate in college if I couldn't share a room now. That hurt me a lot, because it's true.

She left the room, and I decided to take a bunch of acetaminophen pills to try and kill myself. I convinced myself to only take 4,000 mg (the daily limit), and, obviously, I woke up today. I also took about 20-30 mg of melatonin in a backup attempt.

Today I'm very woozy and dissociated.

TLDR--failed OD.

So, I plan to try to kill myself today after school. Or sometime before I graduate in May. I'm sick of myself and I'm never going to make it in college.
