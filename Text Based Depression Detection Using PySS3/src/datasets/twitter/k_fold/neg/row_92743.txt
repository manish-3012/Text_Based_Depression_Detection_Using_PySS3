I'm aching for the relief.I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to go on. My mind has downspiraled into the way too familiar depression and suicidality once again. Christmas has always been a hard time for me, or err, holidays in general. I'm currently ten hours away from the person I love, as he is celebrating with his family and taking care of his sick father (whom we have no clue how much time has left).

I feel so selfish, but this time, it's too much. It's way too much. My mind is aching, I can't bring myself to even pretend to be doing fine at this point. I've felt like I'm clutching my fingers to the edge of a cliff, that leads into the bottomless pit of the current state of my depression. I've been holding onto it so hard, I've been using all my last bit of strength.

And finally, I dropped. 

I don't want to make things any more complicated for my loved ones, but at the same time, I'm aching for relief. 

I'm sorry, oh so sorry.
