Almost a year and a half since last suicide attempt, but im thinking about ending it todayHi,

I tried to kill myself about a year and a half ago, I actually posted in this subreddit back then and the comments i got made me go back and try and live. I actually did and got a new job where ive been working for a little more over a year.

But tonight I am down.... so down without any reasons thinking I would be better off without the world and the world would be better off without me. Im not sure im gonna do it but I most likely will.

Anyway,

Wanted to just post something here. Thanks for the previous support from SuicideWatch. Dont worry I got letters prepared for my family.
