What techniques to folks have for dealing with persistent thoughts (without action) of self-harm?I just spent the weekend with a girl I'm dating - only to be cockblocked by my own anxiety. Any time I get sexually frustrated like this (this happens quite often) I feel like I want to chop off my dick. No joke. Any suggestions?
