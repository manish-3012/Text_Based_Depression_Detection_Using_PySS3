StupidI'm not that bright. I thought I could be, but I'm not. I thought I could keep up, but I can't. I wish I had the words. I wish I could fathom into an expression all the things I feel right now. I'm not that smart.
I probably sound stupid just typing this shit out.
I'm not that clever. I wish I could have made it through school like everyone else.
I can't keep up.
I wish I could have asked some decent questions at that seminar I felt so proud for attending. I couldn't.
I wish I could go to the museum with my friends and not be so lost as to what each of the abstract sculptures might mean. I used to have the words. I don't anymore.
What have I done to myself?
How did I become so stupid?
I'm going to cut tonight. I'm still good at that.
