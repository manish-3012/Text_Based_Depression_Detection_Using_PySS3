I really wish I had the courage to pull the triggerI have a gun, I have the right bullets... I've even went as far as writing a note and loading the gun and putting it in my mouth but I just can't pull the trigger. All my life I've been struggling because I can't stand hardship and challenges and now the same weakness is holding me back from escaping this nightmare..

wtf is wrong with me? I've been depressed all my life.. lately I've been in bed most of the day.. can't even take a shower. Alone; no friends, barely any family. But I'm still holding on to this crappy life. wasting my days away eating fast food, watching porn and just wasting wasting wasting my FUCKING time. Why can't I just pull the trigger and end it all?? should I get intoxicated to find the courage?
