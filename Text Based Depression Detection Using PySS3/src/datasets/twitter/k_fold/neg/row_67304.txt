I just donâ€™t know what to do (May trigger you donâ€™t have to read just venting)I want to live but I feel like suicide is my best answer. I know many people say that itâ€™s not but I just rather die. I feel like I deserve it too. Iâ€™m crappy, miserable person that no longer feels Iike I deserve living. There not much else too say about it. People say that killing yourself doesnâ€™t solve anything and thatâ€™s true but man I screwed up my so bad I donâ€™t know even how to fix it. I feel like itâ€™s too late. Iâ€™m 26 now have no real plan in life and slowly but surely Iâ€™m losing everything I work hard for and the only thing I can do is eat, go therapy, play video games and sleep. And Iâ€™m sleeping habits are mess up too and my eating habits are worst I only eat McDonaldâ€™s, Wendyâ€™s, Nachos and ice cream. And surprisingly Iâ€™m still losing weight too. I feel like Iâ€™m just rotting my life away and I hate it. I wished that there some kinda of miracle happen to my life right now but Iâ€™m slow not believing in those anymore. I feel like I need to take some kind of action in my life beside what I have been doing but the only thing I can thing of is suicide
