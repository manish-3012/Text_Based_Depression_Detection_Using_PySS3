Today.. i just felt what people mean that im dead inside...As for the story.. my gf was telling me so many nice things about her family thinking about me, and they werent that good with other men.. and that she really loves me, but all of this was a lie. Everything was a lie. Today at 1:30 am i understanded the meaning of feeling dead inside. My body just didnt want to respond to anything. I was in shock, my hearth just broke to a billion of pieces, its not that she did this to me. Its been like this my whole life. Im a 20 year old â€œmenâ€ and in my whole life i have been living in depression. I have tried to make everyone happy hoping i will be happy too. Thats a lie. I have tried to hang myself once, the only thing that stopped me was my family, i thought about them and i stopped, i had to hide the marks around my neck for daays. But right now im thinking why i didnt go for it. Everyday i just get hurt by them since no body supports me. Im thinking about killing myself soon, very soon. I cant hold it anymore. Too much pain, i dont even remember whats like being happy. Please somebody TALK TO ME.
