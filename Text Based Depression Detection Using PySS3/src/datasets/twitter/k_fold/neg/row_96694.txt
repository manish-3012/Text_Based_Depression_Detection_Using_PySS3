They never would have let me out the mental hospital if they knew how I really feel.A week ago I was released from a mental hospital.  It was my third time being forcibly sent to one in the last 3 months.  I am good at convincing the shrinks their that I am fine and it was just an accident.  I told them I was just bluffing when I texted my ex-fiance telling her that I was going to kill my self; I was not.  I was standing in the bathroom with a bottle of vodka and all of my med sitting on the counter.  She called the cops and they took me away in cuffs before anything happened.  She care enough to call the cops on me but not enough to even fucking talk to me or see me.  

I have a good stress-less job and a ton of understanding friends who would do anything for me yet I still want to die.  I just don't gain any pleasure from living.  I don't want help anymore.  I have been to groups and therapy and have enough pills to cover my whole bathroom counter yet I hate my life still.  I can't drive on the freeway without wanting to crash my car into an overpass at 80 mph.  The only way people in my life try to persuade me is by guilt tripping me and telling me that if i did kill myself they would all be so sad.  I will quote Kanye West by saying "People never get the flowers while they can still smell them".

**UPDATE:** So I talk to a good friend who I met in a mental hospital and has it a lot worse than me and she was very helpful.  I am no longer suicidal but I am not any better, i just don't want to kill myself right now.  Today I caught myself dreaming about being in a bad car crash or being shot by a stranger.  I would not mind dying but I don't think I should kill myself.  I feel like everything I do is to worry friends and family into caring about me but I always hate it when then do.
