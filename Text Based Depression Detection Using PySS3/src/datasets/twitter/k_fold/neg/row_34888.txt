I need advice. Nobody will/would take me seriously for being thirteen years of age.Hello. My name is Miya, I'm 13 and all of that dumb fucking bullshit. In short I just want to fucking die. I've been battling depression since I was eight years old for reasons I'd rather not get into (family, school etc.) this may sound like the cliche, edgy teen depression story, but I think it's more. I hate everyone around me, I constantly get bullied at school and I have constant, agonising thoughts of suicide. I just want to know the most painless and easy way to commit suicide or stop the pain. I've tried cutting and even therapy, yet, none of this has worked for me. I just want to die. Edit: I don't want a compendium of answers telling me to get help, I just want the pain to be taken away.
