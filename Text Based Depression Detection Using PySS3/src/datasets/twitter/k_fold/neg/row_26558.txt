K19 introverted, jobless, dropped out marine corps bootcamp 50 days in. No talent, no money, in mom's house, too lazy and shy to try to get a job, staring down barrel of my 20 gauge. I'v never had any friends, moved around a lot was never able to connect with anyone. For 4 weeks i literally have had no human contact other than my mother and going with her to the grocery store once or twice. I'm lonely, a loser, i'm unlvoe and unwanted, if i disappeared no one would care. all i ever wanted was to be loved or jus tknow someone cared for me. and pitty posts of love on reddit wont change that. ive been thinkin about it for a whie now, but my shotgun is chambered and ready to go, just waiting for the courage to finally do it. dont know why im posting here, maybe theres a shred of hope in me. if i do it, hope mom finds ths post and im sorry iknow it hurt u, its probably ery selfish but im miserable mom and i love u bye.
