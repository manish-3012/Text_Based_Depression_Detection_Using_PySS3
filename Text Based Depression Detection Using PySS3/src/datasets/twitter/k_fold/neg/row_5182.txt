I might try it againI have felt suicidal for as long as I can remember and a few months ago I actually swallowed all my pills in the middle of an argument with my mom. I told her right away and she took me to the hospital, it was so traumatic to a have a tube through my nose and into my stomach that I didn't think about doing it again for a few months. Until a few weeks ago. Now that's all I can think about every time something doesn't go right in my life, I want to die but at the same time I'm so scared of it and I want to live, I just don't want to live like this anymore.
