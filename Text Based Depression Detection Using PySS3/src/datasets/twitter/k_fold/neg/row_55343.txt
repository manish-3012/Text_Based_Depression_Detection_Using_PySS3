If I fail Iâ€™ll do itIâ€™ve wanted to die for quite some time now, but I think schoolâ€™s finally going to throw me over the edge. Iâ€™ve been nothing but an A-B student my whole life and Iâ€™m failing pretty bad in one class right now. My parents will probably yell at me for at least 45 min if I fail and honestly I already hate myself enough, I donâ€™t need to be told Iâ€™m a failure I already know. No need to worry about friends because I donâ€™t have any, haha. Only 1 week plus finals to find out how much longer I live, oh boy.
