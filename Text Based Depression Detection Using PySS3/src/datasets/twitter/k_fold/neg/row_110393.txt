I'm back againWell I've been feeling pretty bad again recently, a while back I made this post on SW: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jq6tp/what_can_i_do/ and I think it's still how I feel. Since then however I have seen my psychologist and she has told me to ask the school staff when I need to see her, but I don't really want to. I don't really want to do most things I like anymore, I have very little motivation. Sometimes when I'm walking home I think about how it would be just to walk out on the road and let a car hit me. A few weeks ago for a few nights I would just sit with my pen-knife open and think. It's got so bad that I don't really want to seek help IRL, if I could I would rot away in my room in the hope that life would eventually end. A majority of the people I am close to are also depressed and think about suicide too, I just don't get why we continue to live.
