Suicide note?I've been thinking of writing a suicide note for a while now in the case that one of my attempts actually works but I don't know how to fully articulate myself or what kind of things to include. Would love to have some suggestions about this and also do you guys know if my note could potentially work as a will? as don't really have the means to legally make one right now. 

Also would it be better to make it digitally or go for a more traditional paper note?
