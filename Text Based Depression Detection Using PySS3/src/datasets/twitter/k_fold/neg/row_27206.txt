Same old...So... got to that stage again, night time, alone... thinking, maybe overthinking, tiredness? I donâ€™t know. Always seems the same,y thoughts always come down to thinking the same thing, other than being found unconscious somewhere... has anyone ever had the experience where, u meet someone, u make a connection, and itâ€™s like everything falls into place. I kinda liken it to the movie Vanilla Sky if youâ€™ve ever seen it, not the whole movie but part of if. Where he meets a girl and itâ€™s like BOOM! Heâ€™s totally head over heals. Then something happens and they never see each other again.... but in his life or subconscious he thinks about her every day....
