I have a perfect life.I'm a middle/upper class teenage white girl living in one of the safest places in the US. I go to private school. I've never been seriously injured, bullied, or gotten bad grades. I don't have body confidence issues. My family is healthy, I have good friends. But that's all I am. I feel like there's not really a point to anything, to life, except my relationship with my boyfriend.
I've been in a "secret" relationship (over the internet and phone, webcam, etc) with my best friend, who I've never met, and he lives 6 hours away. My mom didn't approve of us and "broke us up" when we started out, but I knew he was perfect (He really is, to me. You hear it all the time but it's true. We are the epitome of a healthy relationship) so we continued in secret. The distance and the waiting is just grinding me down now. I feel like every day is a struggle, I just miss him and want to see him so much. I have school-related anxiety and I can't bear to not be with him constantly. I just feel like I want to die because of it. If anyone can help, please do.
