Iâ€™m still here but I donâ€™t know whyHey guys. I know Iâ€™m supposed to be dead but Iâ€™m still here. After I failed another suicide attempt I decided Iâ€™d wait until I could jump off the golden gate. In the time I have been waiting Iâ€™ve had moments of attempts at positivity only to relapse back into something worse. I am now here at the bottom of another pit made by my desperate attempts to get better. Philosophy, meds, talking to people, nothing worked. Now here I am. 2 days from my set date to die and I donâ€™t feel different than when I set the date. I know there is no argument over nihilism and even Camus couldnâ€™t convince me to live but I thought after all this time Iâ€™d find something. Anyway Iâ€™m waiting for the day again and this time there is no â€œfailed attemptsâ€. From a long time lurker, goodbye (in two days)
