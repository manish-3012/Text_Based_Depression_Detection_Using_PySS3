I didnâ€™t do itA little over two months ago, I posted here about how I was spiraling out of control and didnâ€™t see the point in living if I wasnâ€™t ever going to be mentally healthy. Iâ€™m not here to say that Iâ€™ve magically been cured and life is sunshine and rainbows, because that couldnâ€™t be further from the truth. A lot of days are still battles for me. But Iâ€™ve improved overall and Iâ€™m still here fighting for the life and future I want. Iâ€™ve found new perspectives and routines that have become therapeutic for me. Iâ€™ve had days that have been worse, and days that have been better, since the last time I posted here, but how you handle those ups and downs is everything. I donâ€™t have shit to say in the realm of advice giving, Iâ€™m just speaking to whatâ€™s worked for me. No matter where youâ€™re at in life, there are good days and bad days ahead and I like to think they balance each other out in the end. If you end it all when youâ€™re in the slump, you donâ€™t allow your days to balance out and thatâ€™s tragic. You deserve to feel kindness and love surrounding you when you go instead of being broken, lost, and alone. That day is coming, please donâ€™t bring it on prematurely. Stay in this battle with me, we still have more lemonade to squeeze out of lifeâ€™s lemon ðŸ’›
