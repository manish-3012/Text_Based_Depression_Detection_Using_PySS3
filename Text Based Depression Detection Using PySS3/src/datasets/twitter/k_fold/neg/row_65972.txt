Just a momentoThe other day I posted a topic saying that I was going to end it. Well I failed, ended up waking up at some point after I passed out and ended up bailing, turning off the lawnmower. Then I went inside, passed out, threw up all over my blanket then woke up 5 hours later. Washed my blanket and thought about my next attempt. Well this time I have refined my technique and I am doing it MUCH more sober and not plastered. Today is the last day that I will post on here. 

I have responded to a lot of posts on here reaching out to people to support them in their time of need. In return, reading their posts helped me through some rough times. In fact I had no karma points before I become terminally suicidal. Over the course of a few days I received 58 karma points from people thanking me from posts that I have made on their topics. I see that as 58 lives that I reached out and touched in their time of need.

There is no reaching out for me. I'm 28 and now this is the end of the line. I'm not reaching out for attention or anything like that. I have made up my mind my friends. 

I wish you all the best and I'll see you on the other side.
