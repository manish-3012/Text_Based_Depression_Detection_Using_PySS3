I feel lostI thought about posting something like this for quite some time now.

I have been thinking about killing myself for years. Most of the time those were more like idle thoughts,  unlikely I would act on them. But there are phases where I am close to the edge, especially the last few months and right now. I don't think anyone of my family or friends has the slightest idea about this. 

The main thing keeping me from actually killing myself is my family. I really like them and feel terrible at the thought of my parents, brothers and sisters having to mourn such a loss. Especially because I guess I'd be rather likely for them to blame themselves. 

So if I don't want to put this pain on my family, what's keeping me from seeking help?  I guess it's selfishness in a way. Anyone I'd talk to about this would be obliged to talk me out of it I guess. And I am currently not sure I'd want that. I want someone who will just listen. And at the same time I don't want to talk anyone about it. Because I don't think it's too unlikely I'd still go through with it. And of course I fear how horrible anyone I'd have talked to would feel then. 

Not sure what I'm aiming at with this post. Just kinda needed to write this out I guess. Any comments to help me clear up my thoughts would be appreciated. 

If any of the above sounds weird, that's either because my thoughts are a mess right now or because English isn't my first language.
