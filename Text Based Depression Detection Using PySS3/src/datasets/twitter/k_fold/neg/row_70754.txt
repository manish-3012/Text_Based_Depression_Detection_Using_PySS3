Guilty as ChargedWhy is it so hard for me to find joy these days. Why is it so hard for me to find hope these days.

Each passing moment is both dull and numb. The only feelings that I feel consistently these days are anxiety, anger, fear, misery, and most abundantly, hopelessness.

Itâ€™s hard to feel anything when youâ€™re standing in a room thatâ€™s pitch black.

As I wander around in the dark aimlessly, I lose hope that a light will turn on. Instead, I trip and fall, I tumble in the darkness. 

Each passing moment brings along with it more pain and more suffering. Tiny disasters piece together into a quilt of depression. 

When will this end
Can I just end it myself 

I used to think suicide was a selfish thing. I used to enrage at the idea that someone could think so little about the ones they loved.

I understand now.

A feeling I never thought I would feel from my depression was guilt. Itâ€™s interesting how much you want people to notice your suffering, but also how much guilt you feel when they feel your misery. I donâ€™t want the people I love to feel my sadness, but I really canâ€™t do anything about it. 

What do you do when you feel like youâ€™re hurting the ones around you by being uncontrollably depressed?
