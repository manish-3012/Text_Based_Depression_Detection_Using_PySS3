I CANT TAKE IT ANYMOREI just, cant take it anymore...
I have found a month ago that all my friends talk shit about me behind my back, I am super-shy and don't have the courage to meet new people. Every girl I every tried to hook up with( not many, just 3) has rejected me badly saying that I am super fat, even though I am 176 tall and 79 kg . After that, most of them proceeded to say shit to other kids at school about me, like I am an asshole, I was too direct and other pervert bullshit even though I didn't even try to do anything..Now nobody wants to hang around me at school and I cant talk to anyone about my problems. Furthermore, one of the girls I tried to go out, was the school therapist's daughter who is a feninist bitch and believes that all guys are assholes including me, because of some of her exes.When I went to her, and explained what has happened and requested help she told me that I was just another guy threw me out saying:"I wish you fucking die you piece of shit!!!" This has really hurt my self esteem, I wanted to become a computer scientist and create awesome video games as they are the only ones keeping me company. My parents always yell at me for not having friends but when I try to open up they mock me. I don't know what to do anymore... I think I will do it today or tommorow... I don't fucking know....shit...
