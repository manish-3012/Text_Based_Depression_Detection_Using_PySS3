I can't feel my humanity and I am completely dysfunctional. I'm biowaste. [VENT]Do not prioritize commenting on this post. I've attempted before, but I am very far from actually attempting again, probably further from it than from even before I had my semi-psychotic delusion.

Boy, am I happy that I'm not in that place anymore.

I'm just posting this because I had the first proper suicidal thoughts in months, and for reasons that I believe to be at least miles more rational than when I had falsely convinced myself of having done horrible acts and thus be deserving death and eternal torment.

Feelings of inhumanity at best - and of subhumanity most of the time -  has been pervasive ever since my earlier developmental years. I think that it may be because I back in my early adolescence had almost no social skills, even compared to the fellow kids. Therefore, I don't think I was able to reflect myself in others, and thus I couldn't develop a sense of "sameness" with the rest of humanity. And by humanity, I don't mean that I believe myself to be a wolf, or an alien - The latter maybe only existentially. I mean that I don't think that I deserve the status of being a dignified person with entitlements to a varying degree of rights, that i don't hold that "intrinsic human value" that humanism entails. This felt like a massive inferiority complex at first, but in my later years it's become the only thing that makes me something at all, existentially speaking. Because I think that I fear two ways of becoming existentially non-existent: If people criticize me as a person too much, directly of implicitly, my fragile and diffuse sense of myself as a human being will disappear. This is why I'm really paranoid, and view everybody as a threat, because I'm trying to protect the little of myself I have left from being "murdered". The second fear is commitment and assimilation, because if I become "just like the others", I will stop being a thing of my own and be eaten by a larger ontological unit. So I think that I actually externalized myself and fell into my own hell world from that fear of annihilation by consumption. And I have no willpower, because there is nobody home to dream enthusiastically of goals. Or that I just have ADHD and Schizotypal Disorder, who knows.

I can't work, by the way. I live in the country that arguably has the best healthcare and welfare systems in place, but even with all the free help I'm getting (therapy, almost free medication and special classes), It's not enough. I can't pay attention in class. Can't focus on doing my homework. I'm almost considering scrapping this post already, because I already lost my drive. Blergh. I've made a friend recently, we smoke joints on the occasional thursday. She's an anarcho-communist, and she makes the ideology very convincing. Especially since I've had latent interest in far left politics from before I met her. Wouldn't it be nice to have something to identify as? But I feel like I can't commit. First, I'm scared of leftists criticising me as a person. Second is the reason I'm scared of commitment I have mentioned before. And last, I feel like a person as unproductive as me really shouldn't be allowed to have any political influence, even if even the teeniest bit. I would still be as unproductive as I am now in an anarchist society as I am in a capitalist one.

It just feels as if I'm unfit for life in general.  


Writing this felt good. Time to light another cigarette and then run out of money for the rest of the months thereafter my extreme nicotine addiction will cause me to beg strangers for cigarettes to the point of extreme self-degradation and humiliation.

But I do feel better after writing this, I really do.

If anybody is interested, I'm a 19 year old male btw.
