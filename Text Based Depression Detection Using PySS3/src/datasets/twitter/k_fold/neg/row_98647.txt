Reddit is the only thing that keeps me goingIm not a good man. Ive been a terrible man. Im just uncovering a life of being abused and then realizing ive lied, cheated and stolen my whole life. 

I have a list of mental health issues and just got diagnosed with a few personality disorders and since then....chaos.

I no longer care for my partner or my dog, whose been my bestfriend ive ever had. None of it feels like it was real.

Reddit and consistant posting is the only thing i can do to stay alive. Its seeking attention and connection outside if my fake life. I can barely exist, i dont deserve happiness this is my punishment.
