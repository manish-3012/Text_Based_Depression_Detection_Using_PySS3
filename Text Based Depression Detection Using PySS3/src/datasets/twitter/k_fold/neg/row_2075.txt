worried that I am going to get to a place where living gets to be too muchI am dealing with postpartum depression. anxiety and lots of physical pain. I totaled my car 2 weeks ago and have now been "blacklisted" at my doctor's office as a "pill seeker". 

I have been crying like crazy over the humiliation I felt when they told me my account was "locked" and that I had had "enough" painkillers. I can't take ibuprofen or any NSAIDS so I had been taking primarily hydrocodone since the accident. 

I really wish I had not made it to the other side of the accident and had died then. I feel like my existence is negative in every sense of the word.
