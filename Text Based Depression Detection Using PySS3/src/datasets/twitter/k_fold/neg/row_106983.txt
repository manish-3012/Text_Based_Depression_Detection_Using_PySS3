Iâ€™ve completely lost my sense of selfDoes anyone else feel like a nonentity, like you donâ€™t really want to die but you werenâ€™t ever meant to be born into the world in the first place?

Itâ€™s like nothing in the world feels real to me, like I could reach out and touch something and I wouldnâ€™t be surprised to find out it wasnâ€™t really there, and itâ€™s made me feel like maybe Iâ€™m the one thatâ€™s not real and my life and actions canâ€™t effect anything around me

Is this normal with depression and is there anything I can do about it?
