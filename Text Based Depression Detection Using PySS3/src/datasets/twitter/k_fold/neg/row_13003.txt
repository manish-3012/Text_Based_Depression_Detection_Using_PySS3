My world isn't realI really feel like this is my time, posting here as a last cry for help, if thats even possible.  I am really smart, know everything my highschool is teaching me already. Just cant focus enough to actually do any of it. So im failing everything except band, which i love. I have no friends despite trying hard to make them ( I am a girl and am almost anorexicly skinny, but I would call myself attractive enough for a friend), and when I try to talk to my parents they are always too busy to talk to me (usually wathing tv or my mom on her laptop all day, doesnt even have a job) and my reality has become video games. It is my only retreat from my terrible life,my only place i have friends (which my mom calls fake friends) and I know people have it worse, buy I cannot stand how my life has become the way it is. If i have to rely on my fake world then Id rather not live at all. I will slit my wrists tonight after I get back home. I've read a lot on here and realised otjer people seem so similar
