No escapeLife is getting too overwhelming and itâ€™s hard to cope. I feel like I have no escape.  
School is stressing me out to the point of breaking down in the bathroom stalls. When I get home, Iâ€™m too tired to do anything but sleep. 
My mom bullies me about never being as good as my brother. He goes along with it cause heâ€™s so desparate for her acceptance. Iâ€™m never good enough at anything and I should always be more like my brother. She doesnâ€™t care about me. She tells me Iâ€™m sick, that normal people donâ€™t act like this.
My friends think Iâ€™m fine cause I donâ€™t want to be a burden to anyone and Iâ€™m too afraid of being left alone.
Is there any reason not to give up?
