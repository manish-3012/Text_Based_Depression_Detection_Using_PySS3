depressed, suicidal and alone at university, feel like i cant go to a counsellor because my problems are too heavyMy depression goes beyond just feeling down to the point where i think of death 24/7, not just killing myself but just death in general, 4 people i knew well died in the past 6 months so that may have triggered it off, and i also think i have PTSD (witnessed drug abuse from my parents all my life and one specific event where my step father beat my mother almost to death in front of me when i was 15, i never thought it would affect me but looking back that seems to be something that could have triggered off how i feel now) i feel 'suicidal' but at the same time anxious about my health, i constantly think im going to die from an underlying heart condition just because my cousin did, its getting ot the point where i just cannot function. My boyfriend and I broke up last month, it was a pretty emotionally abusive, toxic relationship where he turned out to be a serious narcissist and the mask fell off in the end, he was aggressive, nasty and manipulative, i think that has triggered of PTSD (if i have it) but anyway ive come back to university after the christmas term, i have never ever ever felt so low in my life, im constantly miserable but i dont want to bring up to anyone how im feeling because im constantly down anyway so i just feel like they dontwant to hear it, plus no one understands and gives me advice that often ends up making me feel worse tbh, i really dont want advice like "join gym, go for walks, eat healthy" i do all these things, i try and force myself to do everything in the name of 'self-care' but it is just not working.  When i am alone i feel surrounded by the thoughts in my head, when i go out with friends or to parties i feel alone, and then i feel overly anxious because i know im that antisocial weirdo or whatever who doesnt speak to nobody but i really want to make conversation and make friends but i literally feel like i cant engage in small talk anymore not when the concept of death is on your mind 24/7. I really want to go to the university counsellor today before i do something stupid, but im just scared all my problems are way too heavy like do i menntion about the fact i think i may have PTSD and the events that happened to me when i was young because if eel like that could be a key indicator of why i feel like i do now, ive never spoke to a counsellor or anyone before, multiple times i got offered counselling when i was a teen which i refused because i thought i was strong and could handle all the shit that life threw at me, boy was i wrong
