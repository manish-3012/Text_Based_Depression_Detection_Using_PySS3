I'm tired and scared and want to end it allI don't know where to go. I gave up on my meds because I wasn't eating, my therapy is going nowhere, my parents tell me to grow up, my friends don't understand or really care. I'm tired and scared and I want to end it all. I spent the last few hours searching for ways and I feel ready. I tried playing with friends and having fun and venting but nothing is working and I'm lost and scared and I don't know what to do, it's almost midnight and I have a final in eight hours so I can't seek other help
