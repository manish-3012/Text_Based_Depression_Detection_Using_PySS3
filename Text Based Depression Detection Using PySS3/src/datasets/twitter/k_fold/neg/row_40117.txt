Does getting committed save people longterm?My wife is planning to kill herself in a few days - after mother's day, once our 4yo son has finished and given her his gift. 

She's suffering from an illness that's affected her appearance, and she believes that it'll be permanent, and she doesn't want to live 'like a freak'. It's been eating at her for a couple of months now, and she's passed the breaking point, she doesn't care any more, she won't talk about it, won't listen to reason, she just wants it to end - and her grim determination is the only thing that's quieted the daily hours of hysterical tears. 

Thing is, when she was in hospital a month or so ago, she got taken into a psych ward for observation - they treated her like a criminal, kept her in degrading conditions, subjected her to deeply traumatic interviews, then sent her off with a pamphlet and a pat on the head. 

She got no help, and was subjected to hideous trauma. 

I can't let her die, I have to do *something* to save her. But will betraying her confidence, and getting her dragged off (there is *no way* she'd go voluntarily) actually do any lasting good in a case like this? I don't know if clinical depression is part of the picture or not. Her feelings of despair seem greatly magnified, but whether that's chemical in nature, I just don't know. 

Will I just end up hurting her even worse, only to lose her as soon as she gets out anyway?
