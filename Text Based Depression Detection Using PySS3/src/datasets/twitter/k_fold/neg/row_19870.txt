Iâ€™m going to kill myself after writing thisI donâ€™t want help. I donâ€™t want to talk to anyone. I just want to die. I canâ€™t see a future ahead of me where Iâ€™m happy. In my life, Iâ€™ve had good experiences, but nothing can overwrite the pain I feel in my heart every day. Going to class makes me want to stab myself. Talking to people, knowing that they all hate me, makes me sick. I just want to stop being miserable.

I know life isnâ€™t easy, but it shouldnâ€™t be painful to get out of bed in the morning knowing that Iâ€™m all alone. And if it is supposed to be painful, then thatâ€™s all the more reason why I donâ€™t want to be on this planet anymore.

Thank you for reading this. I just wanted to get this out to someone before going. Who knows? Maybe Iâ€™m trying to procrastinate before I drink this cup in front of me. Either way, have a nice day, and Iâ€™ll see you all on the other side.
