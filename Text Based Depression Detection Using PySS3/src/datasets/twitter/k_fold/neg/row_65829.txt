Accepted the fact that this is how it ends.Every solution I can come up with results in me dying and everything else getting better from then onward. Im failing at everything in life and cant see any kind of solution, everything requires me being even more of a burden to everyone around me. For once I feel comfortable that I will be ending it soon.

I cant do anything because of my depression and anxiety and if I did get help I would be getting help while being even more of a burden on everyone and have no chance of actually having a life.
