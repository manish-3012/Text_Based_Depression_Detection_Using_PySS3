I thought i was getting betterThis week is just the icing on the cake. I'm having major issues with my job, the holidays made me realize that everyone really is happy without me, and my boyfriend who's been the closest thing to my best friend just broke up with me. I have nobody in real life to turn to. I have no real friends, no best friends. No family. I really am completely alone despite having friends on the internet. 
I'm currently trying not to relapse because I've been clean since October, but it's gonna be so fucking hard after today. 
I really am trying to get away from suicidal thoughts. I was actually trying to plan out a possible future. And now most of these plans are going down the drain. 
I hope anyone else going through the same thing reads this and knows that they aren't the only ones going through stuff like this.
