This night canâ€™t get any fucking worseMy friend texted me earlier because she saw my cuts on my arm, and basically found out about my self harm because she wasnâ€™t believing my excuses. Because of this I cut my upper arm making sure my sleeve on my school uniform covered it this time. Less than 5 mins ago, I was helping my dad with dinner and was wearing my towel over my shoulder (over my pjs obvi) and I am wearing a singlet top, I usually put on a jumper after my shower after Iâ€™ve towel dried my hair (and before dinner cause I hate my body even more when I eat). The towel fell off one of my shoulders and was just hanging over the other one, and my dad saw my fresh cuts, he didnâ€™t believe that i accidentally cut myself so I just said I scratched myself with my nails, he didnâ€™t believe that either so Iâ€™m now hiding in my room. I just want to die, my friends and family finding out about this less than an hour apart. I fucking hate myself, I shouldâ€™ve been more careful, but when I cut my lower arms they donâ€™t usually notice, I got too comfortable. Fuck I hate myself, I wish I had the guts to kill myself right now.
