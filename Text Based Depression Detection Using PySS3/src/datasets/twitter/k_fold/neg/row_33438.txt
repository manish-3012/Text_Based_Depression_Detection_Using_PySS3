Worried about my daughterI was snoozing in my lazy boy last night and my son had a couple friends over. I overheard my 12 year old daughter talking about if she could get a tattoo it would be a semicolon.  I'm familiar with the meaning,  I've attempted suicide many times (I can never finish anything). 

Now I'm probably the worst father in the world and her and I don't talk much, but I love her so much and I am concerned for her. (I'm ugly crying as I type this) does anyone have any advice to approach her so she doesn't just shut down or get mad? I've hidden my attempts and I'm worried she is hiding hers.


I don't even know what to say,  I've given up but she is so young I don't want her to give up before she has experienced life.  


Please help me talk to her!
