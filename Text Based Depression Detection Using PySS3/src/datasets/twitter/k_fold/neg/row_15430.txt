My dad almost killed himself. What do I do?My dad had been depressed for about 8 years now. Ever since him and my mom divorced his financial stability has steadily decreased through his alcoholism and terrible decisions which has lead him from owning a huge house to barely being able to pay the rent for a 2 bedroom house where he canâ€™t even fucking afford to have me and my siblings there.

He had a girlfriend for a short while but not long after she found out he was an alcoholic she left him, leaving him even more sad.

Every time I would be with him drunk heâ€™d go on and on about how much he loves me and my siblings and how he wishes how he could do better for us. I talked to him many times and always let me know that I loved him too, but that never pushed to him to get help.

Two days ago he called me drunk out of his mind crying hysterically about how much a failure and weak father he is. I tried talking to him for a while but it did nothing.

Then today he called me in the same state but this time he said he was â€œdoneâ€. My heart dropped and I started screaming at him to stop and what not. Our conversation went on until he stopped talking and put down the phone. I really thought it was the end for him, but I still called the police and gave them all the info they needed.

Luckily they got to him and he didnâ€™t do anything harmful to himself. They took him from his house and apparently heâ€™s getting â€œhelpâ€ now. I wish this would make me hopeful, but it doesnâ€™t. My dad has lost everything. Heâ€˜s stuck at a shit low paying job, lost his girlfriend, can barely afford rent, or to even see his own fucking children. Even if he SOMEHOW managed to quit drinking I have no idea how heâ€™d manage to find happiness.

Seeing him like this kills me and I just want him to be happy and satisfied with his life. But I have no idea how he could achieve that. Itâ€™s not like heâ€™s a teenager like me with his whole life ahead of him. Heâ€™s almost 60 and his kids are all he had left. What do I fucking do?
