Help meAnyone, please. I don't know what to do anymore. I cry everyday. I'm alone, I have no friends aside from one... he only ever hits me up to ask for something. Every since I quit smoking weed he barely bothers to reach out. My family all moved away, they barely talk to me, they don't even care.
I have no one. I'm so alone. I just want to be happy. Not successful. I don't need friends, I don't need my family to love me. I just want to be happy. I just want to know what it feels like. I want to enjoy watching a show again, to truly enjoy a game, a book, a movie. 
I want to love someone who loves me. 
But I can't, I don't have any of that. I don't feeling like I'm falling apart. I feel like I'm broken.
I don't want sympathy. I just want help.
