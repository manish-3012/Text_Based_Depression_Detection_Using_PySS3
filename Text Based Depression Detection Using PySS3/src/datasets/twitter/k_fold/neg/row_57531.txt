Iâ€™m not gonna do it. But Iâ€™m suicidal again.This is not the first time. This has been happening on and off since I was 13 (am now 25). But it wasnâ€™t supposed to happen again. I moved out of my parents house, which had been a big source of stress for me. I was supposed to be okay now.

But I find myself sleeping til 12 and still not wanting to get up. I find myself crying. I find myself thinking of suicide. Itâ€™s just ideation - Iâ€™m not gonna do it. 

But this is all fucking with my schooling. I finally got well enough to go to college and now I feel like THIS again. I donâ€™t want to flunk everything. I also donâ€™t want to do my homework. 

My roommates help. Theyâ€™re great. But I still feel very alone. I donâ€™t want to tell my parents how I feel - because theyâ€™ll make me go back home and that would not be good for my mental health. 

I think I need to go back in for a ketamine infusion but god is that ever expensive.
