Too ashamed to write a noteMy life, as well as myself, are so pathetic that I can't write a note.

Maybe there's no need to write a note when very few people care enough about you to want to know how you feel. I've never been popular, and part of the reason why is because of my fucking mental disability. I came from a broken home with very little to my name, and even if I wanted to, I couldn't enjoy my life on my own terms because I'm mentally defective and wouldn't be able to.

I'm afraid this is the only option. I can't bear another minute living on this shitpile. There's no reason to keep living if you can't enjoy your life properly. This shit is tiresome, and after twenty-three years, I have no desire to live to see the remaining few decades.
