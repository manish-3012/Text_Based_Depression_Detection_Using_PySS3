Honestly my health anxiety gets so bad sometimes, that honestly I feel like giving up on even trying to be scared of my death.Sometimes, at random, I just feel so done with life? Like so much has happened to me, and while sometimes during the day I feel like "oh don't complain, just smile and be as happy as you can" or "just keep trying to stay motivated, work hard, one day you'll find happiness" and I try to believe it, I try to believe I'll make it out of this.

Then my health anxiety goes really awful, sometimes I'm not even scared of dying I just accept it, sometimes I feel like my self hatred is so strong, I'm just too fucked up for fixing at this point. Sometimes I genuinely don't know what's stopping me from saying fuck off to the stress, fuck off to the tears, fuck the whole planet and everything and especially myself.

I'll feel better in the morning, I'll continue fighting in the morning, I don't believe I'll ever stop but oh boy. Why is it always around like 3-4 am giving up feels so tempting? 

I swear, I want happiness so fucking badly, I want to get rid of my PTSD and OCD and whatever the fuck else might be wrong with me. Idk I hope I can do it.
