Any happy survivors out here?Hey all!

I must admit I'm not a member of this sub normally.  But I'm looking to write an encouring blog post that can convince people not to commit suicide.

One thing I learned from not committing suicide  is that no matter how dark it seemed, all the things that have happened in my life since then are so amazing that if I had known they would happen at that moment, I never would've even doubted that I wanted to stay alive.  My best friend did kill himself, and often when I have a great day I think about how much he would've liked it if he was still here.

I would love to compile the stories of as many people as possible who attempted suicide at one point, survived, and went on to live happy lives.  I'm specifically looking for people who want to list all the cool stuff they would've missed had they done it (doesn't have to be big impressive stuff, if you enjoy the little things, talk about the little things).  But free-flowing stories or personal advice from yourself to another person contemplating suicide is good as well.

If anyone here has a story like that and would like to help me with this, feel free to comment here (where it can already help people) or PM me.

I really hope this can make a difference in some way!
