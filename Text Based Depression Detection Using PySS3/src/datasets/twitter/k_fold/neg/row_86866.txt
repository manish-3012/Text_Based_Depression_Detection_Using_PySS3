I dont know what to doI'm still quite young (teens) and I just wanted to end it for more than 2 years. No one takes me seriously - asked my parents for help got grounded for months with no phone or PC- asked school counsellor was blatantly ignored and sent out after 2 minutes once I didnt have self-harm scars or suicidal thoughts in that moment. I just cant deal with it. I'll end it soon probably.
