Everything is fineThere isn't anything particularly wrong. Sure, I'm in debt, have a job that I'm not fully satisfied with, and have money troubles, but other than that, everything is just fine. 

I have a loving wife with no children (can't get pregnant), A loving family, and good friends. I just don't particularly want to live anymore. I don't particularly want to die either, but when I get to 51% in preference of no longer living, I'll just end it. 

I'm on antidepressants and self medicate fro time to time with whiskey and weed, but that's not very often. 

I don't know why I'm writing this. I don't expect anything to happen. I'm not going to have an epiphany and suddenly feel any different.

I may just disappear for a while before I choose to no longer live. It seems almost euphoric to have an expiration date.
