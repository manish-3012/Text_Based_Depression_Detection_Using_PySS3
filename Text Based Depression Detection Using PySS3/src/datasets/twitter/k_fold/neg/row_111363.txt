My suicide will be the greatest revenge I could ever accomplish.Itâ€™s a shame I keep putting it off. 

I already know I plan to die from carbon monoxide poisoning.

I know what to buy and I have just enough money left on my credit card to have it all shipped whenever Iâ€™m ready.

Iâ€™ll find somewhere remote and set up a tent there. 

My body wonâ€™t be found for days, maybe even weeks. Who knows.

But I wonâ€™t leave a note, I wonâ€™t say goodbye.

Iâ€™ll leave this world on my own terms.

If anyone gave a shit I wouldnâ€™t be here in the first place.

Iâ€™ve done therapy, Iâ€™ve done drugs, Iâ€™ve done CBT, Iâ€™ve done mediation.

Nothing fucking works.

So yes Reddit Iâ€™m going to be *selfish* and end my fucking life.

And itâ€™ll be the greatest revenge I could take on a world that brought me so much fucking pain.

I wonâ€™t be anyoneâ€™s doormat or punching bag any longer.

No one will ever hurt me again.

Iâ€™m lucky that I have no dependents and itâ€™ll take ages for anyone to realize Iâ€™m gone.

I refuse to give a proper goodbye.

This is what happens when thereâ€™s no way out.

This is the best solution to my problems.

Youâ€™ll never change my mind.
