Itâ€™s finally happeningI think Iâ€™ve settled on Wednesday night, I know the amount of effort it would take to fix myself would be astronomical. I canâ€™t do it, I can barely go to work anymore and the thought of Wednesday being so close makes me feel like everything can finally end.

I just donâ€™t know what to say to the people whoâ€™ve been trying to talk me out of it for the past few days. The might not know the exact details, but itâ€™s clear they care. 

Does anyone have advice for a suicide note?
