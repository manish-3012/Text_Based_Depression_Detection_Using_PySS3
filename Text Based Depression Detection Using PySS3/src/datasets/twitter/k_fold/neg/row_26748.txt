I wish more than anything i could go back in time and do things rightBut I can't. I look back, and, i think how I couldve done so much better. I just sit here and I cry and I cut myself and i think of how I have no one to talk to, noone to even ask "hey, can u just give me a hug?", and I think how I'd be happy right now if only I'd done literally anything different. Eth, if you're out there, if you even care, I'm sorry I couldn't hang on long enough. I'm done.
