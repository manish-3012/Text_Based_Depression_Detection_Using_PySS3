Today was the first time I nearly hurt myself a lot.Today I sat down, realised all my problems in this stupid life and started to have a breakdown. I have type one diabetes, which means I take insulin to survive. Too much insulin can be very dangerous though. I sat with my ''insulin-giver'' and just wanted to give myself an overdose of insulin and just see if it was enough to drop my bloodsugar low enough, to ultimately die or lose consciousness. But I hesitated, but only because my brother came home.

I've never felt so down before. I've never wanted to just leave so much.
