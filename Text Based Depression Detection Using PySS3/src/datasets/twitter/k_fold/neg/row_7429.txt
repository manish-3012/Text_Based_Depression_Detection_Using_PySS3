saying that â€˜people would be sad if you leftâ€™ is another level of selfishI donâ€™t see any point with this anymore. The people around me who care want me to get into recovery and all that, but also the fact that they would be â€˜sadâ€™ if i left. 

Recovery is all about focusing on yourself, yet the only reason why iâ€™m somewhat motivated for recovery is that other people wouldnâ€™t want me to leave. 

Iâ€™ve been told many times that suicide is the selfish way out, yet 99.9%of the time, they havenâ€™t experienced my past history of sexual abuse and trauma and all the sexual harassment i receive. 

They donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like, yet they want me to live through my shitty life for their sake, when in actual fact, they would all pretty much forget in a year. Itâ€˜s so manipulative and donâ€™t understand why people look straight through it. 

For those of you who sort by new, sorry about the rant
