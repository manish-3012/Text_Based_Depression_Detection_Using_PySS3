I wrote a song about suicide (definitely triggering) but i was hoping someone could find comfort in itSuicide note #3 

A song sings out to me 
Bringing back ugly feelings 
I still feel that way don't i? 
Feeling worthless and wanting to cry 

I don't have much to offer 
I don't feel much pleasure 
The dreams i once had 
I only feel apathetic towards

My worth to others continues 
To softly softly fade away 
I don't want to start anew... 
If I'll always end up alone 

I curse both today 
And all the days leading to today 
And all the todays leading to tommorow
The games end of sorrow 

I don't always feel that way, 
I've tried fighting to hold away 
Such ugly impulses, 
Just another promise to break,

"I'm really okay" laughing away
The words are tangled in my throat 
Throwing them up someday 
But this is my mine alone

I never owned this life
This body, or this strife 
I don't care much for it
It'll all end too won't it? 

My worth to others continues 
To softly softly fade away 
I don't want to start anew... 
If I'll always end up alone 

I curse both today 
And all the days leading to today 
And all the todays leading to tommorow
The games end of sorrow 

I don't always feel that way, 
I've tried fighting to hold away 
Such ugly impulses, 
Just another promise to break,

You'll forgive me, won't you?
Or at least forget me, won't you? 
It was all meant to end, wasn't it? 
This bond between us also to break 

Sometimes i want to cry out again 
But its already to late to stop the end 
I apologize for the inconvenience 
But it seems better for everyone 

My worth to others continues 
To softly softly fade away 
I don't want to start anew... 
If I'll always end up alone 

I curse both today 
And all the days leading to today 
And all the todays leading to tommorow
The games end of sorrow 

I don't always feel that way, 
I've tried fighting to hold away 
Such ugly impulses, 
Just another promise to break
