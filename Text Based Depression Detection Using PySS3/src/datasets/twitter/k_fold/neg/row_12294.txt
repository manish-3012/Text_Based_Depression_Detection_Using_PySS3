Question - Has anyone else struggled with wanting to 'check out' for decades (38m)?22 years after my first diagnosis of major depression, and only recently (prior two months) has it become completely debilitating. It feels like the normalcy I thought I felt as a high-functioning major depressive maybe never was. I'm panicking almost non-stop about fixing everything that's wrong. The pain comes in waves and at seemingly random intervals. This time around it's a flood of disaster, the details of which are too long and uninteresting to mention here. A happy ending in life is no guarantee after all, eh?

Today I'll pick a date, pick a method, and write a note. My legal and financial affairs are in order.  
If nothing else, I'll then stop unfairly burdening the one and only person who still believes in me. I know it's painfully hard for her to see me this way and she deserves better after all the awful things that life has done to her. I just hope she'll remember our good times and continue to always be the amazing person that the world knows her to be. She'll shine brighter without me.
