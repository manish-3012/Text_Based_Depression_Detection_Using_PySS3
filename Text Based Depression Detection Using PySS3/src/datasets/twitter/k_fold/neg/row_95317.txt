I think tomorrow will be itI think tomorrow will be the day I kill myself.  I have lived long enough disabled and I cannot tolerate life anymore. So tomorrow when the opportunity arises I will end this life. there is nothing left for me, I had never thought about death, but now I wish for it everyday. all I do is fill the time in between now and my death. All that makes me excited is no longer available to me. 

What is the  point of living where all I do is work to afford to be in my quadriplegic condition? 

I wish it didn't have to come to this, I wish I could just go to sleep and not wake up.

I wish that tomorrow I won't wake up. I wish that somebody would break into my home and shoot me. I wish a car would lose control and run me over on my way to work. I wish I were dead.
