I appreciate but also find it selfish when my friend tells me "things will get better"I've been suicidal for years now and the only thing keeping me alive is the thought of my mom being all alone and my dog spending all of his days waiting for me to come back. 

I've heard this a lot when I tell my friend "It gets better over time" I know she means well and just wants me to be happy but it doesn't really help. It just makes me feel guilty that I want all of this to stop. Are you really thinking about me and what I'm going through or are you just thinking about yourself and the grief you'll go through of losing a friend? Don't get me wrong though. I appreciate it still, knowing she cares for me and that somehow I'll somehow feel better over time. Even though I feel like shit nearly 24/7 I still have a bit of hope as well. I hope it comes soon
