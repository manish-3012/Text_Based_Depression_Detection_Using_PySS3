Just want some positivity if I mayWas originally nervous to post this because I don't wanna be judged, I honestly don't know if this belongs here, I don't think I deserve attention like the other people here, I'm just at the point where I think about it constantly and see it as a way out, just looking to talk to another human. 
Trying to put a long story short, I realized my gender identity at around 9 and I'm now 15, I told my parents in January of 2020 that I was a trans female, in hopes of things improving, my parents said they supported me but never brought it up again. I know I need to talk to them but I'm so nervous and fearful of it. The farthest I've got with my tendencies is staring at my pistol just willing myself. Is it normal to think of suicide to solve this or am I really just too weak to even talk to my own parents?

I apologize if I wasted anyone's time with this, I know this is for at risk people and not, me, I'll be fine if it needs to be removed.
