Tonight was supposed to be the nightHello all, I'm posting this  because I'm at the end of my rope. Since Jan/Feb I have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. I've had these plenty of times before, for the past 8 years I've had passing thoughts about suicide and some minor gestures but it's never been this bad. I've been self harming since I was 13, and now I'm 20 and I've relapsed recently after 2 years clean. I have thought I've hit rock bottom before but I was wrong. This is rock bottom. 

While I haven't had any intention of following through with my suicidal thoughts recently, I found out about a week ago that I'd be left home alone for the night tonight and since then I've been constantly thinking about how and when I'll kill myself.

I'm exhausted with existing. I can't do it anymore. Now I'm just on the fence with all of the power in my hands but waiting on that last kick to use it. I see a counselor and a doctor and I've mentioned to both of them that I've been feeling suicidal for the past few weeks but they haven't really said anything other than "Hang in there". What the fuck am I supposed to to with that? 

I don't really know what the purpose of this post is. I'm just done and I desperately need to reach out somehow or I'm going to lose it. I've thought about calling hotlines, but I'm terrified of phone calls so this was the only other thing I could think of.
