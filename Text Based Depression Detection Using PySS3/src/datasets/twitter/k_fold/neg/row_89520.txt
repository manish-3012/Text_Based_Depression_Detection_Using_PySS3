I just want it to be overI was so dedicated to having a relationship with just a girl that like that also likes me. I had been talking to this girl for several years and I finally built the courage to ask her if she wanted to spend more time together and she said no. What am I supposed to do. I have tried exercising working on myself as a person. But I fee uncomfortable in my own skin. Almost like I donâ€™t know myself and I could not know anyone else. Please help I just want someone to get old with but Iâ€™m aging by myself and I fear Iâ€™m a slave to fate.
