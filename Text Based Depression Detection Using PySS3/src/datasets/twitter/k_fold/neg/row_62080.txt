I'm done. I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was around 13, and I tried to kill myself when I was 19... I'm 22 now and I'm on medication for bipolar disorder and I have felt somewhat alright for the last year or so, but it's all gone now. The only person I've had to talk to the last couple of years is my boyfriend, and I'm increasingly feeling like he doesn't care anymore (if he ever did). I tried to talk to him tonight but he totally blew me off, and he knows I've been feeling really bad lately.

Today I fought with my mom about how she doesn't think I have any mental illness-- I just like to take the medication for attention. I'm not even sure what that means, but she doesn't get it. My dad is the same way, he always is like "I was depressed once too, blah blah, I got over it". It's not at all helpful. 

I'm supposed to graduate from college with a bachelor's in psychology in the spring, but my grades weren't good enough to get into grad school from the beginning so I'd have to try next year, and there's no guarantee that I would get in then either. Everyone is very disappointed in me I think.

I'm only making this post because I want someone to know what is going on with me. I'm not going to leave a note because I don't think I would be able to without being mean to people. I know how I'm gonna do it, and I'm trying to wait until after Christmas so I don't ruin Christmas. It almost feels good to know that it is coming, and then I'll just be gone.
