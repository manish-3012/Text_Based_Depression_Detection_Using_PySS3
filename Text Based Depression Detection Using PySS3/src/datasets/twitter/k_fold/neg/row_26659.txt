I want a solution to this pain no bullshit excuseIâ€™m a 12 year old boy and I want a permanent solution to the pain every one has caused me. Every one has abandoned me and say I deserve to die everyday for no reason or at least I donâ€™t remember at all I know I have fucked up a few times but they werenâ€™t so serious to be treated like this honestly sometimes I feel like meant to commit suicide like how others are meant to do something great or something else. I know I have it easier than most but it still hurts it hurts so much. I have a few friends they donâ€™t know Iâ€™m suicidal they just know Iâ€™m annoying the only reason Iâ€™m annoying is because Iâ€™m trying to cover up the fact that I am suicidal. Sometimes I think they know and are only here with me is because they pity me and that fucking sucks. My mom my dad and my brother would probably be so heartbroken if i killed myself but I still want to die I know I canâ€™t go to a hospital because itâ€™ll be hell im so scared please help me.
