I have lost everything. Someone give me a story of hope.I have suffered 3 years of agoraphobia and panic attacks and impending doom. I can't find anyone to relate to anymore. How can I get to the other side and see the light at the end of the tunnel? My mind has gone mad. My circumstances can change, but my brain isn't cooperating. I don't want to die.
