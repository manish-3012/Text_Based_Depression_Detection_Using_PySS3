trying to get help.whenever I post on here I try to stay positive and not focus on how bad I feel. but ill provide a little bit of info to paint a picture. I've had suicidal thoughts for a year and depression for a little while before that. the thoughts have gone from thinking about how i would like to die, to actually wanting to leave and developing when and how ill do it in my head. My friends noticed I've been down and said i could talk to them about it. 

I just cant see it getting better anytime soon, and I want to talk about it to them but I cant seem to see how that will help. It wont change how I feel. And If I were to talk to them I obviously couldn't say every detail cause it might backfire and I wouldn't be able leave. 

People that can offer any input on this I would be grateful. How can telling friends help if deep inside you do really want to leave? what can they do really?
