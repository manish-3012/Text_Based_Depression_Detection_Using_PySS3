Suicide Attempt ?Today I put a bag over my head and tied it with plastic zip ties, just before passing out I chickened out, ripped the bag open and laid there for 5 minutes catching my breath. 

Iâ€™ve being dealing with depression for 6-7 years and suicidal ideation/ thoughts for 4-5 years, starting to get addicted to self harming, and today I did this and I donâ€™t know how to put it into words when talking to ordinary people who freak out when you mention the first paragraph.

I want to talk to my therapist about it but I donâ€™t know how to really and where itâ€™s even considered an attempt I feel that calling it that makes me a fraud. 

I will be calling GP soon for other reason, should I possibly mention it too? Or wait for therapist first and then next time talking to GP if I can bring it up ?

Thank you for any comments.
