Severe Depression 5+ YearsI am sad to say that suicide has been a thought on my mind for so long... I really contemplated doing it for years now, but it isnt without reason!

I just want to disappear forever... If I didnt believe in hell and heaven, I wouldnt even be here to write this, I wouldve been in my grave!

Im a dumbfuck with no personality that needs to go away fast, and when I say fast... I mean right now!
