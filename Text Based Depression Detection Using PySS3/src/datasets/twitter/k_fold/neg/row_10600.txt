It almost feels worse that I donâ€™t have a *reason* to feel suicidalIâ€™m in college, I work, I have friends, family, and a girlfriend. There should be no reason I want to die but Jesus Christ itâ€™s all I can think about sometimes. 

I obsess over my past and I know itâ€™s just my brain doing it to me but I feel like a fucking terrible person and waste and a drain on the people around me.

The fact that thereâ€™s no external cause for this feeling makes me feel so much more helpless. 

I went a long time thinking everyone went through periods where they think about killing themselves 24/7. One time a close friend confided in me after the death of someone we knew that for the first time in his life he thought about â€œwhat it would be like without me [the friend] around.â€ And then it hit me that it isnâ€™t normal to think this way all the fucking time. 

Ugh, I just wish I would be happy and not want to be dead
