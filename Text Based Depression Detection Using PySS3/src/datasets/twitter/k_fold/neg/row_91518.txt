just giving upive been in bed all day, missed school. im 15. i have aspergers, i dont see the point in trying anymore. i can never explain my emotions or feelings, nobody understands me when i try to explain something. i know slitting wrists is easy to mess up but i feel so much pain inside i just want it to be over, if it doesnt work ill just hang myself or slowly suffocate myself. i just feel so hopeless. i have nothing to be here for. not even my family. my pets. music. nothing. i have ONE FRIEND. ive been dealing with this for 3 years. it wont stop. im never happy. i dont see the point in school. i cant recognize myself in the mirror, i never have anything good to say about myself, my friends coming over today, but i feel bad cause i forgot and now ive probably ruined it. i just want to be gone, i want to end my life. im tired of being overworked, all this stress is going to make me go insane. ive tried therapy, counselling but im always back to feeling like absolute shit. i guess this is all i have to say. im just so fucking done.
