i feel so many expectationsi feel so much pressure to be so many things and if i fail any of them i get made fun of instead of supported. i feel like i couldnâ€™t even kill myself because people would just see me as weak. i donâ€™t want people to think i want to kill myself because i am only saying it as a threat. i feel like i have no real support and i am just expected to deal with it.
