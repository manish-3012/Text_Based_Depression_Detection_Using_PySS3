Ok here's the planIm going to kill myself if I am unable to get higher than a minimum wage job by age 19. The chances are not looking good. Im pretty shit at school, which basically translates to im a lazy retard, and so im barely even going to graduate let alone get a job. No college is going to take me and the people around me are already being accepted, they have everything under control and I am fucking everything up. I dont know what im going to do and its too late to fix school shit, so the best i can hope for is too get a job that will support me somehow but i doubt thats going to happen. Deciding to do this has actually made me happier, because i know when it will all end.
