I don't know what to doSo i plan on killing myself soon.
I've always had a plan to go study and live in japan, that was my dream, i finished school and planned on going to uni in japan, mostly to get away from the yelling in my house and all that mental stuff that i can't deal with, so i worked.
Mum would always verbally abuse me, since i was little and then she wanted me to sign a house with her, which would use the money im saving for japan and would completely fuck my chance of leaving to japan, so i ran away to live with my dad.
Living with dad was a little bit easier, but still getting in trouble for things that i didn't know i was doing wrong, i would always think that i needed to be careful or else, if i get kicked out, i would have nowhere to go and i wouldnt be able to take that so i would then die.
I've got a job in the new area with my dad now as well but i never seem to be good enough so i stress about getting fired, i always try my best but it seems like it isn't enough.
I have to pay bills for living with dad, so its slow to save and i always manage to lose what i save by paying these bills and at this rate i don't think i can make it to japan, thats the only thing keeping me going so moral of the story is soon i might get kicked out and lose my job, i don't have enough money, plus i don't have the mental or physical strength to keep trying so I plan on dying in the forest nearby soon.

I'm just too exhausted and tired to even try anymore
