i canâ€™t go onthe only thing that stops me from killing myself right now or soon is the fact that i am in debt and i donâ€™t want my family to have to pay for it when iâ€™m gone. i hide behind drugs and itâ€™s not working anymore. been doing therapy for almost ten years and i keep on making the same mistakes over and over again. it is absurdly easy to buy the perfect chemicals in my country to die without pain... I just keep thinking of how much pain it will bring upon my family, but i also think itâ€™s the kind of death that will bring light into it. i think it will make them find peace within themselves and with each other. i think i also have lived enough. i have loved and been loved. i have done my best and life is too much. itâ€™s been too much for a while. 

english is not my native tongue so sorry for any syntactic mistakes or else. 
for now i will go to bed, after taking a double dosis of seroquel just to numb the mind rush...
