Only here because I'm expected to bePretty sure I'm not the only one here â€“ but it sucks big time to feel that you're only here, right now, alive, because you're expected to be. The last thing I want to do is hurt the ones left behind, but there's nothing more freeing than tapping out of a fight you've been losing for too long. There is no bigger fear than picturing the devastation left behind, not even the idea of the final act. Selfishness, it seems, is a virtue in this case. It's getting hopelessly tiring, this never-ending struggle.
