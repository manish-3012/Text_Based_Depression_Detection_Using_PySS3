My ex girlfriend has told me twice now that she is considering suicide. What can I do?I don't know if it's relevant - perhaps it is - but my ex girlfriend and I are still in love with one another. We decided months ago to end things because we are both of the opinion that we cannot be together due to our lives and goals being incompatible. She is leaving tomorrow to live on a farm somewhere to learn about sustainable farming. Tonight, she told me that she has been considering suicide pretty regularly, but assured me that she made a deal with herself to give this thing a chance before following through. 

This is not the first time this has come up. 

When we were together, she was often distant. She comes from a background of an abusive father and sexual abuse (not from her father, but of course, as is often the case, nobody in her family believed her) and she is currently bulemic. She is an incredible woman who is reasonable, considerate, and caring, but she believes she is basically trash. She insists that she is a horrible person, and that she doesn't care about anything anymore. She also shows all the signs of alcoholism. 

I don't know what to do. I finally got her to confide a few things in me tonight, and I tried to reassure her, as I have in the past, that she is not the horrible person she thinks she is, and I've pointed out that the passion I have heard in her voice when she talks about sustainable farming and human interaction is strong. 

I also told her that I loved her and that I believed her to be a better human being than almost everyone we know (which I truly believe) but she still insisted that I am wrong. I am at my wit's end, and she leaves tomorrow. I love this woman and I feel as though I cannot help her. Please advise me, because I have never really been in this situation before.
