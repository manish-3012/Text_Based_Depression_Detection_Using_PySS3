I just want to make it through tonight. Today would have been three years I was with her...

My girlfriend cheated on me and then left me and I haven't done so hot. It's almost been a year since I've been diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia and I just want to make it through tonight.

I don't know. 

I just want to get better but I feel so dead inside and today reminds me that I don't have anything else to live for...

Edit: Thanks for the comments. I've decided to look at pictures of cats until my brother gets here. I don't know about tomorrow but I think I will look at tonight. 
Edit 2: Hey people, thanks for commenting, reading allowed me to focus myself on trying not to give up. I really appreciate it.
