Probably going to go soon.I can't handle this anymore, I've got non stop chronic health problems that won't go away. I've got 50 cents in my paypal account and bills up to my forehead because I cannot work anymore, I am so pissed I will not be able to work because everyone my age is already well established. I'm going to be homeless shortly and I don't know what to do. So really, why am I trying? The universe hates me so why not do it a favor and end it for me?
