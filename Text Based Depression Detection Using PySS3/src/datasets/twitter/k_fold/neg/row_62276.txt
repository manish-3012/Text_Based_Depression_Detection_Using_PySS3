Sitting at work reading posts.So Im sitting at work, reading some of these posts.. they make me feel so many things. Sadness, numbness, sick but at the same time, people feel what I feel.. and I hate knowing other people feel that way and wish I could change that. I have always been scolded by friends for being too nice to people.. want to know why? Its because I never want people to feel what we feel.. you never know what someone is going through, and that moment of you being nice to someone can change a persons mind on ending their life.

I hide my depression, or at least try. My family and good friends know I have it. But they dont know how bad it gets and can be (besides my immediate family). I dont talk about it, I cant, words dont come out of my mouth.  I hate feeling this pain. Its suffocating. It hurts. People who try to help dont understand unless they go through something similar. 

Every single day I think about death. Every. Single. Day. I have never attempted suicide completely, but scenes have crossed my mind. Almost like visions. I want help, but help doesnt even help. Medications dont work for me, therapy doesnt. I feel so fucked up. I feel so defeated. Im lazy, Im tired, I dont have energy or care about anything. Its exhausting. 

I just am here to vent. As many others are. And for those of you who truly feel like you would like to end your life soon, I understand to an extent how you feel (in my own way) and I would love to be there to talk to you. I love helping others, and maybe we can help each other. It may be a bit hypocritical, but I dont really consider it that bc I dont think I could ever truly go through with the final punch. 

Just remember, people do care even if you dont think they do.. sometimes the monsters in our head just want you to feel otherwise. I try to constantly tell myself tomorrow is a new day and maybe something positive will come about.
