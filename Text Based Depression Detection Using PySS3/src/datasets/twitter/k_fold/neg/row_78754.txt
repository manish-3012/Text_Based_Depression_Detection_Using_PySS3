I just don't want to do this anymore.I feel like such a failure that I can't even come up with anything to say that would appropriately convey my feelings. I just don't want to be here. I don't even anticipate that I would even enjoy life if my MI were cured because I'm misanthropic and dislike society as a whole and the ways we are all forced into the same life path or face poverty and homelessness. The only thing that has kept me hanging on all these years is fear of devastating my family, and I'm not sure that is enough anymore. I am ashamed of everything that I am, and  I don't think I can dig my way out of it this time. I never chose to exist in the first place so it feels so unfair to continue. Maybe I will soon muster up the courage to do what I feel such a strong pull towards every single day.
