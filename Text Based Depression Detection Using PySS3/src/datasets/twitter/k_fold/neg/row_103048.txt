The love of my life will never be with meI know this sounds very childish at first but ever since my crush got a bf life has been torture.
She is the one person who always manages to make me smile,has my type of humour,great personality..
But before I managed to get myself to confess some jackass just flew in and got to be her bf out of nowhere and the way I found out she had a bf before confessing is another story, but nonetheless they are together for a year now and recently moved in together, and every day I hope they break up so I can take his spot but seems as theyâ€™re just getting closer and closer and this sucks I only have hope in a girl like her and I really think the world is just against me and wonâ€™t ever let me be with her. Iâ€™m 18 sheâ€™s 20 for context.
