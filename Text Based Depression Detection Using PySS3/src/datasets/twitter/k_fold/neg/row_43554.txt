Acts and thoughts are not my own. How do you go on when youâ€™ve hurt the people you love most?Hey 
Thanks for reading. 

Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for about 15 years. Iâ€™ve recently been unable to stop myself drinking and smoking weed very excessively. 

I found myself chatting to women online despite having the most amazing girlfriend who I wanted to marry. She found out and itâ€™s over. I didnâ€™t want anyone else, but I kept getting shitfaced and doing it.

Now Iâ€™m laying here in her house, sheâ€™s the best friend I have. Even now. Thatâ€™s how good of a person she is.

I canâ€™t bare with the disappoint,met and heartache Iâ€™ve caused to her and others. I know Iâ€™m utter scum, and fuck very thing up despite so much love, support and encouragement.

Iâ€™ve left a trail of shit over 33 years. Anyone felt the same? Iâ€™d go and pipe th exhaust into the car now but donâ€™t want her to have to find me on her farm and I donâ€™t even have a car here. Any suggestions? Iâ€™ve wanted to die for as long as I can remember. Beer and weed help, treatment hasnâ€™t. I ate a bunch of SSRI and Shri but they arenâ€™t helping ,y head and it takes tons to kill.

Rant over.
