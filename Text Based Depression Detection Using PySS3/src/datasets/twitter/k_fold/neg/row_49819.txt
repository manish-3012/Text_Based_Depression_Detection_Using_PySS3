Letter to someoneI have been very depressed lately really feel like shit, as if my head ahas inside a bucket every second of my life, with short spontaneous breaks from my solitude when im with my girl, i really don understand it, i used to be happy now every single day i think FUCK! Is it really going to last forever ?, is this really what im doing here?
i canrÂ¡t handle no more pressure i really feel so alone even when im with the people i love i become quickly rabid, paranoid, unsure, it feels like every turn has a thousand turns more and i can't seem to find a single thing that makes this idea to get out of my mind, as a kid i was abused by my fucking cousin, people say you shouldn't hold on to anger, well i guess anger hatched and gel into my persona, im restless tired afraid and i can't even make a couple tears to roll down my face to stop feeling this shit knot in my chest.
I don't know where im going with this it is only reassuring me that iÂ´ve tried almost everything and i guess i just wanted someone who could listen to me for once in a while, Thanks redditrs .
