I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t have anything to live for and canâ€™t keep carrying this painI constantly feel so alone and I just donâ€™t know what to do about it. I hate who I am as a person and I hate being constantly depressed and sad. I hate my neuroticism but I donâ€™t know how to get past it. I donâ€™t know how to build relationships and have friends which really kills me because Iâ€™m extroverted.

Iâ€™m sick of myself, Iâ€™m sick of who I am and it feels like I canâ€™t change my circumstances considering the context. Iâ€™m trapped with my family as a carer and I just donâ€™t know how to make my way out of this. I feel miserable and I feel like Iâ€™m missing out on the best years of my life but I canâ€™t abandon the people Iâ€™m caring for and donâ€™t have any options to outsource the care.

I just donâ€™t want to wake up and I want to preemptively get ahead of things before the people I have left inevitably abandon me.

It sounds so pathetic but Iâ€™m so jealous of people who arenâ€™t miserable who have friends and a support system. I wish I was better than this but Iâ€™m not. I want to get through things so badly but I just feel so stuck.
