I need help. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m losing hope.I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. One day I had got really into it, if you know what I mean, and accidentally ordered an adult toy (starts with a d). I hated myself for it. I didnâ€™t mean too and totally regretted it. Once it had arrived, I looked at it and was disgusted in myself. I had requested a return so that I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with it but the company said no and that they would just refund me. I was glad to get my money back but it still meant I had to deal with the damn thing. I just got home from school and had dinner. My mom told me about 20 minutes after we were done eating that she had seen what I had in my closet. I knew what she was talking about. We had a long conversation and I told her on how I mistakenly ordered it and wanted to return it but they said no. There was no yelling involved just tears. She said that she believed me but I still feel like she doesnâ€™t and she thinks Iâ€™m gay. I donâ€™t know why I was so stupid to order it. I didnâ€™t even want it in the first place. We went to talking about that to how I believe that Iâ€™m stupid, and ugly. She told me to not think of that and that I wasnâ€™t stupid or ugly. Again lots of tears. I canâ€™t stop thinking about it though. The feeling she may have had finding it. She told me she got sad when she saw it. I want to throw up now. Iâ€™ve been trying to get my mind off the topic since it was hours ago but I still canâ€™t. I feel like I disappointed her by my stupidity. I donâ€™t know what to do. I had never thought of suicide but now Iâ€™m thinking of it more than ever. I donâ€™t have to feel like this anymore. I donâ€™t have to deal with how much of a disappointment I am. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever been as sad as I am now. Iâ€™m crying writing this and I feel like the world is better off with me dead. Please I need help. Iâ€™m losing hope faster than ever ðŸ˜­
