i just want to live to inspire others to livei'm an 18 year old transgender male and my only goal in life is to inspire other lgbt+ youth on the internet or around me to hold on and fight against discrimination. the only reason i'm holding onto life in this transphobic household and society till i can live as i want and come out is that i don't want people like me to feel the same things as i do, as if there's no one understanding them and there's no one that can help them. i want to join the community of openly lgbt+ people that i myself look up to right now. i want to be a reason that the community is growing. my only will to live right now is so that my story can encourage someone in the future but i'm not sure how long the hope to help lgbt+ grow will keep me alive.
