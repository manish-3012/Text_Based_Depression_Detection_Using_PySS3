Should I just kill myself because I know that my life is just going to end up shit? Iâ€™m 18 and I got not future or social skills... Itâ€™s never going to get better!Iâ€™m such a loser, I have not real close friends who care about me... I donâ€™t have the skills or courage to make friends or relationships out of School either. Iâ€™m failing school, Iâ€™m such a uselessness failure... I wonâ€™t be able to get into university and I donâ€™t know what I want to do with my life. I feel so hopeless and my anxiety is so high. Idk Iâ€™m honestly considering jumping off a bridge or in front of a car or something. Thereâ€™s no point for me to suffer anymore... I have no social life and I have no future, Iâ€™m not meant to be happy. Idk Iâ€™m just so honestly close to doing something, I just donâ€™t know anymore! Why do I exist!
