Just want it to stop.Iâ€™m pretty sure my husband hates me, once my kids are older they probably will too. Iâ€™m too much of a bitch to end it but I wish someone would do it for me. I just feel nothing, and im struggling to get up and do anything. Iâ€™m supposed to go watch my son sing at his school assembly today but I just donâ€™t want to be around anyone but heâ€™s only 5 and I donâ€™t want to let him down by not going. I promised him I would.
