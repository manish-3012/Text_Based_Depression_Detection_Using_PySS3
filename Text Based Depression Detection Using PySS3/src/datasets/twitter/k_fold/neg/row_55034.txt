I wish for this to all endHey,


My name is J, and I've had depression since I was eight. I've been in the psych ward 4 times. 90% of meds tried on me harmed me physically and mentally. I'm 18. My parents have tried but since I'm 18 I'm expected to be independent now. I can't hold down a job due to my crippling anxiety and deep depression. The abuse from my past left me with PTSD, and people throwing religion at me doesn't work. I'm at the end. I have friends but who cares when you are in that much pain to leave them behind. 

I'm grateful for what you do, I just need someone to talk to who won't throw a book or pills at me. I feel very alone.
