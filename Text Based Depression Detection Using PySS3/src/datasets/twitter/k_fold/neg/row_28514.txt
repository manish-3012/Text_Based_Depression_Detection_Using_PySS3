I might leave soon.My family told me they are ready to let me go if it means my suffering will end. I have no friends, therapy and medication won't work, insurance is out for mental hospital stays. Today I realized I am still horribly in love with my abusive co-dependent ex-girlfriend. We haven't contacted each other in 8 months. My biggest regret is never seeing her in person (it was an online relationship.) I plan on using the last of my money to visit her, get closure by giving her a letter, then commit suicide. My will is done, my assets and financial accounts settled, funeral expenses accounted for. I am not strong enough to continue living in pain this unbearable.
