want to die for stupid reasonsi guess this first reason isn't stupid, but i grew up in an emotionally abusive and manipulative house &amp; now I'm all kinds of fucked up. 
next is living with the fact i emotionally abused an ex around a year ago (we were 15, I was so fucking immature and should have known better). i feel truly like i have matured and changed but no one wants to be near me because they know me as an abuser. 
plus that girl still feels like shit &amp; she hates me so fucking much she told me to kill myself. i deserve it. i have no friends and no girlfriend i feel so alone.
i can't even put into words how much pain i feel, and have been feeling for YEARS. I know I'm only 16 so i might sound like I'm trying to be edgy but i truly lost all hope in life. 
I'm so ungrateful I could be sick or homeless what the fuck is. wrong. with me .
