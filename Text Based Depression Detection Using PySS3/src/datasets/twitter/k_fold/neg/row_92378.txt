Perfectly happy but I wish I don't wake up every nightMy manager called today, said the internship they offered me in my interview a year ago was a lie to get me to work there and I need the interview to graduate. The only thing keeping me alive is my girlfriend, teammates and fraternity brothers but my family wants to take me away from all of it. Why should I not swallow every pill in my apartment rn.
