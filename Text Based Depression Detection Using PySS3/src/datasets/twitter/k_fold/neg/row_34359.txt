Trigger Happy CopI actively start thinking of ways to die without actually doing it myself. The famous, walking into traffic always comes to mind but it started getting a bit more morbidly creative. I won't go into too much detail about all the things I think on a daily basis,  but here's one. Having a fake gun and walking into a police department with it. It dialling 911 asking for the police, lying and saying there's an active shooter, only for a suicidal maniac with a fake gun to be found on the scene, of course they don't know this and they aren't trained to deal with things like this, they only thing they know is to be trigger happy. That's all I need. Is a trigger happy cop to do my bidding.
