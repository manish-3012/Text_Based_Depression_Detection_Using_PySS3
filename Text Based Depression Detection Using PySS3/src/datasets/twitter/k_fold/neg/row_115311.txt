Suicide is my only option at this point.So she lives in a different country, known her for 2 and a half years. Super close for the first two, talking everyday, even quite recently she talked about meeting up and said she loves me ect.

So I finally decide to tell her. It's something I've never spoken about and found it very hard, so I spend about two hours on it, and I was thinking about it non stop for an entire day so she's not busy. Finally get it off my chest and finally trust someone enough to tell. And she responds with "wow your story is crazy interesting, legit"
 I said "interesting....um, okay?"

And then she ghosted me. Reason behind losing my social life, developing mental health issues, becoming a loser, and suicide attempts. And she says "wow that's crazy interesting" and ghosts me.

If I didn't have a good enough reason to kill myself already I certainly do now. Two years thinking about what would happen if I told her and if I would feel better, and what she might say. Couldn't say it in therapy. That was honestly my last chance to try and start moving on or feeling better. I have nobody else and invested two and a half years into only her, and she's the only person I've trusted enough.

Is there a shittier thing you could possibly do to someone..? Seriously? And I'll still message her until I finally do it. Obviously at this point I have no dignity left at all. 

I really can't believe that was the response....it seems to bad to be real. Can't even relax at home because my dad wants me to kill myself and I have so many health issues from neglect I'll probably die soon anyway.

If she can be that bad then there's nobody who's real. Not for someone like me anyway. I'll be taking the biggest dose I've ever had tonight and see what happens if and when I wake up.
