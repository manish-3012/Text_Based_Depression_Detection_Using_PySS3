Ever have a spontaneous rush where you think you could do it...Iâ€™ve been depressed and having suicidal thoughts for awhile. I came home from studying today, went to my bedroom and say my SO sleeping and felt like the shittiest person in the world. He loves me so much and I canâ€™t return that, and worse is that we are so invested in our future together that I would fuck up his life so much more than mine if we broke up. But I know we arenâ€™t supposed to be together. 

The whole entire situation is fucking with my head so much that it makes studying for medical school harder than it should. Today, I was thinking about it while studying and I got a question wrong and a friend bluntly told me that I was â€œgonna kill someoneâ€. When I got home from studying and seeing my SO, I grabbed a bottle of whiskey and have since been drinking it on the balcony. For a brief second, I looked down at the ground a few stories beneath me, and thought about jumping. It was for a millisecond, but still.... I hate this feeling, like Iâ€™m trapped and either way ruining someoneâ€™s life as well as my own. I feel like a shitty person 24/7
