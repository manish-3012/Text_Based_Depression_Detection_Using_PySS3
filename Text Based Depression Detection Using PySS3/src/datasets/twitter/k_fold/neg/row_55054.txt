"What do I have to live for"A member of my family told me "you have a lot to live for." I asked them what they thought I had to live for. The reply I got was a blank stare because they couldn't come up with anything, and then finally "your future."

I've been living in hopes of a better future my entire life. I've been unable to make any kind of meaningful connections with people, not from lack of trying. When I was around 10 years old I tried to hang myself, it didn't work but I ended up with giant bruise around my neck. Guess what? No one in my family or at school even asked me what it was from. At 26 I have exactly zero friends. 

Now I end up with an incurable disease because of some asshole who took advantage of me whilst drunk. It's fucking disgusting. No one wanted me before, now there's no hope they will now. 

I'm tired of living for a better future. My life just ends up getting worse and worse. I swear I can't recall a single happy memory. I pray over and over again every night "please don't make me wake up." Then when I do I can't stop myself from crying because I've got to exist for another day.

I don't want a future anymore, I just want an end. It's gotta be soon.
