I hate myself, I'll never be able to fit in or make friends, I just wanna not do this anymoreEvery time I try to talk to people or make friends it goes horribly wrong, I dont think theres even a point in trying anymore when I have no choice but to be the loner mute, for the past 4 years I've ate lunch in the teachers office, sat alone in the field for recess and not talked to any of my classmates. Every time I tried talking people didnt want to talk to me, every time I open my mouth I annoy people so why should I try if me trying is bothersome to other people, I should just kill myself so I dont bother any more people
