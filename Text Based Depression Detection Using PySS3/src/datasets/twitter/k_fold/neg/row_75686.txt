Got very close to attempting to ODI'm done. I'm so very done. I've been having random shit go wrong with my health and my doctors really, really don't give a shit. "Wait for it to pass" they say even though I've already waited months and my mystery back pain returns. "Do you really need an appointment for it so soon?" yes because I don't want my 2nd bout of tonsillitis to develop to the point of my eyes also getting infected like last time and my neck was very visibly swollen on one side. My neck is in fact still swollen, but the tonsillitis has gone, and I'm now concerned I've got a thyroid issue due to pretty sudden severe weight gain and other similar symptoms. Am I gonna bother getting a blood test? Fuck no, I wont even be able to get a fucking appointment t to discuss my symptoms.

I want to die and my body is finally trying to fulfill it. 

I took a couple of painkillers at work a few days ago because of my stupid back, and I just couldn't stop thinking about just casually sitting in the break room and swallowing every remaining paracetamol that remained in the packet. I was fairly close to doing it. I don't know why, but I didn't do it.
