I swear to God.I can't stop thinking about how we're all just atoms and my leg is always hurting and I can only see the bad in everything and anything that requires a modicum of effort seems pointless and everyone's got these opinions but none of it fucking matters and I swear I really don't understand why living is better than being dead these days.
