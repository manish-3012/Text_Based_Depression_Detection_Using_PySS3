why try anymore?no matter how much i try to be happy. i try to be active and easy going. i try to be successful. no matter what the fuck i do i mess things up for everyone. my gf my family my friends and even me. i fucking hate this shit of a life. i thought i was able to see a light but i guess it was a fake its gone now as i will be later there is no fucking point in being here were nothing you can do is done right. just as i thought things were getting better it drops dramaticly down a hole. why should i care if ppl dont care if i try. ppl only give a damn if its done successfuly. no one cares about the work that is put in it. i  put so much work in trying to live but nope not a single soul cares. so fucking good bye... for the past 7 yrs i tried thinking i was just being a lil over dramatic but now i see that noone cares if i am or not even if just one person did it wouldnt matter it used to before but not anymore nothing is gonna rid me of these thought i felt the pain for too fucking long just so ppl ignore it.... ive harm to many by my thoughts so might as welll get it over with
