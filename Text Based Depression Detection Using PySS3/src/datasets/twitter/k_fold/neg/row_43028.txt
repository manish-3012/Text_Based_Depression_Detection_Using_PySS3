Ruined by my own expectationsLittle background: I've been having trouble with depression and anxiety since I was 15 (am 18 now, soon to be 19) and even though I've had some help from therapy it seemed like that didn't help at all. I can't still chat with my folks about it unless I am really drunk.

I actually feel like I've been fucking myself over because of what I except from other people and I, the more I think about ending my life within a few years the more I am sure that's right decision. I am far away from my family and the girl that I think it's the one, shit like that end up stacking up and making me feel hopeless which from my pov is not smth bad, at least I am aware of how this will end.

And since I've lost hope, I don't see any way I can outlive my suicidal expectations (which are that I am either kill myself this year or after my parents die). I can't see to find hope to live on my future profession or anything on that matter. 

On this current day, I am surviving due to an enormous amount of cigarettes and alcohol abuse and I don't know if I am going to be able to make it, my greatest enemy is myself


TLDR; I've lost all hope because of my own expectations on myself and other people (mainly), I am waiting for my parents to pass away so I can kill myself without giving them pain.
