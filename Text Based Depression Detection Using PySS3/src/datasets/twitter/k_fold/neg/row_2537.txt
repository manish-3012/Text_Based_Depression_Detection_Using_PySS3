Iâ€™ve been doing homework for 4 hours straightIâ€™ve finished it all, but at what cost? My self-worth, happiness, sense of accomplishment, sanity? I canâ€™t take this anymore. Everyday I wonder how Iâ€™ve convinced myself to live another day. I canâ€™t be asked to deal with depression and stay up long hours like a workaholic. I just wish I could die young. I just wish God could infect me with some terminal illness. Iâ€™m ready to die, I want to die. Iâ€™m ready for death to take me, but it seems unfortunately that it doesnâ€™t want to reveal itself.
