I'm a worthless POS that needs to die.Yep, totally worthless. I have no work ethic period, I am essentially Walking Laziness, nobody loves me (and for good reason), and I can't love anybody.

I'm not happy. Yes, I do enjoy doing some things temporarily, like video games and porn (that's about it) but apart from that, I'm totally miserable.

All I think about is death, and dying. What it would feel like. I have a theory:

I know consciousness exists firsthand. Therefore, I'll wake up in the far future where we have learned how to resurrect consciousnesses, and when it had gotten so cheap that I get it used on me.

But even then, nothing, that would be nice. Better than knowing I'm totally useless. Better than knowing I'll never be happy.
