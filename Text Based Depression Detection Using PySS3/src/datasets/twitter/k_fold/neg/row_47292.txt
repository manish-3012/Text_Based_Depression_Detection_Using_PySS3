Wanting to kill myself, but too afraid to commit to itHonestly, I'm not entirely sure when I started having these thoughts, but they've been around for a while. Ever since Senior year of high school though is probably when they've started escalating to where I am now. Joined the Army because I didn't bother preparing for college in any way. Got pushed into an MOS I really don't want, but I'm still in training for at least the next 6 months so I can't put in for a reclass. The girl I loved in high school left during Basic, "Dear John" letter. Fucked up and got really drunk the a couple weeks back, so now I have a UCMJ violation coming my way. My whole company either hates me or treats me like the joke of the barracks, and I don't want to burden the ones that I feel like I can actually talk to. I know that I just have to hold out for a few more months and I'll be out of here, but that's easier said than done sometimes. And on top of that, I'm too much of a wuss to just bite the bullet and take it into my own hands. Im not looking to talk or for anyone to try to understand. I just needed to get this off my chest.
