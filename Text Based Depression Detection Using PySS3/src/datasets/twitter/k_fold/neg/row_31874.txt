Passive ideation. C-PTSD. Just so overwhelmed.Iâ€™m so overwhelmed and scared at the thought of starting over. I left a decade long emotionally abusive relationship that started when I was 17. Iâ€™m terrified I wonâ€™t like my new life. I started dating someone new and he pretended to be perfect and then he dropped me so quickly, it was so incredibly triggering.

I quit my job before I left my ex because it was so toxic too. Just quit all the awful things.

I just donâ€™t know what to do with all of this sadness and anger. Like I donâ€™t know where to put it. I feel so alone and like a failure. 

Iâ€™ve been in therapy and working through trauma stuff but I just hate how I feel so much. I canâ€™t imagine starting a new job and feeling this way. I lost so many friends because of the breakup. Itâ€™s just so much. Iâ€™m so, so fucking hurt.

And I keep thinking maybe my ex was right. Maybe I made the wrong choice.

I googled minimum overdosage for various medications I have and the only thing really keeping me from doing it is worrying what would happen to my dog. My sister talked me down on the phone but the thoughts are still there. I donâ€™t know.

Iâ€™ve been crying since getting dumped on Friday. I stayed with my parents and drove myself home to my apartment a couple hours ago and think I need to drive back. 

Iâ€™m so fucking hurt.
