Second time I have serriously concidered suicide and im afraid.I don't know where else to go, I don't really have anyone I can open up to. I've never really been serious about suicide in my life until a couple days ago when I first thought about it. This have just been terrible lately and it wont go away because I won't let myself forget things. I can't let anything go, but instead I just sit there thinking about the worst and assuming it to be true. 

I'm just afraid and embarrassed. I haven't been really happy for what feels like forever, just periods where I have been less sad. My grades have been dropping and I just cant find any motivation to do anything anymore. I feel like everyone in my life is drifting away from me and starting to exclude me from things like they just dont care about me anymore.
