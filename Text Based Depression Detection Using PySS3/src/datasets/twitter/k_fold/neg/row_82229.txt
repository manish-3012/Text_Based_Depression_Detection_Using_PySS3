Iâ€™m so tiredIâ€™ve done a lot of things. Pills, jumping off cliffs, tons to try and kill my self but Iâ€™m always doing it wrong. I was hospitalized. Then I was good, for about a year and a half, then I started having suicidal thoughts again, but because Iâ€™m 18, and not 15/16 they talk like I just want out of work. Iâ€™m prepared to kill myself. Iâ€™ve attempted worse ways, this time Iâ€™m just afraid it will hurt. I donâ€™t want to go out in more pain then Iâ€™m already in mentally. 
Nothing makes me happy anymore. And now Iâ€™m here typing this, and will probably delete it in a week because I feel like an attention whore. Because thatâ€™s all they ever say.
I have nothing going for me, I dropped out of high school because I was bullied, I work in a fast food restaurant that I literally have panic attacks before going and am called fat and â€œmooâ€™dâ€ at and called a cow but I refuse to tell my boss because itâ€™ll make it worse. So I guess thatâ€™s on me. Iâ€™m tired.
