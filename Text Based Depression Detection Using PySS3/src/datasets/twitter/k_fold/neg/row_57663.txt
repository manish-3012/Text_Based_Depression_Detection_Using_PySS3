Please just let me goI love you but please stop caring about me.  I just want to leave already.  If you could just find someone else already then this would be so much easier on the both of us.  I'm trying hard enough to not want to end it already, but now I have to worry about what would happen to you if I were gone.  I can't do this to you if you're attached to me, so please just do that for someone else.
