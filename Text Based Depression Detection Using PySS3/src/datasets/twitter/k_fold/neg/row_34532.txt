Day dreaming constantly about ways to kill myselfIm at the end of trying to find a purpose in this world, i know i will never find one. Some people just dont. I find myself spending 80% of the day figuring out how and where im gonna do it. I think im gonna go into the woods and make a mess of myself. I hate guns so ill go with wrist and throat slash to make sure it works. Idk when its gonna happen but i feel like its inevitable.
