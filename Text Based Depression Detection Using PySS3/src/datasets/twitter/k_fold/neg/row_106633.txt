Sorry for the self post... I'm depressed and want support. I'm 22 and was dating a VERY attractive and awesome girl and all was good.. until..I took it for granted and well... one drunk night got into a yelling fight and pushed her. She got a restraining order... fast forward one year... I drunk called her and now will go to jail for a month..

Im super depressed. 1) I am a good person.. I never try to harm anyone and do not think I deserve jail. 2)  I still have feelings... since her I have had 3 gfs.. but they have never been as good.. never the same.. I cannot get over her! 3) I know I sound dumb and I just am asking for some advice/help.. be harsh if need be.
