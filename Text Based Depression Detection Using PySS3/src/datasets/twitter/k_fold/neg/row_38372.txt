I'm done.I don't know what else to say, really. Just swallowed enough pills and drank as much liquor as I can stomach.

I don't even know why I'm writing this, I guess I wanted someone to know that I worked up the courage to do it properly this time. At least someone will read this and that's enough for me.

I don't believe in an afterlife, but hopefully I'll see you all in a better place.

I don't expect to be able to reply for long
