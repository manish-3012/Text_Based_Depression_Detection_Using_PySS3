TLDR sequelOkay.

I've just sat my exams, and honestly I am praying to God and anyone else who can hear me that I pass.

And if I don't, well, I've changed my mind a lot since the last post I made. I'm not going to kill myself.

I don't want to die, just yet anyway.

If I pass then that's all well and good and I can delete this account. But if I don't, then I have another plan. I'll continue working in my part time job and hopefully progress to full time work. I'll never get a good paying job without college qualifications, not in this country at least, but I have a plan.

It's legal, but fairly morally grey. My family would disown my here and now if I told them what it was.
I'll have to give up on my dream of becoming a teacher if I go down this route, and I'll never be really happy, as this route (maybe) involves getting married and just living out however long this planet has left, as a housewife. (I'm cringing at the thought even now).

But yeah, I'm not giving up on life itself. There's enough sadness in the world without me adding to it.

And if anyone does decide to read this, first off congrats on getting this far, and second, don't give up, get help (however you can, professionals, friends, family, heck even a stranger on the street) and just find something worth living for. Even if it's a pet goldfish or something.

Good luck.
