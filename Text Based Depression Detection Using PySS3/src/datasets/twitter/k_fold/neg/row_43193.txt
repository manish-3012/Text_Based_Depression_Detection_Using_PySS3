I don't know what to do anymore.I'm scared of everything that's been going on. My parents are physically, verbally/emotionally abusive. My best friend at school hasn't spoken to me in weeks, and I think it's because she doesn't want to deal with my suicidal tendencies and my selfharm. The boy I fell in love with told all his friends about my depression and now they all shower me with fake sympathy and laugh at me behind my back. My school headmaster forced me to take a medical leave for the rest of the school year and I'm scared that I won't get into college because of this. Worse yet, the people at school made up a whole story of lies meant to hurt me and get me expelled. I don't want to live anymore. I've dealt with enough beatings, enough betrayals, enough horrible words from the person I blindly loved, enough unwarranted hatred from every single person around me. I don't know what to do.
