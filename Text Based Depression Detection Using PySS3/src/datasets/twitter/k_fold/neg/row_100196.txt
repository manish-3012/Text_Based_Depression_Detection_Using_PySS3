"just learn to love yourself"Basically they're trying to say that no one likes you because you're too much of a depressed piece of shit, because you're too ugly/fat/too skinny, because you generally look like shit, because you're too stupid, because you're poor or because you don't have the same preferences as we do, or maybe because you're too shy or socially withdrawn, etc. Or in my case almost all of them. This whole "love yourself" thing is just another way of saying you're a piece of shit and you need to change or you'll die all alone (most likely by your own hands).
What a world we live in...

Just another dumb post of mine, feel free to ignore.
