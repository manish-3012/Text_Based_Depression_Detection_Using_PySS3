I wish a crazy cop would just keep a chock hold held. Seems like the best way. Don't give me this or that. No meds can help it's a bad sleeping problem and is not getting better. No train to scarred even though I know it's quick same with a cliff. I'm thinking about doorknob beltMy mind has reacted and it's too late I wake up an hour two after I go to sleep sometimes longer but then I can't go back to sleep. I am not over reacting and it has been going on for a month. Sometimes it really is for the best. Imagine being tired after 3 hours of sleep that seems to go by like a blink of an eye then not being able to fall asleep because you start to feel sick once you start dosing off and your body won't let you sleep. Medicine makes it worse. My question is. What is the best way to go? Do I need just a regular belt and a hopefully sturdy doorknob? IDC about who I affect because them dealing with that can be overcome and it's natraul. This cant. Please help me. You would really be doing me a huge favor by making me finnaly happy and able to rest. If I got taken away I would just rip out my own throat ( no I can't slit it) I just think being chocked till I pass out is the best way. Talking won't help it's not that kind if situation my mind and body has reacted to my sleeping problem and now I'm screwed. seems like the happiest and best way to go since you pass out. Almost like an mma fight that I lost and just never come back from. People go every day and I would just see it as that. I am going to be so happy on my way out you have no idea. I'm tough and would give my arms and legs to make this go away but it is too late. please respond or send a good link.
