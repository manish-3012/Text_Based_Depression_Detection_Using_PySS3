Studying..I'm 15 
In 10th grade 
There's a new system for our grade in Egypt 
Its a good system but insanely hard 
Our exams are open book now but none of the questions that come from the book arent even the same 
It's like they give you 2+2 in the book and in the exam it tells you to calculate the mass of the sun
I don't want to fail I'm very afraid of what my family would do to me 
Schools hard 
I've been always a model student but this new system makes it so harder 
I've never contemplated suicide till this point I've been ways that kid whose always super cheerful and been told that my constant smiling makes their days better 
But I'm unhappy 
I just wanna off my self 
I didn't ask to be born
I never wanted this life 
I never wanted responsibilitys
I have very big dreams
But I'm scared if I don't succeed in these exams either my father kills me or I loose all of my dreams
What if there is an after life and if I off my self do I go to hell
I dont want that
What happens after you die? No one knows 
What about my family living with the shame that their son and a brother killed him self
And from what fear of failure 
This is a cry for help
I have math in 2 days and im geniunely scared .
If I fail I know where my dad's gun is .... Quick and simple 
Help...
