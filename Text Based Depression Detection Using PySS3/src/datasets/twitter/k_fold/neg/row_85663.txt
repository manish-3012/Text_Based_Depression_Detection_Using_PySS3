Had to force a knife out of my friend's hand, now he's in and out of sleep on my chest and I'm not sure what to do.He's much smaller than me, so it was pretty easy to get the knife away and just scoop him up before he could retaliate.

He cut his arms and legs up beforehand, but that wasn't really a part of his attempt and I can patch the cuts up with some butterfly bandages. They're not that deep, if a bit wide.

Hospital isn't an option and I can absolutely look after him for as long as he needs, I work from home and his parents are abusive. I can't send him back home after this.

What should I do? Both in the short term, and the long term. Neither of us have any connection with doctors/social workers/psychiatrists, as this was pretty out of the blue, even though he's had issues for a while now- I don't want to force him into that environment too quickly.
