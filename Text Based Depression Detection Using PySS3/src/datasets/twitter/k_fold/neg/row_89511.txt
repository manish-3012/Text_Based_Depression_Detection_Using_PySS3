No point.I don't think there's a point in living anymore. I tried to - but it just isn't working out for me. I couldn't realize how much of a worthless fuck I am, and dreamed too big. My life is, and will continue to be worthless. 

But I don't want to die. But then again, I dont want to continue this life. I dont know what to do.

i cant think right now, im just writing whatever comes to my mind. all my years our effort is worthless. its not even my fault. i never chose to be born into this world. so i dont know. ill come back after ive calmed down a bit.
