My dream is the reason Iâ€™m reconsidering thingsSo Iâ€™ve been suicidal a lot lately but today I woke up at around 2 am due to a dream about a baby that I was holding. It was adorable i donâ€™t remember if it was a girl or a boy but it was adorable with big shinning eyes. I was taking care of the baby and it was crawling around. I was holding it and idk why I woke up and thought â€œthat was my baby in the dreamâ€. I woke up so happy that I started thinking I should keep living. I want a baby later on in life and it would be a blessing to have one. I wanna get better so I can be able to take good care of it. I kept smiling and felt so happy I couldnâ€™t fall back asleep.
