Iâ€™m scaredI didnâ€™t do it...yet at least. The thing is, Iâ€™m not scared of how dark my thoughts are, and thatâ€™s the worst part.
My best friend keeps trying to help me and find things to try and make me happy, but Iâ€™ve given up on being happy. Even if I survive, itâ€™ll just be an endless cycle of horrible people, a dying planet, and a dead end job. And Iâ€™m autistic, which means my chances of even getting a dead end job are low. 
Iâ€™d do anything to end my life at this point.
