I can feel it clawing inside my headThe feelings of hopelessness, the depression, the social anxiety, not having any friends. The thought a feeling like this for the rest of my life makes me want to shoot myself. I have been reading /r/SuicideBereavement  and it pushes me deeper and deeper into this pit when I think about putting my family through that.

I have so much I want to write in this post but my thoughts are rushing so much I cant organized them in a post.
