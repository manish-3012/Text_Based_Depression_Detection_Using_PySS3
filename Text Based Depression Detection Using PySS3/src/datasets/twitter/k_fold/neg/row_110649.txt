Killing MyselfI understand nobody is going to see this but Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I donâ€™t have anybody I can trust in my personal life and Iâ€™ve had no luck on reddit as everyone seems to ignore me, or when I reach out something bad happens. Recently, I messaged someone because I thought we had shared experiences. I received no message back only to find that I was being tagged by random people under a post with a screenshot showing things I never said. Iâ€™m actually question this personâ€™s credibility about their past if theyâ€™re going to go these lengths to fake something, and now Iâ€™m getting told that Iâ€™m a horrible person, Iâ€™m bad, whatâ€™s wrong with me, Iâ€™m cruel, etc, when nobody takes the time to look at the whole picture and actually *talk* to me. Iâ€™ve received a lot of DMâ€™s telling me to even kill myself,  so fine. If thatâ€™s what you fucking want them thatâ€™s what you fucking get. I donâ€™t need people like this in my life anyway and I hope they are all happy and this world is so fucking perfect when I die.
