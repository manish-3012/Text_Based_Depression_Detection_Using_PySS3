I'm useless. I'm highly disappointed with myself. I feel so frustrated... I give up.I'm useless even for such easy things like driving. At this point of my life, I realize I'll never be happy. I'm done; I just give up on everything. And I'm so scared of keep trying. I'm so tired of crying all the time. I'm having a lot of pain right now. Sadly, I can't even end with my life because I'm such a coward.
