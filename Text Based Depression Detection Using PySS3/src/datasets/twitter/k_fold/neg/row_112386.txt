I put myself into a corner, and i dont know if i made the right choicea few months ago my ex and I split up, it was mostly on my side, because we got into arguments often and i wasnt sure that this is what i wanted in life, working on my behavior etc. he ended up finding someone new, and i never pegged myself as a jealous person, but idk, the feeling came and hasnt left since. We stayed in contact, he doesnt really have all too many friends and i was helping him with mental problems while we were split up. He seemed happy, and i knew i was happy for him deep down, but these stupid feelings kept coming. We stayed in contact ever since, but ive noticed my mental state getting worse and worse the more i talked to him. The thought of him with someone else just made me feel a tremendous amount of dread, and depressed me instantly. The more we talked the harder and harder self harm and suicide was to ignore. Ive had these issues for several years now and i just cant shake my depression. I dont even know if i still care about him, or if i even want him back. Today while we were talking he said he was having his new bf over, and this just set me off. I told him to get some rest and to enjoy his time with him, and after the conversation I grabbed my box cutter. I flared up, and cut a lot deeper than expected. It bled for three straight hours until i started to bandage it. This isnt the first time this has happened either. I decided that enough was enough, and that i needed to cut ties. Being one of the two friends he had it felt terrible. He's stated in the past how much i mattered to him as a friend. I just cant bear to hear about him, and have him talk about his personal life with me anymore. It just hurts me in a way i didnt know i could hurt. The suicidal urges have just gotten worse and worse the longer we've talked. I just dont know if im making the right choice here. He's a nice person but has inadvertently driven me to self harm and suicide attempts numerous times. Did i make tje right choice?
