I choke myself with a beltSometimes, when the urge to die is the strongest, Iâ€™ll take a belt, close my closet door on one end so itâ€™s secured, wrap the other around my neck and pull as hard as I can, choking myself with my weight. 
Itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve been doing for about a year now. 
Iâ€™ve never gotten to the point where I fully lost consciousness but Iâ€™ve had my ears ringing and I went blind for a couple minutes. I usually just lay on the floor holding my head for a while after Iâ€™ve hurt myself. 
I feel like one day it will lead to my death and I think Iâ€™m OK with that? Because life can be dumb, and I donâ€™t always want to be a part of it. No one likes me.
