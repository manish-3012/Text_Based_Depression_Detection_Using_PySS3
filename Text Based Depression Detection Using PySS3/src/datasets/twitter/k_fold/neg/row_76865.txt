I have no idea what to doMy parents went on a trip for a week and 2 days ago they came back. I thought that it would be a good chance to kill myself when they're not home because if I failed I could just try again and no one would know about it. I didn't do it, but as soon as they returned from the trip I regretted it. Today one of my parents went on another trip and they'll be back on friday. This is my last chance. If I don't do it quickly I'll have to go through all these terrible things again. The only reason I'm afraid to do it is that if I fail and I'll be put in an in-patient unit for at least 6 months. I've talked about it with a doctor last time I was in that hospital and she said they can hold me there even for 6 months and I wouldn't be allowed to go out anywhere. This is the worst thing that could happen to me.
I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end. Every day I'm going through so much pain, I feel anxious and lonely all the time. I'm scared of my family, they're all passive-aggressive towards me, they try to manipulate and sabotage me. My mother screams at me all the time and blames me for being born autistic. I hate my father and we never talk, same with my younger sister. I'm scared of the future, I failed a year in school and I don't want to go there because I'm afraid others will bully me because of it. Even if they didn't I'm so ashamed of myself. I also have avpd, social anxiety and body dysmorphia, so going outsite and being around strangers is a horrifying experience for me.
I'm sure I will kill myself some day, I can't imagine living being transgender and autistic. I'm not asking you if I should do it or not. I know that I probably wouldn't be able to do it now. I just wanted to rant because I don't have anyone I could talk to about it, I'm so scared right now. I can't calm down, nothing gives me relief. I feel like I'm being surrounded by people who want to hurt me, like I'm trapped in a nightmare and I can't escape from it.
