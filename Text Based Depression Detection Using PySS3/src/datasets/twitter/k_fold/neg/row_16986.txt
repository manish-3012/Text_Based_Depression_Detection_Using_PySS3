tonight's the nighti've been thinking of doing this ever since seventh grade. it's six years later and nothing's changed, if anything it's gotten worse. i'm completely miserable and alone and there's no reason that anybody would (or should) care if i go. i'm done. it isn't worth it to keep pretending i'm alright or to see what i might become. i know damn well that i have no future. i'm a lost cause. and pretending i'm okay is so draining. it just isn't worth it. there's not one place i feel alright anymore. there's not one thing i can do that makes me feel fulfilled. i feel so empty and miserable, i'm done feeling like this. six years of this, today is the last straw. i'm done.
