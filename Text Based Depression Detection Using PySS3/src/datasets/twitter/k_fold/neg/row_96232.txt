this is my suicide noteI have lied to my family for 3 years that I am still in college, guilt and worry about what will happen if they find out that I am no longer in college, I should be in 7th semester now. this night my father began to suspect me about college money. I feel so guilty about lying for the past 3 years. I plan to hang myself tomorrow if there is no one at home, I have become trash in my family.
i dont think i even have a future. I can't stand lying to my family every day anymore
