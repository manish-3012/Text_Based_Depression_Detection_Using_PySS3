I don't know what to do anymoreI'm 17, I've been depressed for 8 months and had thoughts of killing myself for 6, but its really getting to the point where I just want to end it.

Nothing I do is fun anymore, everything I used to do slowly got consumed by frustration. I see a therapist and take medicine, but neither really help. I have a friend who talks to me almost every day and she is pretty much the only reason I haven't done it, but I'm feeling like a nuisance to her. She's says a lot of the things I say to her are making her angry because she doesn't understand why I do/would want to do some of the things I say

I started to self harm a little bit, just scratching, but I really am thinking of cutting or more likely just ending my life soon. Idk what I'm trying to say with this, but I just want to die.
