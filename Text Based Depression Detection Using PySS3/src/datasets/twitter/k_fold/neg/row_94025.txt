A brief moment where I felt I was getting closeSo after a night of not sleeping well, drinking alone (but not wasted drunk - just mildly buzzed), in a hotel in a town I don't like any more, I was driving home. And I was mostly numb to almost everything, just on autopilot, but aware of my surroundings - still driving safe. But then, during my rolling waves of deep depression and mild depression on the drive, I had one moment where I realized that sticking a gun in my mouth, aiming towards the brainstem, and pulling the trigger was scary, but probably not much worse than getting a shot from a doctor. I would imagine that if it's done right, it would be lights out pretty quick. This is the first time I've felt less scared about shooting myself. Part of me is concerned, but I'm also absolutely tired of depression and its hold on me for the last 25 years. I'm getting closer, I think, to maybe being successful in an attempt. The only problem is that I have a son, so this still leaves me feeling stuck.
