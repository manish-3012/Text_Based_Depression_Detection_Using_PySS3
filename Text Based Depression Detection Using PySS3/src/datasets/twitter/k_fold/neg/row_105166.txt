Sister attempted suicideHello /r/suicidewatch,

I don't know if this is the right post for this subreddit, but my sister attempted suicide on Sunday. My mother took her to the hospital today as she admitted it to the school counselor. What can I do to help her out? I don't want to act wrong when she comes home and I am not really sure what is going on right now(they're still at the hospital). Thank you all for the help.
