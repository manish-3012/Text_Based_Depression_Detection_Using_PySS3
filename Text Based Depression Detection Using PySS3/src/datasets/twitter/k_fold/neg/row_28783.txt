current state of mindsometimes i wish i was religious or some shit. believing in fairy tales about after life. believing there's meaning in what i do.

but it's too late. i'm stuck with this fucking existential dread.

hell, i'm not even sure it's related. i might just be weak minded in nature. my life isn't even that bad, but whenever anything goes slightly south, these thoughts come back. i'm not able to reassure myself with anything, because there's nothing to reassure myself with. life is going to suck, and then i'll die. why not now?
