I untied my noose the other day and I'm starting to regret itI untied it, got rid of the rope, burned my suicide note, all that jazz and I'm regretting it. Even simply being alive is overwhelming. I just wanna die but I let people in and I can't push them away without hurting them and myself. Please help.
