Can't do this anymoreI can't handle life. Life's problems.

This was one of the worst weekends that I've had since my breakup with my ex girlfriend.

I saw her on Saturday. I spotted her in a crowd of people and I ran away while having an anxiety attack. I could barely breathe, my heart raced like it was going to hop out of my chest and I felt this electricity pulse from my heart. It felt terrible. And I started crying.

Then I saw her later that night with someone who she would do anything for and tried to impress while we were together. And it felt like shit. I ended up getting out of there and bawling my eyes out.

And I felt like I wanted to crash my car while driving home. I was so sick of having someone's power over me like that, someone's power to cripple me.

And I've decided that I never want to give someone that power ever again.

To make it worse, a new girl I've been interested in for the past few weeks revealed that she's in a long distance relationship that's "on and off". In no time in the past weeks did she ever mention she was in one. 

I feel led on and stupid.

I feel as if life isn't worth living anymore if I'm going to feel pain inflicted upon me by others. I'm so tired of feeling sad. 

I don't necessarily want to kill myself in fear of leaving my family behind, especially my 10 year old sister.

But I just want to be gone. Gone, gone, gone. 

I have a plan but I know I don't want to follow through with it.
