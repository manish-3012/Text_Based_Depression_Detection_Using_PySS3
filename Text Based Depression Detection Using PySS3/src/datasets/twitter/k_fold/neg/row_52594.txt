Spiralling hardThis past 7 day have been an absolute misery, I relapsed on cutting myself and did it really bad, and now I can't stop, I'm loosing hope for myself and I just don't want to be alive. I made a promise to a friend to tell him if I was going to kill myself and I told him I would this weekend, part of me doesn't want to give up but I'm just so tired of life, tired of my feelings, tired of my routine. The only thing that was keeping me going was my brother's wedding in Feb but I don't think I'm going to make it. I pushed a friend away today and told him to give up on me. I don't know what else to do
