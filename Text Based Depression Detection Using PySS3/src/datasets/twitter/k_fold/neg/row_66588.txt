Sometimes I want to kill myself just to know how people would react.That is basically it. My parents never made me feel like they care for me. I've been in a couple abusive relationships just to try to escape from reality, but once I depend too much on someone, they realize they can make me do whatever they want me to.

The one time I talked to my parents about depression, I was told it's not real.

I want to, I dunno how to describe it really, disappear? Maybe just to see what'd happen if I died. Would anyone care? Or would everyone just move on without caring, the way they've treated me when I am alive?

If I never held any value to anyone while alive, I shouldnt matter to them when dead. Why does death increase the value of a life?
