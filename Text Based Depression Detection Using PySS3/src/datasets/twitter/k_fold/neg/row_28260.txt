I think I'm a complete idiot. I'm so jealous of my crush to the point that I harmed myself and I want to die.I'm not asking for a relationship advice. All I want to know is how do I cope with this sh*t because I'm jealous of her because of her status , her lifestyle , genetics. I kept comparing those things to myself. I feel like I'm just a piece of trash when compared to her because i don't have any of that. Anybody here feels the same way as me?
