I don't know what else to do... arriving home i think i will kill myself.I'm a 24yr old unemployed lawyer. When i was in college there were a lot of days i would look in the mirror and ask myself 'why are you still alive?'. Sometimes i would cut my shoulder just to feel the pain, to feel alive, i still do it (started when i was 19yr). 
Somewhere in this daily ritual i started to give myself answers to not do it, like 'i'm still being financially supported by my family, killing myself now would be too irresponsible and ungratefull'.

I started giving myself objectives so i wouldn't start the process of planning my suicide, things like 'finish college'... 'find a job'... 'now that you got a job, gather money'... 'now that you have enough money, gather more and see japan as you always dreamed'. I did all that and when i got back from japan i noticed this whole process turned me cold, i don't feel happy or sad anymore, i just see days passing by in shades of grey, sometimes i start to cry without a reason, sometimes i lay in the dark drinking and etc.

i came to my father's house 3 weeks ago and will come back to my place tomorrow night, where i might begin what i always postponed all these years now that i can see things will only get worse and i should go before i start embarrassing my loved ones.

I always lurked here in this subreddit so i thought going away without posting the tale of my life would be a shame. Somewhere along those years, i had fun. Sorry for my grammar as i'm not a native english speaker. bye.
