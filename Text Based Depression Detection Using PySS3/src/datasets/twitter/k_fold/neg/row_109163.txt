My life is fine. Good, in fact.But I still feel suicidal. I have nothing of any real substance to be depressed about. I have a good job, a mostly good family, a great dog, no friends really. That part's hard. I've been single for a long time. I was sexually assaulted in October. But it didn't really fuck me up at first. I don't think about it often, but I haven't had sex with anyone new since then. 

I have a plan, but no timeline. I've never been treated for depression before, but I've had bouts that I had assumed were something similar. Laying in bed for days, feeling despondent, angry at everyone for no real reason. 

I feel so guilty that my life is so good, but I still feel this way. I've told two people and they both were shocked. I don't think they took me seriously, but that makes sense. It's not logical for me to want to do this. 

I just don't care about my future. I don't care to wake up another day. It would just be easier to not. I don't feel sad or mad at the world. I just don't want to keep having to try. I feel like I've tried for so long and I'm tired.  I'm only 24 and I'm tired. 

I don't know. I feel like everyone here has a valid reason for wanting suicide and I don't. And that makes me feel worse.
