I would have died if not for my catI had taken my dads gun and was gonna shoot myself but i remembered my cat and i couldn't leave my cat behind when i died so i packed my stuff and brang my cat to my girlfriends house . 3 years later im happy, married and still have my cat and my dad apologised for aways abusing me. Life is good right now.
