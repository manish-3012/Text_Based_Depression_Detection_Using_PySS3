*an interesting title*Quarantine has given me a lot of time to think and to be honest, for me, thinking can be dangerous. I've found myself thinking about all of the things wrong with me, why I can never be good enough, why i am sat at home, crying playing guitar hero, wondering if I'll even make it to the end of quarantine and honestly, I don't know. It's not the isolation that's driving me crazy it's the lack of motivation to do anything at all. Normally I wouldn't talk to people if I didn't have to, I wouldn't leave the house unless it's 100% necessary but it's the feeling of being trapped, like I'm in a prison cell and I can't leave. There's something about it being technically illegal to go out that makes me feel the worst. My mental health was already bad enough and I've cut myself off from a lot of my friends because I just don't want to talk to a lot of people and I know they are mad at me but I just don't think I cam talk to them right now. Almost Every night for the past 4 years I have cried myself to sleep and I'm getting tired of it, tired of feeling so shit all the time, tired of being me. 

Sorry for the rant, have a nice day &lt;3
Goodbye
