Trapped in this hideous body. I think it's time to sign out.After dieting and lifting weights rigorously for a year and a half, I've realised that my body is totally resistant to exercise. My body is still skinny fat even after focusing heavily on compound lifts and eating lots of protein and centring my whole life around fitness, and I've realised that this isn't going to change. The skinny fat physique is absolutely the worst body type a man could ever have and since I'm stuck in this body forever, I've realised that there's no point in living anymore. Women won't ever want someone so hideous and no one respects a man who is out of shape. They'll see me as a guy who doesn't even take care of my health, yet I do the absolute opposite. 

I can't leave the house because of my body. How thin my wrists look, how scrawny my arms are, how skinny I look in the body, and how flat my ass is. Despite training solidly in the gym and actually getting my nutrition in check, my body is still the same as it was ages ago. It's not going to change. I always convinced myself that if I tried something slightly different then I'd make progress, but it never happened. It's more evidence that I can't do anything right. 

Now I don't see the point in living anymore. If I can't leave the house, enjoy life, build muscle as a person who loves fitness, experience love and sex like normal people, life just isn't worth living anymore. It's like wanting to be a writer but having every single piece of work you've written be rejected or hated by everyone. Imagine how crushed you must be to try everything yet still fail. 

Thanks for everything. Well, actually, thanks for nothing. I put in so much and got so little in return. Fuck you.
