What's the point of being alive anyway?I'm miserable. I'm working a minimum wage job even though I have a college degree and several certifications/credentials. I fucked those opportunities up with failed drug tests. I'm 142 My family is very poor and after hurricane Florence our house needs several repairs we are unable to afford. I hate myself. I'm a bad person. I'm so fat and unattractive.  I'm 22, never had a boyfriend or any kind of intimate relationship. My dad is verbally and physically abusive. He yells at how incompetent I am everyday. I'm trying yo get another job to get out. Only thing keeping me going is my 2 small dogs but even then I feel like im just a burden to them. I literally think about killing myself over 15 times an hour but don't want to fail and be involuntarily committed like 2x before. I'm so miserable. It can't be me meant for me to stay alive feeling like this.
