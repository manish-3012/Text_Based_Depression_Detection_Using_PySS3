I failed.So the school year just ended, and I got a D and probably 3 C's. In my family, that is one of the worst things you can do. I can't imagine what my mom's gonna do to me when she finds out. Last time I had a C on my report card she yelled at me for about an hour and grounded me from anything fun for a week. I don't want to know what's gonna happen when she finds out about this.

This is all my fault. My lazy ass didn't do homework even when I knew my grades. I just lost motivation. Maybe it's because I've been depressed all year, but my mom will never accept that as an excuse. 

This is going to make it night impossible to get into any colleges (according to my mom), so there goes my engineering dream job. I'm probably just going to be a homeless bum that leeches off my mom. I'd end it now but I have no way to do it. I could probably run off into the forest next to my house and slit my wrists or throat. 

I can't deal with all of this fucking guilt. It's so overwhelming so I'm going to try on Thursday. see ya
