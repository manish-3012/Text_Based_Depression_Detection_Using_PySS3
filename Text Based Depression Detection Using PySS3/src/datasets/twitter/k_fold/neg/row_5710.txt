If you can ask for help, you're getting somewhereI'm writing this in the ER room.

There are a few things I want to tell you if you're reading. About two weeks ago I was in ER because I tried to hang myself, today I'm here because I knew my urge to jump off that multilevel car park was too strong.

It sucks a lot, I don't know if you do, but I beat myself over the idea that I'm sad as shit when I have everything I could want or need. I feel like a bitch. The thing is, I kinda hope I'll get better, though I want to die a lot, and I've tried a few times, I'm still breathing.

I feel like there are things I would regret as I started to lose consciousness.

So that's why I'm sitting in hospital right now, by my own choice, voluntarily. Because I know it's better to be here before anything happened than to get dragged down by the ambulance.

Tldr: ask for help, I dare you.
