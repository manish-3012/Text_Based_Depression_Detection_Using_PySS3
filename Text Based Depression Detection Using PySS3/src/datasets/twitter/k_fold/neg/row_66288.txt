I wish I wasnâ€™t born to be honestMy dad does crystal meth and in the past did it in front of me. He cares about me and I know he loves me but I feel like I canâ€™t live a normal life because I live with him. Itâ€™s hard because when he is sober he is kind but when heâ€™s on drugs or coming off of them he acts very crazy and at times inappropriate. I also feel guilty for disliking him because he provides food shelter and has always worked but I feel like he really just wasnâ€™t fit to be a parent. Yesterday I cried about it and my mom told me I was being crazy and that I need to grow up. I honestly just wish I could kill myself because I donâ€™t know how to deal with this situation and I feel I wouldnâ€™t be able to live on my own because I canâ€™t afford it and I have no life skills.
