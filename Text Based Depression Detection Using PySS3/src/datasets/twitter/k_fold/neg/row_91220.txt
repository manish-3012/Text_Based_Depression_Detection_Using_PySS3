Slowly watching myself consider suicide.I just want to open up. I have a good life. I've made mistakes, but I feel they're problems that most of my generation has gone through. I'm not sure why I feel this way. I'm scared.
I am a 24 year old college dropout. Got through a few years, and hit a deep depression, where I rarely left my dorm room for classes or even meals. (I ended up ordering out a lot, which had a bad effect on my weight). Was in a 6 year long distance relationship with my high-school sweetheart. We broke up, because things didn't go exactly as planned. The distance was pretty hard on her. Eventually took a few therapy sessions, where I learned more about my depression issues, which were more common than I had assumed. 
Moved back in with my parents, who were more accommodating than I had expected. I've spent the last 6 months looking for a job (Anything. Even the most rudimentary of minimum wage.), to absolutely no avail. I sit at home most days, but have a very productive hobby, as a guitar player. In addition, I make it a point to fill at least one job application a day. I live in a big city, so there are many employment options. Though I'm unemployed and a non-graduate, I still see myself as somebody that can be valuable to society. I see promise in my future. I just need that first job as a jump-start. Started a fitness and diet routine 2 months ago. I've managed to lose some weight, and work toward shedding away my college gut. I'm even applying for a local university, next semester.
Everything should be fine. I'm covering every textbook step to conquer my depression. Life should be good. Even still, over the past month, I have hit huge bouts of hopelessness. I find myself lonely. I loathe myself for not being strong enough to be lonely. Friends from high school have drastically changed. My ex has been playing head games. I've tried my best to detach myself from what we had, and I get pissed at myself for thinking that I may still have feelings for her. I get angry with myself for even feeling bad, because so many others have it worse. My problems aren't bad at all.
Nonetheless, the voice in my head keeps saying "It's better just to end it." The thoughts have become more detailed and more frequent. I now think about putting a bullet in my head, daily. It's a constant war. I find myself screaming "I am not going to kill myself." mentally, just to fight these urges, which seem to come from nowhere at any given moment.
I don't know why I feel this way. Things are going far too well for this to happen. I hate myself, because I have no reason to feel bad. I may consider medication, but I honestly don't know if it will help. I don't want to die. I don't know why these ideas keep popping up. Despite the hard work I've been putting in, I can't seem to grasp any satisfaction from life. I feel hollow, but I shouldn't. I'm not one for self pity. I've tried to stay strong. What am I doing wrong? 
I probably sound like a whiny little bitch, compared to the people here with legitimate problems. I am genuinely afraid that, one day, I won't be able to say that I won't kill myself. How can I fix this?
