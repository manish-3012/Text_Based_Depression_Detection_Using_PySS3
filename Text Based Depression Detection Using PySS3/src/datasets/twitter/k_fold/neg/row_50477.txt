I think I'm losing my mindI hate that this has to be my first reddit post ever. Iâ€™ve been a lurker for three years. I have no one else to turn to. Iâ€™m a 24 year old American female.

Several years ago I was in an abusive relationship and I tried to kill myself. I almost died. Almost, unfortunately. They told me I had borderline personality disorder. After the relationship ended, I thought I would die. I have no friends. Never have really. I tried to find someone to talk to or confide in. I thought I found someone who would listen, but he took advantage of my mental state and raped me. This all happened back in 2009-2010.

Finally, I met my current boyfriend. He helped me so much. I felt almost human again. Our life these past four and a half years has been wonderful. We moved three states away from our home state to a new city about a year and a half ago. I thought all my suffering was over.

But now this morning heâ€™s telling me that he still has feelings for his ex and has the whole time. None of it was real. Heâ€™s left to go to a friendâ€™s house to figure himself out and Iâ€™m here all by myself. Iâ€™m right back to where I started. 

I had nothing going for me except him. I havenâ€™t been working these last few months because I got sick and had to quit my serving job because I physically couldnâ€™t do it anymore. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and possibly lupus. Fortunately, I had a full academic scholarship to college, so I got to save the money that was originally intended for school and Iâ€™ve been living off that for now. Iâ€™m a musician, so I spent these last few months off finishing my album. Itâ€™s supposed to be released Feb. 10. I was so proud of myself for finishing it. Now, I donâ€™t even care about it anymore. Itâ€™s shitty and no one will ever listen to it.  It doesnâ€™t even matter.

So now I have no job, no boyfriend, no friends, and Iâ€™m in a fairly new state far away from my family. Iâ€™m not really that close to my dad, and my mom is very sick. She probably only has a few years left to live. I canâ€™t put this on her. It would upset her too much and Iâ€™m not risking her health for me.

I feel like itâ€™s all a sign that Iâ€™m not supposed to be here. I was never supposed to be here. The world doesnâ€™t want me. No one wants me. I have no one left.

Iâ€™m donâ€™t even think Iâ€™m human anymore. Iâ€™m just a shell. I feel like some sort of monster. I thought he was different, that he could make me human again.

I canâ€™t do this again. I canâ€™t. Itâ€™s my first relationship all over again. I have to leave. I have to go.

Iâ€™m sorry if this doesnâ€™t make sense. Iâ€™m sorry for all the grammatical errors. I'm sorry if my formatting is messed up. I've never posted on reddit before. I also really hope I'm not breaking any subreddit rules. I skimmed the sidebar but I can't even comprehend anything right now. My thoughts are all over the place. I canâ€™t even function right now. I'm just pacing in circles. I feel like I'm losing my mind. My borderline insanity is coming back. I thought I didn't have it. I thought they were wrong. I'm shaking and I can't breathe. Iâ€™m just trying to pull myself together a little bit so I can figure out the best way to end this. I overdosed on nyquil the first time and that didnâ€™t work and I donâ€™t have access to a gun. Maybe slitting my wrist is the way to go. I could also take all of my tramadol. Itâ€™s the only thing I have that can help numb the pain even a little. But I donâ€™t know if I have enough to kill me. I also have about four months worth of adderall that I havenâ€™t been taking.  Maybe I could take both? I donâ€™t know.

Someone please help me

Edit- My bf and I share a reddit account. All previous posts in the history were him. I didn't even stop to think of making a throwaway.
