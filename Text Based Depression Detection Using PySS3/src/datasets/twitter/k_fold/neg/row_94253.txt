Iâ€™m a 34yr old unemployed majorly depressed fucking loser with no social skills and things are only going to get worse.I feel too much contempt in my heart for certain family and friends. I canâ€™t forgive them for crushing my spirit in the myriad of ways theyâ€™ve chipped away at it in large and small ways.

I have anhedonic reactions to pretty much everything and have done for many years. I just donâ€™t enjoy anything anymore. Nothing inspires me to take action. I just avoid further inconvenience or pain.

Iâ€™ve squandered the best years of my youth and I donâ€™t have any marketable skills or appreciable talent. I canâ€™t keep rotting away into deeper humiliation. Remaining alive is undignified. I donâ€™t want to exist anymore. 

I just feel full of hate towards myself and towards others.

I just donâ€™t have the energy or skills to compete.

Whatâ€™s the point in going on
