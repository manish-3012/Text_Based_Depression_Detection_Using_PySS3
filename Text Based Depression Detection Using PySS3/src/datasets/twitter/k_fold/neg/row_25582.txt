I'll definitely fail all of my classes and I can't deal with it.Started working during summer after 3rd year college, attended class while working the following semester. During that, I faiiled 8 out of 9 classes. I didn't attend those classes because at first, I was too tired to go to class and I became too behind to even attend those classes. Before the semester ends, I got fired. 

Following semester started. No job, super behind on classes and what did I do? Not attend classes. All of it. Stupid, I know. Now, semesters about to end and I don't know how I can tell this to my asian mom, my sister who pays for my tuition while working overseas, my girlfriend who knows that I'm attending classes when in reality, I just go out and waste time, and the rest of my asian family who looks at me like I'm such a perfect kid that makes no mistakes. And I'll probably cant enroll the following semester because the school would see that I didn't attend any classes. I want to get another job but girlfriend condones it because she wants me to get a degree becasue she's graduating this semester. 

All I did this semester is play games just to distract me. Now that the semester is ending,  I just want to kill myself and not deal with all these problems.
