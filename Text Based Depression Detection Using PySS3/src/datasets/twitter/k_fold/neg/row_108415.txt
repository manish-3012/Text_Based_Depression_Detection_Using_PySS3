Two damaged souls is romanticIâ€™ve only been in love once in my life, Iâ€™m only 20 years and Iâ€™ve been in a lot of relationship but never felt the way I felt for my ex girlfriend. We dated in high school and once more after we graduated but we broke up a year ago and I think of her from time to time but it just didnâ€™t work out. Iâ€™m starting to get back into the dating Scene but never really felt the urgency to find someone because I know they wouldnâ€™t really understand me, my ex and I had a similar Traumatic experience when we were kids and I really felt
Like we connected on being so broken from it. I want to move on but I just donâ€™t want to go through the getting to knowing process because 9 times out of 10 Iâ€™ll just be uninterested in the person and feel like I just got my self in a Position where Iâ€™ll hurt somebodyâ€™s feelings, Iâ€™ve been sexually active but never really felt like I liked any of them and it hurt them and I just donâ€™t want to do that anymore.  I always say Iâ€™ll just work on myself and hopefully sheâ€™ll come some day but i miss feeling something.
