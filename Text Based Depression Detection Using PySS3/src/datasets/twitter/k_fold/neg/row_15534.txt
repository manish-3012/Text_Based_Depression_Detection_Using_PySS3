please tell me if i have a chance at lifeI have been a heroin addict on and off since 17. I  was a prostitute until I met my partner 12 years ago. he says I will never be nothing but a whore. People i meet in life call me an angel i always try to be friendly helpful but inside i dont see a point if my addiction and the fact i was a pro will be with me forever whats the point. I tried oding on prozac not fun hurt like hell and rattled for days afterward. Is my life worth anything i have no formal education but i am an avid reader can figure most things out like helping neighbours when she had a broken leg or today pumping a neighbours flat tyre cos they didnt have a pump. i smile at everyone i meet cos i know it brightens my day when some1 smiles at me. i am dependant on my partner for everything he says he loves me then why do i feel like this  the only thing i have ever wanted is to be loved needed. im isolated other than him its lonely
