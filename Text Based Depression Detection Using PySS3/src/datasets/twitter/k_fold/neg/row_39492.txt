I want to commit suicide, but I'm worried about my dogI'm not sure if this is the right place to post this. I'm just kind of lost though. Maybe someone can give me advice.

I have an older dog that I'm worried no one will take care of if I'm gone. She's the reason I haven't killed myself yet. I can't even hardly take care of her anymore. If I can't do that, I really can't see the point of me being here anymore. I'm just tired. I've been dealing with this too long and I can't do it anymore.

I want my baby to be okay though. I don't know who would care for her. Is there some way that I can ensure that she'd get a good home with someone that can take of her better than I can? I'm just not fit to care for her anymore.

I have family, but most of them live far away. It's not like I see them much anyway. I have a great boyfriend, but I'm a shit partner. I have no idea why he's wasting his time with me. I'm a disgusting slob that is going absolutely nowhere. He says he'd be really upset, but I have a really hard time seeing what he'd be losing.

The reason I'm so worried about my dog is that she can't care for herself. My family and my boyfriend can, they have the ability to take care of themselves and move on, but, there would be no gaurantee my dog would be okay.

Maybe I'm just being an idiot about this. I don't know. I'm just so tired of it all. Can someone give me advice?
