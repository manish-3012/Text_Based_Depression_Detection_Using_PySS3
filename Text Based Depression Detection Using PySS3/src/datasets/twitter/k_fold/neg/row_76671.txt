A have tried countless times and life somehow always finds a way to knock me down. I am truly exhausted and tired of trying.For the past few years I have constantly tried to get my life on track, but out of nowhere things would go wrong. I am seriously thinking I am not meant to move forward at this point. I think it is time I stop trying to strive for more.

 I am currently at the lowest point I have been in a long time. 
For awhile now I have thought about writing about my journey in improving my life. I don't know... I thought if I write about my journey I could use it to help others in my position. I know it sounds stupid, but if I can help others by improving my life it gives me a reason to continue.

I have decided to stop because I feel too guilty since if I can't even continue trying how can I help others :/
