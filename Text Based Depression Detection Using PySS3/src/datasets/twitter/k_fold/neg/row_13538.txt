I need to kill myself to protect the people around me.I'm 22. In 22 years of life I've done nothing, I dropped out of high school, got a GED, supposed to start college in the summer, but in 22 years of life, I've never had a girlfriend in real life. Not once. I'm too afraid to even attempt to talk to women. Besides, I have no money and no mode of transport (Besides the bus). So 22 years of loneliness compacted with 22 years of sexual frustration. Can you see the problem here? Yeah, I spend almost all day every day trying to resist either raping someone or going on a killing spree.

I've never told anyone this before, but I felt like I had to. Now I must end myself...To protect others.
