Does anyone not want to get better?I have good days sometimes, but I wish that I didnâ€™t. I find myself wanting to be miserable so that I have the strength to kill myself. Itâ€™s like life is shitty enough to make me suffer, but tolerable enough that I canâ€™t take myself out of it. It gets me so frustrated, I just want a way out. I just need to share what Iâ€™m going through and probably no one will even read this but it was worth a try.
