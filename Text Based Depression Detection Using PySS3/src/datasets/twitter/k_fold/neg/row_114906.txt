Why...Why is everything so hard to handle. Why cant i believe when someone says it will get better...someone tells me it will be better and all i want to do is just stop. Why is it i can accept the fact that things are good for the first time in my 25 years on this earth? Why is everything i hope will help useless or pointless...why am i bothering... I am so tired of it all...
