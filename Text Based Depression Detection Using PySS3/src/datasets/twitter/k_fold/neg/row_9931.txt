HelpEveryone makes me feel like trash, my parents, my brother, my friends, classmates, teachers. canâ€™t sleep because Iâ€™m afraid that I will wake up. i keep having panic attacks at night, I cry a lot. im scared of killing myself because I donâ€™t know whats going to happen after. at this point, the only thing that makes me happy is playing video games..
