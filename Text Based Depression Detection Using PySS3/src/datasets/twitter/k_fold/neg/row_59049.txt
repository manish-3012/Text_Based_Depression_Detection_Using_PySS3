I know my boyfriend doesn't love me because he's afraid my family will kill him.My boyfriend says he loves me but he doesn't. Any time I'm at risk, in danger, or do something stupid or reckless the very first thing out of his mouth is "your family / your dad will kill me if anything happens to you." How could he believe that isn't compelling? He does it on purpose. I know he doesn't love me. I haven't said it yet but he's probably aware that I know because he's been saying it more lately, even though he won't kiss me, have sex with me, or even touch me at all.

I've even been thinking about getting tested but I figure what's the point? If he's cheating on me with that girl that just broke up with her boyfriend, or with that woman he / we play poker with, or if he fucks literally anyone at all and I get HIV and die because I'm in love with someone that does not give a single shit about me at all but won't admit it or try to talk about it with me. I asked him if he wanted to date his coworker after he admitted they both told each other they would go out with one another and he just got all concerned in his tone and said "I didn't think you were like that, what makes you say that." The fact that you both told each other you WOULD you fucking asshole!

I don't know what to do. I'm basically worthless and he's right to not want me but can't he just break up with me instead of making us live his lie? I love him and we've been supporting each other financially for years now. If I kill myself, maybe my family would go after him. I don't want that. But I don't want to live in this shitty hell anymore where I have to pretend that he loves me and isn't fucking his beautiful coworker or our friends on the side.
