A poem about change.I sit here with nothing.  
Nothing but sadness and time.

Tear after tear: collecting,  
Freezing, consolidating.

One brick of ice becomes two,  
Two form together;  
I'll build a home out these tears of mine.

Fragile flesh gives way to the hard reality of ice.

Three walls almost done,  
3 parts drops, 2 parts B-.  
Every part of it, me.

5 parts of pain.

Focusing, anything to stop them-  
the thoughts-  
my mind - the lack thereof.

Starting on the roof, almost done.  
The clouds break,  
One crepuscular ray.

Cheeks dry, one last tear.  
My walls come melting down,  
My fingertips, a mess of scabs and scars.

My eyebrows raise,  
My cheeks lift, burdened by rivers no more.

The light grows faint,  
The clouds return.

My heart sinks to the ground,  
and I with it.

I sit here, with nothing.  
No- not nothing.

Grab the brick out of the puddle.  

I walk there. With me.
