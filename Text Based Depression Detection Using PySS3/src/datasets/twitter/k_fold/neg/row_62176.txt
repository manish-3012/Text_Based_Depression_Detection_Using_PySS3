To live with pain or die with peace.24(M)
I have no job, never had a gf or someone to share my feelings with, even when I gave more than 100% at a job, I was removed because of politics. My parents forced me to do a degree which I had no interest in. I almost killed my self a couple of times during that whole graduation ordeal. Now that I'm graduated I cannot get a fucking job anywhere and feel worthless for wasting my life.

My parents are good people especially my dad but we both are losers working jobs we dont like. His business is failing everyday. And everyday I get this feeling of being worthless by not being able to do anything. Sometimes I just feel like ending it all but man I cannot imagine what my parents will go through, either they'll live or die.
