I feel like I have no reason to live besides my girlfriend, and as we dont have a lot in common, I dont know how much longer it's going to lastAs you can probably tell from the title, I dont think I want to live any longer. I have no close friends, but I somehow managed to get a girlfriend after being a complete crackhead at school. I never hang out with anyone anymore, and I've become a complete introvert, while I want to be an extrovert. My addictions have caused me to push all of my old friends away, and I made new ones that then push me away. The only reason I'm not dead right now is because I'm trying to keep the only people close to me happy.
