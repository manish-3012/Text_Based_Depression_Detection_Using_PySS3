Calling the national suicide prevention hotline?Hi everyone, I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while and it has been worsened by external factors such as high school, failure and extreme pressure in high level and demanding sports, and somewhat toxic friendships. This is not the reason but certainly aggravates the ongoing and initial issues. I just want somebody to talk to who I can explain my whole situation and they can give me an unbiased opinion unlike if I were to talk to a friend. For this reason I have wanted to call the national suicide hotline. I have done the chat before but can't call because I live in a somewhat smallish house with both my parents and my sister. I take care of cats a few streets down from my house and have wanted to go there to try to find a place where I could be alone and call. However they have security installed in their house which I am paranoid is going to record me and have the information spread somewhere which would end me. Does anyone have any advice on where to go and what to do when you don't want to do anything any longer?
