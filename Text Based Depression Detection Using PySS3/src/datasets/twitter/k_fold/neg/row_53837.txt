I have a loving family, Iâ€™m young and healthy, and yet I canâ€™t bare my life anymore.I feel so alone, like no one gets my frustration or understands how I think and feel. I moved out of my city to start flight school and i havenâ€™t flown in over a month, I have no real friends here and I hate both my jobs. I fire up at least 4 bowls every day and I still feel like crying but I have no one to cry to. Life has become too painful to live and I donâ€™t want it to continue, I have some deep emotional problems that frankly I canâ€™t figure out. There is so much wrong with me, and I donâ€™t know or care to fix any of it.
