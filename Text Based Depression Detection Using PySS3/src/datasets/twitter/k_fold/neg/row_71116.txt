Iâ€™m sick of itIâ€™m sick of being told to just move on, Iâ€™m sick of being told to just accept whatâ€™s happened. Iâ€™ve tried and Iâ€™ve tried and Iâ€™ve tried. Iâ€™ve done everything people suggested, but I still just want to attempt again. I just want to feel like Iâ€™m in control of my life and talk to the girl I love, but she just ignores me now. I hate myself.
