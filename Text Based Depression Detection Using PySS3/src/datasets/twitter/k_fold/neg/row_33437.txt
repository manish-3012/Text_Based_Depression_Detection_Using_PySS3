I am giving up"I want to cut myself until I am dead and I dont know why"

I have multiple cuts that needed to be stitched. She saw them, my best friend. Touched the scar tissue. 

"Chemical imbalances dont feel guilty lol" 

She only has two semesters left before she graduates to be a psychologist

I feel so validated. I dont need to feel guilty, it is just my chemical imbalances. "Great I dont have to feel guilty now!" 

I cut and I cut and I cut. On my thigh because I hang on to my last remains on my last remains of self restraint
 

"Yes you dont need to feel guilty"

I can feel myself giving into the urge to put the knife on my wrists. It probably wont kill me but the knife is fucking sharp it's great. I looked up the national suicide hotline of our country and open the chat.

After 3 generic messages the person I am talking with ignores me. I wait. 5 minutes. 10 minutes. 15 minutes. 

25 minutes pass and the person behind the screen doesn't respond. I start feeling desperate. 

In an effort to satisfy the urge to drag the knife across my wrist I instead start hitting myself, until the right side of my head tingle a little and my ear feels weird.

"The national suicide hotline just ignored me.." 

"Wtfff how?"

"Well. How ignoring goes? Not responding to my messages, at all."

"Cant u report it or smth?" 

"Goodnight"

Help?
