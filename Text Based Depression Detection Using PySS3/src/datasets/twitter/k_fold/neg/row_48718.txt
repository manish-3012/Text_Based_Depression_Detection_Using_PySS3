i just need to know if anyone can relate to this.i donâ€™t really know if this is the right place to post this, but am i the only person who knows that theyâ€™re going to commit suicide in the future? iâ€™m not planning on doing it anytime soon but i know that itâ€™s eventually going to happen and iâ€™m just okay with the fact now.
