Best laid plansMaybe life would seem bearable if everything I attempted to do didn't turn to shit. I have two degrees that I've never been able to use because I couldn't even drum up enough interest for an interview. So people told me to find something else I was interested in. I more or less did, but plans to pursue that fell through too. No-one understands that. They keep giving off these vibes (or flat out telling me) that I'm not living up to my potential. So now, I'm just a loser in his mid-40s going nowhere fast and no ambition to do anything anymore but die. But I have to wait until my next refill.
