I feel emptyFirst of all, sorry for any grammatical mistakes as English is not my native language.

A bit background. I've been depressed since 13, officially diagnosed at 15, start feeling suicidal since 17 and I'm going to kill myself by the time I turn 25 (11 November 2020).

No goals, no drive, no purpose. I don't see the point to do anything anymore. I feel tired all the time and have no energy to do anything besides sleeping all day and do pointless stuff online.

 I've tried everything from psychologist, therapist, counselors, psychiatrists, behavioral therapists, trying bunch of antidepressant. Nothing works out for me and here I am now, with absolutely no desire for any kind of life.
