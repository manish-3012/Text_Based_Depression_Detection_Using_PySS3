I feel like I've lost everything.I have been living with my partner for the past 6 months in a big shared house with loads of our friends. On Saturday night we found out that the landlord is increasing the rent immediately for couples because he can't fill the empty rooms at the moment. I lost my job a little while back, so we can't afford the increase.

So on Sunday I've had to leave my partner and friends and move back in with my father, hundreds of miles away. I feel trapped and alone, and like there is going to be no way out of this.

My partner said they'd help me and be there for me, but I've lashed out because they made me promises they've broken and I'm scared and now they haven't spoken to me all day, and I think they're going to end things between us.
