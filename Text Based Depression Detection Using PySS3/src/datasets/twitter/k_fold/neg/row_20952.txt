Everything sucks, specially meWhy should I even bother with living?
It hasnâ€™t been but failures and frustration so far, I havenâ€™t accomplished a single thing that Iâ€™ve wanted to while everyone else around me has and possibly never will.
Iâ€™m a useless piece of stupid trash
Iâ€™ve even failed at killing my self TWICE, rn I just wanna slit my arms to shreds and die
Who knows what might happen soon
