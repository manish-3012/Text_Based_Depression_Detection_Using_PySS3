Make it look like an accidentI'm 29 and done with this world.
I have two great kids and they're the only reason I'm still here.
I'm married to someone who thinks fighting is a necessary component to every conversation. Our relationship crumbles and explodes in front of our children on a daily basis, and the only option to end the fighting is to leave. That makes me want to die more and I'll easily clear a fifth of Makers trying to drown the pain. Weed doesn't do anything anymore but hurt my lungs.
I died three years ago in my sleep due to a heart complication but I was brought back to life. I was in a coma, but eventually made a full recovery.
Why couldn't they have just let me die then?
I make 100k a year and I can't afford rent here in the Bay Area, I'm literally a couple hundred dollars short and it's due tomorrow or I'm going to get another late fee.
I'm $40,000+ in debt.
My asthma is going to kill me but I refuse to stop eating excessively and smoking because it's the only thing that numbs anything, I'm borderline obese and I used to be in excellent health.
Neither of my parents give a shit, my mom admitted to not being a support system. Just tells me not to do it for my kids.
So I'm going to make it look like an accident. There's no other way. At least my kids can grow up thinking that it was just an accident and that I didn't abandon them. At least there's no questions about the life insurance policy paying out.
