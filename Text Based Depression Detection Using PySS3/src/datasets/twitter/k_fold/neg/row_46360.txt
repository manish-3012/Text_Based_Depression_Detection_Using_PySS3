just caught my fiance cheating. Again. We're less than four months away. I thought we were going to make it. I don't want to face the future anymore It's my fault for being stupid. But I really thought we were going to make it. Caught him texting people a few times, we went to therapy, life moved on. Decided to get away from Maryland and away from all the drama. Found out I have thyroid cancer. He was texting people while I was having surgery to have my thyroid removed. This whole time he's been telling me there's nothing to worry about, that he loves me, that he was focused on us and our relationship. The entire wedding is planned and paid for. Every surface of our apartment is covered in engagement photos, our initials, everything. He said he loved it. He said he loved me. I feel so disgusting and fat and filthy and alone. I really thought I had finally made it. I really thought I had a future and a life to look forward to. I have nothing. I am nothing. 

  I just don't want to feel so alone and worthless anymore and nothing is helping. I just want to be gone. If I had a way that I know would work I'd do it right now but the only pills I have are synthroid and tums. I'm only on the second floor. I just hurt so bad.
