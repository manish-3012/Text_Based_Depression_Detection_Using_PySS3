I actually tried it again.But this time I called a distress line and unfortunately they were able to trace the number from the night before (I used a landline just to talk the night before but a cell that night). I just called to hear someone before I died in all seriousness. She lied and told me she'd talk to her supervisor just to talk to me. 

Now I'm in a psych ward for like a billion years. I don't feel I need help. I mean if someone were to kill themselves I'd obviously give them reasons why not to so thats what they're doing. But this is ridiculous. You can't help someone who can't admit they need help.
