Casually wanting to dieAlready tried to killed myself, i failed. Like pretty much everything else i tried to do lmao. Everyday is just same sad shit, where i feel empty, sad, like i'm the biggest freak this earth as ever seen, like i don't deserve to be allowed to breath, and trust me i dont want to. I also i feel like everything i could say is just laughable. Basically i just failed at life. I want it to end. Judging by the many post i read here, i'm not alone, wich makes me also wonder, why us ? What did we do to deserve such shitty lives ? I must have been fucking hitler in a past life.
 I've been happy in my life, it did happen but it lasted like for a few hours to a few days ? People say that's what your supposed to life for. Those moments where you were happy. Well i disagree. If i have to constantly go trough this shithole that is being me just to be rewarded with "moments" of happyness i'd rather just die please. So many ways to die, while the Idea of being happy is just a fantasy. I know this post is gonna end up on some cringe subreddit, i guess thats life, that's how i am, a clown, idk what else i should say unless please make it stop ?
