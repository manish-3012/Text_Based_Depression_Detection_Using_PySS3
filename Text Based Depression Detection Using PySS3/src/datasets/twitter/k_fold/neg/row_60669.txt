I'm thinking about suicide for the first time and need helpWhat a year. I don't know where to start.

In January, my wife and I experienced a miscarriage. Halfway through the year, we experienced another miscarriage. Now, she is out of work, we are barely able to pay our mortgage and she wants to separate.

This year has taken everything and I have no one to talk to. If anyone at all wants to chat, I'd be so appreciative.
