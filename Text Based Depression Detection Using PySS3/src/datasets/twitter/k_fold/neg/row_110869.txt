Getting things off my chest.My life seems like this excruciating exercise in misery. I feel as though doubts of happiness are odd cosmic jokes, just to keep me in the game a little longer, keep me living. Because almost immediately the sources of that happiness turns on me. My friends mock me somehow, abandon me or just outright abuse me. It happens over and over again, it never stops. It got to the point where I decided not to leave the house, not worth it. I don't want the cruelty anymore.

Since I was a child I remember looking up at the ceiling hoping there was some merciful cosmic force listening and whispering, "please let me die, please." I was abused back then by my mother, a cold woman with large, black eyes that still haunt my existence, despite her passing. My dad, the last thing somewhat positive in my life lost his mind within the past year, hitting me once, saying he wants to set the house on fire and burn everything left inside, almost crashing a car to kill us both, planning to run away and abandon me, joking about buying me a suitcase on my 18th birthday, telling me to pretend he were dead once I'm older, so on so forth. So nothing to live for anymore.

I have so much more to say. I want people to understand finally, get the full scope of my suffering before I almost inevitably leave this planet to fall into astral oblivion. When you hear the full story it really does sound like I've been set up for failure, like i, myself, am a joke. But I don't want to bore whoever reads this to peices. Thank you for listening.
