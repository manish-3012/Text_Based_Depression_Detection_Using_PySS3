people around me are moving up in the world and iâ€™m constantly fucking upso im in my second to last year of high school (we have 13 grades in germany and iâ€™m in 12th). im 19 and i had to repeat a year due to surgery and other mental health issues. 

i grew up in a family where everyone was expected to do certain things. my dad is an architect, my mother is an artist, most of my cousins have studied medicine and my older brother is a psychologist. now all of my friends have completed high school and others are already at uni. 

i just feel like this dumb girl who hasnâ€™t achieved shit her whole life and wonâ€™t ever amount to anything. 

this school year has been going horribly. iâ€™ve missed 3.5 weeks of school now due to my mental health acting up. i might go to psych ward for the break but iâ€™m not sure yet. 

i tried hanging myself in the garden two days ago but  didnâ€™t go through with it. although it felt kinda good. 

negative thoughts are coming back in to my head today and i keep envisioning my death. i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s up with me. i just want to be happy and successful like everyone around me or dead...
