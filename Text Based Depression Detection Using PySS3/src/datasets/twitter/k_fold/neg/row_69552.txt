Anyone else feel like this?Sometimes i feel like i treat my depression as an old friend because it never leaves me and is always there. That was also the reason why I didn't tell my psychologist I wanted to kill myself for 3 years, and never told my parents anything even after they brought me to the mental hospital 4 years ago. Im kinda comforted by the thought that suicide is always an option and depression is always there for me like a safety net. Or maybe its the depression making me feel this way. 

I didn't think this was a problem until my psychologist brought it up last session which kinda compelled me to write this.
