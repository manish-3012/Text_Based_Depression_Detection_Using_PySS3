27 clubI'm about to turn 27 at the end of August, my suicidal thoughts and attempts started when I was 12. My attempts for suicide were always weak, because I'm afraid of pain. I've been physically abused and in several other situations with bodily pain, I hate it so much. I've survived a serious car accident, illness, an attempted murder in which my neck was snapped by a person I loved. I have no friends, I mean 0, I don't have a close relationship with my family and I have a history of being abused multiple ways by my mother. I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and PTSD from multiple things. Don't get me wrong, I love life, I love my mother, I don't have any hate in my heart. I think I could be useful to the world, use what I've learned from my pain. But I feel like I'm too late for my life. I'm starting from 0. I'm so deeply lonely. I have health conditions that make me very afraid of my body and things getting really bad, like cancer for example. My body was like a prison for so long because of my illness and I was bullied...where was this going again? I'm trying, I'm trying by typing this. I miss my pets that have died, I miss my grandpa, I miss K, I miss L, I don't want to live this life alone anymore. All I want is to help people and I can't even help myself. I already have a plan, but no time set. I hope whatever on the other side is beautiful and we feel no pain, I hope we all feel loved and completed if not in this life then the next. God forgive me, this life is a gift and I feel so bad to think of what I might do with it, I'm so sorry
