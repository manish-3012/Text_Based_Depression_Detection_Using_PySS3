Waking up is the hardest part of the dayThe moment I wake up, I am overwhelmed with dread and self-loathe. I just hate myself so much. I feel like I'm toxic to everyone around me just for being me. This means that if I wake up earlier than I should have, I won't be able to go back to sleep. Or I'll be late because I can't find the motivation to get up.

Last night, I confessed these feelings of self-loathe to a close friend and she just didn't understand why I hate myself so much when she thought I was amazing. She reminded me that so many people love me but I couldn't help but feel like I was undeserving of the love that she mentioned. At the back of my mind, I'm always thinking that if they knew this or that about me, then they wouldn't want to talk to me. I then asked my dad whether I was a difficult child growing up (because I've always felt guilty because I had a lot of temper tantrums) and he said no. My family does seem to love me genuinely despite all that. Sometimes I wish they hated me for all the shit I did.

Why? Why can't I love myself? Why don't I feel like I deserve to be here? Why are mornings so bad? Why can't I get up? Why do I think that I'm a self-absorbed idiot? I can't do this anymore. I want peace. Please give me peace.
