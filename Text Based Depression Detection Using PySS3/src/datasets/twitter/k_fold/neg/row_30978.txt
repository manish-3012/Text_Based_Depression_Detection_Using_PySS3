Life is fucked upHi. I'm new to all this. I have depression,cutting,suicidal. I'm thirteen. Turning fourteen in a couple months. I haven't seen me mum and siblings in two years. Me mum and oldest brother were abused by my stepfather. He almost hit me. I'm bullied. I don't really want to live anymore. I don't have anything to live for. The only person who understood me was me mum and my grandfather who passed away a year ago. I don't know what to do anymore.
