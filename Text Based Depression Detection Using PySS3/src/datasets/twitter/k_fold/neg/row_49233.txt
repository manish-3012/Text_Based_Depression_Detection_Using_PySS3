The stress is too muchI have never posted something like this before or really told anybody Iâ€™ve wanted to end my shit show of a life. I have a beautiful girlfriend, a dog, and a good life but everything is just so god damn stressful to me and work is making me want to swallow every last one of my anti anxiety, depressant medication in my bedside table. Idk I tried killing myself my freshman year of high school and I almost did it and have thought about it almost everyday. I literally just canâ€™t take this stress anymore medication doesnâ€™t work itâ€™s too fucking much. I have a loving family so if I did it, it would destroy them so thatâ€™s my one reason not to. If I hadnâ€™t had my loving girlfriend and dog I would of done it a year ago no question. Idk sorry Iâ€™m blabbering I just need to write it out to someone.
