Hey, I donâ€™t know how this sub works but Iâ€™m in a hurry. My friend from a different city just put something cryptic and suicidal on Instagram. Heâ€™s not the kind of guy who would do this for attention, not that anyone really does, but heâ€™s not like that. Is there a number I should call? Is 911 an option?
