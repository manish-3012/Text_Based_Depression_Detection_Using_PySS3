The loneliness is killing meAbout an hour ago I got up to go shower, I didnâ€™t realize how bad it was until I feel on the floor crying and sobbing. Everyone is so busy or having a good time without me. I feel like someone I choking me and pushing me into the floor and I canâ€™t get up. When I feel like I might be able to do something basic like eating or going to the bathroom I just break down again.

This week I went through a breakup. Even writing that word it doesnâ€™t feel right. It was the only person keeping me alive these past two years and now without him Iâ€™m alone again, whatâ€™s worse is my family and friends had no clue how bad Iâ€™ve been these months so theyâ€™re unprepared when I come to them and ignore me or give me crap advice like â€œexercise or take a break and relaxâ€. No one picks up their phone or texts back, if they do they sigh in annoyance and give an excuse to hang up quickly.

Today is maybe the last day for me. I donâ€™t see myself past this week and every time I get to this point it feels less and less like Iâ€™ll come out alive. Part of me wanted to try getting help but it looks so difficult I might just give up if this pain doesnâ€™t stop. Iâ€™m gonna do it.
