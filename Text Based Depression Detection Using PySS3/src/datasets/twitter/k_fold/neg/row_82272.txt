I just donâ€™t get itWhat have I done wrong to lock myself in such a constant loop of degradation? I donâ€™t know if I deserve to feel like this or not. I can only guess the answer is yes. It seems unfair, but complaining wonâ€™t do anything. I just wish I knew where I went wrong. I think about suicide almost constantly, and the things I once found enjoyable do nothing for me. I feel the same all the time. Just nothingness.
