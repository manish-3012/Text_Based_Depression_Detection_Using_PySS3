life is absolutely repugnant.well....this is definitely a new thing for me to be doing. where do i even start...damn
well, i guess iâ€™ll say my name. my first name, not my last or middle. actually, my nickname. call me brain. my dad called me that...heâ€™s gone now. my mother is a bitch with an authoritarian parenting style like the rest of my family. iâ€™ve been bruised, cut, reduced to tears and almost killed by most of my immediate family. a lot of my friends are depressed, suffer from anxiety, have family issues, get into toxic and abusive relationships, or all of the above. my girlfriend suffers from anxiety, depression, and a few more things, and only recently has she stopped pushing me away...my grades in high school are pitiful, my social life is dying out, my friends are leaving me, and i feel useless and hopeless. i wanna fucking end my pain, to cut my arms and stab and mangle myself beyond recognition, to OD or shoot myself, i donâ€™t know anymore. i know i have to keep fighting my past and present, for my girlfriend and our future, but it feels like the world is crushing my heart and mind...idk what to do or who to turn to or whether or not i should give it all up and just embrace death..
