Another Chrustmas and Birthday aloneMy family is pretty much just me my mum and my brother, however I moved out at 17 due to the chaotic home life we had. My brother has schizophrenia and a few months ago he stabbed someone during an episode, they are fine but he is in jail awaiting trial in NSW where my mum and borther have been living, I live in QLD so I wouldn't be able to visit even if I wanted to.  I am turning 22 tomorrow, on boxing day. I'm alone again for christmas and my birthday and this time my brother is sitting in a jail cell, poorly medicated and constantly in psychosis, while I walllow in my own self pitty. I hate myself for feeling bad about my own situation. I almost always have a shitty christmas and birthday, last year I was homeless for christmas and birthday after my first break up with my ex of 3 years.  I thought this year might be better but life has been kicking me back down year after year. Now I'm just sitting in my room thinking about dying and ending my miserable existance.
