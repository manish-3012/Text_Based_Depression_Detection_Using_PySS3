Reasons to live?Sorry this is stereo typical but the only reason I'm really hanging on to anything anymore is a promise I made to a dear friend that I wouldn't give up. He is has left me behind, and I'm stuck under the belief that he would be okay with me breaking my promise with the hell I'm in. My parents are verbally abusive, and wont let me see or talk to my significant other they absolutely hate, despite that he treats me wonderfully, even when I treat him badly. He, and my friends have been there when I was crying my eyes out and being bullied or hurt by schoolmates or my family. They don't trust me enough to even let me go see my friends out of suspicion that I'll be doing something horrible, because I hid that I was dating my s.o. and I cant stay at school longer then necessary (they have cameras, so they know when I get home.) 
I can only do home work, maybe read or watch tv, and go to sleep. I can't see this getting any better from here, I know I have it so much better than a lot of people but my parents remind me everyday was a terrible ungrateful waste of resources I am. It would save everyone  pain and money if I somehow disappeared, and I really don't see a purpose in any continuting day.
