I'm not suicidal, I'm being murdered slowlySuicide is the closest concept most people have to the way I am being murdered. I'd go to the police but they wouldn't take me seriously. Some police officers are among the people murdering me. If you want to support me, then stop them from murdering me. That is the only way. If you comment you will be participating in my murder.
