My attempt at a simple nearly-universal meaning to life.I had an epiphany today. After months of trying to find purpose to life and find a meaning to my life it suddenly hit me. You see, as soon as we understand the concept of death as human beings, a sub-concious decision is made for us to choose life over death. Simple evidence for this is that you are currently reading this when you could instead be ending your life. You have an open decision but you will have a natural bias to side towards life. The key to finding a meaning to life is to make a concious decision on this question of life and death. Indeed, you could easily choose either and this does not necessarily mean life or death in a physical form but rather a state of mind. For example, you may choose death and still be alive but be completely obssessed with the idea of suicide. However, when you realize your sub-concious decision to live, it seems natural to choose life over death. Futhermore, once you make this choice conciously, that is all the purpose you need in life. Indeed, you may ask yourself "why do I live?" and you will realize that you simply live to fullfill your concious decision to pick life over death. Hence, whenever you seem to be straying off the path of "life", I suggest to always reconsider your sub-concious decision to live and to align your conciousness along with it. This may seem like an overly simplified version at my attempt of giving meaning to my life but I hope this idea may help a few of you reading this. TL;DR You have already made the decision to live sub-conciously, hence this should provide enough of a reason to choose life in a concious state of mind.
