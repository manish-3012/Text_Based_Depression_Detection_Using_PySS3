It's just so loud.Hi, I just need to get these feelings off of my chest. 

I'm so tired of this. It is taking everything for me to just type these words. But the only option other than doing this is lying down with the thoughts swarming around my head.

I'm past the point of caring. I don't want to care for anyone, or anything. Everything just seems so pointless. The thought of dying is bringing me so much comfort at the moment. I just can't stop thinking about slipping away, knowing that this is the end.

All I feel like is a burden. I feel so hated. A friend offered to let me live with them so I could finish college when my family were moving away, but now I feel so unwanted here. I am just fed up of all this shit. 

Right now it feels like my only real friend is the thought of dying. I'm self harming again. 

The only reason I am still alive is my family. I love them so much, but I rarely see them (and rarely can because I am jobless and poor). But these feelings are so loud in my head, and they are stronger than love.

I am not in immediate danger, but I'm getting pretty damn close.
