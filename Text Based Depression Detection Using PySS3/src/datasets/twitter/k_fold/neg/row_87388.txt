No worth as a human beingI'm almost 25 and I've never been in a relationship. I have an ileostomy because of ulcerative colitis. I haven't had a real job. I tried to do an apprenticeship, but just like college, I didn't complete it.
 I weigh 43kg, don't gain weight or muscle mass.

I've tried to kms 3 times. First attempt was by overdosing. Second was not eating or drinking until I ended up in a hospital. Third was hanging, but I was "saved" by my family.

I don't want help. I feel like I'm in a hole. I want to make this hole my home. I've tried to climb out of it countless times, but I either fall back down halfway, or jump back in willingly.

I feel just as scared to live as much as I fear death.

I've written this kind of post before and deleted thembefore posting, but right now I feel like I'm drowning in my thoughts.

I've seeked help in the past, but it made me feel more worthless.
