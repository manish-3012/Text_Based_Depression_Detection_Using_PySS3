My Girlfriend wants to kill herself and I do not know what to doMy girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years and a few months. My girlfriend lives a pretty nice life in my opinion. She has caring parents, her parents make plenty of money, she gets everything she wants, she has never had to worry about anything in her life but yet every few weeks she texts or calls me saying she doesn't want to be here anymore. She says she feels worthless and thinks the world will be better off without her. She says that she will never commit suicide because she doesn't have the strength too. She once told me if she saw a semi or a car coming straight at her she doesn't think she would move. Comments like that almost sends me in tears. I have tried everything I can think of like talking to her about it, telling her im here for her, telling her that things will get better and that she isnt worthless and that everybody has a purpose and yours is teaching kids. (She is a day care teacher) it has been like this for about a year and a half and im out of options
