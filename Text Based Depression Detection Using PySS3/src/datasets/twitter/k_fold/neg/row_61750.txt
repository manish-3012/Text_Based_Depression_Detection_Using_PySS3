I just don't think I can keep living this miserably.I come from a very abusive family. My parents have done a lot that's really fucked up the ways that I think about myself...I constantly feel like I have no control over my life. It's like everything I see reminds me of some past trauma. It seems like all the help online is "all situations change" but I don't think my mental state will ever change. It's just becoming too much to cope with. I just feel like I'm done living and I don't want to have to deal with all of these bad thoughts inside my head any longer.

The only reasons I haven't killed myself yet is because I have a boyfriend who is the nicest, sweetest guy on the planet, and I love him so much, and I'm worried that if I kill myself he'll kill himself too. My parents, who are manipulative and narcissistic and believe they can do no wrong, will NEVER blame themselves, and they'll probably blame my boyfriends and my friends and make them feel responsible. But another part of me knows that my friends will protect my boyfriend and that all of them will know my parents are responsible...

I just feel like I never have any freedom or any chance to make choices about my life, and this would finally be my escape from all of this.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. Honestly posting this and talking about how I was feeling with some people close to me really helped me feel better. I'm feeling much better today thanks to all of you wonderful people. I hope you all have a great day, and I hope anyone reading this who felt like I did yesterday feels better too. â¤ï¸
