Does the pysch ward help?The thoughts been bad since june 18. My drunk fiance left me for alcohol but boy did he chase me. It hurt so bad I live in my head. I have been raped,  used, bullied as a kid, and lost my sister to suicide at 7 due to draino.

      I'm in florida I tried to run away from people up north I'm afraid of and the distance helps but I'm all alone. I'm not a florida resident yet so I would be in some state run ward I have ptsd, depression, and anxiety I dont want to shower, I cry, and I'm in a domestic violence shelter when I touched down in florida I was crying and an asshole tried to console me he played the Christian card and at the time my spirituality was getting me through. He didn't understand platonic and ended up being a sociopath and tried to kill me he was just released on 7 mths time served two nights ago. A state of fear again.

        The dv shelter sucks it's too depressing for me I want to pack it up and do this on my own. Have a car. Have gym membership. I'm on effexor    valium, and prazosin I know doctors are quick to pull benzos. I do want to die.....do hospitals help I been doing this on my own my whole life. My parents are emotionally checked out and elderly 35 year female try to stay positive as anything can change in a New York minute.
