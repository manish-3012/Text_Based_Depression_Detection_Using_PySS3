How often do I have to be told, "I don't understand you," before I get that I'm not supposed to live?My own mother says this. **Constantly**. I imagine just about every single person in my life tells me this.

I am a perpetual strain on her and those around me. Fortunately, that has never been many people, so the misery I cause is fairly limited (I suspect because people can sense just what a vile thing I am from a mile out). But it is there, and it seems only right to put an end to that.

If I cannot even form an understanding with others, then what difference does it make if I'm alive or dead? And since this causes me so much frustration and grief, why indeed wouldn't I just end it?

It is not possible to love what you do not understand.
