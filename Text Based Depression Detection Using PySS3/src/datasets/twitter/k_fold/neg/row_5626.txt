I didn't commit suicideThis is a little update from my post of a few weeks back.

In the end, I didn't kill myself.

I planned everything out and I wanted to kill myself on the 10th of August, a month after the death of my friend Eli.
That day at 2 AM I woke up and went to the bathroom with a knife and stayed there for a good hour looking at myself in the mirror.

I don't know what happened but I started thinking about my family and I forgot everything for a few minutes. I was free for a few moments and that gave me hope for a future. 

Now, I'm happy to say that it's been a week and I'm not that obsessed anymore about what happened. I still have nightmares and thought about her, but not as toxic as they were.
Hopefully, it will continue, and I'll be able to free myself from depression. 

I'm now looking to reconnect with people I knew from high school and I'm ready to start a new chapter of my life. 

Thanks to everyone that tried to comfort me during that bad time, even if it didn't help per se, I really appreciated it.
