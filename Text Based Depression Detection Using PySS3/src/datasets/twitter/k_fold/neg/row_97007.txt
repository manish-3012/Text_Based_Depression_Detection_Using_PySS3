Attempted suicide a couple weeks ago. I think I'm just going to be another statistic.
I really don't think I'm going to survive the year. 

I took a bottle of Oxy on the 24th of August and went to bed fully expecting to not wake up. But I woke up the next morning and dressed myself and went to my 8:30 class. Like nothing was off. Like I didn't just try to die. 

I've reached out to friends but honestly I'm getting to the point where I know I'm annoying them. I know I'm crying wolf too much. Who the fuck would want to be around someone who cries so much? 

If they knew how fucked up I am they wouldn't want to be my friend. Maybe that's why when I try to talk about it they always get weirded out. I'm rotten and nobody wants to smell it. 

I'm trying. I really am. I came out as being transgender back in February, and I lost 45 pounds by consistent diet and lifting. I look like a new person. I feel a lot different than I was at the beginning of last year, but this fucking hopelessness is still there. 

This feeling of being completely fucking wrong is still in me. I can't get through a day without it barking at me. 

I finished my workout today and it hit me right when I got in my car. I had a full-fledged panic attack right after a workout. Yup. Cried/hyperventilated the whole drive home. 

Now my post-workout endorphins aren't even helping. I literally have nothing left to do and I'm really afraid that I'm going to end up being that one that FINALLY did it. 

My best friend said he thinks suicide is cowardly and I was thinking on this earlier, but there always HAS to be a coward, right? What if I am that one dude that does it? 

What if I can't escape it? 

I'm reaching out to you, Reddit, because I really can't take it anymore and my reasons for living are dwindling.
