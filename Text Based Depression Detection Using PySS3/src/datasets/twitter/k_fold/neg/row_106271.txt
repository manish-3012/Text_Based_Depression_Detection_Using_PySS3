I think I'm finally done.I've wanted to die for a really long time. It started when I was 7 and I first tried to hang myself to get away from the abusive and violent home I was in. Since then I've gone between finding reasons to stay alive and failing at suicide but this time I think I'm finally done. I was living for the hope that my life would get better. I was working at it. Applying for jobs and trying to set up a good future for myself. It was all kicked off about 1 year and 2 months ago. New girlfriend. She actually planned a life with me and it's been rocky at times but it was going good for the most part. She finally said fuck you I've had enough of your shit. Which is honestly a really bad time to do that. Every job I've gone for has rejected me. Nobody wants me. It could be that I'm 17 and haven't had a job ever because I was too busy checking in and out of hospitals. Or it could be the collective scars on my wrists. Either way it doesnt really matter. I've learned I've got no place in this world. Nobody wants me. They never did. I knew that at a young age because nobody saved me from the fucked up shit that was happening on a daily basis. The principal of my elementary school came to my house and looked my mom and step dad in the eye and told them I was a bad kid but he couldn't see how fucked up they were. Couldn't see what was happening to me. People always tell me no one will save you, you have to save yourself and this is me saving myself. I'm gonna take my sleeping meds. Make sure I take more than recommended and then find somewhere outside to hang myself. I'll try to adjust it so it'll break my neck instead of strangling me. But even if that doesn't work we are supposed to hit below freezing temps tonight so I'll freeze to death out where no one will find me for awhile. I'm sorry I just needed to get all this off my chest before I died.
