Need advice for what to do nextHey guys. I figured I'd give this a shot since I don't really know what to do. I've struggled with depression at varying degrees for 6-7 years now (I'm 22). I thought at some point as I got older it would be something I'd grow out of, but I haven't. I still hate myself and I still think about killing myself. 

In the past year it has gone from once a month to once a day where I have a thought about doing it. The problem is, I know I shouldn't. I don't want to. I don't want to die or to end my life. I don't want to be depressed and I don't want to feel this way. 

I'm not really worried I will kill myself, at least not tonight or something like that. I'm worried that I am broken. I can't stop hating myself and I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I don't know what to do. 

I am getting details about a therapist/psychiatrist that I could see. My parents think this is a problem in the past and if I used my family's health insurance I think they would know. I don't want them to but I don't know how much this kind of stuff costs. 

Could a college student afford therapy and potentially anti depressants?

I don't know what to do and I have no one to ask for help from. Any comments or advice would be great. Thanks in advance.
