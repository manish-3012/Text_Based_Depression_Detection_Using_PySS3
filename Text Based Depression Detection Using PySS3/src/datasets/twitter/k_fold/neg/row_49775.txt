I will be free this weekend.I don't know why I'm even bothering to post on here, but I don't have anyone else to open up to so here I am, I guess. I've been depressed for 7 years now, and this past year has been the worst. 

I've never really liked who I was as a person, I'm fat, ugly, untalented, socially awkward, incapable of getting a girlfriend...the list just goes on. I tend to stick to hobbies/things that I feel like I'm good at, but I tend to shift away from them after not too long cuz I just realize that I'm completely shit at everything. I just can't do anything right. The only thing I'm good at is school at this point, and I'm losing passion for the very major that made me go to school. I'm in a great school (top 10 in the world for my field of engineering) and have a good gpa, but I feel like I've given up everything to get there. And I'm realizing that I'm really not that smart...i'm just good at school. And not only that, but being the socially awkward fuck that I am, I can't really get back into being social. I'm a horrible mess, and I hate being me.

This past year has been rough because I lost my best friend. Long story short, I ruined the friendship, and she's moved on. I still open her snapchat stories, crying and reminiscing about how things once where. She was the only one I've ever opened up to. We were best friends for 6 years...and she's gone. I don't know how to live like this.

Sorry if this is getting long...I'm just miserable. I'm going to blow my brains out with a shotgun this weekend, same way my father died years ago. I'm empty and dead inside and I miss my bestfriend. I'm sorry, Sara. I know I promised you that I would never do this, but I can't. Please forgive me..
