Iâ€™m not allowed to see my girlfriend and now that school is canceled probably for the rest of the year, I feel like Iâ€™m dying inside.Hey, so I (17f) am not allowed to see my gf (16f) because my mother found our text messages and figured out we were seeing each other. She made a deal with me that if i broke up with her and had no contact with her (no texting, phone calls, hanging out, or seeing each other at school besides a short time at lunch) then we could be together in a year. Sheâ€™s a huge part of my life and I cry every single night. I want to die to end the heartbreak of this horrible situation Iâ€™m in.  Iâ€™ve reached the 6 month milestone of this horrible year and I donâ€™t want to go on any further. I feel like Iâ€™m going crazy without being able to even ask her how her day is. I canâ€™t even imagine going on like this for months. So I guess this is an please help me call. Please if anyone has any ideas how to convince my mother that whatâ€™s sheâ€™s doing is wrong. It might really help me out.
