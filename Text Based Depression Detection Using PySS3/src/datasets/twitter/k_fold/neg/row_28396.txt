I'm suffering from depression and anxiety for years, had suicidal thoughts in the past, harming myself, I got better for a while but after my break up I start having the same thoughts and I am afraid for myself. I don't want to die but the feelings and my thoughts are unbearable... I'm so afraidI also have problems expressing myself, so I keep everything hidden inside me, and it kills me not be able to talk, but it's so difficult, I don't feel connected with other people, and consolation doesn't help at all. I want my boyfriend back but it's very unlikely. I don't want to die, but I don;t have the strength to carry on..
