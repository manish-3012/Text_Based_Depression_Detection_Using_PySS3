I'm suffering every single day and nobody even takes me seriouslyI just want to end my life to show them all 

Of course that's barely even one of the main reasons I want to die, but it'd feel pretty damn good knowing I'd finally be taken seriously if I do it 

Everybody seems to argue that if I end my life I'd end up hurting other the people who "care" about me, but I WANT to hurt them in that way, those assholes fucking deserve it
