I can't believe I"m even posting hereBut I don't know what to do anymore. I'm 22, I've done _nothing_ with my life, and I have no motivation to do anything in the future. No job, haven't finished my associates' degree yet, never had a real relationship, only a few friends. I have nothing, I'm just a drain on everybody else. and all that bullshit about "go out there and do something, decide to take life into your own hands" doesn't do jack shit because I can barely work up the energy to leave the goddamn house. I'm always tired, always depressed, constantly anxious. I'm medicated, but my meds don't do jack shit for me anymore and I can't get to a psych until November because of stupid insurance bullshit. I don't know if I can make it that long.

I don't even know if I'm suicidal, I don't think I could kill myself, I just wish I didn't have to wake up into this existence every morning. I don't even remember what happiness feels like anymore, it's been so goddamn long since I've felt genuine total happiness. It's always ruined by anxiety or loneliness or fucking anything can set it off. I'm getting worse every day and I don't know what to do fuck. I've genuinely thought that it would be better to get myself into a mental institution, just so I could be focused on fixing my fucked-up brain all the time instead of thinking about other shit.

I just want to live a life, I want to be able to look forward to something, to be proud of something god dammit. My little sister is _ahead of me in college_ because I couldn't even do that right. I don't have any good memories about being young, I never went out and made them. I have scars on my arm that will always be there to remind me. I'm fat and gross and honestly it's a good day if I manage to drag my ass into the shower. 

I just hate this. I hate myself for letting my life be like this, I used to have dreams and shit but I can't even imagine a future where things are better. I know my parents have to be pissed off at me, but I can't work up the motivation to move forward in life.

I'm just rambling now. I need to sleep. I need help, like serious help. I don't know what I"m going to do if I have to wait until november.
