I donâ€™t think I have ever really been happy. (A bunch of crazy rambling$I am only young but I cant remember a time where I havenâ€™t wanted to die or atleast wondered why I was alive or for what reason. When I talk to my friends seriously about how I feel they donâ€™t care or take what I am saying seriously because I am that guy who is cynical, dry and sarcastic. I donâ€™t fit in, People donâ€™t like me, I fail most of my classes yet I am called smart by everyone, I have never done anything with a girl, A girl has never found me attractive, I cant get a job, I am ugly, I cant talk properly, I am fat, I dont want kids, I see life as a waste if time, people find me to be an annoying negative nancy that sometimes makes a funny joke... the list of reasons I hate myself go on. Yet I canâ€™t name one reason I like myself. Not one reason to live, multiple on why I should die. My mum loves me and so do my few friends but I donâ€™t really care what they think or feel about me, itâ€™s what goes on in my head that fucks with me. 

Everyday just living for the sake of it why? idk because I am alive I ask myself. I have no purpose and even when I eventually get one why does it even matter? Thats right it doesnâ€™t, I donâ€™t matter in any way at all I am just another human in the cog that is an economy, thats all humans are, just cog that keeps money flowing, the economy going, really what else are we in todays western society? 
Got to school -18 years, go to collage/uni -4 years, get a job -10 years, get married and have children -18 years, keep working -30 years, retire die within 5 years. Thats it. Thats the average life, work to make money to contribute to the economy have children so they do the same thing once you finally have earned enough money to retire youâ€™re old and cant do anything really. I just dont get it. Some people dont even have the privilege to experience a life that shit, theirs is much worse than that. Idefk what I am doing anymore why why why is what goes through my head every fucking day I just want it to end I just want to sleep forever or be an emotionless robot so I have a logical fact based programmed purpose.
