getting help.Accepting help was probably the hardest thing ever for me. I felt like something was wrong with me. Obviously there was, but I guess I didn't want to accept the fact that I needed help. I started seeing a psychologist since December. I've had two sessions already.  My next session won't be until mid January. I've been dealing with anxiety problems since junior year and I just started getting help now. The smallest shit bothers me and I wanna start cutting myself again. I could be perfectly fine one moment, then bawling my eyes out the next. I don't know what to do anymore.
