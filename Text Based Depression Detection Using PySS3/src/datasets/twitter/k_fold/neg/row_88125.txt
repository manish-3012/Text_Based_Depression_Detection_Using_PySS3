My own self hatred is hurting those around meThis has been a recurring issue in my life over the past year. As Iâ€™ve grown more depressed and sad with myself, Iâ€™ve lost the capacity to give others the treatment they deserve. That of course leads to more people being agitated with me which leads to me becoming even more depressed, which makes the cycle worse. I have become so grossed out with myself that I canâ€™t even jerk off anymore. Iâ€™ve tried multiple times in the past week but it just leads to me feeling sick and disgusted in myself. I donâ€™t honestly think that Iâ€™ll commit suicide, but the thought has become rather prevalent in the back of my mind. Itâ€™s kind of as if itâ€™s always there, waiting for me to do something wrong, at which point it just becomes louder and louder until it drowns out everything else. It typically goes away pretty quickly after I have an incident like this, but fuck. I cannot handle hurting those close to me just because I donâ€™t like myself. What the fuck can even be done about that? In order to stop hurting others, I have to stop hating myself, but itâ€™s hard to hate myself when all I can do is hurt others.
