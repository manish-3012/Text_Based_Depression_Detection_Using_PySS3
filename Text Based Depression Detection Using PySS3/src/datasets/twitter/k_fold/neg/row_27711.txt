Stared at a blank screen for quite some time.Stared at a blank screen for a while trying to figure out what to say. Decided to maybe try to help someone else and saw an interesting post that I replied to. Someone conducting a study about quality of life after a failed suicide attempt. I responded and realized that what I wrote there was exactly what I wanted to say. So here we go. 
 
28, male, two suicide attempts one that landed me in the hospital for 6.5 months with a series of ECT treatments. 

Quality of life is absolute garbage. Not a minute passes that the thought of taking my own life doesn't pass through my mind. I dream about it. I've developed auditory and some visual hallucinations. My family is obsessed with self image, having a suicidal son is shameful to them, haven't spoken to my father in a few years. My mom might text me every several months. Haven't seen or spoken to my brother in about 5 years. Now that I have actually attempted suicide, and people know I am capable of it, any time I say anything remotely depressing people freak out and call the police. Who put me in cuffs, take me to a VA hospital, and I have to spend 3 days there before they let me out. Now that I have a dog I can't risk getting carted away for a few days. Who will feed her? No family. No friends. And an innate fear of therapists now that I've had 3 separate therapists call cops on me for fear I would kill myself. So, now I isolate myself. Barricade my doors at night. Sleep fully armed, always ready for someone to take me away because I "might be" a risk to myself. I was raised Christian, even though I don't necessarily follow that religion anymore I still have a huge sense of dread and terror thinking about Hell. So most days is a constant tennis match with myself, in my head, on wether or not biblical Hell is worth the risk of suicide. With no one to talk to. Only thing that stays my ever ready hand is the thought of eternal torture.
