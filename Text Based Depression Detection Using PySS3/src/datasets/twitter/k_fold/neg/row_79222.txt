Don't want to be here anymore but too afraid to die?I can't take any of this anymore.

I have no one. I have nothing to look forward to. I've fucked up everything.

But I'm too scared to even attempt suicide again, not only am I afraid to fail but I'm also afraid to succeed.

I just want this pain to end but I'm too much of a coward.
