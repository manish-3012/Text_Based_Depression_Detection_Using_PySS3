Im a loser, a failure, and have nothing to look forward to, i dont see the point in living anymore.I've honestly felt like I shouldn't be alive for the last 5 years of my life (I'm a 22 yo male, almost 23). I was a baseball player in high school and always felt like an outcast because everyone I knew was always going ot parties, hooking up with girls, incredibly hot girls, getting drunk and seemed to be having it all. That was never my scene and my friday nights were spent going to the movie theatre by myself while everyone was at a party or a football game, or staying up all night playing video games. That is when I felt something was wrong with me.

 I made it through fine had a couple good friends and ended up ditching the university I wanted to go to for the school that offered me to play baseball for them. Well it was the same old stuff, eveyone did the same thing and it just wasn't my crowd but I had some friends still. It all changed when I had career ending surgery and I couldn't play anymore, I know sports isnt everything but thats when I completely shut myself off. I didn't see anyone, locked myself in my room and played video games, watched anime, and did nothing but smoke massive amounts of weed.

I was a straight A student before this and had a 3.9 gpa after 2 full years of school. After I cut myself off that semeter I had to drop every single class but I sought help after this, everything was fine the next semester, I caught up with a couple old friends, got a girlfriend and had all A's again. Well I still felt like something was wrong and the next semester I got even worse, I was now old enough to buy my own alcohol and I developed a horrible drinking problem, where I seriously got blackout drunk every single night for the last two years and would smoke after this because just smoking wasnt doing it for me. Me and my gf fought all the time, mostly because of my horrible addictions and once again I was failing at school, but hard. I failed every single class except for one  D, came back again and failed every thing again but dropped all my classes to keep that from happening.

Which brings me to the last fall smester and the last 3 months. I lived in my own apt by myself with only my dog. I tried to kill myself multiple times. I've cut myself, I tried to overdose on pills, and even tried to hang myself, the only reason I've failed because every time I try my dog just looks at me with his sweet face and I know I can't abandon him, he's everything I have, and I'm all he has too. If it wasn't for him Id have been dead a long time ago.

Well I couldnt afford to go to school anymore, I dropped out, had to move in with my parents and cant get a job anywhere, I lost my car, and havent seen a friend in years, and mostly because I dont have any. My parents think Im a failure and even though they dont say those exact words, they tell me it everyday, we fight constantly and I've cut myself again to no avail(Im too much of a pussy because it hurts a lot) and now my dog has a home with my parents and its getting easier and easier to let it happen. I want to park a car in our garage and just go out peacefully, but Im not trusted with keys because of my addiction problems, I'm a college dropout with no prospects and no hope of going back and I know the rest of my life I'm going to have to scratch and claw just to make it paycheck to paycheck. I don't see any reason in living and dont see anything to look forward to. Can someone help me? Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? 

TL;DR Title says it all, sorry for the EXTREMELY LONG POST, just figured you should know how hopeless I am before I hear everythings going to be alright.
