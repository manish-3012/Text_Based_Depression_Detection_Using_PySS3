Hello r/suicidewatchI'm going to cut to the chase here and ask you to tell me, what is the point of serving a society that is doomed to fail? What is the point of fighting for your life if it's just going to end some other day? What is the poi t of doing any thing if it's all just in vain? What point is there to fight for ANYTHING? Tell me that instead of telling me I have to much to live for.
