My obituaryI'm killing myself. That's nothing new for this subreddit.

I'm not going to commit suicide though. That would be way too hard on the people I love, not to mention they'd be stuck with a bunch of debt that isn't their fault (I'm not in debt, I'm just talking about the mortgage).
So, I've decided to kill myself slowly. Took up smoking a few years ago and have stopped any worthwhile sort of physical activity. My job has me on my ass 8 hours a day and I stuff myself with all the unhealthy foods I can find.


It's working, I can already feel my heart beating irregularly. Within a few years at most it's going to simply stop.
And that'll be that, my descendants will be taken care of, and no one will have to feel guilty for something I did. Dead of natural causes.


If I'm lucky I might have an accident before that happens.
I'm just posting this here because no one else in this world cares, not even me. I'm somewhat hoping that it'll jug my emotions somehow, but I doubt it. They've been gone &amp; deadened for years. I can't keep that charade up for much longer.

So, in closing, I'm not asking for sympathy and definitely not for anyone to take any actions, as that would be quite counterproductive. I just wanted to get these last few sentences off my chest, out of my heart, and gone forever.
