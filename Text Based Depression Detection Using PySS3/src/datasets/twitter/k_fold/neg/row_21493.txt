I can't live in a world that has so much painI want to end my life because of how bad this world is.

I can't handle how much lack of empathy humans have and how much suffering is in this world. I express my discontent with other people, but they say I am just focusing on the negative. They say it's just because I have missed out on good experiences, but they don't realize they also have a biased view because they have lived a better life.

I'm not selfish for feeling this way, I just have a lot of empathy. I hate how capitalism discriminates against disabled people and that brutality against human beings is normal. I hate how we can ignore so much suffering in this world.

I want to end my life because I don't believe that this world can be helped and I don't want to stay around to view anymore suffering. I deeply believe that no matter how hard I try, my actions could never help this world enough to continue on in it.
