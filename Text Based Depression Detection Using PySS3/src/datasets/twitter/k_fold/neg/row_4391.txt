Enjoy the small things.Okay, so I think we all need a break from the depressing stories that only end up everyone feel worse. So here it goes.




If you're ever thinking about commiting suicide or harming yourself in any way, here are some things to help.

1) The 24 hour rule. When you're thinking about ending your life just make yourself wait a day (or even two or three if you want) and see if you still feel like ending it all.



2) Talk to someone. I know that *everyone* tells you to get help or talk to a therapist, but it does help. They wont magically make you feel happy, but with a little work on your part you will feel better. 



3) Listen to music. Make sure it's not too depressing, but also not too cheerful. my favorite song to listen to when I start thinking about suicide is Misguided Ghosts by Paramore. Find the song(s) that 
make(s) you feel better.



4) Enjoy the small things. Think of all the little things you would miss about life. Write down all the stuff you would miss **no matter how small** and keep adding to the list every night as you think of stuff. Sometimes it's hard to be optimistic and think about things you would miss about life, but even then you can read what you wrote before and remind yourself . Here are some of the small things that I enjoy:

* When I try to go on the Depression subreddit and I accidentally type in derpression. That always makes me smile.
* (for Americans) The fourth of July, I love how blowing stuff up gets everyone together. 
* Grammar Nazis. Most people hate them but I think it's hilarious when people get butthurt over someone correcting their grammar.
* Drama. While I hate drama, I love all the ridiculous reasons people will come up with to be mad about.
* B movies on SyFy and Chiller. I love those really cheesy movies like **Mantis** or **Kingdom of the Spiders**.
* I love people's reactions when they find out that my favorite movies are **Nosferatu**, **Jeepers creepers**, and **The Mist**.




so there you go, I know a lot of the stuff is really generic advice but it really does help. And If you want, post some of the little things that make you feel better in the comments :)
