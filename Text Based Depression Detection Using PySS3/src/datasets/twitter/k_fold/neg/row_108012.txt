OverloadAnd you know it's honest when the thought of it resides inside of you with comfort. A wholeness sort of chill regulates my entire nervous system when I imgaine what you'd think is the darkest scenario to admit my own mortal existance into the next beyond. Would it be escape or could it just relief the headaches? No human should store the amount of emotion i have stored and will continue to store. Happy or sad I'll put it away.
