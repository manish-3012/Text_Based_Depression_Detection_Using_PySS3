I feel like I have nowhere to turn, and only one thing makes me genuinely happy now.Last year, I met a boy, Gio, he's really sweet and nice, he's really optimistic, he listens to me, lets me speak my mind and vent. I am so lucky to have him. But even with him at my side, I just don't know how to tell him how I truly feel, that I would off myself in a heartbeat, that it would need no second thought. That I wouldn't be able to hold myself back. And mostly that... That I feel so lost, so alone, I'm scared, sad, but most of all, I'm alone. I'm so tired of acting like I'm happy, it's just a distraction, because in the end I go back to where I started. I feel like I'm stuck in a corner, I don't know what to do about it. I think the only thing keeping me here is this really cute boy, his name is Cole. He's really tall, nice, sweet, he's essentially my dream boy. But I'm such an antisocial fuck-up that I can't even say "hi" to him. I've never had the best record of making friends, and I have few of them. He's the boy you aim for a romantic relationship with, but could totally see as a friend. I just can't push myself to greet him. I'm always scared I'll fuck it up, in fact, I am such a fucking moron I accidentally smashed a tennis racket into his twin brothers hand, and i wasn't able to look at either of them. I've always made myself look like an idiot so he would laugh, whether it be at me or with me, his smile is worth a billion lives, it's pure, and it makes me so happy to know I cause it to happen. Even reading this back makes all the sadness from my previous words burn away. but it returns when I realize that I'll never even muster the courage to befriend him. I've always thought about asking another friend in our Gym class to talk to him for me, but how would I even ask? Sorry for venting, I really needed someone to read this, maybe tell me I'm not as irredeemable as I think I am, and let me know I'm okay. Thanks for reading. One love to all reading this :)
