Girlfriend is hiding suicide attempt?Hello all, first off, thank you for the help you are in the community!

So, my gf and I are in our early 20s. Lately she's had a case of the blues, and despite my worries, assured me she was fine. In hindsight, there were a lot of warning signs  and she was overly apologetic and blaming of herself for many things. I tried to get her to call a professional, but she's resisted. 

Last week, she confided in me about how she got really sick from drinking, but assured me things had peaked there and she felt better and less spiteful of herself. She got over a hill so to speak. I've kept an eye on her and spent as much time just being with her as I can. 

Yesterday, I found out through a friend that she actually was trying to die that night. And she had actually admitted this publicly after the fact on her alternate social media accounts.

I haven't brought it up yet, as I feel like I've probably been making things unintentionally worse lately by being overly available and vocal about coming to me if she had any problems. 

However, she hasn't brought it up either. And when we were sitting together browsing the account, she quickly scrolled over the post I recognized so I couldn't see. And in general, not very communicative of her feelings. 

I'm worried, and confused about what to do next. Should I let her know, that I know?What else can I do?
