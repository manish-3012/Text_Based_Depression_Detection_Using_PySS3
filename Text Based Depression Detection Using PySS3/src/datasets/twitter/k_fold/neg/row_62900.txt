I'm alive but dead inside.I'm here because i feel like i need to give myself a chance. I will kill myself sooner or later. Please hear me out.

I'm 21 years old, computer science graduate, but heres my story. Before i have everything food, friends, electronics and family. I'm very happy then unfortunately my father died when i was 2 year college and my mother gone nuts. Sorry my English vocabulary is shity. Since I'm still studying back then i needed money and now that my father died and my mother went nuts. I needed to pay everything. I starred working while studying its fvcked up hard i onlu sleep like 2hrs aday. And then when im getting used to that destructive lifestyle. Shit went wild again. My professional asshole auntie wants me to move out of our house coz my fathers dead and that part of land is hers now just because my father died. See now i dont have a single family. So i can't argue with her coz damn i dont have money and shit. So I rent a small apartment for 2 years while still studying i only eat once a day coz i need to budget my money for my studying. And all of my friend is gone coz im fvcked up. So i need to deal with depression and shit asking god why the fvcking me? I mean i have a lot pf shit going on and I'm doing mu best to keep my shit together. And then tadaaa. Graduation day. I'm the most happy fvcked up person on earth that day.

Now looking for a job about programming. They all looking for experienced people. Im a fresh grad looking like a dirt bag coz of the shit that i have been through. Every company that i applyed turned me down coz i dont have experience. I am so done with my life. I know im near to success but every strength in my body is gone. Im giving up. Life beat me. I hate this world
