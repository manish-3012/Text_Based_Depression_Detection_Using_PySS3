I give up.My life has fallen to shit in the past few months. I've typically been antisocial and introverted but I began making an effort to get to know people more. I partially succeeded but I feel it was under the guise of a fake persona, someone that was far from who I actually am and I feel I've lost my actual personality.

And me trying to make friends was shit as well - I managed to fall in love with one of them and after confessing she sent me a letter essentially detailing how we weren't friends and how she felt obliged to give me a letter solely because of the circumstances. That hit me pretty fucking hard - she was a big enough part of my life to get me away from depression and suicide the first time.

I feel like I've dug myself into a hole I can get myself out of. Suicide honestly looks like a better option than continuing to live through all the shit I've been flung. I'm tired of living, to say the least.
