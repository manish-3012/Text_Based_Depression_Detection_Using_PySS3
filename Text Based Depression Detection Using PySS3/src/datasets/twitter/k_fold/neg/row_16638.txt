Welp, guess now's the timeDon't know why I'm writing this, since it sounds like a cry for help and makes me look even more pathetic. I guess you could say that I'm just here to give the story behind why I'm going to end it all and the reasons. Pardon my subpar writing since it's early in the morning and I haven't slept all night.

I used to believe that I was good, a gentle kindhearted person that would always be nice and help out others. When other people took advantage of me, isolated me, girls rejected me, etc. I thought it was all their fault. But I was wrong, it's my fault. My fault for being a useless human being at living, being absolute trash. I feel that I'm a failure to my family, no matter how much they tell me they will always support me and love me. It would be easier for them if I just died. I don't even know why I'm writing this, and apologize if it's too long. Tomorrow I'm going to do it, probably shoot myself.
