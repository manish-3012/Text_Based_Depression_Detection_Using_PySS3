I always lose what makes me happyI'm 19. I turn 20 in a few months and I've ben depressed for years and everytime I start to get happy I lose it. Recently I met a girl who makes me so happy. And we've ben going on dates and our friends say she really likes me. But tonight she told me she's moving like 2 hours away and I just asked her if she still likes me and wants to date me but she hasn't read it yet. Do you think I can make it work with her? I can't take anymore heartbreak
