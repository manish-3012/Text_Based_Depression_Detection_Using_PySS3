I feel like such a failureAbout half a year ago at this point my ex broke up with me, the person i most loved and did everything for insisted i was controlling and gave a shit ton of contradictory reasons to hate me, she continued "being friends with me", a.k.a using me.

She was living her best life, she went through more girls in one summer than i did in my entire life, and I was her first kiss, I feel like such a failure compared to her.

I wanted to kill myself, she said she's there for me, we went out, she invited her crush, she stripped and they kissed, Ive never felt worse.

I tried that night. I failed.

She then said to never contact her again, Ig she would finally stop hurting me.

She called today, cause "she found some good weed and knew I wanted to try"

Why'd she call?

I cant stop thinking about her. I dont wanna live like this, Im a failure, everyone around me is better than me, at the minimum socially.

She even went from no friends to more friends than me this summer.

I already have the knife in my hand, just thought Id shout into the void one last time.
