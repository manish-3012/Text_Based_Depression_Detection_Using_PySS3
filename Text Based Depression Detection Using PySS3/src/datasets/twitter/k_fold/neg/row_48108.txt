I'm sure now I have the same neurological condition as my father. It's lifelong and debilitating. I can't be in a relationsip because I don't want to trap someone into becoming my caretaker. I'll never get married and have kids.I can't pass this on. If my family history is any indication I'm going to deteriorate until I need full time care. I'm already moving back in with my parents at 26 because I can no longer take care of myself. 

Why do I have to live? Why do I owe it to others to live out my days in suffering? Why can't I choose not to live like a parasite off of others?
