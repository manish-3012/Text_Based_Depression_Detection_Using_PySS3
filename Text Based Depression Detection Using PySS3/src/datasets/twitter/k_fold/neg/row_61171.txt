I need helpI feel like seeing a therapist (or psychologist whatever) would help me greatly but I have a few problems with that.
1- I feel ashamed of having to admit to my parents that Iâ€™m mentally unstable and depressed. Iâ€™d feel like theyâ€™d see me as someone just mentally weak, or as â€œa pussyâ€.

2- My parents canâ€™t afford it. Theyâ€™re already in debt and with 3 children they donâ€™t have a lot of money to spend. I wouldnâ€™t want them to struggle even more than they already do.
