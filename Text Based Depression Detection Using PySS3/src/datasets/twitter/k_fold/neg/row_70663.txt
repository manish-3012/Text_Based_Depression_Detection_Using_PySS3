CrosspostI feel my whole life is a lie. My sexuality is a sin. My mother hates that I'm gay. I was thrown holy water at by my grandmother after she found out I was also cutting saying I was the devil. They aren't even really religious, I don't understand. I have to pretend to be straight to fit in. I can't handle school but I do get very good grades. Just the motivation to go is a struggle. Me cutting was a joke to my whole family. They involved the school but the day after that they did nothing. I did it for attention. Pain pain go away I guess? The feeling gone away for a long while but I get that feeling now and then. Especially now. It's my last year can I make it? What do I do with my life after that? I can't pretend everything is going to be okay. My family has spoiled me other than those things I get many thingS I want. I think I'm just being selfish and I probably am but I want to disappear. I want to be forgotten.

I really just want people to hear me out. No one has understood me and I can't seek a counselor it's the worse. I'll probably end up in a really bad place again. The struggle of not cutting and the struggle of being looked down upon. I'm embarrassing myself by just posting this stuff.

My father is also verbally abusive. When my parents were together he used to beat me up if we got into a fight. He choked me at one point but that's the past
