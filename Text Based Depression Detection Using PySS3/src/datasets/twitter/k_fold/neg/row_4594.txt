Feeling LostI was with a man for 12 years. We had our ups and downs. Truthfully, more downs. I hung in there as long as I could. Moved, out of state, to be with him. It just didn't work. I moved back home. Within THREE weeks, he connected with a woman he dated years ago..his first true love. I hurt like hell. Guess he was never really into me...I don't know if I have the energy to start all over. Tired..emotionally, mentally and spiritually.
