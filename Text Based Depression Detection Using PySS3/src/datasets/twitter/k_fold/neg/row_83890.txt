I don't see the pointRecently I realised that there's literally no point. Like really why are we here? I dunno, I have goals, I have lots of goals, I have a girlfriend and I'm still just a student but..
Lets say after I complete all my goals there will be another one and after that there will be another and after that there will be another, but then I'll just be too old to have goals and society is just gonna cast me aside and forget me.
I have travelled a lot don't really see the point of that, like why? what is it even for are we just supposed to tell ourselves "wow this sure is slightly different then the place where I live".
Like no.. I'd rather even stay home, where I'm supposed to be by evolution.

I don't know I know it probably seems selfish. There are so many people. So many people born with disabilities, in a third world country or in an abusive environment. But still after I end it, I won't care. Society will probably forget me in a couple of years. Yeah, I'd might cross a mind of a few people from time to time, but like who cares.

I don't know if y'all get my point. English is not my first language so I don't know y'all get what I mean, but yeah. That's it for now. I'm not thinking about ending it any time soon, but I can't stop thinking about it. I just had to get this off my chest. Thanks
