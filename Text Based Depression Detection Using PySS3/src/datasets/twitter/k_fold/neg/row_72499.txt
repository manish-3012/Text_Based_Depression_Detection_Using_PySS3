Does anyone else feel like me?So for this I'm not using a throwaway because well, I really don't think it's too much of a deal, I just want to know if others feel like me.

I too have considered suicide, but it's not due to the usual reasons (depression, family stuff etc.) It's purely down to curiosity. Seriously, I'm genuinely curious to know what happens when you die. Now I'm not silly enough to kill myself purely due to curiosity though. I can appreciate that life is a gift, and if I have no valid reason to end mine, then I shouldn't. All I want to know is are there others out there who are as curious as me?

Also please if this is the wrong place to post this I'm sorry. I found this subreddit by just clicking random and thought it might be the right place. To anyone out there who is seriously considering suicide, please, I know you might feel like a random stranger over the internet cannot help you, but listen to the advice these people are giving. It's good stuff. They've been in your shoes and they've pulled through, try to remember that there's always another way to sort things out.
