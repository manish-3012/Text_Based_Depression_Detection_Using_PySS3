Some people deserve to dieHey, thank you all for taking the time to help me with a dilemma. I need an honest opinion and please donâ€™t feel bad for me.

When I was a young kid (barely a teen), I did something that I can never forgive myself for.  I donâ€™t feel like getting into the details, but this is something that I have regretted my entire life. It has gotten to the point where I just cant live with happiness. No matter how hard I try I cant forgive myself. I was just a young dumb kid but there are some things in life that haunt you forever and no matter what, you cant go back in time and make things right.

Iâ€™m not bad person but this childhood event has haunted me forever. Iâ€™ve been suffering from severe depression and anxiety for the past 7 years and I just cant take it anymore. Life is not something I enjoy or ever will be able to enjoy. Every second for the past 7 years has been me waiting to die. Iâ€™ve coincidentally even been in multiple accidents and every time I just seem to fucking make it out alive. I just want to end it all but I donâ€™t know the right way to do it. I am not a person that deserves to live. Please just trust me on this.

Please donâ€™t try to sympathize with me as I am not someone who deserves your sympathy. I am a terrible human being who needs to be dead. How should I go about this. Thank you
