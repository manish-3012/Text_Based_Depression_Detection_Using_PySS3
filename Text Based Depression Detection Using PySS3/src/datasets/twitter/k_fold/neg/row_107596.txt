Suisidal ideation isn't funI've been on and off suisidal for who knows how long. It's gotten worse in the past years.

Two times I've had plans. One to overdose in my bed and close my door and wait for my roommates to wonder why they havnt seen me for days. And the second time I was going to crash my car with no seatbelt on. 

First time I got a better Dr and on different meds. Second time checked into a hospital and eventually got a dog. 

But I started thinking of plans today again. The best option seems knife to heart/jugular or finding a way to hang myself. 

I've told people I've been feeling suisidal. I've made appointments to see doctors and a therapist. But whats the point? I might fix it for a little while but it's just going to come back worse again. I know some day I'll eventually just kill myself anyway. 

I don't feel like moving my limbs. They feel to heavy. I keep crying all the time. Nothing interest's me. I just want to be gone. Idk what to do.
