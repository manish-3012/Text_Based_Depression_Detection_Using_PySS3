Help for a friendI have a friend who recently told me she has suicidal thoughts. She also said that I'm the only one she told and she wanted me to keep it a secret from anyone. Unfortunately I'm quite a dunce when it comes to emotions and talking about them. I would like even the slightest help on how to go about talking to her about it. I've made sure to listen and not make it seem likes shes to blame or anything similar. I care for her deeply I want to help her anything is appreciated. If there is any info that could help please let me know and I'll share if possible. Thanks to anyone and everyone in advance
