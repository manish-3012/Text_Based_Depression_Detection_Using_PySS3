You ever make people mad online and not really even fully understand why and get this strong sense of self loathing have to self harm over really petty shit like that?I get this sense like I'm not trying to purposely hurt people, but like I am unintentionally a horrible cunt. and the impression I get is that I SHOULD feel like a horrible cunt, and that's what I deserve, based on how everyone else treats me. and so if I pull out a blade and start bleeding that's probably a positive result considering everyone in the world
