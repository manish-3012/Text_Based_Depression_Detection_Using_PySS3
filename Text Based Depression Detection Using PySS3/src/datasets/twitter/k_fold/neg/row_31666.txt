The greatest gift I can give is to my unborn, unrealized children. I'll never force them to exist. They can rest in peace.I have billions of potential children. 

And I'm not going to bring any of them into this world. They won't have to know the pain of mental illness. They won't hate that they were brought into the world without the consent or against their will. They won't be told time and again that they MUST exist, while they suffer under a system which fucks them at every turn. 

They have the freedom to rest in total peace. To sleep without dreams, to know nothing but the quiet nonexistence that I wish I could return to.
