I'm going to kill myselfI've seriously tried to improve my situation over years, it hasn't worked.  I've tried to ask people for help, no one wants to help.  I've tried to get professional help, it hasn't helped.  I had a therapist give up on me yesterday.

I'm in immense pain right now, I'm popping klonopins and xanax to get through the day.  I might run out soon, then it's over. I'm done, fuck this shit, I'm so fucked up there is no fixing me.

Just made this post to see the truth rather than sugar coating, and yup, I'm a fucking loser and will always be one: https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/3v0rgz/would_you_date_this_person/

Why bother living if you're going to just be miserable
