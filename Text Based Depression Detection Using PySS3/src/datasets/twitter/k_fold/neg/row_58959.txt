If a friend wants to kill themselves because they're suffering in life, would it be cruel to prevent themIf your friend suffers from multiple mental illnesses that aren't being helped by therapy or medication, their family is shit, they can't work  because of their mental illnesses, the government wont assist them in getting work or money because he isn't mental ill enough, He can't go to school because of mental illnesses, and all of this seems 10x worse to him because of depression, should I let him kill himself?

He's almost tried before and a friend of mine called the cops and he was so upset that someone tried to help him and i felt so bad because he truly hates life. He hates living. And i don't know how to make life better for him. And i want to support and validate any feeling he has. I obviously don't want him to die. But what can i do? nothing helps him. He has such a pessimistic view of life. From everything he's told me, i've had a much worse life than him. But my depression and anxiety aren't bad enough to have such a glass half empty point of view. So i can't just tell him "suck it up, people have worse lives" because...that's a dick move, and it doesn't help. I don't know how to show him that life isn't bad. And it makes me think, maybe for him, life IS that bad...People suffering from incurable illnesses can get assisted suicide to end their suffering, is it not cruel to make my friend live who is suffering constantly? I don't know. What do people do in these situations? i don't want to overstep my boundaries with him. I want to respect his wishes.
