I want to want to be aliveI keep reading things trying to make myself change my mind but it's not working. Reading about suicide survivors and spending time with my family and shit. I really feel like I just wasn't built to last, if that makes any sense. I'm planning on killing myself towards the end of April. (Hey, at least I won't have to deal with finals lmao)
