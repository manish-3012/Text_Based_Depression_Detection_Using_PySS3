So tired. So worn out. I just don't want to do this anymore.Long story short, 24 year old with a past attempts. Been depressed since I was 12. Fiance left me. Parents abused me. Family is neglectful. take 5 medications just to function. Lately I've been getting deeper and deeper into depression. I just can't stay on my feet anymore. Bills are piling up. I can't get up to do anything, even feed myself. I think I need help before I waste away.
