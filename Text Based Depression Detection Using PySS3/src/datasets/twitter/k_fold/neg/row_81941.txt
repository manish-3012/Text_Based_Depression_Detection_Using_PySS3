I almost killed myself today.I've always considered suicide, I've just settled being an avid self mutilator instead because I keep telling myself how damaged my mom would be if I did kill myself.. She's barely hanging on now with my help, I can't imagine if I just left her..

But today.. today was just. I don't know. I got really, really sad suddenly. Just this endless void opened in my gut and sucked everything into it. I became empty, almost. I ran a bubble bath and tried soaking in it to possibly ease it, but all I could think about is how much I just didn't want to be here anymore. Just thought of all the bullshit, everything I can't handle in my head. I plugged in the hairdryer and was going to throw it in the bathtub while it was on and I was in the water, but the cord was too short and if I ran out to get an extension cord my mom would kind of take notice. So, y'know, nothing happened..

I can't even trust myself anymore. I'm so conflicted. I don't know if this is the right subreddit, I'm sorry if it's not.. I just needed to vent about this.
