Told some of of my close circle 2 weeks ago that I have suicidal thoughts, but don't know how to tell them the situation has worsened and the thoughts are persistent now. Don't know how to keep bringing attention to the fact I'm doing really bad, how do I bring myself to talk about being suicidal?I have been having 'I want to die' thoughts for a month and told a group of my friends and my partner two weeks ago. They reacted concerned and offered me help, but there wasn't much they could do. I sortof run a company with two of these friends, and they seem to at least mostly leave me off the hook when I mention I'm doing bad.

However, my mental health has worsened and last week the thoughts turned into 'I am not going to make it to 2021'. I'm at peace with that, but I a part of me knows that that's not the best way to think. 

I also haven't told my family, it's hard to bring it up bc my mom commited suicide and non of my family members are very emotional fit to deal with talking about it. Nor are some of my best friends, so I haven't told them, but I really wish I could, because I want to at least tell them goodbye or something. 

I'm gonna try to stay alive untill 13 Oct bc then I'll have an intake for psychiatric help. But I do feel like I should tell people that I really have no plan to stay alive much longer than that, for my sake and theirs.

How do you get over that mental barriÃ¨re everytime?  How do I tell the people that love me that I can't live like this, eventhough they do their best? 
Especially tips for how to tell people who are not very good with emotion would probably help
