I don't know what to do.I'm not sure I'm at the point where I would actually kill myself as I do have some sliver of hope that I might eventually start to feel better again because I've been through bad stuff in my life before that I eventually recovered from. but I have still had some suicidal thoughts. This is because I have been having consistent negative thoughts and well I have always had those because of an anxiety disorder I'm usually able to distract myself with hobbies. However it has recently gotten so bad that a lot of the time I don't feel anything from my hobbies anymore. I feel like for some reason I have recently become uninterested in everything that I used to enjoy. Because of this my head is just filled with negative thoughts and I can hardly distract myself from them anymore. Sometimes recently even when I try to enjoy a hobby my brain will make me feel guilty for enjoying it(for example I'll try watching an anime and feel guilty about at the thought that people may have been overworked to make it) I have Asperger's syndrome and have special interests but even my spacial interests are hardly making me feel anything recently. I wanted to talk to my parents about how I have been feeling but I feel to worried to tell them I have had suicidal thoughts because my dad also struggles with depression and I would feel too much guilt if I told him and made his depression worse or made him worry. I just don't know what to do.
