I thought if finally be freeWell, I kinda thought this would be it. I made all my plans, grabbed what I would need, and trudged out into the forest. I was all set. After walking around for an hour, I haven't found a single tree that I can hang myself from. None. It's just all trunks with no branches. 


So now I'm sitting alone in the forest with a noose in my bag. I'm tired of feeling this way and I can't see a reason to continue life. I wish I could say that this is just an episode and that I'm being irrational, but this is me perfectly calm. I spend every night awake, just hating myself, wishing I could be anyone else. Someone worthy of respect, success, and a personal life. But until I die, I'll always be this pitiful loser.
