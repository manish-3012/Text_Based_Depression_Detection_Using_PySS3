I'm trying.As I type this there is a little girl inside saying "mommy." She's not alone. Her dad is there with her. I've told him multiple times that I'm suicidal and he doesn't listen. He thinks I'm being dramatic because he has never dealt with depression.

 I can't stop the thoughts. One second I can be sitting on the couch with my children, the next I'm thinking of the most effective way to end my life. I have it planned out. I have an attic with a beam. All it takes is a chair and the tie for my robe. When I do this I don't want there to be an option for me to back out.

I'm mentally exhausted. I need help and no one will listen to me. I can't afford a babysitter for therapy. The only thing I can do is give up and free them. I just want some relief.
