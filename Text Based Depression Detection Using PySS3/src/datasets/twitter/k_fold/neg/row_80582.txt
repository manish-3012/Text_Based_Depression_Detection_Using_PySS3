gonna be kicked out on my 18th borthday. i dont know how long i can stay with my friend's family. i don't know where to goi graduate high school in May but my parents want to kick me out this sunday on my 18th birthday. i dont know where im gonna go. i can say at my friend's place, but I dont want to be a bother to them for too long. my mom found out my plan today to do that and she told me that it won't last and how they would despise me after awhile. i have nowhere to go. i only make $700 a month from my job. literally, id be out in the cold, and i dont want to freeze to death. i dont want to die, but id rather something without as much suffering as hypothermia
