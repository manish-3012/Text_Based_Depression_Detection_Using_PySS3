The answer is yes, the questions are where and howI know I'm ready, I just don't know how to best avoid hurting anyone. I know my dad has nightmares of finding me, so it won't be at home. I don't want to do it in a hotel and scar some random stranger by having to deal with my body; where would be a good place to cause the least harm?
Also, leaning toward [edit due to rules] even though I know it's generally unreliable because I want to be as peaceful as one can be when exiting life. I am well aware of medical/chemical literature and probably have easy access. It's been over a decade since I researched best theories on final methods; I know  I don't want to make a bigger mess than a dead body is going to make.
I've thought this through, it isn't a rushed decision, although certain choices I have made recently have made my physical and emotional suffering worse, so why bother continuing the anguish when there will be plenty for family to wrap up no matter how much I prep.
