FinallyAfter being a suicidal bitch for almost 16 years now, I finally am gonna do it. You know when you go into the hospital and they give you the forms to see how youâ€™re doing, and they slip that suicide one right in the middle of the stack. Like â€œDo you feel like youâ€™re eating ok?â€ *checks yes* â€œAre you doing ok in school?â€ *checks yes again* â€œDo you want to die? If yes, do you have a plan?â€ 

For the last one, I always just checked no and moved on. I hated confronting doctor after doctor that I know didnâ€™t believe me or had something else to do. I hate the awkward conversations that get both of us nowhere at the end of the session. But Iâ€™m getting off track...

I always stopped myself during previous suicide attempts. Just before slitting my wrists, I remembered that my brothers (M6/M8) would find my body. Just before jumping off a building onto the construction site below, I got a call from my girlfriend. I donâ€™t want people stopping me anymore. The wouldnâ€™t care if they all hated me. If they all hated me, it would make it easier for them to accept my death. Itâ€™s not like they really care anyway. We are only friends because weâ€™re all depressed and depend on each other to survive. Iâ€™m done depending. Iâ€™m done lying. Iâ€™m done telling everyone that Iâ€™m ok because I donâ€™t want to talk to them about it. Iâ€™m done having panic attacks, anxiety attacks, sadness, depression, ADHD, insomnia, voices, everything. Just got to push everyone a little farther away and Iâ€™ll finally be free.
