I can barely be bothered to post hereMy life never seems to improve no matter what I do. I have been struggling for my entire life with mental illness, nobody seems to care, everyone is angry with me all the time, because I am crazy. My children now seem to hate me, my ex has poisoned them after manipulating everyone and everything around here. What should I do? I crave the nothing that exists beyond this painful mortal life.
