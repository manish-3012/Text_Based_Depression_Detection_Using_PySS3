Medication withdrawals are making me suicidal-where to go for help? I started a long drawn out process of getting off lamictal many months ago. I'm super dependent on it to not be depressed and have been on it for almost 4 years now, so I've been going down 6.25 mg at a time and lowering every 10 days. Lamictal gave me a serious illness that now is attacking my organs, so I have to quit no matter what.

Nothing has ever helped me not be depressed besides lamictal, and I don't really feel I can have a life without it. My psychiatrist cares a ton and is very invested in her patients and has regular conference calls with my therapist, she's very sweet. But after so many tries to get on other things, I'm not okay...I'm on 56.25 mg now and have been for a month. I can't go down because the depression will get even worse, and I can't go up because the last time I raised it by just 6.25 I had a fever and increased autoimmune issues for 10 weeks. I'm suicidal and scared of being in my mind. Is it worth going to a psychiatric hospital? I feel like I'm in crisis/psychiatric emergency mode all the time, but I'm not sure if that's the place to go to get help coming off and get on better meds.
