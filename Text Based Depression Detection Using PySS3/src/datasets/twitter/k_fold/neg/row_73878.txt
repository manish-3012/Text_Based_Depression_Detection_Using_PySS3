My life is greatâ€¦ so why do I feel this way?Iâ€™ve been struggling with chronic depression ever since my preteen years, and anytime Iâ€™ve thought about suicide Iâ€™ve been able to very easily dispel the thought by thinking of my loved ones who would miss me. Also, I donâ€™t ever want anyone to have to find my body, a scenario that horrifies me. My thoughts of suicide also used to be very infrequent and incredibly rare. But nowâ€¦ but now suicide is constantly on my mind. The concept of what lies beyond death absolutely horrifies me and keeps me from thinking about it. However, today, I reached the threshold of not being afraid anymore. I actually closed my eyes and thought how I wouldnâ€™t even be able to tell I was dead. Itâ€™d be like going to sleep and, in a blink, there'd be nothing and I wouldnâ€™t notice. I thought about running a nice bath with candles and then... well... you know. But instead of being disgusted with myself I was actually calmed by the idea. I was thinking about what to leave in my note, what final goodbye Iâ€™d have. Iâ€™d probably put up a status on Facebook too: â€œIâ€™m sorry. Be good, okay? I love you.â€

Why do I feel like this? My life is perfectly fine. Iâ€™m finishing college soon, my s/o is the kindest and most patient person in existence, Iâ€™ve got sweet pets, my family is awesome and supportive, and Iâ€™m financially well-off. I feel so guilty feeling like this all the time, and when I see the awful things other people go though I almost feel sick with self-loathing. I spend so much of my time crying over nothing, and my motivation is absolutely nonexistent. My plants die, I want to die. My pets get sick, I want to die. I canâ€™t bring myself do homework because Iâ€™m depressed, I want to die. Not learning a new skill fast enough, I want to die. Everything I see in the news, even though I try to stay away from it, makes me want to die. I feel sluggish and broken, and I know killing myself only passes along the hurt to othersâ€¦ but Iâ€™ve just stopped caring. Iâ€™ve hit this awful equilibrium of selfish and angry and so depressed that I just constantly want to die. Yet Iâ€™m also trapped in a paradoxical state since Iâ€™m not willing enough to do it--I canâ€™t bring myself to.

Iâ€™ve had a couple sort-of near-death experiences (one being a suicide attempt via pills) that made me change my will to live for the better, but I noticed Iâ€™ve begun to disregard these as of late. I also used to see a therapist but she moved. I plan on finding a new therapist soon, because I just donâ€™t know what to do with myself. Iâ€™m terrified anyone will find out how I feel. Supportive as she is, my mom thinks depression is a chosen state-of-mind that can be fixed with a sunny walk. My s/o has struggled with depression so he knows how I feel, but I donâ€™t want to worry him and I donâ€™t want him to see me differently. I also have this irrational fear that he or anyone else might take my depression personally, which is unlikely and ridiculous of me to thinkâ€¦

TL,DR: Iâ€™m constantly suicidal, and I donâ€™t know what to do with myself. Why am I like this? I feel like Iâ€™m in Edwin Robinsonâ€™s â€œRichard Coryâ€ poem right now.
