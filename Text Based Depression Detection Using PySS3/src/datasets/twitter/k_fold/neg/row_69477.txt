Never posted anything like this before...I've never used reddit before but I've lurked here during some darker times in the past. I don't even know why I'm posting now. I guess because I don't really have anywhere else to reach for support.

I'm so close to suicide now. I don't have depression but I do live with a chronic illness that leaves me bedridden most of the time. It's an illness I know it's possible to recover from but I don't seem to be able to do it. It's taken 7 years of my life (I'm 28) and I just feel so worn out. I've had all sorts of treatments. I get excited that I've figured it out, make some minor progress and then have yet another setback. Net progress is pretty much none and I'm just so tired of existing. 

I have no career, no friends, no relationship, no income. I've totally lost my twenties to this illness and I'm so close to giving up hope. I've always been a fighter but I've totally lost faith in myself. I feel like such a burden to everyone around me. I feel like such a waste of space.

Six months ago I told myself that if I was no better by now I would kill myself. I have a plan, it's not a great one but it would work. 

I don't even know what the point of this post is...just to tell someone I think...

Thanks for reading.
