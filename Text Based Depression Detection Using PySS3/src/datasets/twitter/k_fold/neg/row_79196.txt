Adult life plus suicidal thoughtsHi everyone.

I'm about to start college soon. But first, I have to take an exam to get into the college itself. I've been personally dealing with depression, anxiety, and binge eating my whole life plus I'm at the lowest point I could ever be right now. I've also struggled with suicidal thoughts for my entire life and it has become really hard to simply ignore those sorts of thoughts all the time. 

My mom expects a lot from me, therefore she's putting all of this pressure on me to just pass the exam.

I honestly want to study a different career, however, i don't want to let her down or disappoint her. 

She and my grandma are the only reason why I haven't kill myself yet. 

Is it worth it to live an entire life to make someone (like your mom) happy?  I feel like living is now an obligation and a weight that I have to carry with me at all times. Hi everyone.
