I'm going to my first group session tomorrow...I'm following up from this thread.

I went to the counseling program at my university and they recommended group therapy, so that I can get in touch with people again. I'm taking summer class with research, so the thoughts are coming back, but I still holding out. I post this to give r/SW an update, but also to show someone in a similar situation that they're not the only one. Feel free to ask me about the situation.

EDIT1: It was just a screening.

EDIT2: Just admitting I have a problem made me feel better about it and allows me to better seek counseling. If you think there's a probably; don't be afraid to seek help.

EDIT 3: I'm in private counseling now.
