i just have a questionidk i tried calling the national suicide hotline, and my state's hotline. no answer. it doesn't matter at this point anymore. i just want to know, if you have no friends or family; if you contribute nothing to anyone, and aren't needed by anyone, and are easily replaced and forgettable, why shouldn't you kill yourself? if nobody would notice, or care, why wouldn't i?
