16 years old ready to goIt's been over a year now that i don't see any reason i should wake up and i don't understand what other people see that i don't about life. I'm burned out, i go to school and i have a job at McDonald's, my grades have just been going down, my parents don't know what to do with me. I use to have lots of friends but i don't know what happened. . 

I've talked about the thoughts of ending my life to who i was considering my best friend and he seems to think i'm joking and this is just pushing me closer to the line.

When i'm in a group, i feel like i'm talking to a wall, nobody cares it's like if people are just waiting for me to be gone. All i live for right now is drinking and smoking and i don't care if people think i'm feeling  sick because of drugs or alcool and in fact its the complete opposite, they are the one that are always there for me no matter what time is it or what my problem is. 

I just feel like a fucking pussy not killing myself already, i've been two times on the bridge next to my school, ready to jump, both times i was very drunk and kept thinking about my "friends" that i love but i always come to the conclusion that they don't, they don't  like me. 

This reddit post is being written at 1:12 AM i don't know what this will give me or why i'm i writing this but in a way just saying what i have in the abyss of my ? of my thoughts ? is making me feel good. I guess you're like a friend, but i don't have o see you being bored of listening to me and i don't have to explain myself, i just keep on writing.

If you guys, if one person as made it to the end of my "brainstorm confession" could you give me a reason to wake up tomorrow
And I think i'll end on this,
