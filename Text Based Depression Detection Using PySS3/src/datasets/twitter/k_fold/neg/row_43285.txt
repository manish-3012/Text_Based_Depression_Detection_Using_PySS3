is it normalis it normal that i dont want to help people who want to kill themselves? i would never suggest them any ideas or anything of course, i just noticed that i used to always try to cheer such people up because i knew how it felt and i didnt want other people to have suicidal thoughts but now.. i kinda perceive suicide as a choice everyone has a right to make. and i know the suffering of a suicidal person and if someone wants to end it, i can't interfere
