How does anyone not kill themself?It's pretty clear that nothing I will do will prevent a net negative effect on the world. I can't imagine the life anyone would have to live to result in a feeling of accomplishment in this day in age.

I am a US white male in a family of Republicans. The only thing that's kept me going for a while is my acknowledgement that my departure from this world will result in my family having a shittier time if I'm not here. My debts will pass to them.

Each day it feels more like I can do literally nothing to make this world better. My very existence is making the planet worse, except to the people with whom I'm in direct contact. For those people I can imagine a moment of silence to accept my death and a lifetime of greater struggles because I wasn't capable of doing enough to prevent them from having to shoulder my burden.

I just don't know how I can go on pretending like I can do anything when it feels like I should just count my losses when cashing in right now is probably ideal. My family is able now more than ever to get though the burden I'd leave them, and they probably won't be able to later. I see no reason to keep going when there's literally nothing I can do to make going on worthwhile.
