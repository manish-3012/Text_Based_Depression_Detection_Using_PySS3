Donâ€™t want my family to have to see my mutilated body.I have been researching suicide methods for about a month now and have come to unfortunate conclusion that the only truly reliable method that I could complete is suicide by firearm. However, the thought of my family discovering or identifying my body under those conditions might just be enough for me to never follow through.

I truly wish there was a method in which I could die painlessly and peacefully in bed.
