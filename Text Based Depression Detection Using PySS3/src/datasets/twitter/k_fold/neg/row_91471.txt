YallYall I just wanted to share my story.
I deal with major depression, anxiety, controling parents, and not liked at school. I'm not popular or amazing. But I'll tell you one thing. I'm still important. And if someone like me can be important. You can too. I havent beaten my battle but I'm trying. I still feel like dying every day. But im not giving up now and nither should you. If you cant do it for yourself do it for me.
