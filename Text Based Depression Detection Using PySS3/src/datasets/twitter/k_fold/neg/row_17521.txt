Need advice...The following has transpired over the past week or so

Saturday:
Took the MCAT today, was talking to my best friend about it last night. She graduated last semester and moved a few hours away so I rarely get to see her anymore. We exchange lengthy messages via facebook every now and then, it's a nice way to catch up with each other after long periods of business. Anyway, I sent her one such message a week or two back and she told me last night that she'd definitely send me a good long one today.

I take the MCAT today, it was fucking brutal, walked out of there wondering why I didn't just void the fucking thing. But then on the way home I just kept reminding myself that I'd have a message from her waiting in my inbox at home to cheer me up.

First thing I did when I got home was logged onto facebook, 1 new message -- awesome.

Contents 'Sorry anon, I can't stand talking to you any more, you're too much of a stressor in my life'

Defriended.

So I'm sitting here with a bottle of gin (now half a bottle).

Pissed?
Sad?

I don't fucking know how to feel at this point.



I tried texting her several times, didn't get a response until Tuesday. All she had to say was 'sorry'. I tried calling her a few times after that text and she wouldn't pick up the phone.

Then today I log on to facebook and I have a new friend request, it's from her.

Message : 'I'm so sorry anon that was a really shitty thing for me to do, I don't know what I'm doing anymore. Please forgive me'

I don't fucking know if I should forgive her or just let her rot.

I'd appreciate any input you gents could give on the situation.
