Being ugly and a virgin is the worst thing ever16F I know boys shouldn't be a priority in my life but i can't help but cry over the fact i will be a virgin for the rest of my life. Never held a guys hand, hugged, kissed I've never even made contact with a guy before the only time was a accidental shoulder brush. I sound so lame and disgusting but i just feel so depressed. It's not like I'm purely looking for sex , i just want to simply hold someone's hand and feel loved and cared about. So many people have already  had sex and kissed and i haven't done anything remotely close to that. No guy has even glanced at me or talked to me. I'm not  attractive and I know that's the reason behind all of this. I have ash brown hair, blue eyes, pale skin, 5'3 and quite petite, which isn't attractive in this generation especially America. So many things about me make me very unattractive. I'm very shy and i don't know how to talk to people, which has made me quite friendless and made me appear weird to everyone. I'm not looking for the "Your so young just wait until you're older" I just wanted to write this to let it out.
