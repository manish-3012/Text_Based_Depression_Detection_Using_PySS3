Want to end itMy life has been nothing but disaster; arrested, falsely accused (no, you can't guess it, don't try), still have ptsd from it although its over, depression, panic attacks, currently obese, failing at my religion, God hates me (if you're irreligious, that's alright), and VERY in debt. Unrecoverable. I'd have to live like a monk for 5 years and not spend a dime just to pay it off probably.

I think it's about  time I call it quits. I don't know why I'm here.
