Everyday objects and locationsLately I've noticed myself thinking about different methods of suicide prompted simply by going about my life.  For example, I walked into a restroom recently which was being cleaned.  On the janitor cart there was a gallon of drain cleaner.  I wondered to myself "How hard would it be to chug drain cleaner?"  Another day I was at a mall walking on the upper level.  As I approached the elevator I realized the atrium was three levels high, and I thought "Swan dive to the bottom might end my pain and lonliness?"

Am I alone in these thoughts?
