I don't want to do anything anymoreI'm not really sure what's happened. I got home from college for the summer and I've just felt so lonely. I feel like I have no friends at all.  I feel like an awful person. In High School, I was a pretty awful person to one of my good friends, and I feel like I still haven't gotten over the awful things I did.

Now, I'm just here alone. I hate going to work. I hate having to wake up.

And this doesn't even mention how anxious I get around people, ya know? I hate going to work because I know I'll have to speak up, and for some reason that's gotten harder and harder to do.

I am certain that no one expects me to be this low in my life. I feel like so many people look up to me and I'm just here wanting to quit on everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be better, but I feel like every part of me just wants to hide.
