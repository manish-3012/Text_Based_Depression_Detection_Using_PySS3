HiIâ€™m thinking of ending my life for many reasons. 
I canâ€™t find a job
I canâ€™t be good at anything 
Very immense pressure on me 
Always try my best and fail harshly. 

I tried to kill myself 3 times before. I took therapy. I feel a bit better. But now Iâ€™m feeling really trapped in a life of darkness. Canâ€™t live my life as I want. I TRIED a lot. And really failing so hard. I canâ€™t support it any longer and I feel so ashamed writing this but it may be my last beat. 


I need advice. Love from god and help but couldnâ€™t find that either.
