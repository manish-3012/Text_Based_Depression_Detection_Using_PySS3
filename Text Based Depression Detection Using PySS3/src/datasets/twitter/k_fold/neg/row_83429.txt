help 

Life has been rough for me. Especially in Turkey(TÃ¼rkiye). Euro and dollar is rising, more and more taxes (the officials are thinking of a tax that single people have to pay),they sold one of our massive airports and more. So basically my country is flooded with resources and the officials are really (extremely) bad at governing this country (think of a high end gaming pc running freeDos) . Enough Turkey, let's talk about me; My dreams are about founding a company. A company like apple or spaceX. I mean a lot of CEOs of these companies had lived on poverty or bad conditions(I am grateful for my condition).Also, I have a lot of innovative ideas (such as graphene technologies or nanotechnologies)that I will get patents of in the moment I turn 18. However, all my school friends humiliate me and hate me. I think about suicide because of them. I don't get enough satisfaction from my life. Nobody loves me as much as they love their other friends. I never ever had a girlfriend. I hate myself for no reason. life seems to only get worse. Why the hell am I still alive? Sorry for bad English and sorry for not writing correctly, I am on mobile.

Note: if you ever see a company with a triangle logo, it means that I have succeeded and please dm this account.
