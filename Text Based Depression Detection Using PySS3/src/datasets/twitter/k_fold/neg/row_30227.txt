My friends ex-girlfriend wants to kill herself due to brakeupMy friend (male 21) got together with a girl (22) on a concert about 7 months ago. She is a "crazy" and she has gotten it proved by doctors. She has ADHD, depression, anxiety and few more things. I could tell from the start things are not going well. They weren't exactly in a relationship because both of them didn't want to get too attached to each other (fuck buddies) ... At least how it looked like. She wanted more but my friend didn't and she got pretty obsessive. When he finally decided he wants to end it he started to think she might kill herself. 

My question is: what can he do to prevent that? Calling a mental facility sounds a bit scarry yet calling her parents sounds like they can't do much about it either.
