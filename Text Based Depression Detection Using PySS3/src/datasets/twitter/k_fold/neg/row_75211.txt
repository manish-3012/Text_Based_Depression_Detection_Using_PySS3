How many times am I going to post here until I actually do it?I have a plethora of feelings exploding in my chest right now. Some good, some bad, some I have no clue what they are. I have an actual physical pain in my chest that I need to get rid of. I am sick of fucking everyone over. I just need to go. I don't want people messaging me telling me, "No! Don't do it." because I don't care anymore. It's what I want. I don't want anyone sad. I just want it to happen.
