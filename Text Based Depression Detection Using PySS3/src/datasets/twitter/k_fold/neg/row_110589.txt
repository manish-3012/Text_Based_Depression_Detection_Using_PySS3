I'm so fucking close to offing myself!To sum things up neatly: I got sent to a hospital for anxiety, dropped out of school, lost all my friends, tried to kill myself, went to another hospital, switched schools again, tried to kill myself again, went to a different hospital, went to a residential, lost all my newer friends, went to another residential, switched schools again, didn't get credit for it, and now I'm having to repeat a grade at my old school. And I don't know how much longer I can take this shit.

I can't keep fucking texting people "Hey what are you doing tonight ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥´" (when I'm on the verge of an anxiety attack, fake-ass emojis included) or "What are you doing for lunch today!!!" (pretty enthusiastic for someone who normally sits and cries in the bathroom for the whole class period) and not getting a response when they're clearly on their phones, posting shit on social media. I try so fucking hard. I couldn't care less what other people think about me, judge me all you want, but it absolutely DESTROYS me when I think about the fact nobody at all wants me, cares about me, wouldn't feel indifferent if I died in a fire-y car crash, or was found hanging from my ceiling fan for that matter. I know every normal, ~popular~ human being in the city of Greater Houston, been living there all my life, and still not one of them gives a flying fuck about me. I've been 'friends' with so many God damn people and there's still nobody I can reach out to when I feel this way, or who cares when they see the most obvious signs that I'm struggling. And if I drop the slightest hint, a calculated attempt to tell people I'm not doing okay without being branded as 'attention seeking', people will just answer me with a picture of them at some party guzzling down the piss water that is Coors Lite, probably having the time of their lives. I'm a 16 year old girl pouring out my feelings in a post on Reddit, what am I, a fucking virgin? 

I feel like I'm not supposed to be here, like, on the planet Earth. At first it was just a little twinge of loneliness every once in while, or being with a group of people and realizing that I didn't belong. Kind of similar to living on autopilot, going through the motions because it's what others expect of you. More often that not, though, it's feeling numb, knowing that you're existing rather than living. I really try to do well in school, be social, kiss up to my teachers and make good grades, make plans with people that don't like me and invite myself to places I'm not wanted at, and none of it fucking pays off. It's not even really FEELING like that everything you do is in vain. It's knowing that for a fact, and having personal experience: the last time I overdosed and was found passed out, choking on my own vomit, I disappeared for 6 months and not a single soul noticed. One night I showed up at a party (I left in September and came back in March), and a few people asked me, "So you do online school now, right?" 

I'm exhausted in every possible way. I don't know what I thought I would get from writing this. But if I AM going to take away anything, help me out here: If I jumped out my window and down 3 stories to the ground, would that do the job? And would anybody find me before I start to smell?
