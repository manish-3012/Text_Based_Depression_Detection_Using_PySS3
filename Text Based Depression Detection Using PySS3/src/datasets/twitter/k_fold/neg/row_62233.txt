My biggest mistakeHi,

I was 21 and I met a girl of 16, we had some sexual activity and would exchange images (sext) also screengrabbed her snaps without her knowledge, (didnâ€™t share them)I didnâ€™t realise this was illegal and now canâ€™t stop thinking about this mistake. She was too young I should have known better.
Iâ€™m having councelling &amp; meds but canâ€™t acceot that I am technically a sex offender and feel this is awful

I reported this to the nspcc and the police who said they would not take any action. If I could believe that itâ€™s not so bad I could maybe move on, is this possible? Is the age gap so bad? Can people forgive me?

Iâ€™m from the UK where age of consent 16 but have to be 18 for images.
