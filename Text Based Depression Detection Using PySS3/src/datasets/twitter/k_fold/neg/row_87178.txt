Feeling hopeless about my major...My major is broadcast journalism. I haven't applied for any internships because my GPA isn't fantastic. I feel so depressed and hopeless. I worry that no one will even want to hire me because I don't have enough stuff on my resume. I'm also confused on what I want to do now. I love writing. I have a huge passion for it... but I don't know what I want to do with broadcast journalism degree...
