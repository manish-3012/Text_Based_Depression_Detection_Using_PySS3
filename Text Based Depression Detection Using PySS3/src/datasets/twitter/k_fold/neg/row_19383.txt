I feel like this is logical.I feel like I have reasonable reasons for wanting to die. My quality of life has almost completely diminished. Two years ago I â€œcheatedâ€ on my boyfriend ( I got drunk and made out with a gay guy). My boyfriend went psycho. We lived together at the time. My days were spent either being called a whore, being pushed around, or kicked out on the street until he decided to let me back in. Unfortunately for me it only got worse. Turned into beatings/strangling not long after that, he ended up giving me a concussion on valentines day. So Iâ€™ve pretty much given up on life (I'm still with him). I've said fuck it to showering or getting out of bed in general. However I go to school and work but then back to the fetal position in bed. BUT ANYWAYS, my point is, that im pretty fucked up now. What I wrote is just skimming the surface of the shit i've endured in my life so far. Its safe to say that I will need a SIGNIFIGANT amount of therapy to be able to function physically, socially, etc( which I cant afford). Plus, since the abuse started i've have some social anxiety problems. I break out into a rash when ANYONE talks to me. Sometimes a shake or even twitch. This is amplified when talking with men. So embarassing... Yeah so I have no friends. Seems like my only logical option is to end my life. Im waaaaaaaaay too depressed to attempt to improve this situation. Metal institute vs death? I choose death, Im fucked
