im too fucking weak to existi swear to god i wasnt meant for this planet

i just called the suicide hotline. no hygiene for nearly a decade because of my depression has turned my teeth into rot but i dont have dental insurance, or any insurance for that matter. the anxiety wont go away. the pain wont go away and i have the worst pain tolerance so im sitting here, sobbing, scared of everything, alone. ive had 3 panic attacks in the last 24 hours and i can never fall asleep anymore. im terrified of getting a job. im terrified of social situations. 

iwalked to the store to get some orajel for my teeth. did nothing, just numbed all the wrong places and sent me into the third panic attack. nothing works. nothing works. im going to die like this. i would rather die than go through life as someone scared of their own shadow
