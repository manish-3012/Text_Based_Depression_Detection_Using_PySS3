Iâ€™m getting a hotel room tomorrow, I need time to think and be aloneSo tired of hurting and burdening my family with my depression and failure. Tired of living like a non human. Need to get away even if itâ€™s just for a little while.

Leaving them a note that tells them Iâ€™m ok and not to worry about me, I wonâ€™t answer the phone but Iâ€™ll text them to confirm Iâ€™m ok.

I hope once Iâ€™m in the hotel I can feel even a little different. I hate being so anxious and empty and sad all the time.
