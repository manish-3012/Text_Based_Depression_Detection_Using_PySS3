I honestly don't know how much longer I can go onMy mother has been emotionally abusive and neglectful to me my entire life. I won't go too much into detail, but I've made two posts here before about it, so if you're curious, see those.  


TL;DR My mother took literally everything away from me my entire life to spoil my bratty little sister, to the point of pulling me out of school and not letting me do anything to socialize growing up. This has been going on my entire life, but since the age of 11 I have been literally trapped in my basement unable to leave. She claims because she didn't literally lock me away it doesn't count, but I had no way to leave.  


I'm 23 years old now and haven't had any means to start my life. I've been torn down my entire life by my family and without the chance to develop social skills I can't do anything. I can't even talk to anyone beyond just saying "Hi," if that. I've had no way of getting a job because of where we live. I've tried applying to everywhere within walking distance (and then some), but nothing for the past 5 years. I have no ride, public transport doesn't really exist in my town and my mother gave the car that was supposed to be mine to my younger sister after she totaled hers drunk because I didn't have a license yet, when my mother is the one who actually yelled at me when she promised it to me \*not\* to get my license yet.  


I've barely even scratched the surface with this post or the previous posts I've made. She has literally ignored me since I was a child. Every time I tried to talk to her or anything. I just can't handle it anymore. I can't handle the fact I never got to be a kid or a teenager because my mother just didn't care. She tries to excuse everything she's done by going "I wasn't thinking straight" or "everybody makes mistakes," then she'll flop back to just flat out denying it.  


I just wanted to have a fair chance in life and now it's gone forever. I'll never get the chance to be a teenager and actually develop when I should have. Everything I should have had is gone forever because she couldn't be bothered to tell my bratty sister no.  


I've tried therapy, I've tried medication, nothing helps. I tried to explain to my mother that her being fair would be the only thing that helps, but it's been 12 years since I started explaining that and she has only done worse to me since then.  


I can't do this anymore. The only reason I haven't killed myself since my last posts here is because I convinced myself she would finally listen and be fair, but I've come to the realization it won't happen. I can't get over it without it (yes, I have tried), she's completely unwilling and keeps making excuses, doctors and medication haven't helped. I just wanted my mother to treat me fairly and to have a shot at life.

Everyone I've talked to keeps saying "oh you're young there's still time" but they don't get it. I'm literally starting as though I were 11 except at 23, and am expected to get a job and move out and be ready to be an adult when I didn't even get the chance to be a teenager like everyone else. I can't do it. I just want to end it. I've been slowly getting to that point, and the past few weeks have made it even more rapid.  


This post isn't really a cry for help or anything if I'm being honest. My mind is made up. I don't know why I'm posting it honestly. I guess I just want someone to tell me that I was actually the victim here instead of my mother's gaslighting.

I'm sorry.
