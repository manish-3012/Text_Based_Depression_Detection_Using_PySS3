My adult life is being ripped into shreds in front of meI don't see any future for me.  I'm 24, been taking care of my family since I graduated from high school, have had no chance to go to college because I had to work to pay bills(ALL of it), my mother is dying, my father is disabled and I seriously despise him.  Now my mother is going to go away and leave me with this piece of shit to take care of.  I don't think there's any future for me.  I have had a horrible past, and when I look into the future, I only see my situation getting worse.  I feel like I've missed out on everything life has to offer and now I'm a bitter 70 year old man in a 24 year old's body... I need some advice.  Should I run away? Should I just end it and let someone luckier take my space? I'm tired of looking after others and see my own life being ripped into shreds right in front of me.
