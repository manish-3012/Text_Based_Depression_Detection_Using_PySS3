My dad just died. I don't know what to do.Hi.

You can call me Jake; but thatâ€™s not my real name. Itâ€™s a nice name to have though.

Iâ€™m not exactly suicidal. Sure, Iâ€™ve thought about it. But not in the sense most people do; at least not in the sense I think most people do. But I really need to talk to someone and I hope you can spare a few minutes.

As a person, Iâ€™m as generic as it gets. I feel joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and every other emotion a human being generally does. I like having people around. I like my friends. I love my family. Iâ€™m concerned about the current political situation. Iâ€™m very displeased about pollution. I even feed stray dogs and homeless people.

But thatâ€™s only an image; A mask. Whenever Iâ€™m alone I start to talk to myself in second person. Itâ€™s almost subliminal. I tell myself how I shouldâ€™ve done things, and how I should proceed. I teach myself how to blend in, and manipulate.

Iâ€™m very good at using other people to do things for me. When Iâ€™m with people I can get along with anyone. We always have something in common. Something we both love. If I donâ€™t know much about it, I will have by the end of the conversation and the other person would think that I was genuinely interested. I really am, most of the time; at least Iâ€™d like to think so. All in all, I have a lot of friends, powerful and powerless.

I can seem very concerned about other peopleâ€™s troubles and I might even help them to the best of my ability. The truth is that I donâ€™t really care, or feel sad about anyone, or anything. I just think what someone else wouldâ€™ve done and emulate. Years of observation has helped me get very good at this. And once Iâ€™m alone again, I try to find something to keep myself busy. I usually play random scenarios in my head.

Iâ€™ve thought about suicide. Not because Iâ€™d been depressed or sad, or because I had problems in life. ( come to think of it, I never had problems in my life. everything just played out nicely. ) Iâ€™ve thought of suicide as a method to a grand scheme. A well versed, well planned drama. A mystery to remain unsolved for centuries after my death. Itâ€™s already done inside my head. I only have to execute, once there isnâ€™t enough stimulation around and Iâ€™m literally bored to death.

I watch movies. Iâ€™ve watched a lot of sad movies lately. Just to try and feel something. I didnâ€™t cry when Schindler said that he couldâ€™ve saved one more; or when Old Yeller died. But later at night I could force myself to cry by imagining myself in certain tragic situations and then emulating. It was almost real.

Every emotion I feel is emulated. Itâ€™s never real. And I know this is not how itâ€™s supposed to be because Iâ€™ve seen how others act and react. Even in movies and books, they *feel*. So I really want to know. Is this how everyone feels? Are your emotions just emulated to fit the situation too? Or am I deranged?

Why am I writing this now, after 25 years of existence?

I was very close to my father. We have a beer or two every Sunday by the pool, and talk about things; mostly life and politics. I often stay there for dinner. He cooks a very nice steak.

A week ago, I got a call saying that heâ€™s been run over by a car and killed. I didnâ€™t start doing anything until Iâ€™d finished the movie I was watching. And then I called the funeral home, did what a good son wouldâ€™ve done, and went on with my life. I donâ€™t even miss him.

It doesnâ€™t seem right what I did. So I decided to write this, and put it up in the internet so I could get some external advice on how to proceed. and I'm sorry about the edgy title. I had to get as much viewers as possible for a better probability of quality input.
