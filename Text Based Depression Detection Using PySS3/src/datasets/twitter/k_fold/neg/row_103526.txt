I think I'm about done here.It's a battle I've fought with positive music, movies, and people (and a loving wife) as allies but this pain in my chest is going to kill me, and soon. I hope I've made a positive difference and been somewhat of a role model in others' lives, it's all I've wanted to do and I think I've gotten about as far as I can with that. Think it's about time to check out now. Or soon, depending on how long I can find this loneliness and isolation so goddamn morbidly *interesting*.
