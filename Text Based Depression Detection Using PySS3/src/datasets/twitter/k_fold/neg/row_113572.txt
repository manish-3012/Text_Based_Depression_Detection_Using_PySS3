my life is miserableim 17.

my parents are acting like they are gonna get a divorce and i cant help but feel like im part of the reason why.

my ex is accusing me of abuse to all my friends.

my friends are fake as fuck.

im smart but i cant handle school.

i should be going to college next year but im afraid im not going to be able to handle it.

i feel so alone.

i spend every night thinking about how useless i am in the grand scheme of things.

im sorry for letting everyone down.
