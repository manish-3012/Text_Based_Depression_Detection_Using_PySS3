Need some tips on what to do to help a friendA friend of mine has just taken a bunch pills yesterday in the aims of killing themselves. Thankfully it didn't work but they are only regretful of the pain and I'm quite sure they are already thinking of doing it again. Just wanted some help on how to speak to them about it , my friend has never tried to have professional help of any kind because they don't think it will help and feel a burden. My friend has only told me what they did and I really want to help them so any tips or advice is appreciated.
