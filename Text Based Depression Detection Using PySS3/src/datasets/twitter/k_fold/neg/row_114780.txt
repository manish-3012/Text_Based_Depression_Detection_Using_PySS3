I'm at the end of my rope. I just want the pain to end.Here I finally am. Miserable, sad, overwhelmed and full of grief.  To put things in perspective, within the last six months 


-Mom got stage 4 cancer.
-Blew most of my money with an gambling addiction.
-Wound up getting an aggravated DUI.
-Having to leave my long term relationship of over 7 years due to a shitty people and a even shittier environment.
-Car gets vandalized,  and one of my gfs fam just straight up fucks up my gift car. 

I know I'm upset.... but I'm sick of all of the pain.
I literally keep on thinking about suicide, as I just don't want to experience this shit anymore. I'm done with shitty people, shitty relationships, and all of the awfulness I have dealt with. 

I'm honestly am trying to work up the courage to pull the trigger. I just want this shit to end. I cant stand it anymore.
