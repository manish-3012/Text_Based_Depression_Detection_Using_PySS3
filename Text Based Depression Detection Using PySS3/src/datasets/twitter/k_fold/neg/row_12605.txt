Have become increasingly suicidal the last few weeksMy mind literally cannot stop ruminating. I can't thing of a single day where I got a break. I'm so mentally exhausted. I truly don't want to deal with this mind anymore. 

I tried hanging myself several times against my bed, just to feel what it's like to experience losing consciousness. I'm holding onto the belt so it'll loosen when I start fading out, so I won't kill myself. But I just really wish I could. 

I just want to see hope again
