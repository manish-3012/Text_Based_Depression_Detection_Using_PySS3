Help. The only thing keeping me going was studying to be a personal trainer. And I just broke my knee. Talk to me and make me see why I should keep going.I've broken my knee before but I just wasn't expecting it to happen again.

The reason I feel so horrible is because I came from a ghetto immigrant family and I clawed my way through school and through college at the best public one of my state. I had a great life but for 2 years now that I've graduated I can't find a job I'm good at and I just got fired. After a horrible week of trying to figure out what the hell I'd do I decided to do my passion and be a personal trainer. I am pretty fit but after having to work extreme hours before getting fired I have gotten the most out of shape of my life. I was pumped to get back on my fitness and make it a career I would at least enjoy. 

About 2 hours ago I ripped tendons in my knee. I've gone through this before. I will have months of atrophy and physical therapy I will need to do before I can be self sufficient again and I can't afford the mri. I think it would be so much easier to kill myself. It's really tempting. But I have brothers. I'm most like their mother. What should I do?
