Everything's falling apart.I cant anymore. Everything I knew is crumbling into my hands, and I cant fucking deal with it anymore. This is hopefully my last post before I end it on Monday. I just hope that my family understands. Today, I realised that my friends wouldnt even care if I did it. Everything I've ever told myself turned out to be true, and I'm going to get relief.
