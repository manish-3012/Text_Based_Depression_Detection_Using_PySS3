I really need a friend.I have been very depressed lately. My life has been in ruins since October when my long-term girlfriend cheated on me. I kept thinking that I had everything held together but I was quite wrong. I've had a few flings since then but they've all crashed and burned (and none because of me!).

I've dealt with depression for over four years. It comes and goes in waves, as I'm sure many of you know. I've never wanted to kill myself but the thought of death and the fragility of life consumes me at times. I don't know if I'm suicidal but I can feel the hopelessness start to sink in.

I don't have any consistent friends in my life. I go entire days without talking to someone. I dearly need someone in my life who truly cares about me. And not because they feel sorry for me but because they value my existence and enjoy conversing with me. I have so much to offer. I'm joining the Peace Corps in a year or two. I've been digging into standup comedy. My personality isn't a bummer. I just... fail to reach out to people.

So, I guess you could say this is my "cry for help". Is that how this works? Is this how desperate I am now? Trying to make friends on the basis of myself slowly possibly becoming suicidal? Another reason to make my life feel like a joke.
