Im scaredEveryday the idea of ending it all gets more appealing, i don't enjoy life, im lonely and always looking for an escape but it's not a long term solution, so killing myself feels more real everyday, life just doesn't get better and i don't know what to do i am so lost and tired of all this already, what can i do to start enjoying life? i feel like im not looking life from the right angle and i don't want to die but im afraid i may do it someday. Help me please.
