The pain is too much, and my will to deal with it is gone.My will to live is just gone now. It just feels like my body's given up, and telling me to just throw in the towel, and let myself die. I'm constantly in pain from loneliness, and skin hunger, as well as just emotionally fucked up beyond help from my abusive parents. I'm in constant physical pain due to my psychological problems...that's how bad it is.

The pain is becoming unbearable Its been a 7 all day and random times spikes to a 9, and this has been near constant in my life for months now. I just can't take it. I'm not like other people. I'm beyond help. I just...I just...I just can't take it. Too much stress, too much pain, too much...too much...too much...too much...I can't...I can't...

Sad thing is, I'm just trying to get through basic things  in life and it's causing me all this...I'm not even able to eat right now. There's no hope for me to live any manner of life or to get better. I've been trying for so long now... Not to mention that all my friends seem fair-weather, and just run off or stop talking when I try to express my suffering, and my therapist can't at all after the meetings we have are over...I'm alone, and I'm failing...

I'm just drained...I'm just a freakish mess of a mistake...I'm just done...

There never was a point to keeping on living, and now I can't keep pushing myself in absence of that. There's nothing to make all this pain worth it...Its not that I want to die, but I just literally can't do it anymore...
