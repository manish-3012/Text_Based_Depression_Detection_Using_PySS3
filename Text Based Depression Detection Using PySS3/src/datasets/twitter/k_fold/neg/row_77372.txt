I (31F) really messed my life up and I donâ€™t have any hope.My family has always been shitty to me. I donâ€™t speak to my family anymore because of it. I speak to my mom on the phone once a week and I speak to my brother on birthdays and holidays. My sister and father I have no contact with. Extended family, I grew up isolated from, donâ€™t speak to them either.

I donâ€™t have friends, like I mean there isnâ€™t a single person in the world I can call on the phone and have casual conversation or otherwise with. There is not one person I can call. 

My husband and I got married last year. I knew he was schizophrenic. I knew his family is antisemitic, as his mom saluted Hitler in front of me knowing Iâ€™m Jewish but I married him anyway.

We werenâ€™t even in contact with his family much until he stopped taking his meds and the psychosis relapsed and he couldnâ€™t function at work. He is staying at his parents house because I was stressed out by his psychosis and it was triggering suicidal thoughts and all I can keep thinking is how much I fucking hate his family like if there were zero repercussions I would want to actually cause physical harm to his mother.  I also am really angry he would jeopardize our finances and his ability to work by not taking his meds.

I feel really alone, like I have no reason to live and like I need to divorce my husband if I donâ€™t want to kill myself.

Divorce and starting my life over seems harder than killing myself.

I donâ€™t know Iâ€™m just fucking exhausted and have no emotional support whatsoever

I feel like a failure and like I made poor naive decisions and now Iâ€™m paying for it

I feel like what I want out of life doesnâ€™t matter, my existence doesnâ€™t matter and it feels like it wonâ€™t ever get better.

-Cheers
