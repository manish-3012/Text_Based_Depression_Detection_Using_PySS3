I almost killed myself over her ... now I'm begging her just to speak to me again ... ?! wtf is wrong with me?I was hurt by someone I really cared about over unrequited love. I've been through this before ... seriously, I'd sell my left nut just to be stuck in the "friendzone" at this point but she won't even talk to me and I can't get closure.

How do I make it stop? I don't want legal trouble for being a "stalker" ... I don't want to kill myself. I just never had any luck with those head shrink people and I'm fucking lonely and I'm fucking miserable.

I don't want to die I just don't have a lot to live for, I don't have a support system and I'm really, really unhappy and painfully misunderstood by some of the people I thought I knew better than anyone.

I need to let go. How do I let go?
