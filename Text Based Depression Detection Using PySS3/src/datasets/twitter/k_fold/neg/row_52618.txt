A boy just did it last nightI feel really fucked up by knowing that everyone I know can just blow up and finish their lives. Knowing that in this moment, there are a lot of people in the same situation that I am, just fighting day after day against the feeling of emptiness, just make me lose my faith in what I believe. 
You, I know it's a heavy weight that stands on your shoulders, but be alive one more day. That's what I'm trying to do. And if you wanna talk, please text me.
