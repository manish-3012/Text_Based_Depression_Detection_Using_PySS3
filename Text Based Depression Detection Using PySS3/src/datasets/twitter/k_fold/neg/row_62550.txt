A bigger attemptI tried taking about 10 over the counter pills on Friday night mixed with 7 shots. Was not really much, didnâ€™t even throw up but regretted it halfway through. Now itâ€™s Sunday night and I regret not doing more now that I no longer have access fo that stuff. I have wine and my antidepressants, Iâ€™m going to take those and hope I donâ€™t wake up.
