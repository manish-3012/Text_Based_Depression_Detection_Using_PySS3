BF is suicidal... but not sad or depressed?So... my boyfriend has been in a suicide rehab center for the last month. He says that he's just over life. He's not sad, not depressed, generally enjoys stuff, but is also just over it all. He says it would just be easier to be dead. Now, I've never heard of anything like this before, I haven't been with a guy who's been suicidal, but I do have a friend who was in the Army who battles with depression and "dark thoughts" all the time... but I feel like this is a whole different animal. My army friend owns firearms, is well off financially, but dealing with things from his service time falls into depression a few times a year, but has never tried to take his life (given that he has firearms, I'm surprised.) But.. my boyfriend on the other hand, isn't depressed... isn't sad... is still doing all of the things he loves, sports, video games, occasional trip to the bar, etc. and usually seems like he's in a really good mood...  but for some reason he just doesn't feel the need to be here anymore. It's been a really difficult thing for me to understand, and it's starting to take a toll on me. (Not that I'm getting suicidal, but I'm just confused, having never dealt with this situation... I just don't understand how anyone can possibly think that way?)

Has anyone else dealt with this before and if so.. what/how did you approach it?
