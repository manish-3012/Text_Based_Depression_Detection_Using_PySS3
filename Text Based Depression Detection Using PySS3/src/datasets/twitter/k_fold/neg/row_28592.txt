i dont know what to do anymoreall i want to do is kill myself. having faith in god doesnt help and it only makes me feel more ungrateful to my god. i dont know what to think. i can be fine for a few minutes or even hours... then im just back to wanting to die. i cant stand a person like me living on this planet, but im too much of a pussy to actually do it. i cant focus on work. id tell my mom, but the last time i told her about my problems, i made her cry. i dont want to make her cry anymore. im sorry for making you guys read my pointless vent
