Considerations and the LikeMy first post here and all I can say is... there is a lot of backstory pretty much. Ever since 2014 I have had frequent thoughts of suicide and tried three times already. At the time I was suffering depression and the main reasons were being unemployed, still being single, no car, no license, and being hung up over a girl I had a lot of love for and still kinda do.

It is 2015 and the girl has left town, I do have a job, car, and license now yet I still feel like a massive failure since she left for a university and I am still here with a degree from an unimpressive school working my first job getting low hours. I have been told to seek help but I am conflicted on it since I am getting low pay and one of the people that suggested it to me is seeking help and slowly going insane it seems like. A parent that can help me out refuses to let me get help since they are convinced that once I go on the pill, I will commit suicide definitely instead of thinking about it. Plus said parent is afraid of me changing and making their life worse because of mental instability. Also doesn't help that they are afraid that if I get help, that info will leak out and I will NEVER make it in life and will be considered a retard for life losing any chance of getting a good job.

I feel guilty for feeling this way since I got what I wanted for the most part, and a friend even said the same thing that I should not feel depressed because things are going well for me. It just doesn't help that I still think about this girl and how I am so behind compared to her and others I know. I feel like I came in late, and have no chance so why exist? Why exist when I am just completely screwed in terms of what I can do with my life? I will never get that girl, will never get a girl period, and simply I lead an existence where no one likes me despite being told otherwise.

What should I do?
