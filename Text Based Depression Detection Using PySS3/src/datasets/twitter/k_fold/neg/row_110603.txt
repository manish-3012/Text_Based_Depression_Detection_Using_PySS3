Do people genuinely believe you can just "drop everything and do something crazy"?That's common advice I see, lots of people saying "just leave the situation that's making you suicidal or depressed". I've got a decent amount of savings, enough to fund "just doing something crazy" like randomly traveling around or whatever. But I've worked for 2 years to save that amount up, and would likely chew through a lot of it in the process. Would I be happy just being back at square one? No one in my life would respect a decision like that, either. I don't like my job, I'm certain I'd be happier somewhere else, but it's easy and secure. Maybe it contributes to my wanting to die, but I feel like I'd just end up worse off if I packed my bags, flew to Australia or Thailand or Germany or wherever else and just tried to make it work. Yet when I say I don't like my job, and I don't like the place I'm living, etc, people tell me to just quit, drop everything and do something wild. Go to my dream state or my dream city or my dream country and just see if I can make it work. Just go hiking in some mountains or go partying in Mexico or something.

It just doesn't make sense to me. No, I can't "just" do that. I'd lose a bunch of money that I might need for something else. What if it doesn't work, then I'm really in trouble. Nobody would support doing something like that, especially not my parents (who are super meticulous planners and don't support anything done without a plan). I'm 26, I don't answer to them anymore, but still, it would dampen my enthusiasm for sure. It seems totally unfeasible and irresponsible. Yeah, staying in the same place might wear me down enough to hurt or kill myself, but isn't it better to stay in the crappy situation and just try to work on personal things I'm dissatisfied with instead of just picking up and hauling off somewhere else? I just wanted to get some thoughts. It seems totally ridiculous to me. Yeah, I've got nothing to lose, but if I pull out all the stops and it doesn't work I'll just want to die worse anyway.
