One of my friends is planning to do it and I don't know what to do.One of my friends has struggled for months, and I've tried my hardest to help them, but they don't seem to be listening. They sent me a message today saying that they are going to end their life on May 1st, at 3:50pm. I don't know what to say to them anymore, I've told them that it isn't worth it,  something along the lines of that, multiple times. I've been talking to them for hours on end trying to talk them out of it but they are very determined. I'd appreciate it if any of you can help out. Thanks in advance. &lt;3
