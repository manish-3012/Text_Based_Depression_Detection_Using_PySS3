Iâ€™ve said my goodbyes, what now?I didnâ€™t really give context to the 3 people who I speak with on not even a daily basis. I just said I wouldnâ€™t be around and needed time alone. I have made up my mind. I just donâ€™t know how to do it. Do I leave a note? Do I just do it? I donâ€™t want my family to find me. Iâ€™m worried about my cats honestly. I donâ€™t live alone, but what if they give them up for adoption? That is honestly the hardest part for me. 
I know Iâ€™m rambling. I have just had so many anxiety attacks in the last 24 hrs. I feel like my heart wonâ€™t slow until it stops. No one has ever taken me seriously and my parents think my mental illness and self harm are BS.

Guess I never grew out of this phase, mom. Only took 10 years and a suicide method.
