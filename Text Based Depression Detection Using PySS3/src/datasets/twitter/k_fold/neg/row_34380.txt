help convince me to waiti already took some stuff today, honestly i could take my sleep med and go to sleep now and i'd probably feel better tmrw morning, but i have literally zero interest in that. i want to literally just take everything and hope i just never wake up again.

no one's going to convince me to not kill myself because i'm so done, but things are somewhat better when i'm busy at work, and my therapy appointment is on tuesday. so. convince me to wait until tuesday.
