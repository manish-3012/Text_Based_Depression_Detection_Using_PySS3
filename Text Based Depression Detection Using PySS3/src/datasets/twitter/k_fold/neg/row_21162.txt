I just want someone to hug me and tell me itâ€™s gonna be okayI canâ€™t get through a lot of the pain Iâ€™ve been going through for years. I feel out of place everywhere I go. Sometimes I think the pain Iâ€™ve felt for years will never go away, and if it wonâ€™t thereâ€™s no point continuing this life, if all Iâ€™m gonna be is miserable for the rest of it. I really just wish someone that understands what Iâ€™m going through would tell me that itâ€™s gonna be okay, that Iâ€™ll be able to pull through. Therapy dosent work, meds donâ€™t work. I feel absolutely hopeless 90 percent of the time just pushing through it on the smallest shred of hope that maybe the next day Iâ€™ll finally be happy again.
