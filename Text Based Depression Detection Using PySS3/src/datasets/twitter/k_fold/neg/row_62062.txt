15. don't know what to do. everything hurts. I don't care about anyone everything hurts it seems. I've talked to so many people and no ones helping. I've been to two physiologists. and both thought I was good and healthy. about two months ago I was going to kill myself. and the boy I love stopped me. we dated for a few months and just became best friends after. he's completely over me and was at the time I was going to kill myself. he was pretty much the only reason I agreed to not kill myself. now he started liking this girl who likes him back. I'm completely crushed I can feel all my suicidal feelings rushing back to me. no ones helping. my friends and my family don't seem to matter. people say I need to distance myself from this kid to get over him but he's my best friend and the only reason I stayed alive. I dont want to be here. everyone makes me sad. I feel like everyone I. this world is terrible and I don't know what to do if I feel like the only reason I'm alive is slipping away. my friends say I have so much to live for and if I wait I'll be fine. but who am I kidding this pain is too great and I don't know how else to cope. I'm about to kill myself and I don't care who's sad about it
