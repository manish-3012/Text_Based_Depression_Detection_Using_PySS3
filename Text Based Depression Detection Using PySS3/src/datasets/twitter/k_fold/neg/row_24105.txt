Hospital wonâ€™t admit suicidal roommate please helpPlease remove this if this is the wrong sub for this but I donâ€™t know what else to do.  I am located in Canada and my roommate has gone to the ER five times in the last 8 months with suicidal thoughts or actions. Two nights ago she was discharged from an overnight stay at the hospital after an attempt even though she made it clear she felt she was not in control of her actions and is a danger to herself. The hospital refuses to admit her because she was not in critical condition at the time the ambulance got to her but it is very apparent that she needs immediate and intense care. My question is if it is legal for the hospital to discharge and refuse to admit a patient that has suicidal plans? Iâ€™ve taken her to two different hospitals and one wanted to admit her but our address was out of their district and the other hospital near us weâ€™ve been to 6 times counting today and theyâ€™ve refused admit her every time even though she has physically harmed herself and admitted to have plans of suicide. I donâ€™t know what to do if they donâ€™t take her and I am so scared that this will discourage her enough to throw her into another spiral. I need help and I feel like there are no options, I am her closest thing to a guardian where we are and I donâ€™t feel like I can keep her safe anymore
