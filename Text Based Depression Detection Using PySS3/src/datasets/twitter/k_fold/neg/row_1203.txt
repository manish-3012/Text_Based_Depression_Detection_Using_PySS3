need someone to keep me occupiedI'm feeling really self-destructive and could do with someone to talk to, to tell me what the sensible thing to do would be, or at least keep me at the computer for a while longer. I'd call a hotline or something but my anxiety means I'm not really okay with talking on the phone.
