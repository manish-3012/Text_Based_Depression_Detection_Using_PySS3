Getting diagnosed with an STI; the straw that breaks the camel's back.Hey guys. Throwaway time. I was doing so well for so long. Now I find out Monday if I have herpes. I can barely afford the initial doctor's appointment, I dunno how I'd be able to finance any medication. I think now is the best time more than ever. I've just been crying in bed for days. I've attempted suicide twice prior, once 4 years ago and once 3 years ago. But things are bad again. I'm a waste of space and a leech on society. I'm not 100% sure the purpose of this subreddit. I just need someone to talk to.
