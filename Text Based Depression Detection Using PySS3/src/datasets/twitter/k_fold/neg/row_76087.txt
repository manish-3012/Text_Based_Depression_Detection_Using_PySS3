I cant take it anymore....Im losing hope in my life every day. My parents are arguing every even because of stupid things like what lunch will be on next day. My father is just asshole being and yells at me when i do anything wrong or beats me when i dont do what he says or when i reply "no" on his command. He yells at my mom and usually calling her "bitch". One night few days ago i heard them arguing and i heard father telling mom that he is with her only because of kids(me and my younger sister). Its even harder for me when i dont have any place to lock myself alone, our house is very small and i have room with my sister and mom. I really enjoy time when he isnt home, which isnt really often, because when he is home, he sits hours while smoking cigaretes and drinking alcohol. He luckily doesnt get very drunk. 

I just cant take how he is so unfair to us, when he does anything wrong he allways says its fault of me or fault of my mother and way more unfair things he does. He ruins my life. I think about suicide more and more. 

I think only way to escape this is wait until i turn 18 and move out, but last 2 years i dont feel like my life will get better.
   
  Also i want to mentoin that im on gymnasium school and its very hard, especially when i have depressions and losed motivation to study or do something with my life.

Im writing this because my father couple moments ago called me that i got problems in school and when he returns from work, he will probably beat me. 

I feel like trapped in this damn hole for years and i cant do anything with that. Its like prison.
