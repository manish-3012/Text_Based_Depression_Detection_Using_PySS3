late night ramblingidk if this is the right place to post it or whatever, but i havent told anyone in my life anything thats going on. if i did tell them, i fear of being belittled and mocked, even by my parents, who would see it as an excuse for me to not grow up. i took a bottle of sleeping pills around 6 pm last night. i had what i could only describe as an out of  body experience. i listened to my playlist i made, put on my favorite tv shows, and hoped to pass out and eventually sleep forever. was i wrong. my parents and i had a talk when i went downstairs for a glass of water and i was completely out of it. my legs didn't work, i felt like a newborn deer. i stumbled around downstairs, almost falling. my legs felt like lead. i was hallucinating pretty badly, and eventually made it back upstairs to my room where i fell asleep for about an hour. i thought it had been two days. it was the strangest experience of my life. during the night, i mustve puked on myself and my floor and pee'd myself too. i thought it was all a dream, i still can't believe it happened. the thoughts that i had last night are appalling. i havent stopped shaking since yesterday, and my heart feels like its constantly racing. i don't know how to feel, i just dont feel the same.
