I've lost my will to liveI'm 26 I have never had a job that stuck for more then 6 months, I suffer from anxiety and depression I failed out of college and I can't seem to deal with social situation. I used to have someone that made my life OK she was my everything and I pushed forward for her. But after seven years she came out as a lesbian and I'm broken. I'm now living in another state away from my two other friends that i never saw anyway, with my parents. They are wonderful and supportive but it doesn't change that I don't want to live anymore. I am alone she was my first everything, and I don't want anyone else. I planned on proposing in December, I was ready to be together forever. I can't have her back no matter what I do and that hopelessness has sapped me of the little bit of feeling I had for staying. Now the only reason I'm alive is because I'm too scared, but I'm hoping that changes soon.
