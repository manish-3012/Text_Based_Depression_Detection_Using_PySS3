Do things get better?There are so many nights in my life recently that just shows me how much I've missed out on. Always looking for the next best thing or whatever else is out there has never let me enjoy the moment that I'm in. I think about shooting myself in the mouth on a daily basis and I just don't think that's going away this time. I can't do this every day and I don't want to. Everyone can tell me that I should take a break and breathe and accept the inevitable and control what I can. Sadly I don't care about that on such a regular basis. I think about my friends and my family and I still just don't care. I know it's selfish but I seriously wish that at some point in my life I could be selfish without affecting someone else. Why does my life fall on anyone but me? Let me do what I want and end this where I see fit. Does it get better? I don't think it does and it only gets harder year after year. I'm 26 now and would be very happy without keeping on.  I'm not even sure why I'm posting this I just needed to get some of this off my mind and out there somewhere. I'm not even looking for anything in response I just want someone to know how alone I feel on such a daily basis...
