Tomorrow is the day.I will spend today doing small talk with my ill mother and little brother. I will smile, I will laugh, I will make silly jokes, I will try to be happy today for them. Come tomorrow I won't be here to be able to care anymore. I won't be around to worry about the sacrifices I've made to support this family that I love from my heart. I will not be around to worry about unemployment and the bills I have to pay. I will not be around to worry about how to pay for the next meal for this family. I will not be around to worry when my mother's illness gets worse soon, I will not be around to worry about the tears of my little brother. This country sucks, it fucked me over and over, I asked for help relentlessly for a long time, and everyone just turned their back on me since I and my problems are not their concern. Come tomorrow, I'm out, and I will not be around to care about anything. I will be nothing.

I know you don't care about me either, I'm a few thousand miles away from you anyway, you shouldn't care. Have a great life.
