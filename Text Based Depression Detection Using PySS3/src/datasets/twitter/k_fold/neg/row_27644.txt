Have I been poor long enough to learn the value of a dollar?When will I have been poor long enough to be said to understand what the value of a single dollar is? I have to say it's rather frustrating, because I happen to think maybe it's over valued by the rich when it comes to the wages of people that are poor, yet undervalued when it comes to themselves. It seems like some rich people don't understand why the poor can't just not be poor, and the pull yourself up by your own bootstraps mentality is a double standard if your bootstraps are broken, and you can't afford a new pair. In this case the allegory is mental health and therapy costs, how am I expected to make safe let alone good decisions fiscally or otherwise when some days I have to resort to rationing slices of bread for the days meal?   


That's old school poor, sure I have a roof over my head but I only do for so long while I sacrifice food or utilities. How long do I have to do this before I'm not looked down on for my own decisions? I don't have good mental health, nor the resources to get. Oh I would that I could seek therapy, god I wish I could afford it in either time or money.
