I'm fucking scaredI just wrote out the fucking note.

I'm actually going to do this. If not tonight, then soon. the next few days. Won't even make it to my 21st birthday. Don't even know if I want to make it. 

It's homeless or death, and I won't be fucking homeless. But i'm so god damn scared of the pain that comes with dying. 

Before anyone asks, no I don't have a job and can't get a job. I have crippling depression and dropped out of highschool. I tried holding a labor job but my body can't handle it. I'm just not cut out for life. 

I just needed to tell someone. No one will know that i'm gone since I live alone. I'll print the note out and leave it on the table or something.

I can't stop fucking crying.Jesus this is pathetic.
