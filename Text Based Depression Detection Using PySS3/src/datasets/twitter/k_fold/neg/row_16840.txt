disowned, soon to be alone, doneI've survived some shit: molestation, rape, bullying because of my sexual orientation, abandonment by my biological parents, addiction, anorexia, and homelessness. I've tried to live my life as a proud lesbian, but I am living a lie. I should have been born male. It becomes harder to look at myself every day. Everything about my body feels so wrong: the hips, the tits, my goddamn thighs, my short stature. My girlfriend will leave me if I make any attempt to transition, or if I even come out. She is the only thing keeping me going these days. I will be completely friendless. My friends in the lesbian community hate transgender people and if I transitioned it would be a betrayal of everything they believe in. 

I've recently been disowned by the few in my family who are still speaking to me (most cut me off when I had drug problems at the start of college). I have no family now. The last thing my mother said to me was that her daughter is already dead to her, and now she is just waiting for the day she'll be allowed to bury me. 

I'm unemployed. I just dropped out of school because my thoughts are always racing and I can't stand to be around people. I've failed at everything I set out to accomplish in life. I've even failed at suicide: 7 times. 

Give me one reason not to end it.
