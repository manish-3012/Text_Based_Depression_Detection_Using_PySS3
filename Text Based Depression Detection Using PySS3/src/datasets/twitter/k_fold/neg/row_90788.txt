So, a year ago today, I posted on here saying i had taken all my zoloft and was prepared to die.I took exactly 32 pills. 2150mg in total. It was all i had left.

None of you will remember me because ive long since deleted the account and the post. 

I had my suicide note written, a note for my neighours. I treated myself to snacks and cigarettes for my last night. I remember taking them at 8pm exactly and after doing my last shop at the corner shop i lay in bed and waited. 

The only contact i had throughout the night were all of you on here. I talked to so many of you. I wish i remembered the conversations but the details are kind of a blur. 

So, obviously i lived. Im here 1 year later and on this anniversary it legitimately feels surreal. 

Ive made progress; i left my abusive boyfriend, im surrounded by my family who love me and support me, i have a part time job, i go out for walks every day. Ive taken up hobbies, im seeing a therapist.

I still have my low days, ive been very low lately due to the heat, this anniversary, physical problems and dating issues. 

One thing has stood out for me though, throughout this year ive had these odd moments of clarity. Something enjoyable will happen and its always small, and ill think "im glad I was alive for this." 

Discovering a new hobby, meeting new people, playing a new game, having a fun board game night, a good time with friends. Maybe only half a dozen instances...even having one of them was worth living for.

Every issue I had, there was a way to deal with it. Some of them took time, some needed support and some required bravery (the hardest by far leaving my ex. It was such a weight lifted from my shoulders...realising im not a bad person or crazy) 

Some of you here, that felt like i did last year, may get angry at a post like this. I know id be angry.  Id think it wasnt so bad for them or they just dont get it. 

Ive learnt a lot over this year, hitting rock bottom and surviving may have been the best thing to ever happen to me. It forced me to change my life. I am one of the lucky ones. 

Im not sure what the point of this post is, today just feels weird. I have no one around me to talk to about this and i dunno, maybe it could give one or two people on here perspective. 

I also wanted to say thank you to you all, you have saved one person from suicide &lt;3
