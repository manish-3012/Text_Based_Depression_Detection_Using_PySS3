I'm ready to dieI am so horribly useless. I really don't have anything to live for and all of this constant effort is driving me to insanity. I really need to find something to help my family get through my death. I hate to think about what I'm going to leave behind, but I have to do it. Well, I suppose I don't have to, but I really want to. I want nothing as much as I want to die, actually. The plan was to go to Mexico to get my hands on some Nembutal, but I don't have the money for that. So an overdose of antidepressants will have to do. The pain doesn't matter to me. It's the fact that I'm leaving my family such a horrible thing to deal with that really hurts. I doubt anybody will have the answers but please, if you can think of anything I can do that will help my family deal with my death, I would really appreciate it. I'm ready, and I have been for a long time. The thought of dying relaxes me. But the aftermath fills me with dread and anxiety. Anything to make it less horrible for them would make me happy. Thank you.
