If my girlfriend leaves me I am going to kill myselfI have a wonderful amazing girlfriend but it seems she is drifting further away from me and today she suggested we started talking less. I have hardly any friends and am not close with my parents and I don't tell them much  so I dont have anyone to really help of she does leave me. If she does I am positive I will kill myself.
