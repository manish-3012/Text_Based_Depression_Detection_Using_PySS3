Why do I get more suicidal as the years go by? Especially on my birthday.I donâ€™t really know why but Iâ€™ve pretty much had suicidal thoughts since I was 12-13( Iâ€™m 15 now) and they all intensify on my birthday or around that time. When I was 13, I thought about self harm, even tried to inflict it, and when I was 14, I did self harm, I did so again this year. My family gives me a really hard time, theyâ€™ve always put me at a loss, they never knew what was good for me. My parents simply expected me to be aware of everything. 
I wish I could just leave everything. I feel so free whenever Iâ€™m away from them. My feelings are conflicted, itâ€™s sort of like. I want to die but then again I donâ€™t..

Yes. Iâ€™m ashamed of my parents and siblings, I think that they are one of the most useless people that Iâ€™ve ever come across.

What do I do? My own problems ruin my friendships.
