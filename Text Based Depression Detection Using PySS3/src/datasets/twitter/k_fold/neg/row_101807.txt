I am inexorably going to kill myself soon.Hi, everyone,  

  

I know it's a bit of a delicate subject and I'm not going to go into detail because unfortunately the situation is complex and even I would have a hard time describing what's happening to me; I'm not one of those people who have a lot of problems.  

  

Since last August, I have been officially calling myself depressed. I used to get depressed a lot in the past, but this is now a permanent situation. A "functional" depression since the autopilot starts as soon as I get up on Monday morning and ends on Friday afternoon, when I'm finally done with my 9-5. From then on I find myself in a total depression, with constant death wishes that clearly will take me to the grave sometime soon.  

  

I am seeing a therapist but unfortunately it doesn't change anything. I don't feel anything negative as soon as I walk out the door. It's always the same for me. As soon as I start talking to someone about it, my old instincts prevent me from feeling empathy towards myself and I treat the situation as if it were temporary. Or without really being able to convey the urgency of my condition. I'm no longer afraid of death or pain at all.  

  

Nothing seems to work. I am gradually detaching myself from everything that connects me to life, except running and sleeping, during which I float.  

  

I'm just getting a little tired of always believing that it's going to get better soon. It's been like this for years.
