What is the point?What is the point of being alive if when we die we donâ€™t remember any of it? Itâ€™s really only worth living if you are happy. Being sad, depressed, and anxious all the time is fucking miserable. I have friends and family that I care for as they care for me. All I seek is affection, someone to care for and vice versa, Iâ€™ve been through 3 heart breaks in the past 6 months all from the same shit. Itâ€™s all a fucking game to these peoppe, and I am so done with it. I was studying to become a doctor but honestly I just fucking hate people now so why fucking bother helping them. When does shit actually work out for me, because I will lose my mind if I keep going like this. I am not happy or satisfied even tho people wish they could have my life. I wish they would honestly this ainâ€™t worth it.
