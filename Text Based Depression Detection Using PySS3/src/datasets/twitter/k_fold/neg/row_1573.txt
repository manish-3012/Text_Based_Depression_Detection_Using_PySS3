Bored and ready, but scared.As the title says. Iâ€™m so bored with life. Iâ€™m not sure why. I have a great fiancÃ©, 3 wonderful children and one on the way, we travel, we have a disposable income so weâ€™re able to enjoy ourselves... Iâ€™m young. I just turned 23 in March. Iâ€™ve seen and done it all. Iâ€™ve been to every continent outside of Antarctica. Iâ€™ve been to all 50 of the US states. Iâ€™ve worked some of the coolest jobs. I have someone who loves me and wants to spend his life with me. 

Yet, Iâ€™m just so bored. I cry in bed at night for hours, until around 7/8 AM. No sleep at night. As soon as I feel sleepy, the kids wake and I have to start mom duties. Everything is so monotonous and sometimes I wish I could have a new life. Iâ€™m blessed in terms of what Iâ€™m able to do with my life and what I have done, but it all came so quick. Whatâ€™s there for me to do now? Nothing is interesting. Every day is the same. Every day will be the same until I retire and my kids are out of the nest. 

I am just so uninterested in life and I feel ready to go. I wouldâ€™ve been gone already if I wasnâ€™t terrified of committing. Iâ€™m not scared of what comes after for me. Iâ€™m scared of how it will affect my children and the mental of whoever finds me. 

I guess that Iâ€™m stuck in this depressing, monotonous loop forever. I just wish I could escape for a day.
