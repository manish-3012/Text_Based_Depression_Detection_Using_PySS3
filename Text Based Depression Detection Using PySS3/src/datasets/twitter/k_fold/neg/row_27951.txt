Iâ€™m tired of being tiredThis is the second time Iâ€™ve written this out, maybe a message from the universe itâ€™s a waste of effort but whatever 

Iâ€™ve been fighting against suicidal thoughts since I was about 13. Always though one day I would go through with it but just never did. Kept fighting.

Iâ€™m 20 now, and Iâ€™m so tired. I donâ€™t wanna fight it any more.
Everything reason I had for living is slowly but surely being pulled out from under me.
I donâ€™t want to go on feeling empty any more, or feeling like a worthless horrible person.

Therapy hasnâ€™t helped, meds havenâ€™t helped, loving parents and partners and friends havenâ€™t helped.

Iâ€™ve already written a letter to my mom, telling her I love her a lot and to not be sad. 
I donâ€™t know if I want to write one to my partner. I love them a lot but theyâ€™d be much happier with me gone- at least then they could go and be with the woman they love who isnâ€™t me.

I still donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this, tbh
