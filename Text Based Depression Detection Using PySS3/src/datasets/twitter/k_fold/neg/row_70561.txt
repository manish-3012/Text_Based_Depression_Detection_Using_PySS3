I'm quitting antidepressantsI'm done taking meds that just numb everything in life, I'd rather have pain then feel nothing at all. and maybe I'll finally get the willpower to kill myself, I'm supposed to be on 75 mg of sertraline  but 3 days ago I just stopped and you know what? I dont regret it, if I dont quit meds I wont ever be able to kill myself nor will I feel anything good or bad
