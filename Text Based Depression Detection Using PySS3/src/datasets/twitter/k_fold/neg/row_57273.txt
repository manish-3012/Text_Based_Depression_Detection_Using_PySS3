On the verge of ending it all...I'm reaching the end of the rope with my depression due to a myriad of things. I suffer from chronic pain due to 4 surgeries I've had from a rare disease I developed in my early twenties that was caused by health issues growing up. I suffer from TMJ issues that cause severe pain and limit the amount of talking I can do on a daily basis which makes life very hard. 

On top of the health/depression issues, I suddenly lost my job/career of 4 years earlier this year when trying to come back from disability due to my latest surgery - cited for job abandonment because I didn't return to work promptly when my doctor released me back (left town to propose to the love of my life). I am now unemployed, facing bankruptcy soon due to ~$75k in credit card debt due to medical bills, being out of work because of the surgeries and failed side businesses as an entrepreneur. I will soon lose my car and dignity when filing for bankruptcy - I feel very defeated. Oh and the girl I am in love with and proposed to earlier this year turned me down because she wasn't ready and didn't like that we lived in different states - even though I've been working to relocate to live closer to her. 

I am battling severe depression due to the chronic pain, health issues, financial situation and the fact I can't fathom taking another job that is outside my field due to the fact I worked so hard to get to where I was in my previous career. I don't know what to do anymore and I am having such a hard time working through the depression to get my life back on track. It seems like everything around me is crumbling and all I want to do is throw in the towel and end it all. 

It may sound trivial to some; but the health issues, depression, bankruptcy, loneliness and unemployment is just a lot to handle at once. Ending it seems like the only way out now.
