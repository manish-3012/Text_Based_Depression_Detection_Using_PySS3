The Divided LineHello,

I can't remember the last time that I was happy. If I think about it, I can't remember ever being happy. 

Even though I've been manic or hypomanic or whatever, I never felt good about myself even when I was bouncing all over the place. Does anyone understand that? Does anyone understand what it's like to feel really energetic but still have zero self-esteem and self confidence etc.? It's an empty fucking shell man, feel like a puppet on the string.

And the worse thing is I can feel myself going down again. I don't want to be depressed ever again. I can't take this shit. I can't connect with anybody. And I can't feel good about myself at all without feeling empty. 

And this ain't bullshit, it's true. I wish, I FUCKING WISH TO GOD AND ALL THAT SHIT, I wish that someone could feel this shit. I wish someone could understand. But to me everyone else feels like they're zooming past me at one hundred miles an hour.

I don't want to die, and I don't want to live. Which one is going to win?
