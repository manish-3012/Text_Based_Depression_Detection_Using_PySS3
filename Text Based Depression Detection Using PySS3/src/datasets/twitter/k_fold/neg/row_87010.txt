Help, when to let someone go?I'm afraid, I'm worried, I am concerned. Yet, I am tired, stressed, and also afraid if I lose my friend. She has been depressed for quite a while now, and I've tried everything I can. I supported her, listened to her, and also helped to remind her to take meds or go to her psychiatrist. Nothing helped, and now I'm at the point where, with college and work, with supporting her and my parents, puts quite a strain on my head and my heart, and probably my own well being.

When to let go? I don't want to, but I'm starting to feel that I couldn't do anything anymore that will change something.
