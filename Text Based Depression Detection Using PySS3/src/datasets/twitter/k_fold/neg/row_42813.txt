I can't go on any longer.I have been suicidal for a while, and I only brought it up once in 6th grade but now it seems to have been forgotten by anyone close. I do not think this will help, I just want to get this off my chest if I do end up offing myself soon. My parents seem oblivious to my concerns about my health, so I do not have high hopes of getting better.
