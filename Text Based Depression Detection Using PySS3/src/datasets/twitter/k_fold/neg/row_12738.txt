I feel like everyone hates me and I want to dieAll I want in life is to feel connected to others. I want to have a big group of friends who love me. I feel that I have so much to give yet I feel so desperately alone even though I'm surrounded by people. I feel like life is one big in joke that I'm not a apart of. I feel like every time someone is talking to me, they are waiting for someone better to come along. I feel empty and worthless. I've tried so hard for so long and I feel like I have nothing left to give. I don't know what to do. I'm dulling and stilling at this point.
