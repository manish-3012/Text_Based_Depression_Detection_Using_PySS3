Hi. A friend of mine just ingested 7 pills of 665mg paracetamol in effort to commit suicide. What can I do to help him. Will he be okay? Please this is urgent.It's called panadol joint and each pill has 665mg of paracetamol and he just had 7 pills of it. He would've had more if there was more in the pack but 7 is all he could find. What will happen to him? Will he die?
