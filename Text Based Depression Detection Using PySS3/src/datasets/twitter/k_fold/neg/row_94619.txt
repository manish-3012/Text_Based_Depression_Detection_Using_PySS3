I asked a girl from my friend group if she wanted to get laid. I regret it.She denied and hasnt texted me back since and its been two days. I believe my friends are all angry at me and I'm now casted away from the group. I have no way of knowing because I threw away my cheap phone since I was tired of always looking at it to see if she texted back. I'm a self sabatoging dumbass who doesn't know how to socially interact. I am emotionally immature and thats why I've never had a girlfriend. I'm absolutely pathetic.

I'm such an asshole, why did I even ask her that? I treated her like an object by even asking. I feel so bad, i'm not sure how she  felt about it. And now I may never know. Its 3:00 AM and I'm afraid to go to the study group at 6PM... I shouldn't have asked...I feel...so..empty.... I dont care about getting help anymore because therapy never worked out. They only prescribe me meds. I hate my life. I want to die..

**Edit: Thank you guys for your kind words. They mean a lot to me, especially right now in this moment. I feel dizzy...Its 4:34 AM. I'm going to lay down. Thanks again for helping a broken guy out. Or maybe not so broken, just trying to figure things out...I dunno. thanks alot guys**
