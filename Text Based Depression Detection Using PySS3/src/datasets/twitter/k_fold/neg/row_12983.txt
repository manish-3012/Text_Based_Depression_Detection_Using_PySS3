stuck - suicidalI really feel like dieing so bad. I wish I could fall asleep so peacefully and never wake up, I pray that to god every night before bed. Im a gay in a toxic family, I turned 18 a month ago, and im just anxiety ridden. Ive been like this since as long as I could remember. Its like im too scared to face the world. I don't know but if anyones reading this with any ideas. I don't want to be in this household anymore. so bad it feels like im stuck, even though the door is right there. What should I do?
