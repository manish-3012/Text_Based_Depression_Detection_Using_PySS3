this place is too much for me. i really need to go to hospital or somethingi've been procrastinating about it for a couple weeks now. "i'll do it after this game, i'll do it in an hour, i'll do it tomorrow" ect ect. it's always worked but i'm starting to get tired of it and i really need to go somewhere safe because i'm really really going to hurt myself.

just, how people are here is too much for me. i've posted about it before but, everybody here has a tough love, tell you how it is, sorta attitude. it works for some people but it's not for me and they refuse to understand that.

i cannot work with people (therapists, psychiatrists, ect) who do that shit. it's stupid but i can't. i can't cope with it. i cannot fucking cope with it, that piece of shit attitude or these people anymore.

i just thought these people were going to be different. they weren't. i'm never going to find the right person. i've been trying and trying to work with people in spite of how badly their attitude effects me and it just makes me worse. i can't even tell them that because they'll just go "well we're all you have so put up with it" or something.

i really can't put up with it anymore, i don't know what to do. i just want to die because i can't get away from these people, but i don't want to go to hospital either because it's scary and they have the same attitude.
