Warning: long postI've been struggling with anxiety and panic attacks for a while now, just over a year I think. I decided to tell my boyfriend what was going on because he could tell I was acting weirdly (not wanting to go out due to gear of having a breakdown in front of him) so I told him about it. I could tell it changed something between us and I just left it. Today I found out that he told everyone we know about my anxiety and I got bullied for it saying that I was just attention whoring and that there were people out there with 'real' problems and that I should be feeling sorry for them rather than 'making up stories just for attention.' I became depressed from this treatment and refused to go out for weeks. After confronting him about his backstabbing he called me a needy bitch and dumped me. I'm not doing so well. Someone to talk to would be great.
