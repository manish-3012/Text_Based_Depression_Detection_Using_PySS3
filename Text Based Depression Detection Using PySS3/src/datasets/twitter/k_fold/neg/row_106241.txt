Feels as though I'm approaching the endHi, I'm 17, I have been depressed my whole life and have always desired to just end it. I recently suck out professional help as I've been coming closer and closer to suicide as the years go by (I was actually kind of forced because a friend found out I had tried to killed myself earlier in the day). I have been given medication as well as having regular therapy sessions to try and help with my problems since then.


One thing that I have realized from this experience is that my problems seem to be unable to be helped. I can't identify a cause for my depression, it's always been there and I've really never felt anything because of it. A lot of the questions they ask me I can not answer because I don't know how I feel about things or what causes any of my problems. Nothing seems to have changed with me recently yet things seem to be getting worse. I just seem unable to do anything. In the past three weeks I've been to school 4 times and have not touched a single assignment i need to make up. I can not physically bring myself to do anything. I've never really had any issues in my life (aside from my mental problems) and recently I keep asking myself why I want to kill myself and the only answer I can come up with is that I just want to die. 


The only thing that's holding me back from killing myself is that I don't want to cause problems for other people. I don't want for my family to have to suffer due to my own problems nor do I want for my friends to have to deal with another one of us killing themselves. 


I honestly do not know what to do and i feel that I'm coming closer and closer to the inevitable with each passing day.
