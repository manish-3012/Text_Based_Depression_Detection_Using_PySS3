Thoughts of a depressed college studentI feel done, I can't go on anymore. There's so many people that love me and I'm not broke or am homeless and I feel like such an ungrateful piece of shit for still dealing with these thoughts. I hate myself so much and I wish I could just get into a car wreck or have a terminal illness so I wouldn't let anyone down for taking my own life. I have an amazing girlfriend who would do anything for me and lovely parents but I still deal with major depressive disorder and nothing seems to be working. I can't go back to the doctor or check myself into a mental health clinic because I don't have health insurance and my professors are so done with my shit. I'm just so tired
