I need somebody to reach outThe last year of my life has unraveled all sorts of concepts I had about life and love and God, and I understand now how weak I am and how closed off to people I am and how narcissistic I can be. I'm having a hard time dealing with it all.

Outwardly my life looks great, but inwardly I am so empty. I have gently reached out, just saying hey or how are you, to about 60 people who I thought were my friends, and I have not gotten a single response back. And I feel so alone. Can somebody reach out?

I have attempted suicide haphazardly before (the last time was 6 years ago) and I thought I was done. But now I have a plan and I feel so relieved. When bad thoughts start to come I have begun to think, who cares, I'm going to be done soon, and then I feel light and peaceful. 

I really need help.

I'm a 28 year old male with a family.
