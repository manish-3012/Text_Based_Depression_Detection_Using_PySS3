Just talking.I don't know what normal is. I live in a completely broken house that I can't escape. No father figures, my sister is miles and miles away. I always have to lie to get by and that only makes things worse. Before you say "Just stop lying" I can not. It will literally make things way worse.


Someone saw my self harm scars and called the police and my mother seemed a bit angry when she saw them. Even in the hospital, I never saw that "Look of pity" it was just awkward smiles. I feel she is starting to truly hate me.


I can not trust anymore around me. I can never express my feelings. When I did try to get help, it was always bullshit. One therapist actually made me feel completely worst and I had to lie and mask that.


All I have is these lies, this pain and all this guilt. The only thing that gets me excited is when I can feed my pitiful drug addiction with help from my imagination or thoughts of me dying and floating in an empty void for the rest of my life where I will see and feel nothing.


It's no different form being alive, right?
