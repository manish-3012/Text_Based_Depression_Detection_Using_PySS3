I'm trying...I've been told to suck it up when it comes to my depression and my suicidal thoughts last night. The pain spikes and I can't do anything to stop it. I've been actively resisting strong urges of suicide for about 3 months but everything just seems so futile. It starts small but it keeps inching closer and closer. It starts off as intense scratching, turning into wrapping a belt around the neck to feel what it would be like, and it's currently slashing at my arm. I don't want to die but something inside tries to convince me that it'll help me be at peace if I do.

I've been seeing a therapist, I've sought out help from suicide prevention lines, but it's not enough. It just feels like trying to catch my life, my will to live with a strainer only to catch bits and pieces of myself. I'm still slipping through and I'm seeing more comfort in that sweetening silence. I'm asking for some help while my mind is still lucid enough to realize that my body/mind is asking for something ridiculous.

Please help if you can,

C.
