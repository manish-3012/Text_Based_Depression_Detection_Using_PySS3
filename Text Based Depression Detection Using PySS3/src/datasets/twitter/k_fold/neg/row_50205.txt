I don't want to die but I think I'm nearing the end of my life.I don't want to die, but I'm suicidal. I wish I could change things, I wish I had the will and the courage to change things, but I can't. I'm so scared of sticking around. The intrusive thoughts and the shame and the feelings of worthlessness will not ever go away. I don't want to die, I just want the pain to stop.
