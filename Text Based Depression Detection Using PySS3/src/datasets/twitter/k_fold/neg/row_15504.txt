I feel like killing myselfMy mom died of an overdose 10 days before my 18th birthday i had a shitty childhood filled with addicted parents and I barely graduated high school I really want to go to a university but my grades wonâ€™t let me I canâ€™t get a job because the places Iâ€™ve worked at I only stayed less than a week because I canâ€™t handle labor jobs I have nothing to live for Iâ€™m not gonna be anything in life itâ€™s meaningless
