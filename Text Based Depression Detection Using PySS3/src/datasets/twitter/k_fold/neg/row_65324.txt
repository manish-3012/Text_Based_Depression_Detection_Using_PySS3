I can finally do it.I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 11.  I kept telling myself that life would get better.  Well two years ago I made myself a promise, that if my life doesn't turn around after I put in all my effort, day and night, that I could finally do it without feeling any sadness or guilt, just peace.  
I've tried hanging myself a few times but I pussied out.  I tied a garbage bag over my head and filled it with duster, yet somehow I woke up half an hour later with the bag still over my head.  I wanted to slice my arteries or veins but I couldn't get over the quick action of it.  Now I think I have the solution.  I can hook up a needle or 3 or 4, as if I were drawing blood, but just have it drip into a bucket.  Just chill out, watch some TV while I start to get light headed and go to sleep, like I've wanted for 20 years.
To those that say it will get better, you're partially correct.  It only gets better so it can get even worse later.  I never thought things could work out so well after hard work and then have everything dissolve as if it never happened.  And the one last thing that makes me absolutely sure that I want to die is that I get no sense of satisfaction out of anything I do, ever.  Helping people, projects, jobs, nothing.  And even if I didn't have to worry about work or money, I know life's problems will still follow me to the grave.  There's no point in running from the dragon. 100 billion dollars wouldn't make me change my decision.  At best, it might delay it.  I've got one more month of rent and then I'm going to drain all my blood.  I will also be removing myself from the organ donar list so no one will be able to live a happy life at the expense of my shitty one.
