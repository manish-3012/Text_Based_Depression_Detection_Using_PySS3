Attempted yesterday. I wish i hadn't wimped out.I'm oliver. im 15 and i've had depression for i think 2-3 years now? It runs in my family. i tried to (trigger warning) strangle myself with shoelace yesterday, but i pussed out and i kind of regret it. My girlfriend tried last october and we made a pact to tell each other if we were going to try anything. i broke that pact, i guess. i told one friend and the other two saw it on my blog. i want to attempt again. 

what do i do now? 
(no i canmot talk to a counselor, they dont care and i can't talk to myparents because they just dont want to get me treatment for depression amd puniah me instead??)
