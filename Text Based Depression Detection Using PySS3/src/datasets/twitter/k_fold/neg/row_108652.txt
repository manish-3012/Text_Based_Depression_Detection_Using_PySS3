I'm 16.I'm living the life of a touring DJ.

I have a hot girlfriend round the world from me.

My family does support my career decision.

I'm not really bullied or picked on at school.

And yet;

I'm suicidal.

My arms are filled with 100+ cuts.

My girlfriend hasn't talked to me in months and I'm afraid she's killed herself.

And I can't take it anymore.

But I know you fucks are going to tell me to hold on.

Because I have a great life, according to you.

Because I should be thankful.

Or maybe

Because I'm 16.
