Seeing my boyfriend for the last timeMy close friend committed suicide recently, and I was just sexual assaulted recently also. All I do is rely on friends for places to stay, to eat, and basically live. It's a rare occurance to visit my brothers and sisters. I failed all my classes the last few semesters, no matter how hard I try. I think I'm finally going to end it soon.
