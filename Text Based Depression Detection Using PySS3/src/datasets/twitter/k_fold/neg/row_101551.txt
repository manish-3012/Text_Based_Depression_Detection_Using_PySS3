I called a psych hospital and yOu'LL NEVER gUeSS wHat HapPeNeD nExTsorry for the parody-esque clickbaity title im like desperately trying to make this situation as Comedyâ„¢  as possible bc if i don't i'll succumb to the void 

anyways

so i called a psych hospital because i was spiraling and wanted to, y'know, \~Die\~, but the person on the other end of the phone was extremely curt and blunt and im probably overreacting but in the moment it was quite traumatizing. here's a re-enactment of how the conversation went: 

\~

operator: hello this is \[psych hospital name\].

me, snotting and sobbing all over myself, voice cracking: hey, um, i was just wondering, um, if i were to, um, hypothetically need immediate psychiatric attention, how would that work, hypothetically. 

operator: ..................you have to go to the ER. 

me: oh. i didn't know-- wait, but-- 

operator: go to the ER and they will evaluate you. have a good night. \*click\* 

\~

so like, i absolutely understand the chain of command, or whatever they'd call it, i dunno. but i just-- i don't know, the fact is that there was no way that i was going to go to the emergency room in the middle of a pandemic! hospitals are overwhelmed, and i feel so FUCKED about going to the emergency room because i wanted to die while around me there'd be hundreds of people desperately trying to live, but they can't because they got coronavirus from people who refused to wear masks. doctors and nurses are overwhelmed, i couldn't contribute to that! 

so i called the suicide hotline instead and talked to them for three hours straight while sitting on my roof, legs dangling over the edge. the person on the other end was really nice, and they definitely "talked me down," or whatever, because by the end i was too tired to kill myself, so i just sort of... went to bed.

but these racing, paranoid thoughts keep rocketing around my skull. i just want to not exist anymore, but i don't want my friends and family to be sad about it.

i don't know. i don't know.

also the suicide hotline puts you on hold and they play this optimistic elevator music, and the concept of this is actually so jarring and funny that it lowkey might be the thing that kept me alive.
