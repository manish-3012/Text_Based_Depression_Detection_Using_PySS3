Some questions about antidepressantsSo I've finally decided to get help. I don't want therapy. I don't want counceling. I only want antidepressants. Is it possible to talk to doctor and get only antidepressants without a referral to a therapy session? If it helps, I'm 13 and I plan on telling my parents I've been feeling down lately and that I want to see a doctor about it. Thanks.
