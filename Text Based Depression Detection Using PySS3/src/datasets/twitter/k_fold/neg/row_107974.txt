I fantasize about terrible things happening to meI don't know where else to post this. I think of suicide everyday but this post is not directly about that.

I fantasize about aweful things happening to me. It can range from someone being an asshole to me for no reason to me being falsely accused of something I didn't do and everyone doing terrible things to me that it drives me to the point of suicide and then everyone feeling sorry for me. Does anyone else do this?
