Need to ventSuicidal thoughts aren't new to me. When I was younger and I would face any kind of real hardship the thoughts would creep in. I would think about family and friends and how their life would change and I would be immediately snapped out of the fantasy of death. As the years went by I kept the self destruct button locked away, only to be brought out in times of true duress. 2 years ago I made my first attempt. Actually it was more of an attempt at an attempt. I sat in my bath tub after using a razor to scratch into my arms and thighs. I was never brave enough to do deep damage. I contemplated and contemplated while the water turned cold. I looked over at my hair dryer and the thoughts set in. The cord was long enough to dip in the water and I eventually let in drop in. Obviously it did not work. I had not known that hair dryers these days were made different now so they weren't effective in suicide attempts. Since that moment I've been scared. Scared that I actually had the strength to allow myself to die. Currently I feel as though I'm at a low I've never been to before. I've had depressive episodes before but they were few and far between. It would just feel like I was not comfortable and it was manifesting in a 'gaping hole' feeling in the pit of my stomach. I just felt empty. It didn't last long but this one has. I've taken to distracting myself with drugs alcohol tv and friends but each day it feels like it works less and less. I try not to be one of the people that only look at the negative but I've spent a lot of time thinking about each aspect of my life and finding that I am discontent with each and every single one. I've kept myself alive all this time because I was able to find one thing, at least one thing, worth living for. Now I try and I just feel apathetic. The odds are stacking up against me and my pretty little self destruct button is looking a lot better by the passing day. I'm scared of tomorrow. So scared that I'm considering ending today.
