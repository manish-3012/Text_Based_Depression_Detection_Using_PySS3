Only here for my brotherThe last few years have been agony in all senses of the word. I was diagnosed with a kidney condition that has me writhing in pain when it flares up. While I am vomiting violently my mother shouts at me as if all hell has broken loose saying that I caused this condition and am doing nothing to make it better -  despite the fact that this will not ever get better. 

I failed to get into the second year of A levels. Went to college after that and left after a year because it was not a course I wanted to carry on with - the appeal of it faded. 

I now work with my father as an electrician and plan to start an apprenticeship as an electrician. My mother, however, wants me gone. Constantly reminding me of my failures and comparing me to everyone else who is off doing work or uni.

I feel like the only thing holding me back is the fact I care for my brother.
