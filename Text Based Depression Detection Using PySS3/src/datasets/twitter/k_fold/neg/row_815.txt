chronic pain has taken overI have tried everything for my back problems and they are just going to get worst. I have talked to other places in reddit about relationship problems because of it, and they only told me I was making excuses to not feel better. I don't know anyone who want to willingly feel like this. I have tried ODing 3 times and that doesn't work like it does in the movies. I think the only way is by firearms. Relief of life by police. Pretty sure they will do me the honors if I make them feel threatened. Have had an awesome life up until now, whats the point of continuing in such a awful manner? Why torture myself for and unknown amount of time?
