Wish I was normalI really wish I was normal. I wish I enjoyed life. I wish I had friends. I wish someone cared about me. I wish I had a girfriend. I don't know what it's like to be loved, or even liked, or even wanted tbh. It feels like life is passing me by. I'm so lonely it hurts. I wish I had motivation to try and get better.

The best things in life are free but that doesn't mean everyone has them.
