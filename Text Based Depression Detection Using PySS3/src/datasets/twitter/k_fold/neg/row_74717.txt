Wasted decadeThe memories where I had conflicts with others, when other people insulted me, betrayed me, treated me like garbage, my mistakes, the people I failed, the people I disappointed, they're constantly torturing me...

Ten years of being a clown, of having few friends, drifting away from most people, and not learning how to love myself... 

I know that if I were to off myself, I would pass my grief to many others, so I guess I must stay alive because of that...
