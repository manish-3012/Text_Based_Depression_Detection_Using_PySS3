im officially admittedly depressed again TW i want to move out of my toxic houseturning 18 i thought id have this magical way out of my house and money to accomplish my goals and finally report my abusive ex and rapist. i thought i can finally get therapy on my own etc. i stopped taking zoloft (sertraline) a while back i just cold turkied it and i was good for a while just emotional. my parents dont take me to anymore eye exams, doctors appts, if i have a concern its swept under the rug. they always say theyll get me therapy and glasses but never follow through:(. i need therapy ive needed it since freshman year but my cheap therapists never give a shit about me. i called one saying i was suicidal and wanting to go through and they politely told me to calm down and hung up, the other dug up some trauma and never showed to another appointment. i had braces for years and my teeth are straight and beautiful but a year ago my dentist told me i need my wisdom teeth removed asap or itll destroy all my progress. guess who cant afford it. i need glasses so my weak eye doesnt drift off into the other direction. quite frankly im not used to looking all fucked up as ive been raised in an average family and it may be selfish to not want to be ugly but im terrified. i finally have a job, but i cant leave because i have no money yet, i started my first training day today. and had been looking into this job for a few months before but my dad wouldnt let me work. my dad is selfish and controlling and my mom just praises him and kisses his feet and defends him. theres no way out for me at this point. itll be a very long time before there is
