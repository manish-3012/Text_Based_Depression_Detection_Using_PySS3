I am going to kill myself this day next year.Today is my birthday, and I feel crushingly lonely. I turned 20 today. I'm scared of growing up. I miss my ex more than anything. I've never met anyone who has loved me. I hate myself. I can't like myself. I never had. I'm just done with everything. I miss being happy. I was happy enough before I got a girlfriend, and when I got one, i've never been more happy. It finally felt like someone cared about me. Then she broke up with me six months ago. And I still feel fucking broken about it. My life has been a neverending downward spiral since. I miss the feeling that someone cares about me. More than anything. If I can't find someone who can love me within the next year, I'll kill myself. I can't handle the lonliness.
