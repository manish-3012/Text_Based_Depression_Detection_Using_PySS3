Is this how it ends?Every day I get a little closer to my end plan. 
I have all these things that need to be done before I go. Then it'll all be in place. 
How ironic it is that I worry when I check off the last thing then I'll just go?
That's my plan right? 

I guess I keep expecting to snap out of it. I keep thinking I'll feel better soon. I keep thinking my situation will improve or that there's surely good people left in the world. 
But almost everyday something gets done on that list, and it's getting closer and closer to the end of the page. 

I used to feel so indecisive, I would agonize over the decision. Since the list came I feel nothing but calm. I'm peaceful. 

Is this really how it happens?
