over itIâ€™ve always waited for someone to come and rescue me. Iâ€™ve realized lately that no oneâ€™s coming. And I donâ€™t have the willpower to rescue myself. 

Iâ€™m so tired. I am so so...tired. Iâ€™m tired of waking up every morning angry that I did. Iâ€™m tired of the intense hatred I have for myself. Iâ€™m tired of having to battle every single day...it never gets easier. Itâ€™s never okay. Iâ€™m never okay.

I want to sleep forever. Apparently downing an insane amount of sleeping pills wonâ€™t take me to the eternal sleep I long for. 

I wish someone would do it for me.
