So i decided to took my own life this weekfirst of all sorry for my bad english

i don't even remember when i laugh when i become happy and when i had a purpose on life

i quit talking and meeting with my friends about 4 years ago only friends i have on the internet

im anti social gaming addict im on drugs but i don't think im addict i only smoke weed maybe once in a 3 months

i dropout highschool when im 16 because i knew im not gonna live long ( im 20 years old now ) so i decided to live a little 

bit better life until im gonna die i fucking sit and played games for 4 fucking years only worked 3 months and quit job 

because it was 12 hours for a day i don't have any plan for my life now i don't want to get married and live with shitty 

salary so where i live is you have to go to the military for 6 months when you hit 20 years old if you don't have to go to 

school you can't delay it so i don't wanna go to the military either i decided to took my own life this week i think im gonna 

jump into the train because its very close the where i live but still open for ideas and im pretty sure thats gonna happen

please don't try to change my idea its not gonna work thanks.
