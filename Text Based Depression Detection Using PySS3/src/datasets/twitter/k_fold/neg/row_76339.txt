Suicidal thoughts sneak up on meIm feeling so good and wouldnâ€™t even think about suicide and then hours go by and I donâ€™t remember what really happens but I feel like i canâ€™t take it anymore.  I donâ€™t really know how I got from point a to b but i did and i feel so awful and suicide becomes a realistic feeling and temptation.
