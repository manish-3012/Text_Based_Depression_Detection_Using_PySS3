i thought i was getting betteri attempted back in may. itâ€™s important to note because up until that point, i was getting better. i was almost a year clean from self harm and didnâ€™t count calories either. i was doing so fucking good. and i just slipped up. and now, six months later, i canâ€™t even get out of bed. (important note: iâ€™m enrolled in online highschool) i try and sleep until at least two in the afternoon so that i donâ€™t have to get up and look at my shitty trailer or look through my empty fridge or clean up my familyâ€™s mess. if iâ€™m asleep, i donâ€™t have to deal with the fact that my future isnâ€™t fucking happening. iâ€™m so alone all the time and not to sound emo but no one fucking understands. my mom is always leaving, and my dad is a druggie. my brothers are so dependent that they make me feel like shit because i canâ€™t even take care of myself. i canâ€™t talk to any of my friends because i donâ€™t have the fucking energy. my best friend and the one person i can talk to is my girlfriend. she struggles with a lot of the same shit too though and i donâ€™t want to make her feel hopeless or shitty. i try to be as there for her as i can but i donâ€™t know what to say to her when sheâ€™s like, â€œi wanna die!â€ or â€œi wanna cut!â€ like fuck bitch me too. not to mention?? i always say mean shit to her when we fight and itâ€™s awful. i feel so guilty. i canâ€™t get a job either. does no one want to hire me or am i just too much of a anxious piece of shit to get a job? the question will always remain. i donâ€™t even know what iâ€™m living for anymore. i donâ€™t know why i didnâ€™t die back in may.
