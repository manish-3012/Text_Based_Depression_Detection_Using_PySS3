I've been putting this off for too long, the time is nowTonight is the night ladies and gentlemen.

At 02:00 PST (UTC-8) I will begin my journey to my final destination, a 30 minute walk to a nearby community garden full of beautifully colored fall trees. It is there where I take my own life and finally end this cycle of emptiness.

I skipped class, but managed to make it through work. I've been taking combos of pills all day to make myself less anxious, but the feeling is still there, the feeling that I don't really want to die, I just want this to end. I've been chain smoking cigarettes and putting them out on my arms to prepare for what is coming next.

Once I arrive at my destination I plan on notifying emergency services of a suicide upon which I will commence my ultimate journey into the nether.

I would have done this last night, but I smoked a little too much cannabis and ended up passing out. and waking up long after my "deadline" had past.

Right now I'm preparing my final meal, seared gnocchi with a garlic meat sauce. I plan on enjoying this with some herbal tea and a few short docus on YT to pass the time. 

Goodbye all, see you on the other side.
