Iâ€™m just tired manI never really wanted anything out of life, didnâ€™t care too much if I got married or had kids, didnâ€™t want to change the world, no specific goal driving me forward. Which was fine, because I was content just enjoying day to day life. A generally upbeat person. But ever since I developed anxiety and ptsd from a trauma, I donâ€™t enjoy life anymore. I wake up everyday with my heart beating out of my chest in a cold sweat from intense fear. Iâ€™m so hyper aware, I can feel the blood pumping through my body and it hurts from the pressure. My head burns and pulsates, I have trouble focusing on anything for even short periods of time. I canâ€™t express my thoughts verbally how I like. But most of all, Iâ€™m exhausted. I just want to feel refreshed once more, the feeling you get from a peaceful, restful nights sleep. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve felt like that in years now. Iâ€™m tired man, I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m still trying, or what Iâ€™m even trying for. Thereâ€™s no joy left for me here. I guess If I donâ€™t make it, I hope at least one of you can.
