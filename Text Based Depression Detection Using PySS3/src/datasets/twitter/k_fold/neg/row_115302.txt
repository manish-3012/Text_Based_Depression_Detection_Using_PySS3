What do I do when I want to kill myself but I feel bad for overwhelming health resources when rn the coronavirus is already overwhelming them?Normally I would call a hotline or call my therapist or talk to a friend. But I feel like any health resource is pretty overwhelmed by either caring for corona patients or caring for families in grief after a loved one has died from the virus, and my friends are very overwhelmed and sad rn because of the coronavirus. The thing is, all my mental health resources left as soon as quarantine started. So my mental health shot down the tubes. I thought about volunteering somehow in a way that maybe I would catch corona and die but I don't want to take up an ICU bed even briefly for someone who might need it, and also I don't want my elderly dad somehow catching it from me and dying. I'm also afraid of trying to do it and failing and ended up in a hospital where, again, beds are already limited. I'm just at a loss of what to do.
