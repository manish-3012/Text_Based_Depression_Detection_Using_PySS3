Covid 19Hey my name is Ryan I'm 18 years old and I have coronavirus and I'm scared to die from shortness of breath I've been living with coronavirus few days now and everyday I feel that it's harder to breathe and is really scaring me so I though maybe there's a fast way to suicide without much pain
