Why do I have to exist?Every so often, I reflect on how my presence affects those around me. There is a consistent pattern that I don't do anything to make other people's lives better. At the extreme, it seems like I only serve to complicate any situation I'm in. I just make lived worst. I'm so unneeded, redundant, and insignificant. I hate thinking about suicide because I've already spread so much pain already. My suicide would just add to the devastation I leave behind. I often think about how low I prioritize my own survival. I wish I would just catch a deadly illness or be in the right place and time so someone else would do the deed.
