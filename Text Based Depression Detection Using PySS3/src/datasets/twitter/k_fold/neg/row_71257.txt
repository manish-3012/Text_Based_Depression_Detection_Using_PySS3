Is suicide a selfish act?I've heard someone who was contemplating suicide being chided for being selfish as she'd leave behind grieving relatives and friends. I understand that suicide may be committed for very altruistic reasons ( you are very sick and you cannot stand to see the people you love waste away their lives looking after you).

But even if you do it because you are tired of life, is it still a selfish act?
