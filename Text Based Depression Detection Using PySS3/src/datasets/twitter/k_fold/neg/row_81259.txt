What's happening to me. All of sudden I realize I don't want to live. The many things I've tried to sweep under the rug are staring me in the face.I'm in my mid-twenties, male, short stature. I feel so sick lately. I admit I haven't had a good amount of sleep due to nightshift hours, but my negative thinking (which is not so usual for me) have been immense. 

I recently quit weed and alcohol after years of abusing it, mostly in isolation. During this time my ex gf made many attempts to reconnect with me and even more so recently. We hung out a bit, then I let it go. I just sat in kind of wait for what would happen, knowing I was too scared to make a move. Mainly because she took a very healthy turn in her life in the years we had apart and I really didn't. She just got a new bf and though I want her to be happy with a good person, I came to realise she was one of the best people in my life, more caring than anyone else I've know. My short stature does make it harder to simply find an S/O, confidence was my game with women but I've lost it. Re-built it many times, but now I have no energy left.

I'm eating healthy, going to the gym, working, just not coping at all. Sleep is difficult, I stay awake because I'm scared to close my eyes and have suicidal thoughts. I'm strongly considering smoking weed again an accepting my fate as a low-life because I don't have much going for me.

I feel like I tick many boxes of a person who commits suicide.

* Mental issues
* Unsteady employment (have not kept a job for longer than 9 months)
* Un qualified in any field
* Relationship problems
* Was emotionally abused growing up
* Drug/alcohol abuser
* Isolation
* The big 5: neuroticism, agreeableness, openness, extraversion, and conscientiousness describe me perfectly


All these things stacked against me confirms that this is not just a small feeling that will pass. It's the beginning of something. I feel like I am in very deep. I have feel-good moments in the day, but I want to end my life because the suicidal thoughts/ideas are unbearable. 

I want to see my gp. Last time I was prescribed anti-depressants they made me feel much worse.

As I said I want to just smoke weed again. I've smoked weed since 16 and it has got me through all this shit. It did make some things worse - losing lisence, expelled from school, losing gf, family fights. I just can't win. Smoking weed with someone helps, on my own not so much.

I don't want to leave my brother. He struggles with depression too. He's an awesome guy and has done everything right. I can't bare to cause immense pain to my family, especially not him. It's the last thing he deserves. He's what's holding me back from this. But the immense pain and lack of solution is making me crazy.. I just want to feel good about myself and life again. I want to have ambitions and confidence again. To speak clearly and be assertive again. I feel like I've slipped away completely and will only ever "cope" with my new-found reality. I was deluded before, now I see the picture properly and it's too hard to look at. 

I have many regrets. People say look to the future and not the past, but in my past I was so misguided and my actions have directly hindered my ability to have an organised, easy-going life. 
I'm scared and I don't know what else to do. I can keep going for now. I'm just scared if this keeps up I will not be able to go on, especially come birthday time etc. I lost many friends, I emotionally my hurt family, I can't bare this shame and regret.
