I'm so sorry.Everything in my life has been one fuck up after another, this is the one I can't walk away from. I flew down to see my closest friends for the holidays and I thought everything was well until the last 2 days I was here. I was staying with my Best Friend (who shall remain nameless) and his girlfriend for the week I was here. Over the time I've known them I unfortunately caught feelings for his girlfriend. I never told either of them about my feelings towards her and I wanted to keep it that way. Now what happened was he had to work for the last 2 days I was in and it was just her and I which neither of us minded but she told me he felt uncomfortable leaving me with her alone. I never acted out or said anything about it. After that I explained everything to both of them and since then things were just quiet. It was awkward and silent after it all. I am at the airport now and I sent them both entire paragraphs of how shitty I feel and I can't afford to lose the two closest people in my life. I never got a reply from either of them. 

If either of them end up stumbling upon this. I want you both to know I love you both. You guys were everything to me and I'm so sorry. It's all my fault of the reason why everything is the way it is now. 
Goodbye.
