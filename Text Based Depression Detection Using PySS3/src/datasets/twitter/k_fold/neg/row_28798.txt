Tonight is my death dateSoooo, not gonna be dramatic. Letâ€™s be adult here, tonight is my death date. I canâ€™t take the shit everyone is saying about me, a vile girl whoâ€™s trying to destroy my name for fun, the stuff people are framing me for.

Itâ€™s too hard, it hurts too bad. So, this is it.

Hey, Iâ€™m sorry okay? I donâ€™t want to deal with this anymore.
