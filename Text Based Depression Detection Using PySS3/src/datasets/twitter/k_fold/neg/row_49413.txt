I'm ready to goAfter a sexual assault a week ago, my depression has significantly worsened. I'm facing self-blame, inability to sleep, inability to keep up with school, self-hatred, anxiety, panic attacks and the feeling that I can't reach out to my friends any more because I don't want to burden them.  And ultimately, it's just getting to be too much. At what point to get I just get to sign out?
