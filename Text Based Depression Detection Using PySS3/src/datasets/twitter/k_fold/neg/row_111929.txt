The "Truth"I put his off for too long. You want to know my story? Then here it is, all of it. Youâ€™ll be the first person I wonâ€™t lie too ( tbh I have still lied about the things I hate the most) , I donâ€™t know why but hell it had to be someone someday.
Starting at the age of 14 I became depressed, it wasnâ€™t so bad. At the age of 16 I became suicidal attempting to take my own life and only surviving the attempt due to a hook that was holding the rope breaking. I guess I just got lucky. 


My childhood is great compared to others, but utter shite when compared to other as well. We werenâ€™t poor and I had pretty much anything I could want. The issue is I wanted a proper family more than anything, with a marriage that was hardly something you would call functional and other domestic issues home life wasnâ€™t the best at times. Now this isnâ€™t something that I dwell on, it doesnâ€™t affect me and I donâ€™t careâ€¦ what affects me is the day I walked into my house at the age of like 8-11 somewhere in there to find my mother trying to kill herself, blood everywhere.  After this day I have never looked at her the same and hate the fact I canâ€™t understand something that she did when I did the very same thing years later. 


School life was never the best, I was known by most people but not popular I just kind of existed as a slightly interesting person. I had a small group of close friends (2 people) and a rather large group of people we placed ourselves in. I never cared about my appearance at school and really didnâ€™t give a shit about being in a relationship (That came later) I was just sad all of the time, just everything in my life seemed to be wrong. It was at this time I realised I have no talent, literally nothing that I know of. I barely got good grades in school straight Câ€™s the average (You can probably tell by the quality of this writing) 


I was part of a very large â€œNerdâ€ call on Skype we played games and chatted all night, this has been my life since I was about 15. However, around the same time I started working for some less pleasant characters shall we say. It took me to dark places and I witnessed things I wish I could forget. This is one topic I will net dive into further in fear of bringing up bad memories.


Now after finishing 6th form or â€œHigh schoolâ€ with top grades I was ready for University, but also ready to die, my mind back where it was when I was 16. The only thing stopping me? She needed me, a girl who cheated on her BF with me. Said she left him for me, to tell me the very next day to forget. The fucking girl that looked me in the eyes and lied as she said â€œI love youâ€. The girl that I fucking took to the hospital when she tried to take her life. The fucking girl that I held in my arms as she drifted in and out of conciseness in a taxi while she bled from her neck. The fucking girl that did so many things to me that I cannot even begin to talk about them. The girl that I did so much for you would think me insane (Hell some people do) this person, the one I still care for more than anyone is gone. She decided a week after I tried to kill myself that I was â€œToo much to handleâ€ A girl that I was told to stay away from. Played with my mind, my feelings and had her damn way.


Now I write this on Christmas day, Iâ€™m not worried about the next days to come. Iâ€™ve realised what it is that I want to do and thatâ€™s the same thing I tried a month ago and two years ago. Iâ€™ve posted on here before and ended up in hospital after nearly every post. I do not wish for anyone to contact the police or some bullshit because then I have to run (You would only put me in more danger of myself) 


I post here asking, what it I should even live for. I have nothing, there is no one that I hold dear. This world would miss me for a month or two before my name would fade.
