I need to die me I can't find a way.Please don't tell me the reasons I should live etc. I'm a mental health professional and I know them all. I spent my career helping people find ways to make their life worth living. I found my reason, and now I've lost it. 

I have a horrific abuse history since literally infancy. I never had a family. Escaped to live on the streets. Managed to get into a good college, move far away, even got a PhD and a good job. I never had a family, so my reason for living was to make it to 30, hopefully be married by that time &amp; be able to start my own family. Break the cycle. Do better than was done to me. This has fueled me for a decade or so. 

I thought I had it. I married 3 years ago to the love I never thought I could find. She completes me, and not even in a toxic dependent way. It was just good. Not perfect, but a real and pure partnership. 

Then suddenly about a month ago she's having a quarter life crisis, decides her time with me was an utter waste. Looks at me with hatred. Moved out and has been living with a friend 100 miles away. She blames me for being with her, for all the decisions she made without telling me she made them. She absolutely loathes me, saying she's made sacrifices that she never told me about. Sacrifices I never would have asked her to make. She won't hear me. Won't talk. Won't see me. Tonight it became clear that it's over for good. I am a good person. I am an empath. I work full time helping people live better lives and then on nights and weekends I rescue orphaned kittens. I don't deserve this, and I don't now how to ever come back from it. 

I am queer, 30, in a busy city, unable to go on dating apps due to my career. I am an introvert. My chances of ever finding a love like this are so small to not even exist. I need to die because this pain is immense. Nobody knows I feel this way because they would intervene, or worry, and I just want to disappear quietly. I wrote a will, leaving everything to her. She told me I need to rewrite it, but I have nobody else to leave anything to. 

I can't get a gun, because in my state the requirements are insane. I don't have connections to people to get one under the table. I've tried. I can't get my hands on nitrogen or helium, I'm not technical enough to attach the hoses with various flow pieces. I guess I need to overdose, I'm afraid of pain. I have so many meds from a bad car accident. I need to know what will work, one shot deal. I need someone to help me end this pain.
