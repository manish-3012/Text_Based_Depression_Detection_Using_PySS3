CloseThe only reason I havenâ€™t committed suicide yet is because it would inconvenience my family too much. My mom has been gone so much to help my grandmother due to her health. My father is no help because heâ€™s fucked in the head. If I moved on campus to college, I would have been committed suicide by now. I am literally trapped in this house. I canâ€™t find any pleasure in this life. Drawing doesnâ€™t make me happy anymore. The only time I am at peace is when Iâ€™m sleeping or listening to music. All I think about is self-harm. Yes, I have a therapist but money is an issue. I have been to him a couple of times and I am afraid that I canâ€™t get the help I need. Itâ€™s not looking good for me.
