Generic Edgy Venting PostI'm not going to anhero, but I sure would like to.

&amp;#x200B;

Complicated girlfriend left me for my boss/best-friends younger brother, who is also my underling at our job and one I once considered a good friend. She will do it to him and it pains me to know he is acting just as I did. To the t. Minus events that have distorted things. You cannot reason with people..  My father has recently and painfully gone blind in one eye and has been dealing with accusations of murder, going on 7 years now. I cannot prove anything but I have rarely ever been wrong and I am certain he is innocent. This man gave up his fortune to get custody of my twin and myself. He has sacrificed everything for us. That's a whole can of worms. His ex-girlfriends "best" friend is head investigator, but while she is known for violence and drug use it doesn't seem to matter. She cheated on him with a notorious drug pusher and user. But my straight laced father is main suspect. Insert angry edgy comment insulting god.

My female shiba ran out of my apartment and cannot be found despite being chipped, she was never abused though I suspect her prior owners. I loved her so much. I have dealt with the loss of so many animals in my life and I intended (and did spoil)  to spoil her and her brother. Again that's another can of worms. My Grandmother has been showing serious signs of  Alzheimer's . I was not there more in my grandfathers life before he painfully passed away which destroyed my grandmother. I don't even remember the last time I hugged him and told him I loved him, told him just how much he meant to me. My shitty 93 Jeep, which my father bought my grandmother when I was 12 and she gave to me this past year so I wouldn't be mugged walking to work anymore, nearly killed me when the transmission slipped into neutral while I was driving then back to drive TWICE while on the highway (and continues to do so) in a major city.  I'm too god damn poor to succeed. **Every single fucking car** I have acquired has either BROKEN beyond financial repair or been broken into/stolen. I'm not kidding. 

For those who don't understand why the transmission issue is so bad, just imagined a build up of a lot of pressure that releases and repeats without your control. Pent up energy is very powerful. Now imagine that it happens while driving. Now do it while driving with a light ended vehicle with real-wheel drive. Now imagine all of it while having to go 80 or surrounding traffic will run you over. Again now but the vehicle has over 380000 miles on its transmission with poor maintenance done prior to your ownership. I shouldn't be driving it still but I have to because money=god and I need "god" to live. Now I need to somehow save up to replace the vehicle and saving money is damn near impossible.  I am one of the power payers of my apartment due to various reasons so I struggle to save anything. It's normal for me to have in-between 38 cents to 6 dollars in my account at any given time after bills or emergency's. "It's not that hard to save up money" some may say, and that may be true for them but literally **EVERY SINGLE TIME** I have any savings something always happens to take it from me. Now I hate being alive and all but I don't hate those I do love, while I exist here in order to save them I would and have done anything within my power. 

The baby boomers hate me, gen X hates me, gen tide pod eater/swag/yolo/fortnite victory royal hates me. I am a Millennial and l am somehow responsible for everything wrong in this world almost because I was born. The list goes on and only gets worse, and it does get worse. I have tried un-alive several times in my life only to fucking fail. I had my college funds ripped away from me because I "made too much money". I didn't know 15000 a year was so much, I'm so rich.  I believe I make somewhere like 22000 now, it's not even remotely comfortable. I am not very attractive and have poor luck with women if any at all. My family would tell me I'm a catch but I doubt that, my names not Chad. I cannot have children because I am sterile. I have nothing outside of some minor, very minor, material possessions. I have only a handful of friends at best, even my twin is distant from me. I exist because the people around me guilt me to live. You know they'd be sad if I did not mouth breathe anymore. Because their happiness is worth more than mine.

 I just want to die. I have always wanted to die. I don't want an ever after, I don't want anything; I was a mistake I should have never been born. I haven't been happy outside of the bullshit child happiness built by lies over Christmas and birthdays.  I am very aware that other's have it worse, but I am not them and these are pains that affect me. It doesn't get better, it never has.  

The end.
