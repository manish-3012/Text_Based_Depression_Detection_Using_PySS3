My brother has destroyed yet another relationship with his drinking, and is again threatening suicide.And I am just so freaking done with his bullshit. I almost feel like I am too detached. At this point, I donâ€™t and wonâ€™t trust ANYTHING he says. At this point, there is no way that conventional therapy, once a week etc,  will help him. I am like, 99% sure he is undiagnosed bipolar manic depressive which is made all the worse by his alcoholism. Our dad was an addict, and once he finally hit rock bottom and was in a program was diagnosed bipolar manic depressive. 

I need to go to an al anon meeting, I know that. In the mean time, may I ask if someone has ever called 911 on a loved one who was threatening suicide fueled by alcohol? How terribly did it go and did they forgive you?
