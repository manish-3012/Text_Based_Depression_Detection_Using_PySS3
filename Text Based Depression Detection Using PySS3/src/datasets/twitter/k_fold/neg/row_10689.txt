No one cares. No one ever cared.I am alone. I fooled myself into thinking people cared about me. I confused people being nice with people caring and now I am all alone. I am a burden to everyone. I need to die. I can't open up to anyone about how I feel because it just pushes them away. I am alone; that is all I'll ever be. I just need to kill myself now. My time has come.
