I'm such a waste of spaceI don't know why I keep fighting it's so pointless. In the end I know I'll lose. I'm so useless and my existence is so pointless. If I killed myself today no one and nothing would notice I was gone. Idk what's keeping me here at this point, I should have offed myself a long time ago.
