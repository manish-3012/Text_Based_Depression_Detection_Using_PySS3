suicidal long distance partnermy boyfriend lives in the north of england and i live in the south. he's a brilliant person and i genuinely love him. he has a great sense of humour, outward confidence, he's doing great with his studies and has landed some part time jobs too, i'm really proud of him.

unfortunately, he has been raped and systematically abused as a child, he's killed someone, and he doesn't know how to accept love. he attempted suicide once before, and nowadays he uses alcohol, cigs, cocaine, mdma, weed and whatever else he can get his hands on to cope, but he still lapses into these dark weeks. he says he feels  ready to kill himself, he's written a letter, and recently he's started cutting himself too though i don't know how badly. every time he goes into a dark time i feel i get closer and closer to losing him. i am also suicidal for my own reasons, if he goes i'm going to give up too. he knows this.

i've got the direct emergency number for his town's services and he's promised to call to say goodbye if he does anything. i'm so worried, it's eating me up and i don't know how to talk to him about it. he won't talk about things with me. i don't know what to do. if anyone can help me i would be really grateful
