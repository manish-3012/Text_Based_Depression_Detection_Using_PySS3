Insurmountable debt and poverty make me feel completely worthless as a personIâ€™m in about 60k of student, medical, and credit card debt. Iâ€™m behind on my bills and not working. I get a stipend every month from an inheritance, but itâ€™s not enough to get by. I always barely make it and thatâ€™s because I strategically get behind on certain bills. 

I just feel like such a failure. Money means worth to me. I make nothing, contribute nothing. No one wants to date someone broke. I canâ€™t afford to pursue hobbies or entertainment. 

I just spend every day worrying and waiting to go to bed. I donâ€™t see a way out of the situation Iâ€™m in.
