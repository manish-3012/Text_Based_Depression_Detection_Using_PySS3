tired hhahafeeling particularly shitty rn,, everythings just so pointless?? whats the use of getting help from a therapist and psychiatrist if nothing ever works for me anymore? my meds arent working either. hhga I havent self harmed in a week and I plan on doing it after I get back home from japan, which I actually looked forward to but the people im with are shit. I cant go a day without hearing someone making a remark about my weight and how //fat// I am. they know about my situation, my suicidal tendencies, my mental illnesses, and my self harm. yet they could care less I suppose. I have a few friends and they all care for me yet I cant help but feel like im just an 'extra' in their lives. like im just there to help them whenever they need someones, MY validation for their feelings even though they ignore me when I tell them about my problems. maybe its true I suppose. that id be better off dead. gone. who cares hhaha. or maybe im just writing this bc I want someone to actually genuinely care. my mind is a mess and I cant think straight im sorry. I just feel so,, alienated I guess. so out of place. im so tired. I cant help but feel like my problems really arent worth getting sad n suicidal over but jfc everything is so overwhelming and my heart is so heavy I just want to go,,,,,, no matter how much people tell me that I am loved, I know ill never really believe it. im so fucking selfish and egocentric im sick of it. im sick of myself and just overall being myself. I just want to die.
