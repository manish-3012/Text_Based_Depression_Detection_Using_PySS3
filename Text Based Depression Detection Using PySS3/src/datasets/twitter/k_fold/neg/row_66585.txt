My mum attempted suicideI guess I'm making this thread to look for advice on how to support someone with depression. About a month ago, my mum tried to take her life by overdosing on anti-depressants or mood stabilisers or something. When my dad noticed that she wasn't waking up from her nap, she was rushed to hospital and stayed in a mental health ward for a couple of weeks. Now she's back at home (I go to university in a nearby city) and doing some sort of daily programme at the hospital, but I'm constantly worrying that it's going to happen again.

My family isn't very good at being open about our feelings. It came as a shock to me when I first heard about it. I knew that my mum was struggling emotionally, but I had absolutely no clue that it had gone so far. Part of that was her own doing. She wasn't telling her therapist the truth about how she felt. She was bottling things up and putting up a facade of normality whenever I came to visit. I made it clear when I first visited her in hospital that I wanted her to be open with us and with her psychiatrist; that all I wanted was to see her get better and pretending things were normal didn't make me or her feel the slightest bit better. I also made sure that my dad was much more involved in the recovery process: getting an emergency phone, talking regularly with the psychiatrist, etc (although I think the hospital was going to arrange that anyway). I've also been going home more often and taking walks with her. On the walks she often talks about how things are going with her recovery, but there's definitely a wall up beyond which she won't go. 

I see us falling back into the same habits a little bit (of pretending things are okay), and I'm so worried that she's telling me her recovery is going well when it really isn't. Has anyone else been in a situation like this? What are the best things I can do to support her? 

Sorry for the rambling post. I've been bottling all this up for while.
