A reason not to do itIf you hate your life and everyone around you and just want to end but just scared of jumping because itâ€™s feels wrong and scary but on the other hand youâ€™re hopeless and pathetic 
You donâ€™t care if people love bc your donâ€™t love them and all you want to do is just pass and make em forget you 
You wish you could stop living 
You wish it can all just be over 
You wish you were different 
You wish they were different 
Lifeâ€™s not so pretty where wishes ever come true and when opartoniteis  come and you turn it down thereâ€™s no going back thereâ€™s no fixing your mistake you cant cry and live like your dead 
Ik that bc your reading this and alive 
You might hate yourself but trust me youâ€™ll get use to it ,hate, pain all of it 
And it might not get better but nothing lasts not happiness nor sadness life moves but it doesnâ€™t go on forever 
Nothing stays a secret
