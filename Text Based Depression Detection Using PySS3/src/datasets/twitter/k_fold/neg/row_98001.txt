Serious help.I need help, I donâ€™t want to admit it but in struggling and I want theee thoughts out of my mind, I wish I could just open up to someone but all my friends donâ€™t take it serious or would make it worse, and u saw a professional for four years and it didnâ€™t help and now Iâ€™m at the lowest Iâ€™ve ever been.
