How to choose "when" to end it?I'm going into my second year of college and it's expensive AF. My parents are paying for it though (we don't make much at all) and I honestly don't think it makes sense to wait until after I graduate to end it. I don't go to a particularly good school and I'm a shit Finance major who probably won't get a job anyways despite my good grades. I think I should save my parents some money and if they take out a life insurance policy it could really help them out. 

Idk I don't think I'll end it to be true but I've never been closer. What the fuck do I have to life for anyways. I feel like my life's a big joke. Made fun of by strangers, even at the gym. I'm not a terribly unattractive person either and I've had girls attracted to me and tell me I'm attractive but I don't think so clearly. I'm an asshole. I've been a horrible person in my past. Been racist, anti-homo, atheist. I feel horrible. I regret it all. I just want a clean slate again.
