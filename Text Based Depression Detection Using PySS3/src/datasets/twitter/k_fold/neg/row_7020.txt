BetrayalI had to make this account because my friends know my primary. A month ago, I lost the woman of my dreams (I know how this sounds, but it's not my first relationship) because I became consumed by stress and became a different person. After the breakup, I headed on the road to recovery, and have brought around positive changes in myself.

Friday night, though, I discovered that she had begun dating my best friend two weeks after breaking up with me. I care deeply about both of these people, and am committed to living with both of them for the summer already (no way to back out). I have to see them and work with them every day. These conflicted feelings of love, friendship, hatred, betrayal, and despair are too much for me.

Those around me know that I'm bad right now, but they don't know how bad. I've lied to counselors, professors, and friends who have all asked me the same question: Are you in any danger of harming yourself? I am. The last few days, the ideas have become more and more vivid and real. I feel how close I am to doing it. If I keep feeling how I do, I may kill myself tonight.

Please help me. Please.
