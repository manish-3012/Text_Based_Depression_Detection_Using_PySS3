I just want me to end.Is that so hard to ask for? I just want to be dead. Obviously not today because it has nothing to do with love but everything to do with everything in life. I am sad when i wake up, go to sleep, i can't even bother going outside anymore even though i hate it here. I am in a cage, a prison of my mind. I want out. I cry a lot, i can't keep pretending, this mask is wearing out quick and I rather just be dead. I might have to go through with it. A few people know I am depressed but they think I'm lying, trolling, bipolar, or just want me dead. I hide it well. I am tremendously tired. I wish there was another way I can still go on. But presently, nothing can save me. Only i can save myself, and i do not see myself worth saving. I'll give it until the end of the month. This time, there will be no turning back. I really need to die asap.
