It's like I'm not even here, so why stay?Sometimes I feel like the invisible man. Maybe invisible isn't the right word as people see me and acknowledge me on a superficial level but I don't think anyone really cares about me. All my friends just brush off any mention of my declining mental health as a "You'll be fine, just gotta wait it out". I've been waiting for 8 years for the depression to go away, and 3 years for the suicidal thoughts to go away 

It's not like they'd even miss me when I'm gone. Most don't talk, text, or call first. It's mostly me asking if anyone wants to hang, almost never the other way around. They all laugh and joke and be happy, while I wallow in my room. Waiting for the day I can finally be free of this misery. I already know I'm just gonna crash my car, hopefully it'll be enough. I just gotta get the courage first

It really sucks growing up and realizing that there are so many people out there who care for others, yet no one cares about you. No one asks how I'm doing or if I got over my depression despite the fact that my so called best friend has known about it for years. He talks me through really bad times but never follows it up, never a "hey man how you doing?" Nope. It's always just move on and ignore the emotional kid who always whines
Fuck it no one cares anyways
