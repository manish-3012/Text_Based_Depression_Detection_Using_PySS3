Wrong time period, wrong culture, wrong everything.Just really wish I wasnâ€™t me, here in modern society because I simply donâ€™t belong. 

Maybe I wouldâ€™ve made a great viking or pirate, I have too much of a warrior and rebellious spirit in me to fit into modern society, the only place for people like me now is prison or death
