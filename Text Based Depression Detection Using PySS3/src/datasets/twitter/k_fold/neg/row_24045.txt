I Have Tried So HardI am 23 years old and I have been suicidal since 17, probably longer and I am so sick of everything. I have depression, I have acute anxiety disorder, I have borderline personality disorder, I have ADD and nothing gets fixed. I have been seeing therapists for 2 years now and it is still bad.

I thought I was doing better but today my ex who I have been trying to get back with told me he wasn't sure how he felt about me and i had a massive borderline moment and I just feel like a monster. All I have ever wanted was for people to like me, why am I so bad at it.

I should have ended things 6 years ago why do I keep trying to be happy.
