I really need someone to talk to... Please help me... I'm completely lost and on the edge...I'm feeling so low and depressed right now... I started to clean my closet to find ways to hang myself.. I feel like my family doesn't care about me anymore... and I have no one who cares... It's a very, long... deep story... and stuff from my ex triggered it today. I do not know what to do... I'm trying to keep myself going. Please talk to me... I cannot stop crying and want to end it all....
