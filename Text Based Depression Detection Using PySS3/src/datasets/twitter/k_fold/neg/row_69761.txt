Constant Pain, I'm tired and emptyI've been in constant physical pain for just over a year.  I've been fighting suicidal thoughts for eight months.  I'm tired now and I don't have the energy left to fight.

I'm not in crisis and I do have support, but I don't have the strength to keep going.  I'm afraid that I can't fight the suicidal thoughts anymore and I may end up on a bridge...  I need to find a way to refocus and find some energy.

Thanks for reading. Any helpful hints very much appreciated.
