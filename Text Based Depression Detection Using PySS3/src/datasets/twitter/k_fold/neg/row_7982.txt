What would actually happen if I killed myself?I lost my job recently. I have a master's degree and nearly 6 years of work experience, but I can't find a job. My fiancÃ© is now burdened with all of our expenses and it doesn't look like that will change any time soon. He and my mom are the only people who care about me. He doesn't know it yet, but I have put his name on the house I bought, where we now live, because I am planning to commit suicide. I've tried to reach out to old friends I haven't talked to in a while, only to see how it would go. Several of them have been pretty rude, or simply not interested. I'm not sure what I have done, or maybe still do, that makes people dislike me. I have had this problem with people for a while, just not being particularly liked and generally avoided. I can't figure it out. I think maybe it would be better if I were dead. My mother and fiancÃ© would be devastated, I think, but the way it might really be for them eludes me. How would my death be different than a long absence of vacation? I would just be gone, why would that be bad for anyone?
