so sadso sad rn so so sad rn weeks ago i would cry everyday but now im just numb to this overwhelming feeling n just sleep off in self-pity. hardly ever awake anymore all i do is sleep n naps n more naps bc i hate to be alone w my dangerous thoughts. cant do basic human activities even bringing myself to shower n eat n reply to friends feels like a chore n requires all my little to none energy. idek why im always tired when all i do is sleep all day sigh. im tired of feeling so worthless im so close to overdosign
