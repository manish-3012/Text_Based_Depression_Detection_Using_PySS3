Graduated 2008 stuck with parents' mortgageI graduated uni in 2008. No graduate employer even for basic office work will look at me. I'm stuck in retail and with my parents' mortgage. I'm almost in tears everyday and I can no longer see myself ever living a happy life. If I'm dead I won't have to constantly be unhappy that no recruiter or employer will look at me and that there just aren't gonna be any happy days. I've already lived the prime of my life and those happiest days have come and gone. It's over. Please what's the easiest way for me to off myself
