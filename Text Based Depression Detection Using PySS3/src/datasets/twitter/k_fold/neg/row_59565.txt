Ever feel like your suicide is inevitable? Like you have no control over it.After being kicked out and homeless at 17 my life has been a string of almost making it and then everything being taken away. I'm 20 now and I don't think I'm meant to get out of this hole. I'm going to kill myself one day anyways because I don't want to spend my life like this and noone can help me. The longer I wait, the more people will sacrifice for me, the more I will hurt people, the more I will suffer. I just want to get it over with already. I just wish everyone would understand all the pain I would be saving everyone involved. That it wasn't selfish.
