Isnâ€™t it fucked up?*This is just based on my personal experience, yours may be different *

Isnâ€™t it fucked up how mostly the only people who people really check in with or care about are the shy, quiet suicidal people who fade in to the background and donâ€™t complain that much? You only  matter if you being depressed and suicidal doesnâ€™t inconvenience or annoy them. If youâ€™re cynical and you complain and talk about how you wanna die too much like me, nobody asks how youâ€™re doing or show that they care. They just tell you to suck it up and deal with it. And then if you complain that nobody cares about you theyâ€™ll be like â€œI care!â€ and 2 minutes later listen to you talk about how you wanna kill yourself and not even listen or say a word.
