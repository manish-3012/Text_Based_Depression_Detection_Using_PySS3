I dunno guysI've been looking through this subreddit, and everyone is talking about "reaching out to someone you trust" but I did that tonight and I've done it many times, but somehow it always seems to end up with them not taking it as seriously as I've presented it. At this point its hard to tell if they just don't care or just don't get it. Either way I'm pretty sick of this fucking rat race. Seriously, whats the point? You grow up, maybe have a nice childhood, go to college, get a job, pay your taxes and die as a small blip on the radar.

 I don't really care if I'm remembered or not, maybe I'd rather not be? I just want to go knowing I won't hurt anyone else with my decisions? Is that too much to ask for. Sometimes I just look around and wonder what the fuck are we all dong here, what are we striving for? Sure maybe you will be remembered a few generations down the line if you do something of note but what does that really matter? You won't be here, no one you loved will be here. It just doesn't make sense. We are walking around everyday, searching for our own fates,which in the end will mean nothing. The pain isn't worth it.
