I cant do thisI really don't know what to do anymore. Ive been doing this for so long its so tiring. Constantly helping people feel better but never having someone to help me. Being the emotional support for my friend and then for family has gotten too much. Too much negativity at home and in life itself. I have 1 friend and that's it. I had a spouse but they told me I was too much to handle mentally so they left me. I lost the one thing that was keeping me going. I cant remember the last time I felt genuine happiness, I haven't in so long. I look back and just see pain. I've attempted so many times that I cant even count on both my hands. Im gonna try again and I hope it works this time. I literally can't deal with this pain anymore. Getting constantly put through so much emotional and physical damage has worn me down too much. I just don't have anything to keep me here so why should I stay here. Im in an endless cycle of pain and I don't have or see a future on earth so it really doesn't matter. Nobody truly cares about me because in the end they all leave one way or another.
