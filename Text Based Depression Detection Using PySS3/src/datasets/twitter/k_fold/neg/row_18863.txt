I don't enjoy life.Life for me has well.. Not been so great. For a couple of reasons. Reason one would be because i can't find love. I've tried online dating and it was all just heart torture. Girls breaking up with me because they found someone better than me or think i'm strange or whatever reason. I tried dating in real life as well. But that didn't work out either. Everyone around me just seems to dislike me for some reason. As time flies by i become more and more lonely at a quick speed. I just need some love in my life. But while that might just be me being over-sensitive or stupid. But i also feel worthless and weak. I always try my best to help people with their problems. Or just be a nice person. Yet it's all for nothing. Speaking of nothing. I've realised that no matter how hard i try. That it will be all for nothing. It will be forgotten and there's nothing i can do about it. I'm basically just another life form here to suffer slowly waiting until death arrives. That's why i just want to end it before it gets worse. And hey i will die eventually, why not just end it sooner?
