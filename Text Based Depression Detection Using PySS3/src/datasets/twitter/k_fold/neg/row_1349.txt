My 24th birthday is tomorrow and I canâ€™t stop thinking of committing suicideIâ€™ll try to make this as short as I can. But long story short, I left an abusive relationship, left town and left all my friends. I was about to start nursing school on one day when everything hit the fan and I packed my bags and left. Now Iâ€™m back with my parents since October. For the third time. Iâ€™ve been through several relationships that have went down hill and have caused me trauma. Now Iâ€™m with a guy who is genuinely a good guy, I do love him but he has mental issues of his own and all my issues are weighing him down. I have physical health issues on top of depression, anxiety and ptsd. I canâ€™t hold a job, I keep trying and failing. If itâ€™s not my Health acting up, itâ€™s my anxiety or depression thatâ€™s so bad I canâ€™t even bring my self to leave my bed. Thatâ€™s not what I want. Iâ€™m thinking of trying for disability but I feel like Iâ€™m just making excuses and donâ€™t deserve it. I just lost my job after 3 weeks of having it and 3 months of finding it. I told my boyfriend they fired me for being a liability (which has happened in the past) but the truth is I walked out after having a bad situation with my health and getting sick at work. I felt embarrassed and felt like they were gonna fire me anyways. I know I should of stuck it out. But I didnâ€™t. 
I was about to move in with him, things were about to get good. My parents donâ€™t even know I lost my job.
They think I was going to move out this weekend but my boyfriend told me he wants me to prove I can hold a job because heâ€™s in no position to take Care of me, he can not mentally handle it. He told me heâ€™s not happy and his anxiety is sky high because of all the pressure heâ€™s under. He told me he does love me and wants this to work but he feels like Iâ€™m not trying. 
The thing is I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m trying or not. Some days I feel like I am then others I canâ€™t make proper adult decisions because Iâ€™d rather just lay in bed and pretend not to exist. 
I feel like such a burden to my family and my boyfriend. I feel like Iâ€™m ruining something that could of potentially been good. I feel as if the world might be better off with out me. Monday is my birthday and I keep getting this intrusive thought over and over that maybe itâ€™s time for me to go. I can easily make it look like natural causes because of my health situation and die in my sleep. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m capable of living a normal life. Iâ€™ve tried therapy, didnâ€™t help. Iâ€™m on a high dose of Prozac, which did help at one point but not lately. I just feel so lost
