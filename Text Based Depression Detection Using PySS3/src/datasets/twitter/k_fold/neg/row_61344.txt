I'm planning it for next week.He's gone for 2 weeks on a work trip. We have cats. If I do it next week, they won't be alone for as long and he won't have to deal with me when he comes back. I'm very allergic to tramadol. Taking one after surgery dropped my blood pressure to 80/50. If I take two or three, I'll die like falling asleep. I can get it for $10, he won't even notice it missing from the bank. Then I won't be a burden anymore. No more crazy me, no more trying new treatments, no more crashing lows, no more people worrying about whether I'll kill myself or not. I'm prepared. I still cry about it sometimes, but I know my loved ones will be better off. I only ever hold them back because in the back of their minds, they're worried. I won't bring them down anymore. Easy peasy. I'm aiming for the 19th. Seems like a good day to me. I'll have everything ready before that. Just in case his trip is done early. I don't want him to have to talk to me anymore, all I ever make is excuses anyway. Not this time. This time, I'll just go. I'll call the police when I start to feel my blood pressure drop and it should be too late to save me. That way no one I love has to look and find me.
