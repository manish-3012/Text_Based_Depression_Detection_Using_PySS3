Nobody wants to be my friendI don't know what to do anymore. I feel like nobody wants to actually be my friend. I have friends who are freshmen but they're always "too" busy. I feel like they're secretly hanging out without me. Sometimes they ignore my text messages and GroupMe messages, but then they post about doing something. I mentioned to one of my friends how I felt and she said, "All we do is eat" (lunch, dinner, etc.) but it's not the point. I just like being around people who (I thought) enjoyed my company.

 I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know what makes me so undesirable.

A friend said I shouldn't base my friendships off of text messages, but it's hard not to. 

I'm so depressed and lonely. I just want to kill myself. No one will miss me.. what's the point of living when everyone hates you?
