I have no one to talk toI don't know why I'm writing this.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to kill myself today.  I've tried to kill myself before, but this time, I think I will go through with it and not chicken out.

I'm 40 years old.  I'm a part-time cashier.  I live with my mom.  She'll be horrified, of course, but I think it's probably better to rip off the band-aid then have her get more and more disappointed and sad with me.  I know it will suck for her - I know.  But I've thought about this for so many years.  At this point, I'm just waiting to die, and I don't want to wait anymore.

Life is too hard, and nothing makes it worth it.  I don't have any friends, because I don't to put in the work to maintain it.  I don't have anything to look forward to, because no matter what happens in the future, I'll still be me, and me is the problem.

I hate that person.  I hate how whiny she is, and how lazy she is, and how much of a coward she is.  I've tried, a little, to not be me.  But I can't.  No matter how I progress, I'll always be me, and me is a toxic person.

I don't know why I'm writing this.  Nothing matters, and nothing I say, or write, will change reality.  The reality is, I'm nothing and no one.  My mom will care - she'll be devastated, but I've tried to be alive for her for most of my life.  I can't do it anymore.  She'll have to forgive me.  She'll forgive me.

I really really hope this is the last day I'm alive.  I don't know why I'm writing this.  There's nothing to talk about.  There's nothing to say.  I've messed up my life, and I don't want to go back to it.
