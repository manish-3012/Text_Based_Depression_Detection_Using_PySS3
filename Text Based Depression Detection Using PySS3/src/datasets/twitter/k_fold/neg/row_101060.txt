I just can't anymoreWhat you do when you're out of options cuz everything you touch just becomes shit?
How much can 1 person take?
I just fu.ked up everything,until I lost everything.
Managed to dropout of school for no good reason.ended every good relationship I dont really know why.quit my job cuz I felt stuck.
And now just complet alone cuz I just ignored everyone in my life who showed a remote interest in me. Why I thought I can figure out everything by my own.wtf I did with my stupid fu.king life.Can't strand myself anymore.
Where should a person go from here?
