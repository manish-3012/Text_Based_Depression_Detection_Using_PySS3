I want to kill myselfHello there, 

For a long time I have been in this very dark place where I can't see light. I constantly hear only my thoughts and I don't want to talk to anyone. I hate living, I hate myself. My existence  does not have any meaning. I wish I could die. I have this partner I love, we have been together for a long time 5 years. But, my craziness is driving him away. I know he loves me, but he can't bare with me anymore. I don't know how I became this horrible person. I had a suicide attempt when I was 21, 9 years ago. Today I am just thinking I should do it. I took 10 sleeping pills, I just want this pain to go away.  I am not currently taking anti-depressants, I was in therapy and they did not seem to help. I came to this place because I have no friends, and I just wanted someone to know that I just want to die.
