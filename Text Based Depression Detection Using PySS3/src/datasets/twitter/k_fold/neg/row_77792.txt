For the ways I've hurt everyone around me I deserve to die.I am a reprehensible, irredeemable human being who deserves to die in the most painful way possible.

I'm a psychopath. I've traumatized people. I've traumatized my little brother. He's 10. I am almost a decade older than him. I've hurt him pretty bad. Physically. I've hit him quite a bit. Insulted him. A cop came to our house because of it. I'm a fucking horrible individual. 

I fucking hate myself for what I've done. I don't want your pity, and I don't expect to receive it. I don't except anyone here to be sympathetic of me. Don't be. What I've done can never be forgiven. I have caused childhood trauma. I am the worst possible human being. I didn't commit a minor crime, like petty theft. I abused a child. No one who abuses children deserves any kind of sympathy.

He will never forgive me for what I've done, and I cannot blame him. My apologies will mean nothing, and he wouldn't understand them anyways. He's only 10, after all.

The only way I can give him justice is to kill myself. I can't live knowing what I've done. I deserve this. However method I go with, it needs to be slow. Painful. Just as I've hurt everyone around me.

It's not just my brother. I'm so sorry to everyone I've ever hurt. I know my apology means nothing. I can only hope that they'd believe me when I say that I've never experienced so much regret in my life, but they probably won't, and I understand why. I'm so sorry.
