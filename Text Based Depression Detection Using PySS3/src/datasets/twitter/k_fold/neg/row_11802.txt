Please give me ideasSo, Iâ€™m from Brazil and Iâ€™ve been treating my bipolar disorder with a nice psychiatrist since April 2017, going to therapy since January 2017. Iâ€™ve relapsed twice last year and ended up in the hospital, since the first relapse I canâ€™t have access to my meds for obvious reasons. Iâ€™m doing a lot better, quit my job which was making me feel like shit, changed uni, change courses, basically a whole new world, feeling my princess Jasmine fantasy. Since I started going to uni for gastronomy Iâ€™ve been thinking about moving from Brazil to another country(who am I kidding? I fell in live with LA the second I put my feet there) BUT I donâ€™t know how that could work out, how would I take my meds if I canâ€™t have access to them? And I donâ€™t really feel like I should have access to them either because even though Iâ€™m doing great for the past 6 months I have no idea when this stupid bipolar shit is gonna go down because I know it will at some point because it always does and Iâ€™m very afraid of relapsing again. 
Iâ€™m only going to be able to move after I finish uni (probably December 2019) but I have to start doing plans if I really want this to happen. 
I do have family friends who live in Mission Viejo which is close to LA but itâ€™s a little too far to be in contact with them everyday. What do you suggest?
