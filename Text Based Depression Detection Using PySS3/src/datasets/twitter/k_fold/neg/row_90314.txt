I donâ€™t know who else to talk to, but for the first time ever Iâ€™ve actually thought about suicide.For the past 22 years Iâ€™ve been as strong as I could and truly believed that Iâ€™d be happy with my life at one point. 
I have a lot of support from my family and Iâ€™m even talking to a therapist right now but I feel like Iâ€™m lying to myself every time I talk to him. Iâ€™ll be very motivated and encouraged but then Iâ€™ll get lonely and I go back to focusing on everything thatâ€™s wrong. Besides my personal life, everything about this world is so incredibly fucked up and hopeless to me. Itâ€™s the biggest struggle and the only advice I get is pretty much â€œthatâ€™s life.â€ I know it is, I know itâ€™s not fair and I know itâ€™s up to me to accept it but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m tired of getting up and pretending to be okay, Iâ€™m tired of giving my all to people who donâ€™t do the same, Iâ€™m tired of feeling bad about myself, Iâ€™m tired of not being able to help others, Iâ€™m tired of feeling like life has no meaning. I want to cry all the time, and this week has been absolute shit to me. I broke up with my boyfriend, I found out one my coworkers (who I was pretty close to) was murdered, my mom listened in on my therapy and started making me feel like shit, I have no really good close friends in my city and although my family loves me, I truly donâ€™t feel like anyone understands the unbearable pain I feel all the time. Iâ€™m terrified of my own thoughts right now but Iâ€™m also scared if I tell my therapist heâ€™ll tell my family and theyâ€™ll make me go to a psych ward. Iâ€™ve always been too scared and say I would never because I donâ€™t want to make my family go through that pain but Iâ€™m at a point where I donâ€™t want to be here anymore because no matter how hard I try, something new comes up. If anyone has any guidance or words that might help I appreciate it.
