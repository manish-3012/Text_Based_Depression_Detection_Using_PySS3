I just came to vent I guessI'm a fucking worthless dumbfuck piece of shit and I'm so fucking useless I don't deserve to breathe. I can't do anything, I barely pass my classes, I can't do any sport or any art or any fucking thing, I can't even get my driver's license, I'm too fucking dumb for it. If I ever get into college, which probably won't happen, I will end up a drop-out or something like that then I will be an unemployed alcoholic with no family and no one to care. My friends beg me not to kill myself, but none of them can convince me and probably neither does anyone here. Don't try to help, you might as well ignore this message, unless you're some fucking superhumans you won't be able to change my mind, just as I said, I did this just to vent a little bit because I'm so fucking angry and frustrated and I guess it's better than screaming at the walls. I'm done with this shit, I want to die.
