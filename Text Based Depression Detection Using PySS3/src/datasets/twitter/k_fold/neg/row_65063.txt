Feeling like a disappointmentBeen hit hard lately. I always had a financial struggle which made it hard to complete my higher education, I'm supposed to be the bread-winner of the family, then the miracle happened and I finally completed it. It was the only happy moment I had in recent memory when I achieved my degree and started dating this beautiful woman of my dreams. 

We're currently in a LDR type complicated situation atm, due to some visa issues with the country I aim to work in (the country she is in), this would mean the issues in our relationship might not last long. I come back home and my family is eagerly waiting for me to start something and help in bettering their lifestyle. My future is very uncertain and it feels like I might lose both sides and not be a success relationship wise or career wise. 

Something happened between my SO and I and it shook things up between us. It was a misunderstanding and involved jealousy but no cheating of any kind. However, I get vilified and hated by the very woman that I'm holding an easier career path and life for. I managed to patch things up but barely, things have changed, and this relationship was the only thing keeping me from doing something awful in the first place. That only bright light in my life is missing and I'm stuck in shit storm. My only comfort is disrupted, my family dislikes the lack of progression in my life and I just feel like I keep letting people down.

I know in my head that its something childish, but time hasn't been very kind to me lately and neither has the world. I was about to head to the roof and well... say my goodbyes via voicemail.
