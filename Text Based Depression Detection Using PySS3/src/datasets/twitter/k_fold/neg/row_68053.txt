I don't feel like i can handle it anymoreI am going to start off with the absolute truth. I'm thirteen years old, fourteen later this month. I have been having suicidal thoughts for almost two years now and have gone so far as to have a written plan. My most common fantasy of self-removal is hanging myself with the marine rope my father has outside. I have a girlfriend whom i love and great friends who have kept me alive as long as they could but my past seems to be catching up. My step-father (whom my mother kicked out three years ago) was a drunk, cocaine addicted, verbally abusive bastard and I believed him, and still do, every time he called me a no good rotten fuck-face. That six-hundred and fifty pound bastard ruined my life. But anyway, I am diagnosed depressed and have serious anger issues. In don't know how much longer I can hold on. Fellow redditors, you are my last hope.
