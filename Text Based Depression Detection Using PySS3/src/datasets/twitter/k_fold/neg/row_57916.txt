Things to do before you goWhat are things that I should do to minimize the damage caused by my suicide before I go? I deeply care about my parents, but I just can't take it anymore. I feel extremely guilty that I'm leaving them behind, but at least my sisters will be there for them. So what should I do to minimize complications? Legal, economic, and emotional?
