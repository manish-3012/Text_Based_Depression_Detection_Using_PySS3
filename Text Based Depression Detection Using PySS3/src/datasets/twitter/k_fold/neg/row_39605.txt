Suicide feels like the only optionI feel so overwhelmed and trapped, everyday I just repeat the image of me killing myself over and over and over again. I've survived 3 years with these feelings but it feels like theres an invisible countdown and each year I get closer to finally doing it. The pain in my chest is too much to handle
