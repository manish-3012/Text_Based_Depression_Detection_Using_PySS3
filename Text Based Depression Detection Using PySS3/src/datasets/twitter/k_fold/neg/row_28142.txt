Journey to the bottom.I guess every journey is one of many small steps. Mine is no different.

I was once employed, loved, in education and I guess vaguely happy. I don't really remember ever feeling particularly happy. I've never struggled for friends, but always struggled for my friends. Anxiety about things like my clothes keeping me from them for months at a time.          

Anyway, only a few years back I had a fiance, was nailing my educational goals, had my own house (renting) and was doing ok. I'd never had a family member die. Never been a victim of violent crime. Everything firmly was within my control. I guess I felt if I put my best foot forward then I could make things work. 

Then my fiance suffered sexual assault. Multiple and various crimes and attackers.  

Shortly after we drifted, I lost my house and my education. Then my livelihood. 

Then my family got sick. Some needing care, others just drink and drugs... others aren't with us anymore.

I think then falling victim to violence myself placed too much of a burden on me.

I don't brush my teeth anymore. I don't shower. I don't sleep till I fall down. I don't rest when I'm asleep. 

I'm just a husk paralysed on my couch waiting for death. I'm watching a clock and dreading the end, but stuck unable to live.

Every day I do more permanent damage to the vague idea of who I could have been. Every day I further cement myself as a mess and a failure.

I see little to no point trying to improve my life. I'm basically ruined. I'm poor, uneducated, unhealthy, overweight, too old to have kids, too ugly to find love again... I'll never be able to own my own home or finish school...         

I'm going to die alone, poor, and forgotten. All I really have left to contribute is a carbon footprint and a burden on my family.
