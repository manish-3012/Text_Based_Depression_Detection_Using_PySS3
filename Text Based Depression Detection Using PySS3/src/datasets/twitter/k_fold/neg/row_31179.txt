My mother is about to pass away from cancer and my father is suicidal. What do I do?So about 3 years ago my mother got breast cancer.
this past November she was said to be cancer free and the battle was over BUT;
In early december she got really sick and went to the hospital, there they diagnosed her with lung cancer that materialized from hidden breast cancer cells as they say.
2 days ago i called 911 for her.
since then, her cancer grew really really quickly, both her kidneys nearly shutdown right before she got to the hospital and after a few test they discovered cancer on her liver.

they're giving her 2 months to live.

My father, about 4 or 5 years ago got depressed and talk to no one about it, no one realized it and one day we got a call from him saying good bye. We called the police and after 3 days they found him passed out in a forest. her tried to over dose on medicine and consumed a lot of alcohol.

Now I'm absolutely positive he's going to try it again if my mother passes away.... what do i do?

I'm 19, i've dealt with suicide before for a close friend of mine and today she's doing better but I really don't know how to handle this with my father. His brother with whom he was very close with, comited suicide about 9 months ago, just another thing i think will push him to do it.
