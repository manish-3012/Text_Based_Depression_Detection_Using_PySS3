I've never really told anyone how I really feel.Hey.
I guess I should preface this by saying that I am a 28 year old, white, suburban male who has had lots of advantages in life. So I feel like I have no right to be posting here.
I was always a very smart kid throughout school, though I never attended post-secondary.
I have had a lot of odd jobs, but nothing that has ever felt anything besides dead-end.
I tend to measure my self worth based on those around me, especially the people I grew up with and have maintained somewhat of a friendship with.
All of these people are now married, most have had their first child and all have very secure, well-paying jobs.
But here I am. Sitting in my apartment that I can barely pay for, alone. I feel like I have no real value and offer nothing to this world.
I have had girlfriends. But they are only attracted to my physical aspects. Every girl I have ever dated, when asked "what do you like about me" have always replied something along the lines of "I love how tall you are. I love your beard. I love your smile. You've got a nice D." Nothing to do with who I am as a person. It feels so empty. I feel like they don't really give a shit about who I am just as long as I look good next to them and make them laugh once I a while.

So I feel extremely inadequate.
I am full of insecurities.

I will not consider taking medication as it just makes me feel even more weak.

All this BS and heartache and shitty thoughts could be eliminated so very quickly.

I fucking hate feeling this way.

I want it to end.
