I am coming to terms with the fact that i will eventually take my own life does that make sense?im not sure how else to phrase this, or even where else to ask. However i recently had a realization that i will take my own life in the future. I am 33 now, and am relatively happy but have always felt like it is only temporary until those same old feelings come back.

The realization i had, is that eventually it will become more difficult to push those feelings back down and get on with things. I think i just feel tired, like having been on a journey i am coming close to ending.

It doesn't feel immediate, or that i am in a rush, but just that eventually circumstances will lead me to that outcome in the future. Does anyone understand that feeling? Does this make any sense?
