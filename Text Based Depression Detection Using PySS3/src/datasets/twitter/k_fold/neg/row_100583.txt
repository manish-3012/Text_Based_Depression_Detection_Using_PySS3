I am a foreigner in the USA. Can't go back "home" and about to be homeless here.I have observed how many homeless have to live out their lives and I honestly do not want to be part of that world. I don't know if my heart and my mind can take it. If anything I admire them for somehow holding on to life inspite of their condition. I cannot possibly survive living on the streets. I would probably get killed anyway so....I'm thinking maybe it's better if I die with my own hands...I'm a little scared but i'm more scared of being out there.
