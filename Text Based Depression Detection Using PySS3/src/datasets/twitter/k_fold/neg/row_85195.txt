Anyone up?It's 1:39 AM where I live and I can't sleep. Boyfriend is sleeping soundly upstairs, and I'm in the living room staring blankly at my laptop. I am a huge night owl, so being up late isn't abnormal for me...but tonight I just can't shake this overwhelming feeling of loneliness.

Anyone care to chat?

Edit: Grabbing some headphones and scraping together a little bowl. Will brb in about 5 min! Until then, listen to this **DOPE** song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awV03ivB-mA

Edit2: 3:24 AM and I think I'm going to finally try and sleep. Will most likely be back tomorrow, if not in the very near future. Thanks to everyone who kept me company tonight. :)
