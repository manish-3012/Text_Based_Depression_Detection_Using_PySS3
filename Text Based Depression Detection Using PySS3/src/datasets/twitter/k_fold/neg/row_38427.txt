Luck is everything in lifeWhen I was a kid, I was a very happy cheerful kid. I wasn't bad a bad looking kid either. Then I had a nasal deviation of the nasal septum in my nose that I can not fully remember at the age of 10 or 11. My life is ruined after this day. I always had trouble breathing through my nose during the day and always breathing through my mouth during sleep. When I was 13, I noticed something strange in my mouth or jaw and teeth, but I wasn't sure. There was also a very big hooked nose in my family that no one else had. It's like a crooked nose. When I was a kid, I was a kid with a pretty normal face. But at the age of 14, 15, I realized that I'm not good looking anymore. I had a really weak chin, with puberty almost all  my teeth were ruined. They became extremely crooked. It wiped out all my self-confidence. I didn't go out because I turned into an ugly-deformed person. Breathing thru the mouth literally deforms you.

Personally, I could live in peace with my appearance, but I am constantly judged by my chin and extremely teeth. People with weak chin are generally equal to poor character, inadequate, low class. Observe the majority of people without the type of people will see that all have the same characteristics. And I'm not just a normal ugly guy, I'm a weird, deformed and so ugly.

At the age of 17, I found a correlation between mouth breathing and weak chin and crooked teeth on the Internet, and then I understood why I had been excluded all this time. It was my mouth breathing that made my face deformed. I hate myself for breathing in my mouth, and I also hate my parents for not taking a doctor I've been to as a child and having my nose cured. Don't you think it's strange that a tiny problem ruins a whole life? Although it sounds funny to you, the beginning of events that ruined my life was breathing by mouth.

I'm still 18, I've never had a girlfriend. I trust myself with my friends and in everyday life, but I have no hope of talking to girls. I wouldn't even want to date myself. Because I don't look like a normal person. Again I'm deformed.

I'm 18, my chin and tooth are still deformed, entering a stupid four-year college won't give me anything, I'm a poor, I need a lot of surgery to look like a human and I don't have the money to afford them. Everything is luck. After writing this, I understood once again why I will never be happy in this life. I just wanna die and never wake up.
