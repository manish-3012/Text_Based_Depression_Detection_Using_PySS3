Alone on Christmas DayI try not to let it get to me, as there are people out there in far worse circumstances than I am on Christmas Day. I hate that this day is associated with family, a normal thing that every one has.. apart from me. 

This time of year is supposed to be cheerful, enjoying the time with those close to you. Christmas Day (for me) is a reminder that I'm alone, that I don't have a family and that I'm fucking miserable. The loneliness is killing me and it feels like theres nothing I can do.
