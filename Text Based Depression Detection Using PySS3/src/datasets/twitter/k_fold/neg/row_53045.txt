iâ€™m completely worthless, nothing newi really am. i canâ€™t get a job because i canâ€™t leave the house most days so iâ€™m already a massive burden on my parents, and yesterday i was meant to go to a concert that my friends and i had been planning to go to for months and i made it all the way up to the city it was happening in (over 3 hours away) only to completely shut down and have to stay in the apartment we rented for the night. i spent a fortune on train &amp; concert tickets only to fucking sleep in a different bed while my friends went and had a great time. i hate myself so fucking much for this, i canâ€™t even do things that are supposed to be fun and not stressful because i freak out so bad. 
iâ€™m such a massive coward for not dying yet. there is nothing at all holding me back except iâ€™m afraid of the pain. i canâ€™t find a painless way to die but i need one desperately. i donâ€™t want to keep being a burden on literally everyone i know and iâ€™m not deserving of any help offered to me. the only way out is death and i canâ€™t even do that properly. i honest to god wish iâ€™d never been born and i can tell everyone else in my life wishes it too. 
whenever i go outside i can tell everyone i pass hates me and wants me to die. i wish one of them would kill me already because i canâ€™t do it myself. iâ€™ve thought about walking into traffic but that would cause such deep trauma for whoever hit me and iâ€™ve caused enough pain to others in my life that iâ€™d rather never do it again.
people always say itâ€™s brave and strong to stay alive in spite of what i feel but i know the truth. iâ€™m only alive because of pure cowardice, plain and simple.
