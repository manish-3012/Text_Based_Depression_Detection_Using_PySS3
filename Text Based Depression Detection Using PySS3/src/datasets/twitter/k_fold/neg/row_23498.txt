Update: I didnt follow through, but I might soon. Please help me.I skipped school today, sat at home, played some video games, listened to some music, wrote my goodbye letter. I beat Bioshock Infinite, that was cool. I sent a text to this girl ive had a crush on for a long time, she replied, asked me what was wrong, I couldnt bring myself to reply. I have a bunch of pills in my hand, but i cant take them. Its scary. Please help me
