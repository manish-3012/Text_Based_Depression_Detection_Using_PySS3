Don't you just hate it when people tell you things along the lines of "Get your fucking shit together" or "You're gonna live a sad life if you keep this up"?I've been getting this a lot recently, and I only want to die more because of it. I understand that these people think that giving me "tough love" (or whatever the hell you want to call it) will help me get my life back in order or something, but it really just goes through one ear and out the other. They talk about it as if they think I want to live life in the first place! I don't WANT to get my life back in order. I have no DESIRE to. I ALREADY live a sad life. I don't know, man. This is all too much for me to handle. Perhaps I deserve this tough love-not because it will help me in any way, shape or form, but because it's retribution for my shitty humanity.
