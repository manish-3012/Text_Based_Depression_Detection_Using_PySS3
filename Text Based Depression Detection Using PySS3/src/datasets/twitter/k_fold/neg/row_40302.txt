Goodbye.You never knew me, so I guess none of this matters. I want to at least have something written somewhere, so that someone'll find it, and possibly remember me. I wanted to live, I really did. I think a little part of me still does. I've only messed up my own life, squandered any potential I had. I just wanted to matter. I wanted to talk to people, to cry and laugh and live with them. It just seemed like I was always in the background. If no one wanted to hear me out, if people acted like I didn't exist, maybe it would be better if I just didn't. By the time you're reading this, I should be dead. Kinda Cliche sounding, but old movies were always my thing. I've got one thing left to ask, and then I'll be done because I'm sure you're tired of hearing me complain If the news or anyone tries to twist and pick apart the reason why, don't let them I was simply tired of being ignored and living. Ill miss you guys forever, CK and Julius, please forgive me because i cant forgive myself
