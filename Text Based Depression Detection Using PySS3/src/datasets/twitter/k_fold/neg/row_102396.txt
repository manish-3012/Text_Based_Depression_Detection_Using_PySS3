I am going to give upI have grown tired of being rejected...I am alone..I am beyond desperate...asked for help sooo many times...I believe it is because I am a short guy 5'3... ppl don't take me seriously...I starting my lat semester...moving to a new place...I don't have much fight in me left

I put in a referral for a pycyterapist... no response
