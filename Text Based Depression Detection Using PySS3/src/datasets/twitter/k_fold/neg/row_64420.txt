Best/Only friend betrayed me, and now I feel like dying.I've suffered with depression and anxiety for quite a while, pretty severely in fact, as well as being socially awkward, and not having any friends. Anyway, I'm 16-17, met a girl online gaming, turns out she was in the same state, blah, blah we become awesome best friends, we meet up, we're awesome, friends for about 4 years.

She knew I had depression and anxiety and all that stuff, but she didn't know that I was self harming and thinking about suicide, since she was my only and bestest friend who I treated like family because of me having family issues, I knew I could trust her because she even said herself I could tell her about anything.

So I told her, she calls me a 'Mental case', 'a bad friend', and that I should 'just go and kill myself so other people don't have to put up with my shit.'
She then continued to remove and block me on every form of communication we had.

As you can imagine, this really hurt. Now this isn't the only reason I've been thinking about suicide, but it is the reason that pushed me over the edge and think 'What's the point anymore?'

On top of all this, I've been trying to meet new friends/people while gaming, and she is going around telling them all 'Oh don't add/talk to him, he is insane, he will betray you, or will tell all your secrets to people.' When these are all lies, and as you can imagine, it's then incredibly hard for me to keep those people I'm trying to become friends with near me.

It's all just too much for me too be honest, I'm seeing a psychologist and a doctor, but I just don't know how to feel anymore, and I feel that being dead is the only right thing for me in this world.
