F*ck ppl who never had to "just survive"My school's Redditschool's page is just ppl complaining about maybe going back to campus and like I get it, it will be tough if we do. But people are like "I just don't get why people won't suck it up and do online again?!". Like some people are in the worst situation they've been in and they can continue living in these circumstances. 

Every one of therapists/ psychologists was like I can't really help you so just hold on till you get to college. I got to college for one semester and for the first time this compulsive awful thoughts just become background noise. NOW I'm back in the toxic ass house I tried I'm to escape and I'm so close to giving up.  Not t mention toxic awfulness of my house has 3x due to circumstances.

I only survived winter break by leaving the house all the time but now I cant. I just feel so tired of listening to ppl act like being home is just an inconvenience, it's not it's honestly life and death for me.
