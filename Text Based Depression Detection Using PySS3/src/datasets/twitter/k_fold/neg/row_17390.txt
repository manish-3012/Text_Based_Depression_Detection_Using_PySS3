i don't know what to doI feel like nothing in life makes me happy and I feel horrible and depressed all the time, just constant misery and nothing to offset it
i have a lot of mental physical and social problems, i feel like im just defective, the was a mistake somewhere when I was born and i just have to live with the results
I don't really see things improving, ive been depressed my whole life from when I was in elementary school to now and it just keeps getting worse

i feel like im terminally ill and slowly dying
ice tried therapy medication talking to people etc and none of it really helps at all and just seems like a waste of effort

there really is nothing here for me, if I wasn't terrified of dying i would have killed myself along time ago
