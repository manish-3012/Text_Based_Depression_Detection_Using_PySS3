Corrosion of my Brain.I donâ€™t have a bank account nor a license my individual dependency is so low I honestly couldnâ€™t function without- I dont know my Mum? Iâ€™ve lived so long without meaning, at first it was awesome no stress in the world no one is dependent on you, in a way your virtually free from all of lifeâ€™s modern stress. 

Year goes by still living in the state of not having to worry about getting a job having to find food etc but coming onto three years and Iâ€™m 18- still here not progressed with living independently â³, itâ€™s not just that days become repetitive, 3 years of memories similarity blur into one, and itâ€™s of me starring at my ceiling. 

Guys I feel- I canâ€™t even describe how I feel into language, my brain feels just like itâ€™s deteriorating, I have no self confidence to be able to get a job. One failure is enough for me to slowly self-destruct even if things go good afterwards. 

Iâ€™m so lazy but not in the cleanliness sense but in doing something active with my life, I do push to make things better but even if things go good itâ€™s this self destructive behaviour I canâ€™t seem to tackle. Being brought up quite roughly has made me have a â€œNothing Really Mattersâ€ vibe to it, not that I dear show or express thatâ€™s the way I feel about things those thoughts are %100 lurking with every action I do..

I wantâ€” I donâ€™t know what I want, I want not this.
