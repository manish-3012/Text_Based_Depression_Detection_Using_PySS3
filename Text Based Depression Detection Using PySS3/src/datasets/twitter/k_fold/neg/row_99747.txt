one yearSo I just had my 20th birthday, and 2 years ago when I turned 18. I told myself I would end my life when I turned 21, so that means I currently have 361 days to live. Now if you've ever talked to any person with a therapist they'll tell you exercise will raise the endorphins and make you feel good basically. I tried and I still run every day, lift weights, and try to stay fit. But I'm still, not happy. I don't have a bad life, it hasn't always been great I've had shit happen when I was younger that really sucked and I hope most people never have to experience something like it. The point is your death doesn't have to be a morbidly depressing movie, but a morbidly happy movie. By that I mean don't sit and be alone, don't stay in one place, see some cool shit then, you know, do it. I still plan on my death happening, but I don't want it to be sad. Sorry, I just wanted someone to know what's up.
