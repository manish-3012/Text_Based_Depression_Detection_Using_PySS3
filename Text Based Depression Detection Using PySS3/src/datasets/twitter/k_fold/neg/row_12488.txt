I don't know what to do right nowI feel so overwhelmed. I don't even know what I got worked up about but I feel like I can barely breathe and go five seconds without thinking of a way to try to kill myself. This happens way to often, and I just don't know what to do. I tried to talk to someone only to initially get told I'm being over emotional, then they stopped replying so I assume they fell asleep.
