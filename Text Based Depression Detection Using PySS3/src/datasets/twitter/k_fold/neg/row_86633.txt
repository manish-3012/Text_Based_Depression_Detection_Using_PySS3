I've grown to hate therapists.Having been in and out of therapy for the majority of my life, all I have found it to do is make me hang onto life instead of committing suicide. That does not sound too bad at face value, but then I released no matter what else we worked on nothing else would change. So I would be hanging on to a life I fucking hated because of all the therapy, without ever seeing any progress in making things better in every other aspect of my life. Without it, I most likely would have ended it a while ago now, and honestly I wish I did.  Fear of death being instilled in me doesn't make this life any better, it only prolongs it, which is so much worse. This realization only occurred recently, and because of this I doubt I will be around much longer.
