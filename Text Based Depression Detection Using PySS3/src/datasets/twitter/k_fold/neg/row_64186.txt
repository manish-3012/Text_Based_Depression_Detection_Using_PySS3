I want to die and its my birthday todayIt's my birthday and no one is coming over. I realized my friends aren't really my friends. I have no family and I currently can't work due to a car crash on my brand new motorcyce crippling in debt. My life sucks and hopefully I won't be here much longer to experience this anymore.
