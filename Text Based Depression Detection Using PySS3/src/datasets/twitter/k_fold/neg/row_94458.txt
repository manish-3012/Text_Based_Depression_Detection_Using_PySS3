Can things ever get better?I have ADHD, mild tinnitus and mild hyperacusis. I'm suspecting I have anxiety and maybe dysthymia as well. I slept little and I took Concerta and I felt good without any anxiety. Then I took another dose of ritalin and felt really awful. Anxiety, tinnitus and the hyperacusis was full blown and I had a headache as well. I slept a little to rest and I woke up after 4 hours. That the fuck is the point? I've talked to my family about suicide and are terrified and say that they would be ruined and I believe them. I'm going to talk to my psychiatrist and see what's going on on tuesday, but it feels like it is game over. I just can't handle me being so broken. I feel like I'll never be fixed. There is no cure for ADHD, tinnitus och hyperacusis. It's done. My parents haven't always been there for me throughout my life but they want to help me now, especially my mother, but I feel it's too late. Maybe if they had intervened and got me help before I had anxiety, tinnitus and hyperacusis, but what the fuck is the point now? I don't want to point fingers but my I feel my parents were really negligable. I feel like I would just do them a favor if I offed myself. I've heard steroids can help with anxiety and mood so I've thougt about doing it to get back into training. I don't think my psychiatrist would ever allow me but I'm not convinced SSRI's are more beneficial or more safe, I feel it's more fear mongering than anything. I need to leave urine tests when I visit my psychiatrist so they'll know for sure I'm not a drug addict.

How long do I need to use SSRI's? Is it forever? I'm thinking a careful selection of steroids would help more since they can offer deeper sleep and can help build up my body and brain. Fuck I don't know. Why can't my family just leave me so that I can kill myself?
