Iâ€™m shakingIâ€™ve been feeling suicidal for a while. My bf and I went to the gun range with his friend a few weeks ago. (He didnt know I was suicidal at the time) a few months ago before we were dating, he told me where he hides his gun. Anyway I thought heâ€™d move it now that weâ€™re dating and I told him about a week ago I was feeling suicidal. I was feeling really suicidal tonight so I went to where I thought he was keeping his gun and it was still there. I know how to load it now. I took it out and was about to go outside and kill myself but as soon I took the gun out I heard him coming downstairs so I put it away. He heard a zip and asked what it was I pretended it was my shorts. Iâ€™m still shaking. I really think I wouldâ€™ve killed myself if he hadnâ€™t come downstairs. I donâ€™t know if i should tell him to move his gun or not. I donâ€™t want him to think Iâ€™m crazy.
