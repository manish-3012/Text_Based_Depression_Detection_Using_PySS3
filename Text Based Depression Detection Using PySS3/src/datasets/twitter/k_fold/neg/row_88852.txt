Just found this subreddit and am looking for some helpI just started my first year of university this year and am living on residence. This girl down the hall has been pretty clear that she likes me, even having it come up through texts (I have a girlfriend and am not attracted to her). She has been really depressed and has recently come out and told me she tried to OD on painkillers in grade 12 and that she really dislikes university, as it is extremely hard. She used to be a high nineties student and came to the school on a large scholarship. I was mostly blowing her off until I realised how serious she actually is, apparent through mostly her offhand comments about how she would rather be dead. I really don't know what to do at this point as I am becoming unable to handle her coming into my room to talk for hours on end, and yes I know I sound like a terrible person. I am just looking for some advice on what I should do, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: I live in a dormitory style residence where there are 36 people living on the floor.
