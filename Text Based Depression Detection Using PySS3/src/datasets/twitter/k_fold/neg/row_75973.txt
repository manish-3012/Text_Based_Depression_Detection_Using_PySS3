catastrophic failureI can't accept what I have done to screw up my life and I can't bear to face the consequences still to come. If I can't go back in time or win the lottery, then I need to be shot like a broken down horse. If no one else will shoot me, I'm going to have to get up the nerve to hang myself. I tried and it's really hard, but I am certain I don't want the kind of life that remains available to me. 
Even if I were miraculously cured tomorrow, the mistakes I made can't be fixed, and the worst consequences are still to come. I'm ashamed to say that most of the time when I read posts here, my first response is envy because your lives aren't totally ruined. I'm glad there is still hope for you, even if you don't see it that way, but it makes me realize there is none for me. Does anyone else feel this way? I can't carry on. I just want to die.
