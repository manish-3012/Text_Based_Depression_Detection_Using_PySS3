Just talked to the suicide hotlineAnd I donâ€™t feel helped. At all. It just felt like an opportunity to spout off feel good rhetoric every time I stopped talking. The urge is still there and I donâ€™t have a lot of people I can talk to about this and Iâ€™m in a very desperate mental and emotional situation.
