I just need a break for a whileI donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ready to die but is it awful that I wish I had something to take that would just put me in the hospital for like a week without killing me so I donâ€™t have to go to work or do anything for a while? Iâ€™m so defeated and exhausted and just tired of trying. My house is a mess and I have no desire to clean it. It gets worse every day.
