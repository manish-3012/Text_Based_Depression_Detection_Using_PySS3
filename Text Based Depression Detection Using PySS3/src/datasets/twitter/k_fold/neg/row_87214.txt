What do I have? A dead end job and a boyfriend of almost 5 years who won't propose.Borderline personality disorder checking in. 
I'm 330 lbs Morbidly obese. 

I'm tired of trying.  I feel completely worthless. I have an art degree, but don't even use it because I'm so depressed.  I'm almost 50k in debt from college, 23k in debt from medical bills and I can't afford to survive on my $10/hr job that has been drastically cutting back hours.  
I love my boyfriend with all of my heart but I feel like he deserves so much more than what I offer him. Maybe that's why he won't propose to me.

I've been depressed all of my life. I've been raped, molested, beaten, in prison and homeless.
I'm tired of living my failed existence.  

The past few days have been so dark for me. He's been nothing but wonderful to me, trying to cheer me up. I try so hard to smile for him. 

I'm crying as I frantically type this into my phone. 

I'm also tired of taking 4 different medications for my depression and anxiety. I'm done playing the "what magical cocktail will make me happy" game. 

The only thing stopping me right now is the lack of the amount of pills it would take to kill my fat ass. I'm not leaving him a bloody mess to clean.

I know I'm a selfish bitch for wanting to end it, but I truly don't see a brighter future ahead of me.
