Does the thought of death comfort anyone or is it really just an escape?I have had suicidal thoughts all of my life, never attempted it, but I know if I try I will succeed. I hate myself and this world for reasons I cannot begin to explain. Just wanted to know if anyone else felt like the option of death is comforting or if it really is just an escape. I am nonreligious if that will vary any responses but I dont view death as an escape, it is just another option to me

Death also seems to be the best option despite the hurt that it will give my family. I think I've reached the point where I just do not care due to the pain I have in this life. Really trying to see if anyone feels similar or if my feeling of death being comforting is correct/incorrect.
