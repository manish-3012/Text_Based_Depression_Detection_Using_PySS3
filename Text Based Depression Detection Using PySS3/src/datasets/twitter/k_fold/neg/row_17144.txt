I'm supposed to turn 30 in a couple monthsMonth and a half, I guess. I'm not dealing with it well. When I was younger, I never thought I'd reach 30. I figured I'd be dead by then, either from abuse or suicide, and being this close to it is terrifying. 

See, the truth is, there were some moments when I hoped. When I could see a bright, happy future where I had a good job and good friends and a good life. Where I was happy to be turning 30, and ready to move into the next part of my life. It was something that kept me going through my late teens and twenties, when things seemed the darkest. 

But now I'm so close to it, and everything is still dark and shitty. I'm back living with my abusive parents. I didn't get my dream job. I'm barely making ends meet and going to bed hungry. 

I'll be 30 at the end of August, and it feels like a looming disaster. Like I've wasted 30 years and have nothing to show for it. I don't have a plan. I don't have anything to be proud of. I don't have anyone to celebrate with. I don't have anything to celebrate. 

The closer it gets, the more I think about just not doing it. Just ending it at 29, so no one can say I turned 30 like this. 

Isn't it funny how dying could fix so many problems? Won't have to cry alone on my birthday with no gifts, no cake, no future if I'm dead, right?
