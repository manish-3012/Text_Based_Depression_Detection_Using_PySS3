I'm legitimately looking up ways to kill myself.The only other time I've done this was when my ex-fiancee cheated on me, then came home and told me about it. Now, I'm the whore who cheated. I just cannot believe I did something so stupid and worthless and made my boyfriend hurt so bad. I cant believe I ruined everything so badly. I'm not a cheater, but I cheated and now, now my boyfriend is in so much pain over what I did. He hates me. I deserve to be hated. I don't deserve to live anymore. My whole life has been a waste on resources and it's time to stop hurting people once and for all. I'm just a worthless piece of shit.
