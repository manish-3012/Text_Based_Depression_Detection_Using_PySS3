Came to something of a crossroads... So a couple of weeks ago I finally got my hands on some Nembutal. Even though I've been depressed for a long while now and know I want to end my life eventually (I can't see myself an old man) knowing I had the power to end it all finally really put things in perspective.

I'm not afraid of dying. That's why I've been so selective about how I'm going to end my life but because it took so long to get a hold of the Nembutal I've been able to experience something things that make me think I might be able to make it through... of course then something else happens that reinforces everything else I believe in and it fades but the memory of those moments linger a bit and that's what I'm having trouble with now. 

The biggest issue for me is I don't want to feel like I'm living my life for anyone else but me and to be honest I'm not happy 75-90% of the time. I don't identify with anyone and when I do connect with someone I have to hide most of my identity or else I know I'll alienate them. This is the first time in a long time I've thought about the alternative and while it seems worth it at times, I know that if I give it another shot and crash and burn I may not wait to get my hands on Nembutal but choose another, more horrible way to go.
