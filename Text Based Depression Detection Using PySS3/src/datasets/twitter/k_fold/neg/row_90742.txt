I'm Just So TiredI don't even know why I am here; I doubt I will ever have the courage to kill myself.

I am just so tired.  I can't even remember the last time I slept.  I happy for seconds of a day and miserable the rest of it.  I text my "friends"(associates); but am ultimately ignored.  I go out to bars when I get the energy, but people just dismiss me.  I call family that lives thousands miles away; only to get platitudes and hallow sentiments.

Maybe I am just broken, but I don't know how to fix me.  I spend much of my days crying lately.  I don't even know why I am crying anymore.  Real people cry over loss and pain, but I have nothing and feel nothing, so why am I still crying?

Seems wasteful to post here, I don't know if I'll ever find the strength to finish the act.  Maybe I've just been looking for those who found the energy to commit the act.

I'm just so tired.
