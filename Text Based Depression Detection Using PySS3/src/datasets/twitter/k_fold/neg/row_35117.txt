Death is approaching faster than ever, like a speeding train I am severely depressed and suicidal. I just want somebody to talk to. Right now, I have absolutely nobody. This isn't an exaggeration. I have no friends or relationships, and my family is withdrawing their support. I need someone to talk to.
