sickI have no clue what the fuck to do Ive been doing so bad for so long and getting worse and worse and it feels like my mind is fractured into a million hot shards of glass and I havent felt Ny grip on reality for so fucking long its just unbearable suicide feels like literally the only option I feel so ssick and scared but Im too detached to even kill myself its like my brain is slowly being eaten away and eventually nothing will be left inside me and I just want to end this unbearable feeling
