This is embarassing and funny at the same timeIm 28, no friends no gf since 10 years no job since 4 years

I have no one, only parents and sisters
I do not have mental illness per se but i suffer from psychological problems but im okay with them

No one could suspect i lived such a recluse life even after talking with me several times

I could find a job if i wanted but dont

Im not bad looking and have good clothing style, im in good shape physically

With alot of effort I could maybe find a girl that accept someone like me but it's unlikely

I could make 1 or 2 mediocre friends after years of efforts 

But all of that is absolutetly not worth it for me or for any mentally sane human to live a mediocre life not worth remembering

I WANT to kill myself, im not suffering, it's not depression that is talking but me, i failed at life because i wanted it all but i was disadavantaged compared to most people from the start

Im thinking about parents they are too fragile psychologicaly and their life is fucked up because of poor life decisions my suicide could destroy them but i dont particularly like them

Psychiatrist told me it will take me alot of times and effort to build a normal life but i dont want to spend tons of energy and time to build  a subpar life 

I already started drugs dealing to make money but i still lack a customers base

What can i do?
