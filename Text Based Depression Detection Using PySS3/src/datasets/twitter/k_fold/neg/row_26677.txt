New planSo, for posterity.

One more work week and i get paid. Gun laws are super lax in my state that i can just go to a private seller and just... buy a gun.


And thats what I'll do. I'm over trying in this fucked up world. There's no hope. No reason to continue to starve and be miserable.

I don't care who i hurt. I just want the pain to stop.
