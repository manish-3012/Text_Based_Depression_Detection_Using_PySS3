I don't think I can take this anymore...I just want to give upI keep trying to talk myself out of it. I feel conflicted, but I feel like part of me always wants to just end everything. I feel horrible. I feel like I"m not worth anything to anyone, and that even if people are hurt they'll get over it right? Who cares about me? I'm just a mess, a person that can't hold their perfectly normal life together. I have friends but no one wants to talk to me, or if they do I feel like a burden. It's to the point where I started a fight with my best friend today just so that they would hate me a little, and if I ended it right now they wouldn't be too broken up about it. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I just want to end it all. I don't know why I'm posting this. I feel like I should just stop typing right now and take out a kitchen knife and be done with it. I don't want any attention. I don't want anyone to know. I just want to do it. I'm so tired of trying to hold myself together. I just want to sleep and never wake up. I"m too chicken to call the hotlines - I even feel weak and stupid posting this. I'm not saying other people that post are weak and stupid, I just feel like they deserve to live more than I do. I don't want to live anymore.
