Frustrated and will end soonSorry in advanced for this. I struggled with anxiety and depression all my life. I've suffered years of emotional trauma and I was sexually assaulted when i was in hs. I feel so frustrated i don't know what i did to deserve any of this. People will always say that they will always be there for them but when it inconveniences them they leave you.  When you bring up suicide they say they will listen to you. It's all for show. Everyone is afraid of me now. I had to leave school for a semester what a fucking sore loser I must be right?  I lost everyone from college I only talk to two people and I'm sure they are sick and tired of me complaining and always being sad. Nobody gets it I don't have anything to live for. When I go back I know I will be alone. That is why when i go back in the spring I have decided that if my life doesn't improve by my birthday ( in the spring) I will kill myself. My reasoning is that I am w family for the next six months and I don't want them to witness my death and be scarred. I'm only alive because of my family and that's not fair. That is  why when I go back I will be alone and no one to stop me. People only care once someone is dead and even that it's only for a little bit.
