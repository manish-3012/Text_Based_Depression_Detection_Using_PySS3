-I would like to say thanks to Panderpmonium for sending me to this sub reddit
This is a repost of a post i put into depression originally but apparently this is a better suited subreddit so here i am
I would like to start this by saying i would to remain anonymous and just share something deep and personal. I'm not looking for a pity party i just felt like sharing what I'm currently feeling because no one i know would even get a bit of what I'm truly feeling but i hope you all can at least see where i'm coming from

I'm fucking horrible
I absolutely hate myself 
I'm nothing
Useless
Worthless
A waste of time
A burden on all my friends and family and my loved one
I should just end it someday
I can't even do anything right and i fuck up everything and every relationship
I have no fucking good qualities
I can't fix anything
I can't clean
I can't cook
I'm not athletic
I'm ugly
I'm not a good student
I'm clumsy
Not trustworthy apparently
I'm probably shit at music its just everyone is too nice to tell me anything because they think i'm going to be hurt
I'm seriously contemplating leaving everyone's life so it can be the one thing i did right in all my fucking useless life
Know when to leave before i just ruin everyone's life 
I'm ungrateful of what i have
My parent's have always given me everything i ever wanted ever since i was a child yet I'm still fucking depressed because none of them even take the time to truly listen to me but they deserve a better son, I'm just a disappointment. I have not once ever made them truly proud of me.
Not even my girlfriend fucking believes in me anymore
She may say she has faith in me or whatever but I'm not stupid
She doesn't believe in me anymore and thinks my word isn't worth shit and I'm not even fucking worth her time like why the hell am i even with her if i'm always fucking insecure and feel like shes going to cheat? I'm literal fucking trash and i don't deserve to even be with anyone 
I'm probably meant to be alone because I'm too goddamn emotionally unstable and i have very low self esteem and how the saying goes "you have to love yourself before you can love anyone" but i can't even fucking do that
I probably won't live passed 40 from my constant torment
I have a vice that really isn't healthy for me but i continue to so i can at least ignore myself and drown out my insecurities but it always comes back
Everyone should stop giving a shit about me because i'm not worth redeeming
I'm so sorry to everyone for being a burden
Sorry to my friends for ever having crossed paths with them and torment them with my bullshit 
Sorry to my parents for not being a good son and just a overall disappointment to my whole family
Sorry to my brothers for being a burden to them and for annoying them and for having them put up with me
Sorry to my lover for not being the lover she deserves
I'm sorry to everyone and I won't bother the world someday and when it happens. All my loved ones will have a much better life without me
I'm sorry
