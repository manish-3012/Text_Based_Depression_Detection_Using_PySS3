Any of you get suicidal thoughts out of nowhere?Just wanted to ask before I go to sleep.

Over the past few years, there's been a lot of changes in my family that I'm still not used to. Everybody has moved on but I haven't. I've been told that I should do the same but I can't. I'm still angry at certain family member because they're the cause of the biggest change. I'm confused and upset by all this which is making hard to get passed it. When somebody does something that affects the entire family and you, its clear that getting over it isn't an option. Why do people act the way they do?

I've been like this since 2015. Before then, I've never had thoughts of suicide and cutting. I never thought that I'd start hitting my arms because I can't hit someone else. I didn't think that I would have to debate whether or not I should off myself.

Every now and then a suicidal thought will come out of nowhere and linger in my head for a long time. Same thing with cutting myself. I think about cutting even though I haven't done it. When I get these thoughts I wonder if I should live. Recently, I thought about not eating but that has to do with something else.

Do this happen to you? Sudden thoughts of suicide or harming? I could be happy then I'll abruptly think about suicide and it'll bring down the mood. I'm not sure why this happens but I'm positive that other people experience this. Could my mind be telling me that I'm not good enough? I don't know if I want to end things or cut. Its a difficult battle with myself.

It's getting late where I am so I'll stop. If I get any responses then I'll answer when I wake up.
