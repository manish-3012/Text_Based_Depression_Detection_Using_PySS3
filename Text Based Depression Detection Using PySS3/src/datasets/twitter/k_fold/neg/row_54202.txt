Iâ€™m going to jump off of a freeway overpass tonight.
Hey r/suicide watch,

I feel extremely guilty for even writing this but I think itâ€™s needed as I feel my mind becoming darker as the depression fog fucks with what I think is real. I think I am extremely sick and I believe that there is no help for me.

Iâ€™m a 21 year old virgin dumb loser who because of depression, goes to community college while my fellow colleagues and people my age are either, partying, having kids, or graduating from college with extravagant jobs. Me on the other hand stay at home lay in bed and cry. If I am not doing that Iâ€™m eating myself to death. Itâ€™s so sad to the point where Iâ€™m thinking about going to the freeway overpasses Iâ€™ve been to before and jumping off . Iâ€™m never going to escape the claws of depression and I hope that my life can be used as an example that some people are just too fucked to be help in this miserable world.
