My mind won't shut up.This is the first time I've truly allow myself to think it. I wasn't abused, I didn't have a terrible childhood, but I want nothing and I feel nothing. I'm married and my wife has been depressed for as long as we know each other. She is still under treatment and I've been her caretaker a few times. I've been feeling terrible for weeks but I couldn't hold it any longer. Not being able to go out and concentrate in other stuff has been killing me. Now my mind wants to kill me. It won't shut up. "when? How? You don't deserve any of this!" My wife doesn't know how to deal with me in this way. She gets mad at me which doesn't fucking work. She's sleeping right now and my mind keeps trying to end it. I do have things to do, I do want to live, but at the same time, I don't see the point. I feel guilty for not being able of making her happy, even tho I'm not the cause for her depression. I feel like I'm stuck in life and will never be able to get out of the hole. I don't want to be encouraged or to be told that you're going to be my friend. I just want it to write to someone anonymously.
