It doesn't get better for meI've had this line of thought for a very long time. I've been hospitalized, taken all different meds, outpatient,  CBT, DBT, regular therapy, ignored the feelings,  everything.  I've moved living situation more than 4 times. I've forced myself to 'think positively'. Nothing seems to make a dent. I've been receiving disability for more than 7 years and I'm just a resource drain. I have a boyfriend who doesn't know the extent. I've lost most of my friends. I'm tired of burdening people. And I'm afraid that getting 'help' will drive the remaining people away.
