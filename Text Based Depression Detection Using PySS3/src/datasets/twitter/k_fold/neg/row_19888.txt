Losing everyoneI feel like I've lost everything I've ever cared about. I lost my parents first when they decided that they'd abuse me, then my grandad, my friend committed suicide and it was my fault, two of the people supporting Mr now want nothing more to do with me and someone who was like a mother to me has just cut ties and left the area. I don't want to do this anymore, I'm sick of it. I don't know why I'm still alive rn, clearly there's no point
