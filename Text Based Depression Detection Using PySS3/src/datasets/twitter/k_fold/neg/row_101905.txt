I'm done being a monster to my familyAfter years of just stacking on trauma, I've become someone I never wanted to be. I get angry quick now,I act selfishly, and  I can barely feel anything. 
But tonight I'm just done. I know it'll be easier for them, they keep trying to help me but if I'm in one of my moods I basically shit on them. 
I'm over not being able to predict my own emotions when something happens or not feeling anything at all.
And besides, I think physically my body's done with me too. I'm sitting here starving, there's dinner out on the table for me (been there for 2 hours ) and I've locked myself away in my room even though I want it?
