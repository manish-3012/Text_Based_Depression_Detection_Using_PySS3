will i die from taking lots of metformin tablets?There's not that many paracetamol or ibuprofen tablets but they are loads of metformin tablets that my dad used to take but he doesn't take them anymore.

I just want to die, i'm depressed and a bad person. I'm really useless and boring too and i can't make anybody happy.
