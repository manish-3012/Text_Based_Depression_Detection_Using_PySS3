I've been on this road for a while, I'm tired of it not being under my control. I'm taking control this morning.I feel like I'm dying. Absolutely exhausted from feeling like I'm dying without any control. I'd rather feel like this from my own hands. Honestly for as verbose as I am I actually don't have much else to add. I feel absolutely worthless and pathetic that I can't escape myself, I'm just tired of fighting. Thank you all
