I was told the only thing I ever wanted to do with my life wasn't viable. And it isn't. Fuck.I was stupid enough to make a fucking reddit post about whether the only thing I've ever wanted to do with my life was viable. I knew it wasn't. I knew that the job opportunities for it were next to nothing. I knew that it was pointless. But having that confined by other people? That yes, it's a horrible stupid idea and a waste of money and that you'll never get a job and everything? That really was the nail in the coffin. Literally. There has never been anything else I've ever wanted to do with my life. It just all seems hopeless - anything I would want to do either barely pays, is impossible to get a job in, or some other stupid fucking thing. 

So immediately my brilliant-nothing-can-go-wrong amazing day turns into plan-your-suicide-101. God I fucking love bipolar. 

I'm not going to do anything. I wouldn't. But fuck it if I don't want to. 

Edit: if only i wasn't a fucking child either and could get help/contact someone/admit myself without my parents having to oversee everything and tell me it's just fucking moods swings. yeah. i can't even talk to my fucking psych without them knowing.
