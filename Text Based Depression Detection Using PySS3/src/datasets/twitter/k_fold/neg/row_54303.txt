How do I stop feeling like I need to do it?
I really donâ€™t want to do it but sometimes the feeling is just so strong. I donâ€™t want to live with it for the rest of my life. Is there any way to make it stop. Iâ€™m afraid that one day Iâ€™m going to end my life and I wonâ€™t even be able to stop myself.
