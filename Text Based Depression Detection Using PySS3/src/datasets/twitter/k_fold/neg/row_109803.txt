My one dream is to write a novel but I donâ€™t think I will live long enoughIâ€™m severely depressed, but permanently and I have been for several years now. I have these ideas that I want to see come to life in a novel but I donâ€™t know if I can keep living long enough to finish it. I barely sleep and eat, and I feel like even if I donâ€™t commit suicide I will die soon anyway. Life around me is painful and waking up is really difficult. I have no motivation to continue writing but I really want to, all my grades at school are failing and I have no energy to think about much. My family insults me and I have no friends. Im writing for myself but it takes so long to even write a paragraph because I am pouring my heart and entire existence into it. I donâ€™t want to keep living, it is a struggle to keep living, but at the same time I love writing and living in fictional worlds and if Iâ€™m dead I will not be able to do this. But I think my braincells are disappearing, and I have no time to write at school because people at school are very judgemental and I have no time by myself, and the people in the library are rude. The only time I have by myself is 1am-4am where I can write in peace without any distraction so I am loosing more sleep and with the lack of sleep I think I am loosing my imagination and ability to function in society and think. I am afraid to think about the future and careers because I donâ€™t feel like I will have a future, or that my future will be very grim. I am in need of any advice
