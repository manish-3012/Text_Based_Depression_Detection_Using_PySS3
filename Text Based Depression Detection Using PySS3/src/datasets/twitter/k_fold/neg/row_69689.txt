I cant take this anymoreI'm not even sure why I'm writing here. Or what I'm going to say.

&amp;#x200B;

I cant take it any more, I dont get it how people can go around smiling and laughing all the time. My life have been a living hell for most of my life and at this time there just isnt any fight left in me. I dont want to live any more. I just want everything to be over. I want it to be quiet. I want my feelings to go away. I just want to end it all. I dont have anything to fight for any more.

&amp;#x200B;

For most of my life I've been living with undiagnosed ADHD. Making my life very difficult. At least in my teens I had one family member that made my life better. My grandfather. He got cancer, and died after fighting it for 12 years. While he was alive I wanted to take my life more then once. But I just couldn't disappoint him that way and make his fight even worse. He died 2 years ago. And after he went away I cant find anything in my life that is worth fighting for. And I cant really disappoint him any more since he isnt here any more.

&amp;#x200B;

I have huge money problems, I cant tell you how much. Because I dont know, I lost control 3-4 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont have any friends left. I've never been good in social settings. I have lost all my friends, some from my ADHD when I lost my head and scared people away. And the rest from bad behaviour from me in general. Most of my life I've used on internet with games. And the people there doesn't really care about you. And either should they in that way, its a game you are supposed to have fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had some poor relationships, they have all ended badly. And usually I've just found a new rebound relationship. In short. Its all just a mess.

&amp;#x200B;

This year I've had knee surgery. That didnt go well either, I went into a deep depression. And failed to keep in touch with my job, so I lost that. And I lost my rights to welfare also because of that. So I cant work and I dont have any income.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to start school last autumn. That didn't work out, I could not focus and dropped out.

&amp;#x200B;

I have found the method I want to end everything with. All I have to do is go trough with it. And at the moment there isn't really anything stopping me. I dont have anything to fight for any more. And I dont want to live. If I dont go trough with it, I know I have to work with my self for the rest of my life. And that the fight just have started. I just cant see why I shouldn't do it. Because I cant take this any more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, I dont know why I'm writhing this or what I want from it. But I needed to tell someone.
