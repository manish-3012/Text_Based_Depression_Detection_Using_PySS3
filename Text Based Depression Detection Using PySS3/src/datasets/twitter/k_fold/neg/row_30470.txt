I'm so stressed and confused about everythingI've just been constantly stressed this entire summer break because of not only SATs but also school (my schedule for next year is excessive although most of what is on it is technically what I want), and its led me to constantly be hyper reactive to my surroundings, getting mad at things that are so excessively trivial and I feel so mad and helpless every time I get blow up at my mom. In addition to all of this I genuinely am so confused at my own sexuality and gender identity. It's not like me or my family have anything against it morally, but maybe it's a subconscious social thing? Idk. All I know is I'm not sure of what I am, what my sexuality is, and it's not helping I've got all of these other social and academic issues in my life either. All of this made me consider suicide, but I know that I will disappoint so many different people, not just my family but school teachers and friends as well, so I cant even come close to actually doing it but I constantly go through possible scenarios of how I could commit suicide despite myself knowing it cant possibly he healthy for me. I hope I'll pull through this time as I did many other times, but who knows. To whoever spent their time reading through a stranger's annoyingly long post, seriously, thank you.
