stuck and giving upfor the longest time iâ€™ve felt extremely paranoid, burdened with ocd, and anxious. iâ€™ve been waiting for the â€œit gets betterâ€ but iâ€™m starting to believe itâ€™s a lie. iâ€™ve been like this for ten years and iâ€™ve seen nothing except that itâ€™s all gotten worse. iâ€™m stuck in an abusive and toxic household with no escape. iâ€™ve been trying so hard to get a job and iâ€™ve only gotten one in the past but it made my mental health ten times worse so i had to quit. my town is small so i donâ€™t get anything back and it hurts. i donâ€™t think i can do this anymore. i keep thinking about how iâ€™m going to be 20 soon (not old, i know) but it sucks that i still live in this place of trauma when i thought iâ€™d be out at 18. i held onto that hope ever since i was a kid that 18 would be my magic number, but it wasnâ€™t and 20 wonâ€™t be either. i go to my boyfriend and best friend whenever i feel this way, but i feel it so often and they donâ€™t have much to say to help and to be fair, i wouldnâ€™t either, especially since they arenâ€™t feeling good either. iâ€™ve taken medication before and all it did was make me mentally and physically numb, iâ€™ve tried going outside, iâ€™ve tried getting a new hobby. itâ€™s all fleeting and i feel like i donâ€™t deserve to be happy anyway. i feel disgusting. i canâ€™t even tell my own mother because sheâ€™s threatened multiple times to â€œship me offâ€ when i was a child because i wasnâ€™t getting better fast enough. she still does this to me now. she doesnâ€™t understand that i have personal boundaries and says iâ€™m a bad person because of them. after being out as trans for such a long time, even yesterday she asked to call me by my birth name because it â€œmade her comfortable and she tried so hard to find that nameâ€. as if i didnâ€™t try hard for mine and i explained to her that itâ€™s my name, i deserve to be comfortable, not anyone else. but all she does is gaslight and manipulate me, trying to make me feel bad for her and iâ€™m the bad person. NEVER would i tell her iâ€™m feeling bad, all she does is say â€œiâ€™m tired of this, iâ€™ll just send you awayâ€. as if iâ€™m not fucking tired, iâ€™m living it. i donâ€™t even know who i am anymore and why i should keep going. all i get is worse and i feel bad for telling people that i feel bad because iâ€™ve done it so often and they canâ€™t offer me any advice. iâ€™ve had set plans to kill myself and honestly iâ€™m so damn close. iâ€™m infuriated and burnt out.
