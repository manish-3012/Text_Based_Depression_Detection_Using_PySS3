no one left to talk tothereâ€™s no one i can confide in because of the intense intervention that occurs with suicidal ideation. last time i communicated my feelings i was assaulted by police, arrested for wanting to kill myself, and locked away for 8 days with actual schizophrenics and patients with psychosis (not to mention actual murderers). i trust no one but myself with my thoughts. until i live in a country where intervention doesnâ€™t involve prison, (anywhere but USA?) iâ€™m keeping it all to myself. i wish there werenâ€™t such insane consequences for vocalizing ones thoughts.
