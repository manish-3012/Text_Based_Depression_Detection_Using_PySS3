Woke up wanting to die - everything seems clear to me
Woke up and seriously have contemplated suicide. 

My life is just nothing special. 

Nobody has been in love with me and the only attention Iâ€™ve gotten is from desperate guys that want to fuck me - well soon I wonâ€™t be young or attractive enough for even that. 

Iâ€™m ignored in my job and Iâ€™m not successful enough to interact in the creative circles I want to and none of my projects can kick off because I can never get any funding so Iâ€™m just stuck in the cycle of struggling while working at the bottom. 
Soon my life will be over and the years Iâ€™ve spent writing will have been for nothing. 

Itâ€™s weird, i havenâ€™t felt that bad over the past few days but when I woke up this morning, everything kind of fell into place.
