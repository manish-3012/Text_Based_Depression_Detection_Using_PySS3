Please, do us all a favorThis is an open invitation to anyone out there who hates people that use food stamps because they are lazy and entitled and fraudulent and all this other shit (and based on the reading I've been doing I know there are a LOT of them out there), to please come and kill me, and stop my egregious misuse of your tax dollars.  Because believe me, if I could just starve myself to death instead I would, but it's unfortunately not that easy.
