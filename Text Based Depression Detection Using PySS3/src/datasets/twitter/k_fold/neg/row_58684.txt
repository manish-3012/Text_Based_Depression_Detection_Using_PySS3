If you don't love yourself no one else willHow the fuck am I supposed to do that when I am a bottom feeder of society? When every time I show someone my photo it never receives any positive feedback? When I'm self aware enough to KNOW that I'm fundamentally ugly? When all I have suffered is a lifetime of rejection, despite my efforts to take care of myself and workout. If you're ugly and work out, you're just a different shaped ugly person. I have no other attractive qualities, nor the motivation or capacity to have a high paying job and be succesful.

In my honest opinion, from experience, there is no reason to live if you are unhappy and foreveralone.
