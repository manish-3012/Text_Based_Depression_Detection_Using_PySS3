Been a year since I was on here, yet I feel I need someone more than ever.Last time I posted here it was 9 days until my birthday, I felt terrible and thought I'd end it within those 9 days. I couldn't go to college and my lying kept me from having friends and a relationship. Tomorrow will be 2 weeks until my birthday and i'm even more depressed than I was then. Since a year ago since I couldn't make it to college I decided to join the army, If I couldn't help myself maybe I could help others. I got kicked out of the army in February because I couldn't do airborne standards and my mos required me to be airborne. A week later my grandfather died and everything was falling in front of me. As sad as I was I needed someone and I found what some guys would call the girl of their dreams. Everything was starting to go good, I got my college applications in on time and I was planning to work during the summer, everything I thought was going to be okay. Last week my girlfriend broke up with me and now I learned she going out with someone i'd like to consider my worst enemy. This guy literally told me to kill myself before after my grandfather died, You have no idea how that made me feel, and now I can't sleep and I have started to consume alcohol every day since we broke up, I do it because it stops urges of me wanting to harm myself. I don't know what to do and I don't want to go to some counselor because I've tried before and that's just not for me. I know there's no magic answer but if anyone has any advice it would really mean the world to me because I struggle just to get out of bed now.
