Iâ€™m alone.I wish I could go back a year ago and fix all the mistakes I made I was a horrible boy friend I was too big headed and I took her for granted and now sheâ€™s seeing someone else but I still love her and I would do anything to fix what we had even if people tell me to â€œavoid her sheâ€™s nutsâ€ I canâ€™t breathe without her but she left me for someone else and everyday this horrible feeling gets worse and worse even if she came back how could we trust each other after all thatâ€™s happened? Why do I sabotage myself without knowing it? When will I ever be happy?
