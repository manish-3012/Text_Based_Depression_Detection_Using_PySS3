I dont know who to talk to?I have all these suicidal thoughts, rape thoughts and murder thoughts I want to get off my chest but I dont know who to tell or why anyone would want to hear me talk continuously about my problems? I cant tell my family about the these thoughts because I once thought about murdering them and I kept them out of my sight for 2 days by locking myself in my room. I cant talk to my male friends because they would think I'm weak for sharing my thoughts and emotions with them and they wont take me seriously. I cant tell my female friends because then they would think I'm a creep or fucked up and they'd be scared of me and stop seeing me. I cant see a therapist because I dont wanna burden my parents with stupid financial problems and I dont know if I'm actually depressed enough to see a therapist or if I'm making all this stuff up for attention? I just dont know who to talk to? Sometimes I just wish to end my life but I either dont have the will to do it or I dont want my parents to go through the trauma of seeing their youngest child killing himself on any other regular day and havent even graduated university. 
Please help me.
