What are your thoughts regarding leaving a letter?Is leaving a letter more for the person who ctb or for the people being left behind? Do you think it would â€˜helpâ€™ or just make things worse? I donâ€™t know how I feel about it. I feel like itâ€™s just another selfish thing to do, instead of sparing them the details of whatâ€™s going on inside your mind.
