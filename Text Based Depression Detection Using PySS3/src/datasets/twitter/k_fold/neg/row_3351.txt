I Want To Be FreeI've wanted to kill myself since 2007. Suicidal thoughts swim through my head so much they dont even surprise me anymore. I think the last few years I've just been slowly accepting that I wanna die. I never wanted or planned to live a long life anyway. No one's coming to save me, and I don't trust anyone to open up to, I don't trust anyone period. I'm just bored. And the thing is, it's not even about hating life, it's about wanting to see what comes next. It's about wanting to see other worlds, other dimensions, other places that we can't see because we're stuck here. Its wanting to be free of everyone and everything, free of all my fear, doubt, pain, insecurity, all of my mental, emotional, psychological problems. Free forever. And even if there is nothing after I die, there's peace and quiet. Even if I'm not conscious to realize it. In either case, I would be finally free. My family's generational curses of addiction and mental disorders would all die with me, there'd be no kids to know what it's like to ask why daddy doesn't want you. No watching my body slowly break down and fail and fall apart, nothing. Freedom.

I always figured it would be in my 30s (I'm 29), but then why wait until 35? Or 40? Why wait so long? So I'm thinking I'd do it in six months, December of this year, my 30th birthday. I don't know how exactly, obviously I'd wanna be in my sleep when I go, and I don't think sleeping pills are as easy as people make it sound, like I'd just end up having my stomach pumped or something, but whatever. 

Feels good to say that.
