I hate it when people call suicidal people "stupid"I absolutely hate it when people call suicidal people/people who have commited suicide "stupid", "selfish" etc. because they clearly think that the person who chose to commit suicide only thought about themselves, and didnt give a flying fuck about the people around them, and could have easily reached out for help and the issues in their life automatically disappear.

Unsurprisingly, suicidal people HAVE thought about the consequences, have thought about a lot of things, and they are doing because THEY SEE NO OTHER OPTION. Calling them such things only reflect how selfish a person you are, for not empathising and trying to see what the hell theyve been through, and how much suffering they have been through. How all of their problems will not be solved easily even if you provided them support love and care.

Suicidal people are suicidal for a FUCKING reason, and invalidating their reason is probably the most disgusting and shameless thing you can do.
