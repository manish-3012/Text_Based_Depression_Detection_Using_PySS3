Its 7:36am, haven't slept, just ate a whole box of mac and cheese.Really makes a person wonder.. WTF am I doing with my life? I'm thinking of attempting later. I've got nothing to lose at this point. My anxiety is out of control, I can't leave my house. The psychotic symptoms are there almost all of the time except for a few lucid moments, which I cherish. I'm just fed up. I miss 2014 when I was in the hospital. It was such a nice, relaxing time.
