I hate my lifeMy life isn't that bad, it could be worse I guess.. It's just that I see all these people with such cool lives and I can't help but be envious. That was the reason for my suicide attempt in fall. I was unhappy, and wished to be born in a new life, but I failed obviously.

I want to try hanging myself again still. Honestly I don't think I want to be better, I just want to be pushed to be brave enough to kill myself. I'd be happy to be reborn.
