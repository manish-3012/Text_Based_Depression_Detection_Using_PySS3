.I don't know who I am. I don't have a personality. I don't know where I am. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't think I'm real. I don't want to die, but I don't know why, and nothing makes sense. I'm tired of being scared all the time. I walk past people, and their eyes bore holes into me. I feel like I'm naked all the time, and it fills me with shame. I'm not okay but it doesn't matter. I have had enough though. I can't hide anywhere. I feel really dirty. I don't recognise myself in the mirror. Nobody knows me. What is it in me reaching out? Pure instinct. Because I'm not here anymore. The harder I climb, the harder I fall. Down down down. Nothing makes sense. It's all in my head, but isn't everything? Some people claim to care about me, but how can they, when they don't even know me. Still, I don't want them to get hurt. I don't want anybody to suffer. I don't want to ever be cruel. Why would anyone care about me anyway. I'm not anybody. I'm just a thing. I want to help others, but I'll probably just make everything worse. I don't know why I'm here. I'm not good enough for what I believe is true. I feel nauseas, and dizzy, and this doesn't feel real. But I'm just gonna post this. A thing that posts something should amuse someone somewhere. I'm good amusement I think, I hear them laughing all the time.
