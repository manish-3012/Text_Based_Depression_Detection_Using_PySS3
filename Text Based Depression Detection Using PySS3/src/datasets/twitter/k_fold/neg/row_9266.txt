Having trouble dealing with the thoughts right nowI have been in a long depression, seriously, like 15 years.  I had finally decided to take one more shot at trying to have a happy life, and I really feel like it was all just taken away from me with this covid situation.  i'm having a really hard time seeing any light at the end of the tunnel the last few days.  i'm just tired of the struggle, and don't know what to do.  I just want to lie down and go to sleep forever.
