Constantly thinking about hanging myselfI live a very repetitive life and I don't really have many friends. My moods are usually up and down but even though most of the time I don't feel down or depressed, I often think about suicide and how to kill myself.
I think about it everyday. I look for places where to do it and things I would write in my note. I play little movies in my head of how my girlfriend and family would find out and how they might react.

I keep wondering why I do. That thought of ending it all is always there... A little thought that tells me to fuck it all..
