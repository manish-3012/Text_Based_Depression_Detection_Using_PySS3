The revolving door of bipolar disorder is almost overI donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. You know,all the other times Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself Iâ€™ve always thought about what would happen if I survived because I guess there was always a part of me that wanted to. I donâ€™t feel that way this time. Iâ€™m not planning for what will happen if I survive because I donâ€™t plan to survive. I donâ€™t even feel depressed. I feel peaceful because I know I donâ€™t have to do this anymore. I know this is the right choice. I won't bug anyone anymore. I won't worry my parents/brothers/boyfriend. I won't fuck up my kids. They're all free. And so am I. I wrote out my suicide note and who gets what of the shitty belongings I have. It feels good. It feels peaceful.
