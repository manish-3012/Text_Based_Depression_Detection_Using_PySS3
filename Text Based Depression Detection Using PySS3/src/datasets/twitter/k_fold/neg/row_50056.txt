3rd post/second update on recently suicidal GFFor those keeping track of my last few posts...thank you for the messages and comments, ilI fowarded the most supportive ones to her and it seemed to make her day.
My girlfriend...or sort of ex girlfriend as I'm moving as I've metioned before.

Her ex obviously is badgering her about the child support and guiltily her, calling her a bad mother and I tried to find a person who can repair her car issue for what little money she has...so she can go back to work but it seems that this isn't going her way.

I'm still concerned that she will attempt to kill herself again. This morning it took me 4 calls to get her to pick up the phone and she told me she was crying for 3 hours. I got out of her that she was thinking about her hopeless situation again and how nobody but me seems to care or try to help but that I'm leaving and "don't love her enough to stay and support her".

Now I know I don't have to defend my life choices but I have a job have to start soon and this money I have to use to get myself on my feet and help my dad who us blind from MS and diabetes so there is just so much I can do.

I wish I could help her but I can't bankrupt myself. So I did my best the last week. As I posted I did what I could for her and her daughter and finally saw a smile on her face and even took photos to remind me that she can at least..look like she's normal.

I don't know what to do. I feel like a terrible human being for wanting her to find another guy who can support her so I don't have to feel bad.
