I feel at peaceIâ€™ve always planned on ending it all and that thought kind of made me emotional many times, earlier in my life.

But now, i feel at peace. I feel the anxiety, that swirls around me like a tree in a hurricane, has passed. 

When I think of it now, it calms me, if anything. Itâ€™s a beautiful fantasy.
