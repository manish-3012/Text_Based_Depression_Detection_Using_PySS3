I think I know why people kill themselves when they start to feel betterI wasted so many fucking years, I lost my fucking youth to this shit, supposedly the best time of my life. Now I can see things clearly. I can see how fucked up it was, the stupid shit I did, the people I hurt. I'm so far behind my peers it's sorry, yet here I am in the hole I dug for myself. I'm in too deep. I don't know how to fix my life. I really don't. I hate how things are, I hate how they were, and I feel powerless to change anything. So what does someone do at this point? Suicide is looking like a good option.
