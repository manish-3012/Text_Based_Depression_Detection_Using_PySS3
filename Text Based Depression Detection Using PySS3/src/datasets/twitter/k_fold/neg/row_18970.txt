It would be so liberating to dieTo just let go, close my eyes, let the darkness take me and void consume me. All senses shut down and not existing.

Instead I have to wake up every morning, only to suffer what failure and disappointment I am. Life is not worth living for me. The few nice things that happen do not excuse the overwhelming majority of my time when I just feel hopeless, tired and done with.

I have way better life than most people that posted here and still I just want to die. 

I have no ambition, drive or other desires. For all the help I get and work I put in trying to get better, the desire to end it all is as strong as ever. 

I feel like no activity, person or relationship is worth investing time and effort to receive back that little comfort that may prolong my life. They never last and they always end in dissapointment. 

I wish there would have been a painless way to die. To just shut down forever. Death cannot be that worse than how I feel now: empty and dark. 

OK, that was my venting for the day. 
Love you guys.
