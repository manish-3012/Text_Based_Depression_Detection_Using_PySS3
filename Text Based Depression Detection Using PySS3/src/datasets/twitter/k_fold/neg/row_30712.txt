Time to just release everything.I've been having extremely bad suicial thoughts since the start of 2018 now. I have attempted to hang myself twice and am a frequent scratcher because I'm not prepared to cut myself. I've lost hope in my parents because they don't believe my thoughts due to the fact I don't have a reason and my friends can only help so much. I recently just came back from a holiday and during it I found an apparent suicide jumper hotspot and the urge to jump was there, I was just ready at that point but I didn't for some reason. I don't feel like I have a purpose in this world and I'm always the butt of jokes. My dad mocked me for scratching myself, my friend (now enemy) told my crush to date me and she then friendzoned me and told me it was all a dare. I just don't enjoy my life anymore, it's really painful to go on. I can't sleep, I can't find motivation to do anything and I'm just over it all.
