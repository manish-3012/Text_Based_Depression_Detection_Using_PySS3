Please... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE scroll down to "Summary".

AAAAAAAAAAH I feel like if something is going to happen, it is going to happen tonight or tomorrow. I am extremely on edge.

I NEED people to know how much I'm suffering. I impossibly NEED the attention of an atomized society where everyone only cares about themselves and their own self interest. If they're doing fine, nothing is their problem.

Right now NONE of the people I see around me know what's going on in my head I am about to do something drastic like smash all the windows in the place I'm in and start throwing chairs. HELP ME!

Reaching out right now to reddit is the same thing as grabbing a person by the arm and telling them, "HELP"! I don't expect it to do much.

Constant suffering. NO ONE KNOWS!
