20 year old U.S male, planning second attempt. going to make sure it happens this time.i have a lot to say but it doesn't matter. i'll give some examples of how people in my life treat me and how it makes me feel. no incel stuff here, i'm more well off than others financially, intellectually and physically.

you know in American Psycho when Bateman breaks up with his date and says "i have homicidal thoughts that cannot be corrected"? it's like that. this cannot fucking be fixed and i'm sick and god damn fucking tired of trying and doing the same bullshit every day, tired of holding a fucking knife to my neck to stop thinking of suicide, tired of fucking hating every worthless second.

i just fucking hate every waking moment of every day. the only thing i enjoy is sleep and i got 2 hours of that before work today. god it just fucking HURTS. i'm anxious all day every day about fucking everything. and i've been taking care of myself - i've been taking lexapro every day like i should, working out 6 days a week, eating right, getting re-enrolled, going to therapy. it's not fucking working and i feel even worse than i did during my first attempt. for the first time in 3-4 years i've actually tried, and i've been better and corrected behaviors, and i feel fucking worse than i did when i was smoking pot, skipping class and playing video games all day

i've been taking care of myself but nobody gives a fuck about me. the 3rd girl i've ever loved gave me the most intimate experience of my life, a week later professed her love for me at a party she came to with her boyfriend, and the next day told me over the phone she doesn't feel anything for me. this was last week. we knew eachother for 4 fucking years and this is how our beautiful adventure ends.

i've been talking to this girl for 2 months that i like sort of. we've been on dates and made out and she was my v-day kiss. we work nearby so i saw her for like 30 mins when her store was dead, i went and got breakfast for her and we make plans to go to her place tonight. now it's "oh sorry me and my friend just made plans, oh and i forgot that other girl is staying the night". i canceled going to a fucking concert with my brother and his best friend for her to do this again. if you don't like me, just tell me you don't fucking like me so i don't have to hate myself. you don't have to sugar coat it, you talk to me one way but treat me another, just fucking say it and i'll fuck off if that's what you want.

here, okay, this is the best one. my best friend. my best friend is a girl i've been close with for 5 years. that's a quarter of my life. i just got out of a 4+ year abusive relationship with my ex and i'm finally, after years of this happening and months of us being separated, telling my BEST FRIEND about the verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. her reaction? "oh wow. Jaiden did that? Wow! I can totally see that." fucking nothing! "I... can't keep it to myself anymore. I was sexually abused for a really long time." "daaaamn Anon wow!" 

we're talking about something deep yesterday and i finally reveal to her, after a year of it killing me inside and no one knowing, i attempted suicide. and she literally just fucking ignored it.

i'm a normal fucking guy and i've been taking care of myself. i was a recluse for so long and these past few months i've been saying fuck it, i'll fight through the anxiety and paranoia and i'll do it. i'll be healthy. i get a job, get things sorted out with school, i lose 10 pounds and regain a lot of lost muscle, play guitar and sing like i used to, and i just feel fucking worse. and i TRY to have these relationships and it just makes it worse.

i'm not an asshole, i'm not annoying or unfunny, i'm a normal, intelligent, attractive guy who gives a fuck about shit and takes care of himself. but no one cares about me. you know that song "Behind Blue Eyes" by The Who that Limp Bizkit shat all over? that's me.

i'd rather just go back to being alone, because at least i had control. i'd rather be an addict or an alcoholic. i'm fucking tired. i feel like shit every day and realize no one loves me or will ever love me. there's just something wrong deep down inside, and i just wasn't meant to be here.

this is the perfect time of year for this actually. that song "That's Life" by Frank Sinatra - the message and the chronology. he keeps trying and trying and if he never wins then it wasn't meant to be, "if there's nothing shaking this here come July, I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die".

i turn 21 July 1st. if things don't change by then... if they just get worse like they keep doing... i'm doing it this time, and i'm fucking doing it for real. no pills and alcohol. i'm going to make it work.

fuck it i hate fucking being here i don't want to live and i never fucking asked to
