I donâ€™t feel human anymoreI pray every day to let me die. And then I feel worse when I see good people die who had people love them and need them and be destroyed by their absence. I want to trade places with them so badly. Keep at least one good person alive and me gone. Iâ€™m not a human anymore anyways. I mean all those guys that made me feel like garbage they couldnâ€™t all be wrong right? I mean you wouldnâ€™t just fuck a human being and then run away from it right? You do that with something thatâ€™s inhuman and canâ€™t feel anything. 

I hurt all the people in my life. I let my parents down. My bf canâ€™t handle my emotions and now his life is taking a nose dive. I canâ€™t concentrate at work. I have this beautiful fantasy of dying and waking up in this place where thereâ€™s no emotions and everything is finally quiet and calm and beautiful. I have a plan I just need to get drunk enough to do it. But Iâ€™m getting there. Hopefully by April Iâ€™ll be gone.
