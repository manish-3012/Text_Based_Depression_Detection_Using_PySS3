Timeâ€™s running out.I think Iâ€™m actually, genuinely, going to kill myself when I turn 25 in September. Maybe not right around my birthday. But within the month or later in the year. 

I told myself way back when I started college that if I was still feeling my same pitiful, worthless self - even after graduating and finding a career and working to make a life for myself, that I could go ahead and blow my brains out. Gave myself time to reflect and try to change my mindset. I even finally opened up and went to counseling during school and told some of my friends about what was going on with me. Still havenâ€™t changed. And now itâ€™s time to throw in the towel. 

I have a gun and a plan. I will succeed. I think Iâ€™m going to start drafting a note and making my arrangements. Thankfully my family had our wills legally notarized so the money Iâ€™ve made will go to them and not to the state.
