I want to die. What do I do.Don't tell me to go to a therapist or psych ward. I've done it before many times and they don't work.

I don't have friends, I don't have family, my boyfriend just broke up with me and we live together so he's going to expect me to leave. I've got too much debt, and I hate me. I've tried for years to feel good and be better and change. And I'm tired of being sad and alone...

What do I do...

I'm sorry.
