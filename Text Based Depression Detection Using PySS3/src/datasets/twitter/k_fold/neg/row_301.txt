Is there actually any hope?Everything seems pretty pointless to me, absolutely pointless. There are things in the future that I should be looking forward to, and I should be excited about them, but I'm not really. The only thing I think that actually makes me happy anymore is attention sometimes, but even then it doesn't always. I'm also, spectacularly useless, and worthless. This is not something I'm going to argue about, they are facts. I don't even know if I really want to be useful to anyone anymore, I'm pretty selfish, on top of everything. Anyway, back to the main question, is there hope? What's the lowest you've been at that you manged to get back from? Can you change who you are as person, when narcissism seems to be all that makes up your identity at this point? And if you can't, do you deserve to even live then? If you know, that you're a horrible person, and you don't or can't change, do you have the right to live? I don't know if I do. I feel like maybe I don't.
