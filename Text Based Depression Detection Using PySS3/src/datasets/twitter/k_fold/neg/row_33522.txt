Iâ€™m sorryIâ€™m sorry bothering you but I have no where else to turn 

I literally wish I was dead daily like Iâ€™m not going to slit my wrist or something painful but often think about hanging or injections that put me to sleep or just be in a freak accident 

I was hospitalised a few years ago and nearly died from pneumonia and while I was in hospital was diagnosed with a very rare form of lung disease 

I wish I died in that bed but no I have to continue existing (not living)

Iâ€™m 28 have  no friends and weigh around 8 stone and Iâ€™m 6ft and continue to lose weight rapid, bad depression and anxiety attacks 

Still to this day I have constant blood tests CT scans other x rays ect and I canâ€™t take it anymore 

I literally canâ€™t walk 20 feet without feeling like Iâ€™m suffocating and collapse 

This is no life for a 28 yo man I see no future so what is the point 

So sorry you had to read my bullshit mods feel free to delete I know Iâ€™m depressing
