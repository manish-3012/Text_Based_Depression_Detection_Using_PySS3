I need to find help for my fiance. She is cutting herself, and its not just for attention.My fiance and i have been together for 10+ years and we have a three year old daughter. She has battled with her mental health for as long as i have known her and now she is cutting again. Apparently she is not doing it right, im having a hard time getting her to tell me things but she is trying to.
She is most definitely asking for help but i have no idea how to start and to balance my 50 hr a week job  while caring for my daughter. Im not sure if i should just try and listen to her talk but im no psycologist, and i feel helpless. 
Any advice or resources that people know of is appreciated.
