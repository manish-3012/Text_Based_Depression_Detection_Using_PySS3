Is there such a thing as a sex-positive suicide hotline?Just tried contacting a suicide hotline and the man told me I had to "stop being graphic" when I mentioned that I just had exploratory surgery to see if I had endometriosis around my uterus.  Wasn't even that gross.

It's just that no one can figure out what's wrong with me and I'm losing hope.  Obviously I'm going to mention what's made me feel suicidal in the first place.

I want to hurt myself because I hate my body so much.  Sure didn't help to have someone get mad at me for using the word "UTERUS."  Maybe he was right, my body is disgusting and graphic.  All the more reason to give up today.
