My parents make me wanna kill myselfPeople are lucky if they have good parents. Why? You see, people with good parents will always have people they can lean on, cry to, and ask for help. Good parents will not hurt their children on purpose. They will not tear their children down instead of lifting them up. They will not hinder you instead of cheering you on.  


Since the lock down started here in the Philippines, life has been worse. I had to stay home with my mother who loves to torment me and boss me around. She yells at me for even the slightest things. When instructed to go to the grocery, I am not allowed to buy anything I need. If she found out that I ended up buying something (like feminine wash that I ran out of), she instantly yells at me, attacks me, verbally, mentally and emotionally abuses me.  


One good thing the lock down brought was the fact that my dad is stuck in another country. He is the reason I have an eating disorder. I remember January 23, 2020 when he choked me, slapped me, and physically abused me 4 hours before my midterm exam. He was mad because I wanted to go grab brunch before taking the test. I only eat once a day since then.

I've always thought of committing suicide. I was close. Once. In high school. But I feel like I am getting closer to it now than I was before. Maybe someday, before quarantine ends, I might just be brave and strong enough to go through it. And if I succeed, please tell my parents that it was all their fault. For now, cuts and bruises will do.
