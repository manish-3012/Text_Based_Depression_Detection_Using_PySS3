Death by MDMA and Drowning (Combo)Hi all,

This is my first post on Reddit. I understand that i cannot be explicit in method, so I'll keep it very high level.

As a small background for you all, I've been thinking about suicide for the last 10 years (I'm in my 20's) - and i feel I've reached the point where I'm comfortable with myself to do it, while finding a suitable method to do so. The only thing that's held me back is how it would affect my loved ones. I've concluded that it won't matter to be once I'm dead. Still selfish though!

I would like to get your opinion (and perhaps some non-explicit advice) on this suicide method:

I'm thinking of ingesting illicit substances, waiting until I'm feeling disoriented, and then jumping off a bridge into water.
I believe at this point that drowning will be painless, and my mind will be in a state of limbo as this happens. It will be kind of peaceful.

This will be done during a music festival. Friends and siblings will be there, so it's a good opportunity to connect one last time with all. To say how i really feel about everyone, and to ensure their last experience with me is as positive as possible.
I will then ingest and walk away from the festival to a bridge close by.

I would like some opinions on the method (like the amount of drugs required, and if people have ever experienced something similar? Happy to answer any other questions..
Planned attempt is this month.

All the best,
