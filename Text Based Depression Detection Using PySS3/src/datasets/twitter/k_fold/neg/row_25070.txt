Why does everyone hate me?I feel like everyone is hating me. Why? Because i am poor. They say always i am lazy moochers i should get a good job, good education and not complain about poverty because they say i''m just lazy. But itsn ot that easy to get a good education and even harder to get a good job. Why do they say such things? I often feel complete useless and i just want to kill myself because i am a poor loser. What should i do?
