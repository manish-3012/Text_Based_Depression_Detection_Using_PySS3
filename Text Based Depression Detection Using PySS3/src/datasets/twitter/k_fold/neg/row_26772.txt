Desperate to dieI feel like I canâ€™t do this anymore. I have too much pain in my life from poor past decisions and life circumstances. Iâ€™ve tried therapy and medication for years but nothing has made a difference. I truly believe this is chronic for me and thereâ€™s no getting better. Iâ€™m emotionally and mentally exhausted. I hate myself and I hate my life. It seems so cruel that Iâ€™m forced to be alive when Iâ€™m in emotional agony all the time. I think if the people in my life really knew how I felt, theyâ€™d be ok with me choosing suicide. I donâ€™t think anyone would want me to live like this. 

The only thing stopping me is the fear of a failed attempt. I failed in October of last year and it was a terrible experience that Iâ€™m scared to repeat. How can I get over this fear so I can finally do what needs to be done? Am I allowed to ask that on here? I canâ€™t live like this anymore.
