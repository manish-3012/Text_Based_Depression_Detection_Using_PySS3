Out of everythingI received my thesis approval answer yesterday at 5, that's when finally the ice cracked under my feet.

It has been 5 years since I have been struggling with life, last 18 months have been crazy. Everyday I wake up more lonely.

I get claustrophobic even in a large room. ~~Sometimes~~ I feel what is it worth to living for. I couldn't stay up to my father's expectations. If this Thesis committee says no - no to rereview my thesis - I lose it all. No graduation tomorrow, no job, no Master's degree and finally no life. It may sound like ,"It's not the end of the world". Well, in my circumstance it's, as this will cut me off from my passion I started my life 5 years back with - and it will all go down the pit.

It's just that I cannot take this heavy burden on my head anymore. I seriously need some help..
