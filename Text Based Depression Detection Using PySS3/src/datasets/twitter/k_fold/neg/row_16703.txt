Meaningless life, infantilism, inferiority etcHello, I am 16 years old guy who just trying to live his life.

 I have inferiority complex i can't simply watch on people who is better than me, i think i have low intellegence, even more, i can't underestand maths and physics and what makes angry.

I have a lot of conflicts with my parents especialy mother, she always yells at me, telling how lazy and irresposible i am, and the problem is what she is right, i don't do anything to make my life better, i don't have any qualities to live on my one and move abroad, i think what i am a mistake which shoudn't be here. At the worst moments, i thinking how poitless is to struggle for something, i will die, sooner or later, by my own hand, or as helpless old man from the one of many several desises.

But this is not the end, the main problems is what i don't have streanth or will power to make my life better, or to make something what i call "final choice"(yes, commit suicide) i visited a lot sites and forums about suicide methods, i would gladly try to stab my chest, hang myself or jump under the train, but every time i was close to make my final FREE, INDEPENDENT, choice i was paralized by fear.

Summary: a guy who dont have interest for living at all, nor girls nor games, music, books can catch my attention. I dont have any hope left.
