I threw away my futureI threw away my future for a guy. i made the decision when i was 16 &amp; he was my first love. very typical story, heâ€™s been great to me and i still love him. but iâ€™m having regrets as i approach high school graduation &amp; im realizing i threw away my 3.9 gpa and 4 ap classes to stay home with him. last night, he told me heâ€™s thinking of moving to arizona. i feel like the dumbest girl on the planet. 
i decided to not go to college because i believed that we would stay together, and that he was worth it. now heâ€™s making it very clear that he doesnâ€™t see me that way. iâ€™m not worth that to him, and he would never had made that choice for me. 

I feel so helpless. the amount of regret iâ€™m feeling is so overwhelming. i donâ€™t want to keep living, not because i canâ€™t live without him, but because i canâ€™t live with myself. i wanted to be a surgeon. i wont be now because of young love.
