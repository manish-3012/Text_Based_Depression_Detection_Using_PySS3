What it comes down toMy mind is just all over the place, but there are 2 constants I have identified. 

I want to end myself to stop the terrible emotional effects my existence has on so many caring people who deserve better

I'm prevented from doing it because I don't know what negative effects my suicide will have on those same people

So do I just live in this limbo for another 30 years?  Hoping for a terminal disease to cut my time short?
