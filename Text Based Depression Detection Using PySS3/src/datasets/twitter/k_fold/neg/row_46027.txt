I don't want to die....but I am also so tired of living. 

I am actually scared to die and have no actual plans to kill myself, I'd never ever do that to my dog... but I'm just tired of waking up everyday to the same crappy life

No matter what I try, nothing pans out for me, it's always somehow me settling and I am just exhausted. 

I am in therapy but there's no point in messaging him or anything, on weekends, he has nothing to do with work, refers all clients to the crisis line. The crisis line is useless to me, as I can't open up to complete strangers like that. I've tried before and it didn't help

Anyway, I'm just feeling really low, tired and exhausted today. My support system is basically my therapist and 2 online friends and my dog. I wish I mattered to more people, even my own crap family :(
