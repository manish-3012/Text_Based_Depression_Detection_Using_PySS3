my life sucks so hardhi reddit i know the chances of someone reading this and giving a fuck is about 0.000001% but i will give it a shot in junior school i used to be the smartest kid in the whole school but when i went to highschool i lost all of my friends no one loved me no one give a fuck about me and all i did was watching porn like for 3-5 hours per day.. for like 3 years or more and now in college i cant make friends in matter of fact if i try no one would help me like i tried sitting near this boy in the lab as soon as he saw me putting the bag he left me to sit in the other table with the "cool people" im legit mate thinking about killing myself, no one love me im doing most of expieremnts that require 2 partners alone which takes double the time and most of the time i can hear them laughing about me my life sucks rn so much,and most of time people laugh behind my back in matter of fact just like last week when i went to lab i saw 3 girls laughing on me (they looked at me and then bursted in laughing) this happens alot with me
