Iâ€™ve fucked up so much to the point where Iâ€™m so scared of disappointing my mother that Iâ€™d rather kill my selfIâ€™m so so so stupid. The only way I can fix this is if I decide to take a gap year and go into another University next year. But my mom is going to hate me so much for it. Iâ€™ll be a year behind and my siblings will taunt me for it. I have no room in her house. But I canâ€™t drive, I donâ€™t have a job. I donâ€™t even have an ID yet. I canâ€™t tell my mom â€œhey you know how i had everything handled? Well I donâ€™t lol so I canâ€™t really afford it unless I go into a shit ton of debtâ€. 
Iâ€™m literally so fucking scared right now. Iâ€™d rather just commit suicide or run away and find a life.
