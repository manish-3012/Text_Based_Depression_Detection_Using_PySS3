TodayI have always helped others overcome their depression or loneliness. But today was day I felt so tired of life. I been struggling with depression and loneliness. Even though I am married, today I have caused that marriage to breakdown as I took pictures of myself naked on my laptop to see how I looked. I am ashamed of weight I have put on. I struggled all my life with it been my comfort as I was bullied because of my dyslexia and I was abused by a teacher when I was 5.
    My wife thinks I am pervert and that I am having an affair. I hardly talk to anyone nowadays and never cheated on her.
   I tried to reach out to her to make her understand and I tried reaching out to my mum but no one listened.
  Just so tired that when I finish work in an hr I am going for long walk and than just end it. It is scary as I am atheist and I know after I do this it is end just total darkness. But today I am so tired of life that it doesn't hold fear for me anymore.
   I am sorry I cant help others anymore to over come this
