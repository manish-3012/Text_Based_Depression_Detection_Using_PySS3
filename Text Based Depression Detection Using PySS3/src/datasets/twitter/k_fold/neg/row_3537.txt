Why am I hereThere are so many people that actually do something in this world.

I wanted to work on something I believe in, to contribute. I really had dreams but I am completely unable do anything about them. It's like the world doesn't need my perspective. Then why live if I cannot live authentically.

Why live when all I ever was expected to do is "to fit in" or "to conform". There are so many colourful people. But I am not allowed to be. I know this sounds weird. 

I have no solid sense of self. I'm always becoming other people. It's like a curse. 

Whatever I say, it's empty. I get up for a while but the wave sweeping above my head is always higher and stronger :(
