I just keep thinking a Madison Holleran stoIf she couldn't do it, how can I? She was deeply depressed but from an external point if view, had it all: young, gorgeous, successful. She had something to fight for, a future.

I am deeply depressed, and from an external point of view have nothing: disgusting to look at, socially crippled, zero appealing. Nothing to fight for.

I wish I could trade with her, and give her my life. She deserved better.
