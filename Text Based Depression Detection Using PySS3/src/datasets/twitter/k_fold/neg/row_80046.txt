Iâ€™m devoting my life to hedonismIâ€™m so sick of waking up crying.

I think the day I turn 19, Iâ€™m gonna go to Canada, or fucking drive to Mexico, and drink and smoke and fuck until I get myself killed.

I donâ€™t like being alive, why donâ€™t I just do things that make me feel physically good and eventually Iâ€™ll be dead?
