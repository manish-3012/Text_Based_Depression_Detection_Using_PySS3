Why do people want to live ?I know this question is answered by everyone differently. For me I cant see why you want to be alive theres no purpose of being alive what ya gonna do be a human live life hate life then die what's the point would it no be easier to skip all the bullshit and kill yourself.
Right now in my life I've been battling depression and anxiety I'm on lots of meds I turn 18 in 2 weeks and my goal for when I turn 18 is to kill myself I just want to skip all the shit in this world nobody can tell you that death is bad when you dont know what's beyond it. The goal to life is to die to me anyway. I'm really suicidal right now I've been in and out of hospitals multiple attempts on my life with all times police getting involved and tackling me extra. If a human wants to die he should have the right to doesnt matter about mental illness or physical if they want to kill themselves there should just be a place in your country where once your leagally aged you can just walk into a building write your name down date of birth then be given a pill of some sort just to end it all. FUCKING HATE MY LIFE FUCK EVERYTHING :(
