I've run out of reasons to care about anything anymore.I can never numb the pain with drugs and alcohol for the rest of my life, but that's just prolonging the inevitable, while making me suffer this absurd existence even longer. I feel like everything I've ever done has been leading up to this, the time when I finally get the courage to end this shitty life and move on to whatever's after, which is probably nothing, but maybe it not being nothing is an even scarier thought. I am broken beyond repair, there is no hope for someone like me. I don't want to hurt anyone by doing this, but honestly once I'm dead it won't make any difference to me. Maybe that makes me selfish or something, but I don't give a fuck. I love my parents, and my best friends, but being tortured by my own mind until I die of old age just isn't going to happen. I don't know why I'm writing this, but here it is anyways I guess. Goodbye maybe
