I need helpLet me start by saying that I am 34. An age where most people have their life together and are working on their goals. I am so lost in my life. I did some soul searching and came to some conclusions.  

I hate myself. There is not one quality I actually like. Lately, things I have enjoyed are no longer enjoyable. When I am not working, I sit at home wasting my life away. My career is someone else's dream. I got into IT to fit in with people in school and just focused on it. Now I hate technology but I don't know what i would rather do.   

Most of my friends are settled down, joined the military or have moved away. I try opening up to family and they always say the same things. Try Jesus or that's the devil talking. I was a christian for 15 years and it never helped. I explored buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and even occult and pagan religions. I never seem to fit in or get any relief from them.  

When I was younger, I drank alot. I drank to fit in and feel better about myself but drinking was never my thing. I never did drugs or weed. I watched drugs kill two people I cared deeply about. Now I have a heart condition and drinking is out of the question.  

I talked to a psychiatrist and psychologist. I tried various medications, Paxil, Zoloft,  Depakote, and like 7 others. They never helped. In fact, I felt worse. I don't know what else to do. I feel alone and fight thoughts of suicide on a daily basis. I need help.
