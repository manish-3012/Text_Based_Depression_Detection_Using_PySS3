Its just ridiculous at this point..I'm a musician. My dream has always been to perform for a living. Its a pretentious goal to begin with and in a post-covid world its a worthless pursuit. I'm nearing 30. In my early days of songwriting I got some good support, some nice write-ups from local music press and whatnot. Its all bullshit now.

I've wanted to die since I was a kid. The only thing that makes me happy is music. Friends, family, people I know tell me I'm good and I can make it someday. But I know its just wishful thinking.

I feel there's only two outcomes. Either I keep going and end up a miserable, sad piece of white trash garbage working a horrible job, or I end it early. No one loves me and I love no one.

Some people just shouldn't be alive.
