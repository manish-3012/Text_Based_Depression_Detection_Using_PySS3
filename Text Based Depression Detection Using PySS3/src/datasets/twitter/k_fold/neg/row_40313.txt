Just a push.I find myself even too weak for suicide.. I'm constantly wishing I would just miraculously die. I wish that I would some how get pushed into an ongoing car while I'm walking to work. I often find myself wishish someone would just stab or shoot me for no reason other than that's what I've been hoping for. When I'm in the car I always wish someone would hit me in the passengers side, I imagine my body dying and my soul finally being freed. My soul is tired, my mind is weak. I'm tired of life
