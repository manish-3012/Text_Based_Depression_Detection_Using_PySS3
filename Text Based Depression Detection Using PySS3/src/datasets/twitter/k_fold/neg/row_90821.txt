Iâ€™ve lost my partner to suicide and my next partner has been abusive, Iâ€™ve been thinking about ways to end my lifeHi, Iâ€™m sorry everyoneâ€™s is such pain.
I feel as tho I should be grateful for not having depression. Iâ€™ve not suffered all my life and Iâ€™ve been happy and content  for most of it.
However Iâ€™ve suffered a fair bit and recently I think Iâ€™ll end my life if I continue to feel this way.
Iâ€™m scared obviously, but thereâ€™s ways that Iâ€™ve thought about taking my life. And I feel I can carry through. I think about these often.

My uncle hung himself when I was 16
My boyfriend at the time (who suffered sever depression) took his like life 2yrs ago. I found him hanging with his child in the room. Since this moment I think about talking my life. Thereâ€™s not a day, I donâ€™t.

I was struggling and I met someone who was able to make me happy. He proposed 3months later, and now Iâ€™ve been in a domestics violent relationship for about 6months. 
Iâ€™m drownding with  hate. I feel as though my life is such a burden.
That there isnâ€™t room for happiness left in this lifetime for me. Iâ€™m scared that the seconds left in taking my life, I will regret it and I will see the light all too late.
