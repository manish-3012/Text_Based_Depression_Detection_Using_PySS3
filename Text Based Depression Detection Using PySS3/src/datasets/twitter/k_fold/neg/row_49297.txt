lost my friendiâ€™ve lost my friend, she was very close to me. she always helped me when i had a breakdown about wanting to die and being sad, she was very patient with me. we almost got together until she cut me out of her life. i donâ€™t know what to do anymore because i no longer have her or any friends, is there any point on going on if youâ€™re just alone with no one around you that can help? 

(iâ€™m sorry if this isnâ€™t the place to post this)
