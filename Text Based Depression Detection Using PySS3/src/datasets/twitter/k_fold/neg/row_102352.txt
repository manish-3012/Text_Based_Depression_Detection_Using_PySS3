I have no lifeI work 12 hour shifts 6-7 days a week. Iâ€™m 23 and very depressed. I have severe anger issues and no one takes me seriously or gives a fuck. Idk what to do. I make decent money but I literally have 1 hour after work before I need to go to sleep for 7 measly hours just to wake up angry that Iâ€™m still here and forced to live this life everyday. I have debt otherwise Iâ€™d quit and live life so Iâ€™m just stuck. I truly think Iâ€™d be better off dead but I hate the thought of leaving loved ones behind. But they donâ€™t care now why should they care when Iâ€™m gone?
