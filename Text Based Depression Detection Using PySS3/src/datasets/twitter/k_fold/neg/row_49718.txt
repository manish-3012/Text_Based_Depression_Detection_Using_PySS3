I lost my baby, and my partner left me, I dont feel like living with this pain anymore.I don't know where to start... I'm in so much pain and I feel so alone.. I've been crying for days and nights now.  I can't eat or sleep.

I lost my baby back in may due to condition I had while I was pregnant. And it broke me and my partner apart. I wasn't best to be around with when it all happened but  in time I focused on him and myself to get better, which helped for a time being. Until he started to change his mind time and time again. The way I was treated, dumped 3 times by him after my little girl's death broke something in me that I dont know if it can be fixed. I have nothing, no one left, to keep fighting to live anymore. I'm not the praying type but I prayed for my partner to come back. (I know I sound abit possessive and clingy maybe even obsessive) but that man was my true love, I loved him like no other. And the way things are looking this is pretty final and hes not coming back, he wants to move on from me, and the pain of losing our girl. And I'm in bits, I dont know what to do anymore. I feel so alone, and so much pain I cant even describe it..
I just want to end it all. All the pain, betrayal, sadness, grief, loneliness, I want all of it to end.


To the person who is reading it, thank you for taking your time to do so. But I'm sure what I need to do now.
