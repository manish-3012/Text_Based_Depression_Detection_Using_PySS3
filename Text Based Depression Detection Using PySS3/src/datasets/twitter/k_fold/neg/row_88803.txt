I would prefer to not existI'm a 20-years-old man and I still live with my parents. I don't have any friends, a girlfriend or hobbies, the only people I spend my with is my family. I turned my friends away many years ago. I haven't exactly done much worthwhile during the  last few years. I have spent almost all of my time surfing aimlessly on the internet, reading articles, news, comments, reddit etc.. I haven't played games or watched very much tv-series. I have lost about $500 to poker games and gambling. I have a short attention span and it's hard to focus on any self-improvement project for more than several weeks or days. I will start working in a data entry job in about a few weeks.

There isn't exactly any wrong physically with my situation, all my physical needs are met. I just feel kinda empty and there isn't exactly much to live for. There isn't much I do for fun.

Thinking about myself makes me ashamed, I don't know why.

I had to kill myself two months ago but I decided to postpone it. Thinking how many parents and family would react makes me very anxious because I would ruin their lives.
