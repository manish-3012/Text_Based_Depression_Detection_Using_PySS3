Anyone get that small feeling of wanting to live a life full of extreme healthy dieting, exercising as much as you can, and living a life full of prosperity and mindfulness? And then most days you just donâ€™t care if you die the next day or you OD or you die from a unhealthy lifestyle?This is me most of the time and itâ€™s really conflicting. I donâ€™t have the energy to change myself around and it may sound easy but itâ€™s not.
