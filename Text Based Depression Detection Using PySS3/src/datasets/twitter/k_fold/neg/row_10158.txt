The person I trusted the most ignored my messages asking for supportMy longtime bf ignored my texts for about a month. We are doing long distance and I texted him about once a week about the difficulties I was having. I called him up the other day and he took it (mistaking me for someone else), and he acted like nothing was wrong. This is not the first time this has happened - I feel completely  invalidated by the person I trusted the most, and even more worthless than before.  He is extremely busy, to be fair, and has said that he will only have time to message on the weekends. We had a very stable, trusting relationship for the past 7 years. But I feel like the final real personal connection I had with someone has finally broken down. I have nobody else. 

I am functioning but there is a gaping hole inside and everything is rotting. I crawled out of this situation once but it happened again. It will continue happening again and again, and this time I'll be alone.  I'm completely worthless and continuing to live just means restarting the vicious cycle. It's not worth it.
