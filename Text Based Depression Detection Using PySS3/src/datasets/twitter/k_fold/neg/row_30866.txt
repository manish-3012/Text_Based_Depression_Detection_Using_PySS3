As long as this garbage existence remains so will my depressionNature is fucking evil. Just look at r/Natureisbrutal. That shit is fucking depressing to watch. Animals eating/killing each other over and over again. And this is where we came from. This is the garbage system that created us. Fuck this bullshit reality where so much suffering exists and the only way to free yourself is with death. 

Even on a personal level I donâ€™t find any joy. Iâ€™m not interested in people, I hate work so much, hobbies arenâ€™t enough to distract me from this reality and theyâ€™re not enough to make my life meaningful. Iâ€™m just empty and alone everyday. Talking to others goes nowhere, because the root cause of my pain and depression is existence itself. Itâ€™s the source of all my suffering. So seeing that existence is the problem and that itâ€™s not going anywhere anytime soon itâ€™s best if I gtfo instead donâ€™t you think?
