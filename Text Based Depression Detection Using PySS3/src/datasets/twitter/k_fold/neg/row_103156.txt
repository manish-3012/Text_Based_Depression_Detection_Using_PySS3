My sister tried to kill herself and we don't know what she took. If you can guess from my description please helpShe is in the hospital now and the doctors don't know what she took. While she was still capable she mentioned something like natrium or sodium something, sorry if it's not the right word, english is not my first language. I searched her room and didn't find anything like that. But I know for a fact that she also took melatonin, bromazepam and some kind of anti vomiting meds. Also sorry of this is not the right sub, I know that she visits these kinds of subreddits and this is the only thing I found when I searched suicide...
