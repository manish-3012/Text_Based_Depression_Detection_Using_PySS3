Having a therapist while planning suicideI feel very weirded out to have a therapist that tries to help me move on while Iâ€™m at the same time planning my suicide. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I appreciate talking to her bc going to her gives me at least one type of structure in my week. At the same time I feel pathetic going three times a week to talk about how to get better when I have no plans to get better. She wants me to start medication, but I tell her that I donâ€™t want to waste either medication or her time. 
How is it for you to have a therapist while planning on killing yourself?
