Quit my job, just letting my time run out. Goodbye, 2015. Just a year left.Hi.

I've posted before on /r/offmychest (I think?) about how I plan to commit suicide next year.

I've already organized my stuff, but I went and quit my job (stopped showing up).

With all the savings I have now, I'm only out to spend my last few days with the people I care about. That's why I quit. To silently say my farewells.

Thing is, these people really don't care about me. They don't know. They don't understand. They always thought my depression can be cured by a movie, by eating, by getting drunk or laid.

My will has already been finalized. I'm just counting the days down. Just finishing up my Bucket List.

I don't know if anyone ever felt it, but being suicidal feels to me (emotionally) almost as bad as having a terminal illness. I say almost, because I couldn't possibly completely equate the two... But I imagine a lot of the things are the same.

I know the exact date I'll die. I know how. I'm just waiting for it.

I've been fortunate enough, that in my 24 years of living, I've experienced so many things. I found my adventure. I feel like an old man, looking back at my past with nostalgia. It's time for those days to end.

I felt like I've lived enough of a lifetime, and now I'm at my end. The sadness is too much, too damn much, I can't even think rationally (by normal people's standards) anymore.

I think I'll die happy. That's all I've ever wanted for a long time now.

Has anyone wanting to commit suicide felt this too? That suicide feels just like going home?

I'm crazy. I know.

I have it all planned.
