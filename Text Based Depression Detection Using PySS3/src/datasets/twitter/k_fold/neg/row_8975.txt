Time upI have been her before but not as bad as this. The pain is all my own doing and there is no way out except death. I am a coward. I have tried and tried to find a glimmer of hope or a spark that remains but there is nothing. I can not go through life making the same mistakes and feeling the same pain. I tried to make amends and I have bared my soul but I can not get through, I have to accept that it is finally over, in more ways than one.
