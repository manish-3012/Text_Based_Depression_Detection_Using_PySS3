I think I've reached the next step of suicide idealization.For years I've really, really been unhappy -- then I wanted to die -- then actually thought about dying in a non-abstract kind of way. 

More recently, I've started getting to the point of "seriously" thinking about suicide, in the sense that I just don't want to die anymore -- I'm truly thinking about killing myself, about not being here anymore, this is it. I've started looking up suicide methods again, too.

You know what the saddest part is? Before, I was just sad and wanted to die all the time. Then I got to a point where I WANTED to live! I wanted to keep going! Well you can read post history -- I've had so many opportunities go by and I'll never be able to get them back. Wanting to succeed but failing and not being able to change that manages to feel even worse than just giving up entirely.

I wonder if in academic literature, if there are levels to suicidalness and what level each one of us would be on.
