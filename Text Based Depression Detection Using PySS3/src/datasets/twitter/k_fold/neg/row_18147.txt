I have no goals. I was/am very depressed due to losing a GF that we told told eachother "you are the one for me" "I willI was/am very depressed due to losing a GF that we told each other "you are the one for me" "I will love forever". We even exchanged "I love you" for the word "forever".  I have no goals now.  I just float day to day. I moved over a 1000 miles to be furthur away from her (That was a good coincidence, because I was able to help with my with grandfathers cancer and be with my grandmother when she needs me).  I dont know what to do now, I will either be homeless or dead soon.  I have been working on the slow death through lots of alcohol while I help my grandmother but I have no goals or anything.  I just want to die and I think booze is the most legal way.
