Why can't I kill myself? 17MI just want to fucking die. I don't want to be here anymore. I fucking hate everyone. I am incapable of working. Working makes me want to kill myself. Being around people makes me want to kill myself. I get tired after 5 or 6 hours of being awake. I have my mum constantly in my ear about doing stuff and all she does is complain and try and accuse me of stuff. Today I had a mental breakdown and started crying and calling her a fucking bitch and telling her I hate her because she never leaves me alone, this then deteriorated into me just screaming "FUCKING LEAVE" like 30 times in a row right in her face. I know I'm a piece of shit but she is too. She takes me to all these doctors and psychiatrists and shit and then doesn't even want to understand my OCD, depression or anxiety so what's the fucking point? My family all work like 60 hours a week or some bullshit so they don't care. 

I just want to die. I don't want to do any of this anymore. I don't want to do anything and I have no goal in life or hobbies and I only have like 2 interests. I'm pretty sure I'm incapable of working. I have only done about 5 weeks of 9 to 5 work in my life and I nearly attempted suicide in that time and hated every minute. 

I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself so I just sit here crying.
