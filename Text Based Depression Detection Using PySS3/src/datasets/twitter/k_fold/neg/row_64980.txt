Ive fallen again. And i feel like im on the verge of trying again.I have a really hard time getting out of bed, and doing anything. Even playing games. Right now im lucky enough that i dont have to work because i live with my boyfriend who pays for everything. I recently quit my job (for many reasons) and i really dont want to go back to any work. The thought of having to do anything makes me want to kill myself. I know i should be working or studying or something but i dont have passion for anything. I just want to sleep all day and night. I dont know how to tell my boyfriend. I dont want to live. I dont want to work or do anything.
