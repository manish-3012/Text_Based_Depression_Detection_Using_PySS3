I feel like the biggest reason for a lot of people don't have purpose on life is because we lost our sense of curiosity due to the internet.Idk I always thought sense of curiosity what keeps people going ,but now? You have everything in your fingerprints, no need to go here or there to discover new things about life's mysteries. Sure its different to experience them in person ,but knowing almost everything basic about earth mysteries kinda kills the sense of curiosity and adventure. 

Sapce doesn't count since its far away from our reach and we cant experience it in our lifetime or anytime soon.
