I've been lost for years. Don't know how much longer I can goSo I started writing about myself and how I got to this point but stopped at three paragraphs of jumbled nonsense and "Woe is me" type stories.                                                       Plain and simple, I have felt like complete and total shit for the past 6-7 years and am seriously considering ending it all. I'm a complete emotional wreck and hide it extremely well through silence and forcing or suppressing emotions. If anybody knew who I was in my head the shame and embarrassment would destroy me. I've turned to smoking weed daily and doing lots of psychedelics just to cope with life, it's the closest thing to happiness I can get. The fact I have to do drugs just to feel good also doesn't float with me too well either, but hey it's keeping me here. Suicidal thoughts consume my mind everyday, especially at night. They use to be kinda juvenile and I could shake them off but they've gotten so real lately, I've actually come up with some easily accessible ways of doing it and am actually considering it. I need help and I know this but I'm deathly afraid of opening up to people, the thought of spilling my guts to some therapist scares the fuck out of me. I haven't told a single living soul about any of this ever. I recently quit my job because I was too stressed to function and I've never been able to focus in school. I just want to be normal and on track with life but with the way things are and the way I am I never see this becoming a possibility.
