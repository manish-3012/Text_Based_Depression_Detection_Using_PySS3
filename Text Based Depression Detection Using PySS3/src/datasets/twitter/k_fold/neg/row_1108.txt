Theres no reason why I shouldn't end it.I feel like I posted here before but my mind and memory has been so fucked up the past year I can't remember shit. I'm 26 In  a few months and I barely have any friends, the ones I do I rarely ever get to see. I got fired a month ago because I blew up on management for the constant shitty treatment they gave me every day and so they kicked me out and banned me from the property and since then I havent found a full time job no matter how hard I try. I never had a proper girlfriend so I dont even know what it's like to hold hands with a female while other people my age i went to school with have went to college, found great jobs, and started a family. My health has also deteriorated as I have untreated obstructive sleep apnea so I cant breathe for shit when I try to sleep so I'm constantly tired even if I sleep for 12 hours(usually consists of me waking up briefly every 2 or so hours). I cant fucking afford the machine to help because my moms insurance doesnt cover it all (cant even afford my own health insurance or car insurance I have to rely on my mom for everything because of how much a failure I am). I have severe social anxiety so anything I try to do that involves going somewhere or doing something new I get so nervous and freak out I usually just go back home and sit in my room. The last time I truly remember being happy was when I was a kid. Its only gone downhill since I graduated high school 8 years ago. The only thing that even makes me slightly smile anymore is my dog, but with her health (over weight blind diabetic and being a pug has respiratory issues) she wont be around forever since she has all that and is already 10. Sometime I just lay in bed like I am now typing this wondering what would happen if i just pull the trigger without thinking twice.  I dont think theres anything after death anyway and we all die someday so might as well get to the point. Hm.
