daily routine of crying when watching my mirror turned into pukingI think I can enter in hypoglycemia pretty fast even if the puking is not intentional, imma stop eating and hopefully pass out of exhaustion and never wake up.

Had dreams all my life and I see each and every single one of them slip through my hands. Just another offspring that its genetic mutation has no worth I guess


who are you kidding man, you never had the guts to press when you had the chance, fucking pathetic waste, still gonna fail that attempt
