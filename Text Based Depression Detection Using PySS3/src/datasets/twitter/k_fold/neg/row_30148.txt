Am i really lying?I don't know if this should be a post in r/depression but I am going to say how I feel anyways.

I've had feelings of emptiness and numbness since I was 13. I started feeling and growing tired of things, even though I have nothing to be sad about. I am sad here and there but not full on, I do not feel like communicating with anyone as I never find people with similar perspectives. I've always felt like an outsider everywhere I go, I have problems in opening up to people and sharing things.

I give out hints of my condition to my family and friends but they just feel like 'I am depressed because it's a "Trend"' and they think I am lying.
This is taking a toll on my head for the worst and thoughts of ending it all because I don't fit in, are stronger than ever. What do I do?
