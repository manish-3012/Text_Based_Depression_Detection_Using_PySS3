Again it's backI thought I was better. But no. I thought I was done with her. But no. I can't make myself move on even though she used me for over a year. Cheated on me. Left me time and time again for a different guy. For the first time in months I wanna cut. Disappear. Just die. I don't like this and I don't want it anymore. I want to be normal. Sane. Most of all I want her to feel what I feel, instead of her being proud of what she did. I just want to die.
