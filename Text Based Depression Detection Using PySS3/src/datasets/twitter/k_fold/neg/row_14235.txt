Reasons to stay alive that don't involve other people?Hi, I'm really, REALLY sorry to bother y'all with this, but my mental health this past year is the worst it's ever been, and about a month ago my head started circling back to suicidal ideation, which has been continuous ever since. I've spent the entirety of that month scouring the internet, and especially this sub, for anything I can cling to until I can see a therapist (gotta love those 90-year waiting lists); but so much advice for people in this situation just amounts to "don't do it, think of your family/friends/partner" (or, on the very rare occasions when advice to this effect acknowledges that not everyone has those people in their lives, "but if you die now you'll never meet the love of your life!"). Which might be useful advice for people who are into that, but if you're aroace, introverted, or just not very social... not so much.

So I just wanted to ask, does anyone have anything I, or other people in my situation, can stay for, that doesn't hinge on the current or eventual presence of other people? I don't want to believe that's the only thing there is to live for, but I'm at my wits' end trying to find anything off my own bat.
