There comes a point.There comes a point when all that is left to tear down what remains. When your emotions finally get the best of you in a pool of deprivation and you drown. i watch how other people are treated and it fills me with hatred and envy, i never had that. people pull away from me, i am not a real person. at this point i hate them all. all of them, minus the occasional oddball who also got fucked by life. there is no one to talk to. no one to do anything with. there is no one to feel, no one to love, no one to live with. i am alone and will be until death, every day only creates more distance between others and myself. i hate the planet, i hate people, i hate society, i hate myself. i don't know what i was missing and it appears to be everything. the only thing left is heroin and the eventual od. this is what happens in the isolation chamber rat park. you saw that study, right?  this isn't my fault, i am only one persona nd too short ot be a real one at that. life is a prison, it is a sad joke, it is something only some get to experience. i don't know why tell me why so i can die in peace with understanding as my guide into the void. thnx
