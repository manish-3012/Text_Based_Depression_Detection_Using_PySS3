Thinking of the future makes me want to just end it.Pretty much as the title says, granted the easy response is well just think of now. But we can't think of now all the time, there will be moments you think of whats coming and its not looking good for me. In the end we all end up alone and old and thats not something I look forward to. I'm 32 now, I figure I give myself another 18 years before I just end myself and save life the trouble since my folks will be pretty much too old or gone to stop me. 75 at the latest I think. I like predictable numbers like that and besides at that point who would give a shit if an old man like me died. 

But who knows, maybe my parents will die early and I'll be all alone with no job and no real prospects or motivation to press forward. As ever a parasite as any other millennial I guess they would say about me. If it ever got to that point, fine screw it, just get the gun from the nearby gunstore, BS the store owner that its for recreation, than go through the waiting process and since I don't have a record it shouldn't be that long. Get a gun with a high caliber, put in mouth at a 45 degree angle and then squeeze the trigger. 

Of course that is if everything panned out fine, which my plans never tend to so I said screw planning. College didn't work out and I can't afford/no longer motivated for it. Basically I think I can share the sentiment of anyone who ever gets to that point of just well &amp;*^% everything. 

To love, is to invite tragedy. For weak people like me, well I guess I can't handle the inevitable tragedy that will be my life so as a person who may think it when they get that nudge that pushes them over the edge *&amp;*&amp; everything.
