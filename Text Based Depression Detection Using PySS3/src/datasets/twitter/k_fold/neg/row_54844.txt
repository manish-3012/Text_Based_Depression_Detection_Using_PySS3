Given how much life is going to suck for everyone in the future due to things like climate change, why should I continue to live?I mean it makes perfect sense to die now. The future is bound to suck due to a worsening climate. Especially since so many people deny it's even happening. Any attempt to address the problem is met with scorn and mockery. People are even sadistic enough to wish all kinds of awful things to happen to people who believe the climate is changing. 

Killing myself is a kindness. I could finally be free.
