Iâ€™ve given up, and Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s nextHi guys, Iâ€™m sorry to be so short. I (22M) have been living my life alone, forever, until I fell in love. My relationship lasted a long while, few years, until today my girlfriend left me. Aside from her and her family, I donâ€™t talk to a single person. I live with her, we share our entire lives, and she left me.

I now feel alone, and to be honest I just want to die. I have felt this way before, even attempted, but Iâ€™ve never been successful. Now I feel Iâ€™m at the point where I have to do it. I donâ€™t want to live another day that nobody cares about me, it hurt too bad before and it hurts now. 

I just felt like I had to let someone know, tell someone how I am feeling, because I donâ€™t have anyone to listen. I can live, especially not like this.

If you took the time to listen, thank you do much. 

Iâ€™m sorry
