I don't want to die but I don't want to live like thisLooking at these other posts, my problems and feelings feel insignificant. (And it's no one's fault but my own head telling me I don't matter) But I'm going to post this anyway. Around a year ago, I tried to kill myself by ODing. It didn't work, as you can see, because I tried overdosing on supplements. I was so out of it that I didn't read the label and I just hoped that they would work. I woke up hours later, puking black shit and running a fever. I managed to fall back asleep but felt shitty (both mentally and physically) for the whole day. I can't reach out to my parents about it because they'd just be extremely ashamed of me. I've been alone about this for a while and I have so many things bothering me. I'm hurting mentally and I can't sleep at night, tossing and turning, not wanting to face another day of miserableness and more acting like I'm ok. I doubt many people will see this post, but if anyone is reading this, thank you for taking the time and please help me. I'm so close to trying to end it again. Please.
