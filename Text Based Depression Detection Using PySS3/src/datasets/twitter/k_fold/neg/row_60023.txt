Don't know what to doI want to end it, the thoughts are creeping back in after two years. But I have people in my life now that depend on me and is feel guilty for leaving them behind and having them deal with this on their own. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to talk to a councillor and be placed on suicide watch and jeopardise school because I need to get my GPA up and can't afford to miss and I don't want to tell my mom cause she'll freak. Life's just bogging me down and I should be happy but I'm not and I'm thinking of ending it but I'm scared to and I know I shouldn't but the thoughts still there.
