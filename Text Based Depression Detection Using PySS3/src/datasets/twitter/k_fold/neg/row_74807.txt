iâ€™m trying my besti tried asking  all my friends if they wanted to hang out. there are busy with there families. i tried offering to go somewhere iâ€™ve the weekend to spend time as a family. several times. no. i tried keeping my mind busy by trying to create a online business. my dad starts putting words into my mouth by saying my idea is silly and he can unenroll me in all the extra stuff he signed me up for school. iâ€™m doing math two years above my grade level yet my dad still has the nerve to compare me to other people saying what went wrong with me. i hate it so much. iâ€™m sorry iâ€™m not perfect. iâ€™m sorry. iâ€™m sorry to my grandma for being a lazy selfish person. iâ€™m so sorry i wish i could have been better. iâ€™m sorry mom. i try spending time with you but everyone always just wants to be on the there phones, ipads, watching tv whatever the case is. i miss you. i miss my family. i miss spending time with my family. whenever i try i always end up getting hurt such as someone blames me for having â€œattitudeâ€ or for talking to much. i want to be better iâ€™m so sorry
