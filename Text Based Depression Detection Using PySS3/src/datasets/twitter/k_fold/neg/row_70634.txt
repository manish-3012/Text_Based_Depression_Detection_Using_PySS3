I don't know where I amI've had suicide ideation on and off since I was about thirteen. When I have a particularly bad day, I comfort myself that I can always just jump off of the golden gate bridge. But something is stopping me from actually doing it, even though a part of me feels like everything would be solved if I die. My parents wouldn't have to worry about me being an emotional and financial burden. I feel like none of my friends truly care about me. Part of me just wishes I could just disappear without anyone noticing.
