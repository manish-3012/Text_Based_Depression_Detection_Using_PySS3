If I hear one more peep about #BellLetsTalk, I *will* kill myself.So another #BellLetsTalk day has come and gone, with almost every Canadian somehow giving Bell Canada all kinds of free advertising yesterday on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit etc., and those fucking greedy, heartless jackasses at Bell are trumpeting all over their media outlets this morning that they "raised" over $7 million yesterday for mental health initiatives in Canada.  If Bell ever continues this campaign, I WILL kill myself.  Maybe I'll march up to Bell's headquarters in Montreal and kill myself right then and there.  Maybe that'll make head honcho Mirko Bibic happy and change his mind about pretending to give a shit about mental health.

For those outside of Canada, Bell is a massive, greedy, heartless, good for nothing telecom conglomerate, and I want this piece of shit company (and its "mental health" campaign) gone forever.
