I keep trying to get help and keep getting turned awayI have had panic attacks and anxiety for most of my life (I'm 34 now) but I have always managed to keep myself in check. Now I have MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease which is a disease that effects my ears and causes vertigo and so I'm dizzy all the time. I can't go to concerts cause of the lights, I can't go on rides or take long car trips, I can't have salt, alcohol, caffeine or sugar. So now I have anxiety all the time topped with I can't do anything fun or eat anything good. I have tried getting help with therapists and other sources but I have been turned down every single time. I'm sick of being dizzy all the time and I'm sick of constantly having panic attacks and filled with anxiety and I'm tired of not getting help. I'm basically writing this here cause I need to say something but don't want to tell my friends cause I just want this to end. I'm tired of my living
