I know I'm going to have to kill myselfBeing transgender is a death sentence. I will never be able to be a real man because I don't have a penis. Getting a penis would cost me thousands of dollars that I don't have. Even if I save up and go through with it, how many years of my life will have been wasted? Not being a man means that I'm nothing. I don't want to live or remember anything about my life if I'm not a man. I can feel my lower parts attached to me and it instantly makes me suicidal. I have to shove a $350 funnel in between my legs and pretend I'm not a freak. But I am a freak. I feel disgusting and inhuman. My basic rights of having a name and a body have been stolen from me since birth. God played a cruel joke on me by forcing me into this body and I can't correct any of it. I have to die. It's the only way out of this hell of a life and this filthy husk of a body that my soul was shoved into just so God can laugh as I cry and suffer. I'm going to fill a bucket of water and keep my head in it until I lose consciousness. Maybe then I can finally be free. And I want them to burn my body. I don't want anyone to see it or touch it. I fucking hate being aroused and not being able to do a thing about it because there's no penis to jerk off. I have to die all because God hates me. Fuck you God. If I'm reincarnated or whatever, I'll just keep killing myself over and over again. This is my legacy. I want to scream. I want my body to be dripping with bloody scars as I scream like an animal. I want to cut off my lower parts and scream. Scream sxream scream. Fucking kill me
