I want to give up on myself.Iâ€™m just so negative. And a drain. You know how many people have worked hard to try to make me feel better. My mom has tried. My therapist. My best friend. And Iâ€™m still not better. I feel like a burden. I feel like if i killed my self Iâ€™ll be one less person to worry about. But I canâ€™t do it now. My roommate sort of need me right now because of bills. I know my mom would be sad but Iâ€™m sad watching everyone get frustrated that Iâ€™m not better. I just want to die so bad. I just want to make this my last day.
