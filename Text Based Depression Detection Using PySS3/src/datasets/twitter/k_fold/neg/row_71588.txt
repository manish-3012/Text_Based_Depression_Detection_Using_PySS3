No one caresI'm so tired of everyone just assuming that I'm ok. that just because i'm not crying openingly anymore it somehow means I'm not still depressed. All i ever wanted was someone to love me, but i know now that I'm too stupid and have too many stupid feelings for anyone to ever care. I'm just so tired of trying to live a life where no one even cares to text me and ask me how my day was, or if I'm ok. they all want my problems to be underground so they don't have to see them. well, after today, no one is going to have to deal with them anymore.
