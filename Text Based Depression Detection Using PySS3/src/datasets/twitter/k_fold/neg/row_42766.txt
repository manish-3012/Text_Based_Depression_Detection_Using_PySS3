Tonight im ending my life.Tonight I'm ending my life and starting a new one. No more running from my problems. No more blaming the world. I am no longer letting my mental illness dictate my life. I REFUSE TO LET IT WIN.

So tonight I'm ending my life. And tomorrow I'm  looking forward to a new chapter.

How can a man be brave when he is afraid?

That is the only time a man can be brave.

Time for an ego death.
