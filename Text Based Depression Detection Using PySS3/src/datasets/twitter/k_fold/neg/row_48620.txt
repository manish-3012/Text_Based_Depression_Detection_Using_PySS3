Thoughts of suicide.Iâ€™m not going to sugar coat this post. Iâ€™ve posted in the past for a long time asking for advice about my job which has ruined my mental health although anxiety/depression has been a life long battle. I knew I had to quit and finally did(after 8 months). I have 3 shifts left before Iâ€™m officially out of there. Iâ€™ve felt slightly suicidal recently but after telling my boss Iâ€™m quitting the urge has because impossible to ignore. Iâ€™m scared to die and I truly donâ€™t want to follow through with it. Iâ€™m trying to find a reason to stay even just for today. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you all.
