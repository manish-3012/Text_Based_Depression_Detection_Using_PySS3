It isn't worth it anymore.If having to fight like this every day is what living is, I'm over it. I'm tired of therapy that fizzles after almost 20 therapists. I'm tired of living a life that I fucked up permanently as a teenager. I'm tired of being broke all the time because I miss work due to paranoia that so far no medication combo with therapy can even dent after years of trying. Losing job after job, relationship after relationship. I have no money for food and will be living in my car soon. All I want to do is run my car off a cliff or into a wall as fast as I can go. The amount of work I have to do on a daily basis just to remain alive, much less hold a job, or be in a place where people can stand being around me, isn't worth it to me anymore. Fuck this.
