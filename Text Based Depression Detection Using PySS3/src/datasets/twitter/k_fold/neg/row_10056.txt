Still feeling suicidal. But, I mean, what else is new?This is my second post of the day. So, Iâ€™ve been on a downward spiral since Thursday of last week. After about seven months of feeling the BEST Iâ€™ve ever felt in about three years or so. But now Iâ€™m right back to feeling like absolute shit. My day was surprisingly pretty decent. Got lunch with the fam and then spent the afternoon at the SPCA playing with the kittens. Being surrounded by animals brings me great joy. But apparently good things donâ€™t last. And Iâ€™m considering confiding in my parents that Iâ€™m still feeling bad, but Iâ€™m absolutely terrified of going back to the hospital. Not because I get mistreated or anything, Iâ€™ve been lucky to receive some truly wonderful mental health care. But being there makes me feel like Iâ€™m in prison. You have to get strip searched upon entering. I feel like thereâ€™s hardly any privacy. I feel claustrophobic and trapped. Thereâ€™s not many distractions, so youâ€™re stuck with your thoughts. And with my social anxiety, itâ€™s hard to be around people I donâ€™t know and to open up about what Iâ€™m going through. But itâ€™s literally the ONLY place that can keep me safe. I dk what to do.
