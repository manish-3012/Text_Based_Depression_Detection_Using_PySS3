Do I Leave A Note?I'm tired of failing. I'm so smart and yet I have no work ethic, and I'm just so tired of trying and failing myself. I'm tired of failing those with high expectations of me. I'm tired of being alone with no real friends, no girlfriend, and I'm tired of feeling so distant from my brother, and my parents not being able to see that I'm in a lot of pain, and wallowing in this shithouse they're letting fall apart and fill with junk. 

I want to at least go back to when I had friends who asked how I was. I want to go back to before I broke up with my girlfriend even if it was my decision and despite me being so unhappy there. 

I've gone two months alone without any real contact with someone who will actually be there for me. 

I'm so alone. I'm a failure to myself. I'm without love. I'm ashamed of my parents. I don't want this all to continue. I don't want to spiral into a darker place. I want to even be able to fucking decide if I should leave a fucking god damn note. Do they deserve to know? Could I even possibly explain this dark, stupid fucking pit of despair I'm in? It's not even rational to me. How could I rationalize it to them?

This is what I've sunk to. It can only get worse from here for me so why continue? I just need to decide how to die.
