Death is inevitable, so why not now?I'm so miserable. I've started drinking again. I've been obese nearly my entire adult life and I don't have the energy or motivation to lose the weight again. I've already done it some many times and it always just comes back. I know sickness is right around the corner, diabetes, heart problems, cancer, there's no avoiding any of it. My physical health prospects and my mental health seem only to be getting worse. I can't keep going, my tank is empty.
