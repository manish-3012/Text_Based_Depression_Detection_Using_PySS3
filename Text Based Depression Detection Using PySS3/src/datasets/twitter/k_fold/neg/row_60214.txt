I just hate myself too much...Why am I supposed to work so hard to keep being someone I hate so much? I wish I had never existed. 

How do you work to "be better" when the fundamental problem is the person you *are*? I can be interested in thousands of things, and kind of am, but I don't want to do any of them *as me*. 

How do you move past the wall of self-loathing?
