I want to die, even after multiple treatments...So I've planned on taking my life. I ended up not doing it because well, life happened. Then it went to shit again. I regretted not going when I planned to go. Then life happened again. I was approved for the treatment my insurance was dragging it's feet on. 

Here's where I'm at now, I did TMS. And let's just say it didn't work for me. Literally. It physically was hurting me. I was in so much pain, I almost vomited. 

Than I started Spravato. I've done a few sessions. And although the urge to cut has died down, I am very much still suicidal. It's all I can think about. I want to die. I know I do. 

I don't understand why I can't just be happy. Why I suffer with these thoughts and emotions. Why the emotional pain becomes physical. Why the demons stay around. And the voices get so loud. 

I just want to be free. I want to let my family go. To stop being tied down by my fucking mental illness. 

I feel like life is playing games with me. I decide to die. Pick a date. Get everything ready. And something happens that prevents me from going. A new treatment, someone else's death, a birthday, holiday, etc. And repeat. Life gets shitty. I finally pick a date. And life happens. 

I watched a video of a guy who shot himself in the head. And all I could think about was.. "At least he's free. I wish that was me". How fucked up is that?!.. 

I'm a burden. I'm selfish. I'm hurting. I'm consumed by negativity. I'm dark. I'm numb. I'm emotional. I'm suicidal. I am broken.
