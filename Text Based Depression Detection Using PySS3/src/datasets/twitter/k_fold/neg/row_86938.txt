Best suicide method
Hi! Curious whatâ€™s the easiest way to commit suicide. I donâ€™t want my friends or family to suffer. Iâ€™m afraid taking pills will take too long (i.e. painful for me) and a gun to the head would be too gruesome (for friends and family). I think jumping off a high enough bridge would work.

Has anyone contemplated the above? What did you conclude?
