Trust people around you..is not really a good advice to people with depression.

"You should open up."

"You should ask for our help."

"You are loved."

These words are just words to their ears. How can they open up if people around them are not really "caring"?

Can you open up about your depression if- supposed to be your friend- commented that "People who are suicidal must pray" or "He said he's depressed but I think he is just overreacting".

You watched TV, \*News Flash about a person who committed suicide\* Your parents be like, "Youngsters nowadays are really sensitive. Maybe his parents do not bought him a new phone." Like wtf?

Or you tried to open up but your best friend told you, "Don't tell those things. Everything will be alright." :/

Or you chat them since your anxiety is eating you alive.

You: Hey.

Bestie: Hey.

You: I'm not good. I thought of dying.

Bestie: \*seen\*

Bestie: Have you watched new season of \*netflix series\*

Well, you will just choose to die than to be in this situation.

Those people want to be heard. 

We want to be heard. We want to be understood. But how can we do that if these are the people that we can "trust"?

Can they really be trustworthy?

Be sincere. Love truly.

Surviving is not easy, how much more being alive.
