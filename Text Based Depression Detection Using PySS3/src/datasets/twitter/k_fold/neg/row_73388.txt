Hard work didn't pay offHey guys.
Just to make it clear I am not 100% suicidal, but I need some help.
I've been training Taekwondo for 3 years and martial arts for 6 years.
I have been to lots of Taekwondo tournaments, but I always lost. I am training really hard, but I feel like I can't fight the pressure that others create. Before every single tournament I say that it will work out this time. After the tournaments I get laughed at and yelled at.
I really want to do the sport, but I feel like it is not worth it.
