I just want to dieI just want to die. There is no point for life and Iâ€™m not going to talk about how my life is. I am just going to say Iâ€™m pretty sure I have depression and anxiety. I tell everyone what I think because I donâ€™t lie and tell people the truth and if they ask they deserve to know. My parents are getting mad at me and they want me to destroy and hide my actual mood. Just act â€œhappyâ€ when Iâ€™m truly just want to die. I donâ€™t want the usual comment of â€œoh it will get betterâ€. It doesnâ€™t get better when someone is asking you to truly hide who you actually are and give people what they want for the rest of your life and be a servant to peoples feelings so they are â€œhappyâ€and your not â€œrudeâ€. I donâ€™t even care anymore cause it does t get better, I just wanted to put this out there.
