How the fuck to talk to my parentsDepressions really got me down lately and everytime I have a moment to my thoughts I'm fantasizing about suicide. Often to the point I need to come home when I'm supposed to be out just to do something to get my mind away from it. My parents'll be like what the heck are you doing home and I'll brush it off with one excuse or another. I'm not ready to have a conversation with them but I need to so I can stop hiding this and I don't know how.
