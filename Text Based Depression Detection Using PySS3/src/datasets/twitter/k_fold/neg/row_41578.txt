Ending this chapter tomorrow.I've had a pretty good life here. I haven't been abused, cheated, blackmailed or anything like that.
I just feel like leaving. This thought has sat in the back of my mind for years.

All of my problems have been rooted from myself. I have shit social skills and I'm lazy. 

I confirmed this decision today.
The reason is I just don't see a future in me. I'll probably just struggle through school land some mediocre job and die. So why not just cut to the chase. When I'm dead all the shit that happened in the life before me will be forgotten and I will be nothing. A thousand years will go by and all of this right now won't matter. I'm not haunted by this being my last time I will sleep and experience the world because when I'm dead nothing will matter.

I will update tomorrow and if something changes my mind I'll let you know.
