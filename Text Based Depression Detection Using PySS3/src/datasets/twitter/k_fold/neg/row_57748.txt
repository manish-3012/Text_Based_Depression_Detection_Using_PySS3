I need a way to move out of this place.I've been depressed most of my life. I repressed pretty much every thought or feeling I had growing up to avoid the pain, and when it all hit me in college I broke. I failed out and was forced to move back home, to the place that did this to me. My family and I can't have a conversation without them insulting me, condescending me, and ignoring anything I say that they don't like or agree with. They think they know more about my depression and my situation than I do and they listen to no one but themselves.

Being here has made me indescribably worse. Every day I want to die, want revenge against my family and this place, if I weren't so afraid of dying, as much as I want it, then I probably would have done something. But every day I'm here I get worse, I've already been stuck here nearly a year, things aren't getting better; eventually I'll work up the nerve. And I really don't want to think about how angry and vengeful I'll be by that point.

I have tried months of therapy and two different antidepressants in the past, and I've been in the hospital. Nothing has helped me, and my experience in that damn hospital hasn't exactly left me with a good impression of these "professionals." I'm never going to be okay here, under any circumstances, but I only have ~$500 total atm and no job. And I am *never* going to have it in me to keep fighting as long as my life is what it is. I really need help, and my family won't. Please, I am begging at this point. I can't do this myself.
