Well...Life sucks, 26, having to live with my dad because of a dumb younger self and debt and even working full time cant afford to live on my own.  Unheard of medical bills due to no health insurance, unable to pay student loans off because of interest. I need help, but it's impossible to find any. It's impossible to pay back debt and get ahead, im going to be 40 and living with my parents the way it seems to be goinf.  Schools out of the question until I can repay my current debt, which will take years, so getting anyrhing other than a shitty factory job is out of the question. Fuck.
