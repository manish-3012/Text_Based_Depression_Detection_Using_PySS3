Why can't I be happy when I have everything ?Im 19, i have a loving and caring family, friends, a gf and i stufy at a relatively good college. When i compare my life to other's on this sub i feel extremely privilidged. I never had to worry about getting food, clothes, i alwys had somewhere warm to sleep at night and i have never been through any significant trauma. So why, just why cant i be happy as the others around me ? Am i really that ungrateful ? I could never be able to talk about this to anyone i know because i feel like i am not justified to be suicidal. But i am, everyday i go to bed wishing i dont wake up the next day. Norhing makes me happy anymore bit to be fair, nothing really makes me sad either. I just am, existing only in the present and make decisions based on what is expected from me. My only motivation is that i dont want to hurt anyone around me and i know how much i would if i wasnt here anymore.
I dont exactly know why i wrote this know but maybe someone can relate to this.
Thank you for reading, i hope its not too messy.
