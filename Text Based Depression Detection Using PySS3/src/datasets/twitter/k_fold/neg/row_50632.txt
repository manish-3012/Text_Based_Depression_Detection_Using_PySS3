Not pessimism, realismDonâ€™t want to die, just donâ€™t want to live. Donâ€™t see it changing, only getting stronger.  I think objectively things are bad, and maybe this is how it should be. No family close by, girlfriend trying, but she will get tired of this eventually and prolly better off.  Donâ€™t make enough money, have ton of debt, and real health issues as will likely need hip replacement by 45, so in ten years.  Real thing is three years ago I realized I have quite bad cellulite on legs and butt, as a male.  This is exceedingly rare i have gathered. Physician said likely due to carrying lot of weight in legs and bit of weight gain.  Iâ€™m not obese but have carried lot of weight in lower body always. Two months ago noticed my arms also have it visibly in upper arm above elbow. I donâ€™t carry excess weight there. Also found it on forearms chest and abdomen, albeit less obvious.  I already canâ€™t wear shorts, it is that bad, and idea of soon not wearing short sleeve shirts and hiding myself away is too much. The legs I was accepting slowly, but this is something else.  It will get worse with time, that is how it works. I will half live life trying to hide it or diminish the visual aspect of it.  Thinking about it exhausts me. I want to just sit on the ground and not move, ever again.  Not sure that makes sense.
