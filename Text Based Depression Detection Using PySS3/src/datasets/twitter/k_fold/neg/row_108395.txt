Being alive kinda sucksI'm seriously done with being alive. Everyday I think about killing myself, to just end the suffering but because of how cowardly I am, I just do nothing and wait for it to be night time so I can just sleep and forget everything. I've tried therapy, meds, everything but nothing has helped. I am seriously considering suicide, there is no good reason to live.
