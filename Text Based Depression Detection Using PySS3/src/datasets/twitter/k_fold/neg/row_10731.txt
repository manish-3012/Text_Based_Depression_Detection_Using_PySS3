suicide hotline hung up on me; iâ€™m not sure what more to do :â€™(itâ€™s my freshman year, and even though i was anxious to get here and get away from home, this had somehow managed to be the worst year of my life...and iâ€™ve been through a lot of tough stuff.  itâ€™s just so many different things have happened to me here, that i donâ€™t even know where to start describing. iâ€™ve managed to become an alcoholic and i smoke weed a lot just to avoid being sober. this is truly the lowest point in my life and my biggest fear is that itâ€™s just only going to get worse. Iâ€™ve even contemplated suicide, even though i know thatâ€™s super irrational, sometime i think itâ€™s better than where i am rn. So please iâ€™m just asking for you best advice to get me out of my pit...Thank you.
