Anyone else here abused as a child?Iâ€™m reading Les Miserables. Iâ€™m at the part near the end where the main character confesses who he really is and what he did years ago. As a result of his past, he feels undeserving of happiness, of a family, and of the privilege to be part of society. 

I feel the same, not because of anything Iâ€™ve done but because of what happened to me. My childhood trauma left a black mark on me that Iâ€™ve always been aware of. Despite later being adopted by a good family, Iâ€™ve never felt worthy of it or of anything considered good. 

Iâ€™ve done years of therapy and medication. Itâ€™s had no effect. The damage is too deep. I continue living for the sake of my parents, but itâ€™s an empty, miserable life.
