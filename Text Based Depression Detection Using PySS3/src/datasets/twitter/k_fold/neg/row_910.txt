Banned from a suicide chat for having common sense        Hey yall. I was having a moment so i decided to go to the Chatzy Suicide room (yes I'm saying names, I'm infuriated). It has a lot of cool people and when I'm there, I forget my problems. So we were just chillin, me and some 4 or 5 other people when a mod walks in. Me not knowing they were a mod and tryna be welcoming, I went over the top and instead of asking "how you doin" I asked "how ya pussy" (i realize that's bad) and they asked me to rephrase that and I apologized and everything went fine. 
        After that, she (who had just declared to be a female) suddenly cleans everyone's chat history. I asked what was going on and she says this girl is multi accounting. People come up with evidence to back that theory up, and the mod asks when did the "boyfriend" come into the chat. She doesn't really know, and we move on. I didn't quite understand what was going on (a lot of people were talking at the same time) and asked for details such as how does the mod know that. I proceed to call her a dick because she's discussing beef while people need help, right about then entered a girl saying she was thinking of killing herself and I tried to help. Then I got banned. I emailed the chat staff about it and they haven't gotten back to me yet. I'm infuriated, that i got banned for having a point. What do yall think? AITA?
