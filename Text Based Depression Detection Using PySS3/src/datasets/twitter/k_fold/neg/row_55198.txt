Going to the Golden Gate Bridge on Christmas DayI donâ€™t want to die, but I deserve to.

The meaning of life is something that I think a lot of us look for and have trouble finding. To me, the meaning of life is just to make as many meaningful and positive connections with people as possible. 

Along with that, I believe that life is all about the exchange of care with others. Unfortunately Iâ€™ve realized over time that I almost completely lack empathy. As a result, my care for others is inadequate. They saw through the fake care I tried so hard to give. And in the end, people abandoned me for better sources of care. I do not blame them for doing so, itâ€™s just how life is. I will be alone forever because no matter how much I am loved or how much people seem to care, I will never be able to match what they give to me. That shame is something I canâ€™t live with. 

Iâ€™ll be alone on Christmas this year; no family, friends, or significant others. The holidays brings back my worst memories, and I know it will hurt others significantly more to die on this day. 

Thereâ€™s more security on the bridge during Christmas, and a volunteer group that goes there to help people on holidays that look like theyâ€™re in distress. But I have a plan to blend in and not really draw attention to myself when I go. Christmas is the perfect day for me to give it another shot and try to convince myself to jump. I probably wonâ€™t be able to, but I need to try.
