I may be young but I still want to die.Everything is seemingly going down hill. Work for school is piling up. Any attempt I make at a relationship is shot down as Iâ€™m â€˜Too good of as a friendâ€™ to be anything else. My parents are disappointed ever since I brushed the idea of drugs and vaped once. Iâ€™m not even strong enough to get up in the morning. The only thing Iâ€™ve succeeded in doing is disappointing others  and my self. Iâ€™m lonely and lost nights I think about killing my self but the only reason I donâ€™t is because the idea of pain scares me. I canâ€™t even keep a steady conversation with most people without thinking, â€œ Oh god, Iâ€™m probably too boring for them and Iâ€™m just ruining their day with this single conversation.
What should I do Iâ€™m on my last leg of hope and itâ€™s going fast.
