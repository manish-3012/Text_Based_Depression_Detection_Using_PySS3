Why can't people leave me alone.I wanna die. All they do is lie about me and try to hurt me. I feel unloveable and like I owe these people not to be around. They lie to the police and then blame me for things I never do. They talk about me behind my back like i'm a peice of trash and i'll be gone in a few years. They're right.
