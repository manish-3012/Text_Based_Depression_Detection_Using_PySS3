I feel like everything is coming to an endDoes anyone else get this kind of feeling? I have suffered with periodic depression for years and I have always felt like I will end my life by suicide at some point.

Well things are particularly tough just now. The main thing is that for the last few weeks I just have this huge sense that everything is coming to an end, like I literally canâ€™t imagine a future for myself. Itâ€™s not specific to relationships, university etc I just feeling like this must be the last period in my life.

I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s not necessarily a feeling of dread or anything like that. Anyone else?
