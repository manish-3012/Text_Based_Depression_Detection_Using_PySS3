Deep down something is not right.Today was one of my shittest days I have ever had.

There is something wrong, but I don't know.  I feel a hurt deep down, like a physical emptiness that I never felt before.  

I have good grades, I have a fairly decent family life.  It is just that I am trans and I don't know how to tell my parents.  I have one friend who knows and she is like the best friend I have ever had.  I cry everytime I think of what she has done for me... and I have never met her in person before.  I had to reserve my tux for prom today too, which only helped to remind me and all the chatter about prom and dates.  It just makes me feel like pure shit.

Also, one of my teachers started insulting the gays by saying that only fags support gay rights.  Whatever.  

I am missing out on all the joys of life and I am just sitting here letting them pass me by.

Like, a question I have had recently is, that do friends really have those times when they just sit around and talk and laugh and have a good time.  I have never really had friends.  Like, I guess that is what has caused this whole situation.

It is just unbearable.  It is not so much the world around me that is the problem, it is me.  It is just that I am constantly having a fight with myself.  Like, a memory will come up that I absolutely hate or even after something annoying happens that I hate, I will start yelling at myself, inside my head or physically, depending on the situation.  An example of this is when a gym teacher said, "Maybe next time you should swing."  He said this in the utmost respectful and meant it in a kind way.  I snapped basically and would not stop winching and getting mad for the whole class.

Anyway.  I don't know.  I wish I could kill myself.  But, I can't cause so much strife in my family by having to have it cleaned up and bury me, etc, etc.  Whatever.
