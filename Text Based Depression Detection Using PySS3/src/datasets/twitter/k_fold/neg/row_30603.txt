i don't have anything to look forward to except being all alone.i am almost 40. yet another relationship just ended. i still don't have any friends. it's been that way all my life. i can't connect with people for any significant length of time. i trust no one. i suspect everyone. 

my feelings of paranoia and persecution lead me to alienate myself from any boyfriend or friend that enters my life. i moved across the country to get away from my family and see them only once a year. 
i've never been super good looking, i never have been successful at work or school although i try very hard.

i don't see the point of being around. i never considered suicide up until a few years ago. i never actually think through ideation but i also cannot see a future other than being a lonely ignored poor old lady talking to herself and quite possibly homeless.
