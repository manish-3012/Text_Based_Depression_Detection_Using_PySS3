I don;t think Iws made to be a happy personSorru, I'm a bit drunk while typing this. Im tryingmy best.

I don'ty think I was made to function welll in this socierty. I'm 18, just moved into uni halls. Since ,like 8 I glued myyselfg ton a compuyter screen and my parents took hardly any issueb to it. I seemed hasppy, so they let me cvontinue. I'm 18 now, with absolut3ky bno social skills at all. I've been on a computer all my lifge. I moved in with my  very socualble friend buit stuill I don't find myself spcisalasing with myb flatymat3es.

I dont kn0w. I get a lot of happiness out of veing friends with peiplenand having a bnetowkr,. But at the same tijme I'm not born with the capaiblilities to get thoese things. Itg seems doomedf to me. I dont knopw. Im sad.  dont knopw how i could ever be happybwhen Im ths anti social while relyinghon social th9ings tyo ber happu.
