New job and still want to dieI'm starting a new job tomorrow after taking 4 months off from everything due to my depression. I felt good and even slightly excited initially but now my old feelings are back. I feel like I am going to fail again. I feel extremely anxious and overwhelmed. It comes back to this feeling every time I turn around and I am so sick of living my life in this state of anxiety and depression. I want to end it.
