at work; feel like im a non-existent shadow floating by...ive been on different meds... just had a new switch 3 weeks ago, plus an increase and I still hate existence. I'm depressed. I don't want to be around I feel like everyone stares right through me. I feel like im floppy (messy) with everyday skills and at work I feel off. I don't know what to do i feel like leaving work and  jumping off a bridge. It's becoming hard to bare. I don't even know why I'm posting it but I gotta say it because I'm afraid.
