Nothing will workIn the sense that I've tried therapy, I've tried medication and changing my outlook a little bit. It seems like all I get for assistance is dead ends. Maybe it's because what I'm asking is too much. But when does asking for help too much? I'm not sure what I did to deserve not being helped, so I'm sorry. There is nothing I can  contribute to the world. 

I don't have much to say so this will probably get seen by no one. I'm sorry for expressing myself; I don't have anywhere else to reach out to.
