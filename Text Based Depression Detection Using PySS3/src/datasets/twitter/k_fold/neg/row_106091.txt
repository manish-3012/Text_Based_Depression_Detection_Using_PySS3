Why do I feel like this?Today was one of these bad days where I felt sad the whole day... I felt a rollacoaster of emotions this day, but I felt angry and irritated the most, I got negative thoughts about some stuff I did in the past. Some awkward, fucked up, and rude ones. When I got these negative thoughts I started to go a little crazy by just taking a pillow in front of my face and I screamed loud as fuck, I punched my fucking bed at my house and I threw shit like coca cola cans and shit, I know it's weird...  

After I got angry and shit I got sad, very sad actually... So I ended up cutting my self a little, it was my first time cutting my self. It hurt a little but It kind felt good at the same time.

I also had suicidal thoughts like hanging my self, writing a suicide note or even to kill myself with a knife...

Nobody knows I feel like this btw...
