I survived a genocide as a childLike the title says. When I was very young my family lived in Bosnia in the early to mid 90s. I've spoken little about it over the years. The little bit I have mentioned to people makes them uncomfortable and made me realize I need to talk some about it. I cant even bring myself to talk to my wife. If anyone wants to listen to me ramble, just send a DM. Please tell me about yourself as well.
