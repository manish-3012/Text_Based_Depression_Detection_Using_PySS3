Idk if I should plan my suicide or just say fuckit and do itBeen years of this. Hasnâ€™t gotten better. I am numb and canâ€™t feel anymore. No highs .. just some lows and then numbness. 

Not sure if I should try to say goodbyes/buy gifts/write something to explain myself or just go ahead and do it. I feel like my actions would speak for my pain and I wouldnâ€™t need to write it out. The gifts would be for friends and my sister.  

Not sure whatâ€™s worth it. I just know that once Iâ€™m gone everything will change in regards to what everyoneâ€™s thought of me. So I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s even worth it to try to give an explanation.

The only thing I can even think of writing is

 â€œThe pain I have been in has become unbearable and although Iâ€™ve tried to push through it, unfortunately I have reached my breaking point. It is no ones fault..it was a battle Iâ€™ve lost. My resilience has run out. Please try to remember me in my happier moments. Please do not focus on how I left.â€

I donâ€™t want to write something long. I just want to make it a point that this was my own doing and no one is to blame. And that this action shouldnâ€™t define who I was. 

Anyways. I donâ€™t know the proper way to go about this. Iâ€™m so lost and exhausted.
