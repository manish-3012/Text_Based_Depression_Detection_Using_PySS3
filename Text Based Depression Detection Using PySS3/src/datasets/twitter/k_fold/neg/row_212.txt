I feel so awful.I feel so lost in life. I feel hopeless.

I just want to feel good.

I hurt. I hurt inside. I feel like such an outsider.

My vagina is defective. I wish I could have orgasms to feel better, but it just doesnâ€™t happen. Iâ€™m in so much pain.

I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. Iâ€™m deficient in every way. Sometimes I emotionally eat to feel better because I canâ€™t find any other high to lift me up but that. Iâ€™ve gained weight that Iâ€™m trying to lose. I just want to cry.
