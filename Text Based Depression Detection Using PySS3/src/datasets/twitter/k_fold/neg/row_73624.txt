I want to but I'm chickenI want to die and kill myself but I'm too chicken to do it. I feel like there's no point to life. I've lived with depression, bullying, homophobia and bullshit for most of my life, even though Im Bi. I've thought about suicide almost everyday for the past 4 years. I was diagnosed as Bi-polar 2 with schizo-affective. Though I'm not sure the second diagnosis is accurate. 

Everything I try in life fails. I feel like there's no point to life. I have few friends. 2 to be exact that would care what happened. Parents would too I suppose.  I'm a failure at relationships, can barely make friends. I've never heald a job for longer then 1.2 years. I havnt worked in about 2 years. 

I feel like a complete waste of space. For the most part I'm a shut-in. I hate people due to my social anxieties and bullied history. Even though I crave and need to make at least a friend or two, I havnt been able too.

In general people don't like me. They make it pretty clear too. It'll go fine for a while but at somepoint I'll do something stupid to screw things up. I always do. 

As much as I want to, I think I'm too chicken and wouldnt know how to end it. Medication and booze is possible, and likely how I would. Therapy has not helped me. I'm an introvert and don't easily talk to people. I'm just so tired of being alone in life, feeling lost and hopeless. There's just no point.
