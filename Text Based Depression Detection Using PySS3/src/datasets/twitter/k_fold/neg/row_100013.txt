Idk whatâ€™s wrong w meDoes anyone else obsess over suicide? Idk if I truly am suicidal but I cannot stop thinking about death and hanging myself, cutting myself, driving/jumping into traffic, even though Iâ€™ve never actually hurt myself in any way. 

These thoughts kind of bother and give me a shit ton of anxiety and dpdr and I got this great thought to kill myself just to get them out of my head, but Iâ€™ve held a knife up to my wrists and stomach and cannot do it. Deep down I do not want to die, but these thoughts are destroying my life.
