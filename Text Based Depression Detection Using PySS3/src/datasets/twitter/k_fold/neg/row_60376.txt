I Don't Know What To DoI was diagnosed bipolar this past March after years and years of anger issues, depression, and other quirks that lead to me having almost no friends, and now I'm here. Somehow I managed to graduate college and I actually have a pretty great job. Actually, my friends from that job are probably the only friends that I have right now.
I just want to die. I've done everything. Medication, therapy, hospital stay, change my diet, get more sunlight, but there's nothing that helps me. Whenever I'm the slightest bit happy, I'm manic and way too hyper and that freaks people out. The main reason for my suicide would be that I'm just lonely. I never had a group of friends that really liked me. Everyone thinks I'm weird. I guess I've been sticking it out this long because I know me dying would basically screw over my parents since one of my siblings will need care from someone for the rest of their life after my parents are dead. But my parents are reasonably wealthy and I'm sure they would figure it out.
A girl from my high school died a few months ago in a freak accident and I think about it every day. I wish it had been me. I wish every day it had been me. Everyone misses her, but if it had been me, by now everyone would have been done grieving.
I know I wouldn't be missed all that much, like I said, I don't really have that many friends. Some of that's my own doing but the other part of that is I'm just strange and people don't want to get close to me. When I log onto my Facebook, I see group photos of people all laughing and smiling and happy and that will never be me. People never really take photos of me or with me. I just wish I could disappear.
I don't know what my point of this post was, I just felt like I needed to get it out.
