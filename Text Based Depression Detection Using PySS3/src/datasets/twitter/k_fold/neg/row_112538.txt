Having strong thoughts tonightUsually my suicidal ideations are just that: ideations. For the past couple days the thoughts have gotten a bit more specific. I have been thinking about different methods and creating a sort of pros/cons list in my head for the different methods to end my life. 

 It is somewhat comforting to fantasize about ending it all. I find it to be very empowering to have the ability to stop everything at my own will. It's even more empowering to think about the fact that I've made it this far and still haven't acted on my urges. Every day I wake up wishing that I didn't. The only thing keeping me alive at this point is the fight to 5:00 when I can finally get drunk and high and forget about everything. I don't think I will ever kill myself but fantasizing about it makes me feel a lot better about everything. It's nice to know that there is an option if the pain and suffering becomes truly unbearable. For now, I will stick with self-medication and obsessive suicidal thoughts. Gets me through the day!
