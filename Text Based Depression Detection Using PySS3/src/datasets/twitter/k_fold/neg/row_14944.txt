I don't know anymoreAs the title says, I no longer know what to do. I've lost everything, i've given up everything, and have never come out ahead. I don't even know what it is I have to live for, I dropped out of school to take care of my grandfather after my grandma passed on, both of which took care of me like they were my own parents, they've been gone for a while now, but by doing so my other family members no longer consider me family and well, I don't think care if I lived or died. I've tried to reconnect with my real parents, but they seem to care so little about me. I've tried moving away to get away from everyone and everything that has caused this depression, as always it failed. I just keep thinking of suicide, and when i've tried to reach out for help it's always been brushed off. I'm sorry if this seems to be half-assed typing, i'm just in such a down mood that I could barely get myself to type this up. I'm 22 years old and nothing good has happened to me, always being put down, living in such crap enviroments. This I guess I can't complain too much about, since well some people are without places to live. Sorry this has been a ramble that if you read I appreciate it, but I don't see myself being missed or of any value to anyone ever.
