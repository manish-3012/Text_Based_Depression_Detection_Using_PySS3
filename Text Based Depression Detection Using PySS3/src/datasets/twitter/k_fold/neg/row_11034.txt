friend: I need to scream
me: lol same
me: jk what happened?
friend: why are boys so confusing??
me: i think boys are simple but we over think it
friend: ARE U FUCKING CRAZY!?
ME: probs am tbh
friend: fuck can I justdie
me: pls don't talk like that
friend: well now im gunna have too
me: well what happened?
friend: (insert my close friend who she's had a crush on for about a year)
me: oh yeah I asked him about you two but he said your "just really good friends"
friend: yep
me: that's confusing 
friend: he's been confusing me for two whole weeks and I feel like shot
friend: just shoot me
me: again pls dont talk like that
friend: sorry im gonna have too
me: ok fine 
me: so how did this start?
friend: IM GOING TO KILL MYSELF IVE HAD ENOUGH
me: no you're not not shut up
me: if you do it, I'll do it
friend: I was thinking recently what if I started cutting again..?
friend: pls don't it doesn't help
and goes on like that for about 50+ messages where I utterly fail to convince her to not cut herself and I'm genuinely scared she'll hurt herself. I don't know what to do and I'm quite scared for her. help, please.
