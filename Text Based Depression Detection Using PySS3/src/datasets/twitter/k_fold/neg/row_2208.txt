Iâ€™m having surgery soon and will be put under general anesthesia.I get excited thinking about it. I recently had to be put under general anesthesia and since then Iâ€™ve found myself missing the nothingness I felt. It was the best sleep Iâ€™d ever had and I didnâ€™t want it to end. I havenâ€™t been able to stop thinking about it. I just want to go back to that feeling. I donâ€™t believe in an afterlife, so it just felt like what I can expect when I die, and I liked it.
