It feels like I am rushing to the endI just feel so rushed and my anxiety is killing me. I am going to go on a working trip to San Francisco to make some money because I haven't been able to work on months because I have and still am sick. The pain is mostly unbearable it feels like I only have a few hours of non painkiller related time each day to get things I need to done. I've been sick with these body aches for approaching 5 months now and I have been to my doctor multiple times and each visit nothing all he thought in the beginning was it was the flu and did basic blood tests nothing keeps coming back. Its killing me I feel awful on top of my preexisting medical issues of chronic pain feeling like gall bladder attacks sometimes every day. I'm honestly freaked out at the moment I don't think it would be a good idea to go on this work trip I need help. I've tried to schedule a doctors appointment with another doctor to try and see if I can get a second opinion because my current doctor as nice as he is isn't working out. its been a total of 5 years of me just being sick and 5 months of these flu like body aches that stop me in my tracks really. The second doctor I called won't see me because I am on prescription painkillers and hes the only other doctor in town. I cannot afford to leave town for medical appointments people are too unreliable and I just flat out can't afford the gas. I spent what was left of my savings in January on Vet bills because I had to put my dog down due to stomach cancer. It feels like a snowball like situation and it feels like I am being taken away. I just can't go through with anything due to fear of death and just the thought of what it could do to some of my family members or even my father who I have to take care of. Hell its like I can't sleep anymore like a semi normal person and even then the only thing I can do that gives any sense of accomplishment lately is playing world of warcraft because the pain I hate this existence so much its driven me crazy I just wish there was something I could do a clear path a person that could just help me get this shit taken care of but there isn't most people in my vicinity are indifferent and think I just need to buck up and fuck off that nothing I go through in a day is just over reaction and medication is just a sign of weakness. I'm so tired. I'm sorry for the mess.
