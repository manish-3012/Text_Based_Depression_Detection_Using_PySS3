It keeps coming back.Throwaway because boyfriend has reddit and knows my username, and I don't want him to know that I'm still not okay.

I told him when I was first depressed. He even was the one who suggested it, when I came to him feeling lost and confused and hopeless.

It's been going on for 6 months now. I took a break from work for a little less than a month and I felt better afterward, actually enjoying work again and life itself.

Then one small thing happens and it burrows me in again. It won't go away. I tried asking my parents for help, but my mom simply asked me to fill out a "What's important to me most in life" chart that I didn't care to do. I asked for medical help, to no avail.

I don't know what to do. Just when I think it passes, it comes back. I'm only 17 and won't be 18 for another half a year, so I don't think I can get any sort of medical help on my own.
