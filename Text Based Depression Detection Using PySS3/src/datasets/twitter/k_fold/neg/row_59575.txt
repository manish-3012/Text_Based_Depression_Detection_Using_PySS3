Last StrawI have been trying to be optimistic for years and be grateful, Be a good person and want the best for the ones around me. I have always felt alone and different. When I reach out I get tough love and that I should tell the bitch in my head to beat it. I can't go back on medications and going to a counsellor seems useless because they all just tell me the same thing. Go back on SSRIs and complete CBT through a book. Even psychologists can't stand to be around me. Dying seems to be the only option.
