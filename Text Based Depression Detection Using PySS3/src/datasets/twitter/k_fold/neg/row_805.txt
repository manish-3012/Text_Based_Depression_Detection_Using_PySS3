Gonna be dead by daylight (â–°Ë˜ï¸µË˜â–°)No one
No one will care
No one will notice
No one will remember
No one will bother

And I will be
Done
Done with annoying everyone
Done with being a bad student
Done with causing trouble
Done with hurting so bad on the inside
Done with cutting myself until I get dizzy
Done with crying myself into sleep every night
Done with wishing myself to die every second...

Because then
My wish comes true
My over the years best kept wish
My most inner wish I remind myself every second 

And finally
I am dead

Dead forever
In the dark eternity
Of nothing
