Depression disease affecting me physicallyHave been living with this disease for years gradually getting worse and the signs point to me being near the end. Tonight I threw up what looked like blood, it was bright red like koolaid even though I only ate a hamburger. Anxiety usually makes me throw up but not this bad, getting more frequent. Mentally I sometimes feel disoriented and confused even in calm familiar settings. I can't really focus on anything except the most basic tasks. I wish for death constantly daily. How much longer can I take this?
