I'm so close to passing through the threshold. I've tried to resist the siren song of eternal sleep, but I am too tired to keep fighting.There's a draft in my notes section of my phone. It's titled "Reasons to Live". 

I look at it when I'm desperate. It was helping for awhile. I looked at it again last night, and my desire to swallow a handful of pills and sleep forever was overpowering any hopeful wish on that stupid list.

I could say all the cliche things that people say when they want to die. But I'm preaching to the choir. Suffice to say I've fought for a long time throughout a very hard life to claw my way up to something resembling a good life. 

I don't have any dreams for my future anymore. There is nothing I strive to be. No reason to keep fighting. 

I'm going to sleep. I want people to know I tried. Not everyone is a success story. Not every lost little girl who had a hard life makes it. 

Some of them get tired. And they decide to leave this miserable existence on their own terms. 

I am one of them. 

I guess I just want to try and say 
Goodnight
