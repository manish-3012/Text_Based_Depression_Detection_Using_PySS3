I am not ready for being a personNo matter what happens to me I am not able to deal with it.

Ever little thing makes me want to die.

I can't deal with being a person.  Killing myself is the best way to make it easier for everyone else.  If all I'll ever be is a drain on everyone then I shouldn't exist.  I know I'd hate me if I had to put up with me.  That isn't just self deprecation.  I've talked to people who are sad and I wished they would just kill themselves because they are such a bore
