Guys get a lot of shit.If you're not confident you're seen as pathetic and inferior to other guys. People use words like beta or something else like that to imply that you are inferior. That there's something wrong with you and that you are less of a man and not good enough. You're just a fucking pussy and not a real man and no girl will ever want you. I feel like other guys think like this and that it comes from other guys. Then guys want to kill themselves but nobody wants to understand because he shouldn't have killed himself over this and he should of just been better. This is one of the top reasons I want to kill myself. Because the constant messge going through my head and I'm sure other guys as well is you're inferior and you're not good enough. People are probably gonna get mad at this but this is what happens and I want to be understood by people. But I guess it doesn't matter. Those are my thoughts and this is what I have experienced and how I feel about it. I'm angry and suicidal and I'm sure others are as well for the same reasons.
