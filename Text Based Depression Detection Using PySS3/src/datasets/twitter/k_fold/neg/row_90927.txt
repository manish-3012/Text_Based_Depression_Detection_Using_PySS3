Just need to talkBe me.

Be 24.

Be self-hating lazy Asian bastard.

Started uni in 2011. Dropped out this year because I see myself with no future to fight for.

Parents constantly comparing to everyone I know since I was 7.

Parents constantly reminding how useless and self-inflicting stupidity I am

Have no job experience and applicable skills either.

Have good friends but none I feel that I can call in the middle of night for shit like this.

The only things I enjoy are videogaming, reading, and hanging out with small group of friends and that's the only time I can pretend not to be me for awhile.

Even this account is a throwaway.

Wanted to go out last year but couldn't because another friend of mine passed away for a different reason.

Promised myself to see the year out before committing suicide. Now don't think I can go past the Lunar New Year.
