I don't feel like I mean anything to the world anymoreI've currently been depressed for the past month after me and my ex-girlfriend broke up for the 3rd time and now that she works at the same job with me all I've been doing is feeling miserable and have started want to kill myself due to the incident. I understand it's a childish thing to want to do it over but honestly it feels like she's taken everything from me and practically acts like I don't exist and I feel like she's going to convince people where I work not to like me anymore it's so fucking frustrating I just wish it could all end and the pain to be over with
