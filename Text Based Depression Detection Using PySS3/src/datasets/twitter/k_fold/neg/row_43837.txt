The voice in my headIt's funny, I haven't been so bright Lately since its been so hot. I don't take any Meds at all, and I'm not diagnosed schizo, just depression years back. I'm so blue the voice inside me keeps telling me to kill myself, it gets louder and louder until my ears pound. It's hard to ignore. It's makes me want to die quicker. I don't think talking will help, but I'm posting this to see if anyone has strategies to deal with the voice.
