University, coronavirus and suicideI never thought I would ever make a post in here. And here I am on the verge of suicide.

I am a university student. 22 years old. I was doing really well during my studies. I was full of energy and always able to do my homework and study without considering it much of a problem. And some sort of a "study burnout" was only a fairy tale for me.

But since the coronavirus has been around I've slowly been going down hill. One thing that especially killed my motivation is how coronavirus makes internships much harder to do. I keep calling organizations to accept me as an intern but I either get rejected as soon as I tell them about my internships or they cancel the internship contract right before it starts. Both of these outcomes are caused by the pandemic.

Nobody cares about  keeps happening to me. The only thing my faculty provided for me is telling me "Good luck". On one hand I am unable to get an internship, on the other faculty keeps showering me with homework that I have to do during my internships.

I am so sick of calling organizations with no results at all. The most frustrating thing about this is that if the pandemic didn't happen, this wouldn't have happened. Everything would have been fine. And the funniest part about that is that once I drop out because of this my family is gonna blame me for not studying enough. They never listen to what I have to say....

At this point I just don't want to deal with this. As much as I hate to admit this, I am completely burnt out and demotivated to not even continue my studies, but to continue living my life as well.

I hate everything about this year, everything about my country and it's stupid pandemic regulations (which is what caused the organizations to not accept interns) and I hate how ridiculous my fucking life is.

At this point even jumping off the tall building where I live is gonna be more pleasant than dealing with this. It's actually gonna be quite relieving......
