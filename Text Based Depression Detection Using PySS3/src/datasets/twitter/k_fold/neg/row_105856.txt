I'm probably going to kill myself before the end of this year.I've been having severe anxiety about moving away next year.  I'm supposed to be going to boarding school and I've wanted it my whole life, I've wanted so badly to get out of this town.

But now I don't want to go.  My depression is giving me strong signals to stay at home with my parents, I have an anxiety attack almost every time I think about leaving.

You know I'm fucked up when to only thing that gets me excited about next year is the next fucking DOOM game.

I've failed my last two maths tests, I've fucked up at school so badly that I'm scared of what my mid semester report is going to say.  My last science test decapitated me, I only got a good mark on my last geography assignment because I was with my classmate who is superior in every way to me.

I'm so scared about moving away, at least here I get to be a fuckup near my parents, I don't want to be a fuckup far away from here.  I can't stand it anymore, my anxiety is killing me.  All I can do is worry, worry worry worry.  'What if I do this wrong?'  'What if I annoy the students who actually know what their doing?'  'What if I fail maths at a private school?'
And when I worry I get sick, and when I get sick my mum worries, and when she worries I worry even more. 

The only way I see out of this is by killing my self.  And honestly I'm fully prepared to do so.  I might stick around until November or December, but after that I'm done.
