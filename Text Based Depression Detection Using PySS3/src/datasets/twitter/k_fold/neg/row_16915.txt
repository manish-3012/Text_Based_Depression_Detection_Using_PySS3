There's big battle in my headHi 
i'm 21 years old
I have got big battle in my head because three reasons 

1- My EX left me 3 years ago and i still love her so much so so so so much i miss her every minute i can't even forget her i lied to you if i told you i will forget her , and now she is better than my and im also praying for her for her sucess because i love her and i want to support her 

2- Everyone is better than me i'm useless to the community and for thr planet i can't do anything correctly , i can't do anything right i runin everything all who i know is better than me in my college or in my family 

3- i'm lonely and there's no one for me after my ex even my family They dont feel anything about me even if they see me im sad

My heart is white and i love all people but no body loves me , i love to help everyone in my life , i love to feed cats and dogs .. oh my god i love cats and dogs 

ONE DAY i will join the family of who suicide
