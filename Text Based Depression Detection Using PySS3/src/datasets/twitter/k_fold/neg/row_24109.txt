What's the pointI'm a 18 year old nobody who just can't deal with it anymore.

I'm not attractive

I'm not the smartest

I'm not athletic

I'm nothing

I'm not the best option for any position in this world, so why bother. I'm just wasting oxygen and food other people would make better use of it.

You may say i'm overreacting or some bullshit like that, but for real, i realize i have no place here.

No girl has ever seen anything valuable enough in me to even start a friendly relation at all. I've got no girl friends and, obviously, no girlfriend. Is that my hormones speaking? Probably, but does it matter? I feel bad all the same.

Anyone can find a better friend, boyfriend or acquaintance than me, i'm just a waste of space here. My mom keeps wasting money in me that she should keep for her retirement, if i kill myself my father's inheritance will go to her and she can work less hours, everything will be better without me here.

I don't think anyone will read this, but i just needed to rant, sorry for wasting your time, like i do with everyone i meet.

EDIT: I'm so useless that i needed to edit this post 5 times for it to be comprehensible
