I just don't care anymoreI want to quit life. Do you remember the computer games you played as a kid? They always had a quit button on the main menu. I wish life had one of those. I'm not upset or mad at any one thing, I just don't want to play the game of life anymore. I don't want to be on this planet with any of the 7billion+ other people. People always say "What about family?" and the thing is: I'm ok with being selfish about this. I just hate how it will be milked on social media. Nothing surprises me anymore. I can fake everything for a bit, but eventually it all comes flooding back. I don't want antidepressants or therapy. Deal me out.
