School and insecurityI feel like I'm falling behind in graduate school. I'm exhausted and too mentally cloudy for my classes. I go, but I'll be sitting there and having the single image in my head of a gun rotating through space. I realized today that I'd missed 5 minutes of a lecture because I had been thinking instead about how I'd never even shot a gun, and how could I even find one, and how could I even know how it works. It's scary that I'm having these thoughts as completely normal things.

No, I can't go ask for help from the school because I'd have to explain what is wrong. Nothing is really wrong except that I'm too stupid for this. I've been doing really well up until this semester, with previous semesters of this stuff being manageable and fun, but I think I've reached my limit. Schools also don't take too well to students with suicidal ideation, preferring to dismiss them in favor of not having to report an "incident".

I don't have any specific plans, a note, anything like that, so it's not like it's so bad right now. Sorry for wasting your time.
