practicing radical honesty and taking stock of my life makes it hard to keep goingmy life is gone. here is an honest assessment of literally everything wrong with my life, which i haven't told anybody in full. everyone only knows bits because i keep lying to myself and others.

* i worked in a hotel. it was going to be my career. i got promoted 3 times in 4 years from entry level. i got laid off, and the industry will take years to recover.
* my boyfriend broke up with me last month because he also suffers from depression and needed to focus on himself and his mental health. he made me feel loved and secure and valued. i miss him so much.
* i will no longer have health insurance after this month, and i have no way to pay for the medical bills i've incurred due to a chronic back issue. my back is also a huge source of constant pain and i live in fear of becoming permanently disabled and/or addicted to opioids. my back also prevents me from taking jobs that require physical labor, which would normally be one of the quickest ways out of unemployment.
* i have 4400 worth of credit card debt, 1200 of medical debt, 2500 of student loan debt. unemployment is running out, and i will soon have to survive on very little money in a very expensive city.
* i never actually graduated from college. i've been lying on my resume all these years. i got so close to the end and just never finished, because i'm terrified of success or something.
* i'm 31 and i have to find a new career in this clusterfuck of an epidemic.
* my meds are hundreds a month. if i'm not on them, i will most likely end up in the hospital again. i really do not want to end up there ever again. 

i just don't know if i'm ever going to be okay. january felt like i was finally turning the corner after about 20 years of crippling depression and personality defects. to think about it now is painful. now all i see is pain. i don't know what to do, and i don't want to call a hotline. i'm just tired.
