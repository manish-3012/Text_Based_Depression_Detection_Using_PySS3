Nobody cares about me...All my friends stopped talking to me after learning I have depression.

Nobody in my family ever asks how Iâ€™m feeling or anything like that even though they all know I have depression.

My mother has told me she wouldnâ€™t even care if I died. All she ever does is yell at me for not going to school anymore and that Iâ€™m fucking useless.

I spend every night hugging my pillow and crying myself to sleep thinking about how Iâ€™m so alone in this world. 

All I want in this world is to be genuinely loved by someone but I guess that just isnâ€™t going to happen.

Iâ€™m going to stop taking my antidepressants and    cut myself more now so itâ€™ll be easier when the time comes.
