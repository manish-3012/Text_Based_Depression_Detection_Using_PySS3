I can't stand being alone and I can't stand being around people.I feel like I'm slowly eating myself alive. I hate light. I hate noise. I hate physical contact. Being so much as near other people makes me feel like I just drank a litre of molten plastic. I don't know why. I don't know if it's conditioned or innate to my personality. To me, people *feel* noxious and inflammatory.

I'm not especially volatile. At least not these days. I don't hate or resent anyone, I just genuinely am bothered by human contact, for some inexplicable reason. Like standing next to an unbearably hot fire.

 And yet I'm so fucking alone. Every single fucking day for the past  twenty years I go about my business and there is just absolutely fucking no one. I've managed to completely isolate myself from the world. Congratulations to me, right? Now there's no one to care, no one to talk to, no one who'll be arsed if I kill myself.

And that's the only solution. Because the reason I self-isolate is that I can't stand other people. I've tried and tried and tried connecting with others in as many ways as I am capable of. It never works. No one can handle someone as fucked up as me and I can't handle anyone else. So yeah, I should probably just die already.
