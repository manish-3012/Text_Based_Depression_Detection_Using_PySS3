not going to kill myself...because frankly, by this point, it'd be too little too late. my life sucks. my job sucks. my living situation sucks. my shrink sucks. my therapist sucks. I can't shake the feeling that I should have killed myself 12 years ago. I wish I was dead almost hourly but I just don't see the point in actually going through with it anymore. the time for that is long gone and I fucked it up. so now what? I'm just going through the motions of life, rather poorly at that, waiting for a heart attack or car accident. something. anything.

I hate my life and wish it was someone else's.
