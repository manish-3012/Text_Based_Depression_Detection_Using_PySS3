I feel incredibly lonely.  I have everything but friends.  I'm starting to get tired of trying.I have most things that make people happy.  I have money, I have an awesome job, I'm in an awesome college program, my family is great, I've been able to travel to the places I've always wanted to and I'm not ugly (I think...).  The problem is I don't have any friends where I am. 

I moved away from my hometown 2 years ago for college to a city where I know nobody.  Last year I was unable to really make a good connection to people due to living far off campus and becoming seriously ill for a large period of the semesters.  I now live on campus and I'm not ill anymore either, but I feel so alone.  Everyone on my floor has friends they seem to have known for ever, even the people who are from other countries.  Instead of being like them, I'm here in my room with nobody to hang out with.  I haven't had a friend in this city since I've moved in and whenever I try to make a relationship with somebody, it never seems to work.

I thought I would be happy with the rest of the things I'm blessed with, but I could careless about them at this point.  I have nobody to talk to about what I do or what I learn.  I don't have anyone to love or to love me back.  I want someone in my life here.

If anyone has any advice that would be awesome, or just talking would be fine too.  I'm hitting an all time low at this point and just need some help.
