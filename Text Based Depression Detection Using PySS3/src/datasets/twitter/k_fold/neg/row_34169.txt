Iâ€™m still crippled by debt from 7 year old hospital billsLong story short, Iâ€™ve had my long struggles with depression, self-harm, and even a few suicide attempts. Most of this is stuff Iâ€™ve worked HARD to overcome over the past 6-7 years of my life. 

Over the last few years I turned my life around, got a good job, started grad school, scored an internship in a new city, got a PhD offer. Things were seemingly going awesome. 

2 days before I left for my internship, I found out my parents were filing for bankruptcy. This destroyed me emotionally. Iâ€™m so worried for them and what will happen to them. 

1 week into my internship, I found out old medical bills have been sent into collections and my credit score dropped by 130 points over night. I canâ€™t afford the bill and I was working so hard to fix my credit so that I could afford a good life for myself after graduate school. I have a long road of paper trails, lawyers, etc to try to fix this or itâ€™s going to be devastating to my future. 

These medical bills are from when I was hospitalized for my suicide attempts. It kills me to know that these are still following me now and I feel I may never be able to escape this. I feel hopeless and itâ€™s taking me everything right now not to just pull the plug on this life. 

Please help. I just want to move past this part of my life, but it keeps haunting me. Maybe thinking I can move on and have a good life is futile? I canâ€™t see any way out of this and I donâ€™t want to die.
