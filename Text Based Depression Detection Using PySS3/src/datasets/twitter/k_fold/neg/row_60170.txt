I think death is good, not bad.How come anything I say to anyone they tell me I'm wrong or too dumb or too young, and think they know everything? Death is the only thing I have on my side in this world, who believe in me, understand me, accept me. I'm only 14 but death is all I want to do. I hate evryone, when I read all the comments in redit I hate how mean and know it all and rude everyone is. Ther was a post on a dead gay person and all they people did was make jokes of them. If that is humanity and if it's people like my class mates and parents, i want to leave it now. I'm thinkin about dying on Sunday, by stealing my fathers car and driving into a tree as fast as I could
