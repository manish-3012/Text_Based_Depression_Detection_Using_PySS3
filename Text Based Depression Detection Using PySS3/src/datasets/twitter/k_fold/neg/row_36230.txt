I'm not cut out for this.My life has just been one clusterfuck after another. My parents are abusive and my dad is a drunk who has always been mean just because I wasn't the manly man he wanted in a son. Then when I was sixteen I realized I was trans in the middle of a red state with only one or two supportive family members, so I had to hide from my dad who eventually found out anyway because of said family members told him and he about disowned me so I've had to work ten times as hard just to let him give me the privilege of being in his stupid life.

Followed by getting raped at eighteen and being just wholly broken for awhile before I could finally get thing's together when I turned twenty and started turning my life around before my fucking hands just decided to not work because of some medical issue that we're still fucking trying to figure out. I can't really do anything anymore without taking long breaks after because my hands just. Don't. Work.

I hate life. I have for many years but I'm too much of a coward to just end it already. I can't help but think of the few friends I have and how they'll feel after I'm gone. I fantasize daily about someone killing me and I really just wish they would already.
