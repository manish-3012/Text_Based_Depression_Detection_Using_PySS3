I need someone to talk to.https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/42r2vt/i_hope_my_mistake_can_help_others_i_am_truly/

In the above post, I explained a lot of what's going on with me right now.

I feel like I need to deal with some of the stuff that lead up to this incident. I caught her cheating on me and she was planning on leaving me for a long time. I really wish she had talked to me. I miss her so much. I can't really get into details, but I am able to see that she's already in love again. She thinks I'm human garbage basically, and she thought this before the incident that landed me in jail happened.

I'm trying so hard to stay positive. I've been meeting lots of people, smiling as often as possible, and thinking of ways to improve my future. All I can think about is talking to her, saying I'm sorry. 

I don't know how to forgive myself. I don't want to move on. I just want to die.
