I feel like my mind is a broken record. It won't stop.I don't know what other title to give, or what's wrong with my head. I hate Mother's Day, I hate my mother. Glad she's dead. She's dead she's dead she's dead and she hated me BC she said so when she always put the magnum to her head and now she's dead BC she smoked and sabotaged her health and hated me and she's dead.

I can't keep my thoughts together and her memories and the things she did to me are still there. She's dead but  SHE'S.STILL.THERE! Laughing at me for failing to kill myself back when I was nine. I'm almost 30 now, trying to make it. Just trying to function and I can't keep doing this. I can't I can't I can't...

The nightmares don't stop. The flashbacks don't stop. Nothing ever stops. My head won't stop. I want to make it stop but I'm too cowardly to try. I can't BC I keep getting saved. I don't want to be saved, I want peace. I want to rest. I want to feel like there's some thing to live for and give me joy, but it's numb. It's gray. It's nothing. I'm tired. So tired. I'm lost. I want it all to end. Please make it stop. I'm crying at this point. Im sorry. I didn't know what else to do.
