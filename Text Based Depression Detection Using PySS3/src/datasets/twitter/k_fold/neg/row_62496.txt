Tomorrow is the day I die.I had a long, epic novel of a post, explaining why I'm doing this. But no one will read it and anyone who does can't do anything to help.

Here are the highlights:
- cancer patient
- mentally ill
- Living in a 3rd world country to attempt my "bucket list" before dying here 
- robbed of everything but my phone. 
- Time remaining is short. Can't afford to get home and say goodbye to my loved ones. Fuck this. 

So tomorrow I'm just going to end it quick and painlessly. 

To all those who read this:
-please spend every day being happy
-love your family...no matter what
-fate is not real. Your choices determine your destiny. Nothing else. 
- Sometimes you need to just let go of the medical steering wheel and live whatever is left of your life. 

More than anything...

-if you ever meet someone that you love. Truly love. Down to your soul. Never let them go. 

I had that. I fucked it up. If that person, EPS, ever reads this....the happiest moment of my life was when you told me: "I love you...I am going to marry you one day".  Thank you so much for that. 

To my family: I am sorry. I know this will be hard on you. But remember that I will finally be at peace. I am sorry I didn't tell you that the cancer came back. I thought the pain of watching me die slowly would be far worse than a simple end to my life, filled with demons of my own creation. 

Love you all.
