I wish I can donate my life away to someone elseThereâ€™s plenty of disabled people, people in third world countries and poor people who would love to me in my situation. Iâ€™m wasting this life away anyways. Iâ€™ve lost everyone and everything. I have nothing left. Itâ€™s like a perfect blank slate of a life for someone to take over.
