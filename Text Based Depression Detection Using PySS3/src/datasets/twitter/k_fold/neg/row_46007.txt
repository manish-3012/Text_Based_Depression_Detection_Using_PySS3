Life is just too hardI feel like I have to dedicate everything in my being, every bit of time I have, to working for shit that I'm just not smart enough to earn for myself. Life feels like some shit. If you get stuck in poverty everyone points at you, treats you like you're lesser than them, like you're useless, lowley, don't deserve shit. Everyone thinks they're smarter than you and just tells you to stop being poor. 

I just want it all to end. This life is too hard. And even more so you are supposed to fucking make people like you to actually get anywhere? How am I supposed to do that? Thinking about it makes me feel so tired. And more than that it makes me feel depressed. I don't feel happy about bring alive. I don't like waking up in the morning. I wait for each day to be over and hopefully the end of my days will come soon. 

I hate being alive. I hate having to choose a path to make enough money to live on. There is no security in any path. No matter what I choose I still have to work so goddamn hard. But that hard work might not pay off. I don't have any faith in anything. 

I don't have any faith in anything. I don't have any faith in anything at all. I have zero faith things will ever get any better. I don't believe in God. I don't believe in destiny or purpose. I don't believe there is a reason to be happy to be alive. Life is not something to be grateful for. The primitive fear of death in our brains is not something to be grateful for. It is something to be resented. Forever. Life is something to be resented.
