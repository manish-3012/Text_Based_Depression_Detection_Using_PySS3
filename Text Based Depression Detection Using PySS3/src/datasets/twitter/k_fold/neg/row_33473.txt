The end.Well, that's it.  I can't do it anymore.  I have truly lost everything I have to live for in life.  Today is my birthday, I'm 47.  I spent the day crying alone in my bed. My wife died of cancer two years ago. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to endure. Within three months of her diagnosis, she was unable to do the things she loved anymore. She did chemo for awhile, but it was too late.  She barely lasted 6 months after her diagnosis...it was so sudden. My son (18) and I have not gotten along since. He definitely got along with his mom better than me, but I thought we were at least amicable. In a weird way I think he blames me. He went to live with my wife's sister after her death. She doesn't care much for me but at least she is nice to my face. I've tried to reach out, be in his life, but after she died we just haven't been able to speak.  Today, on my birthday, I was let go of my job of 5 years without warning. Gave it my all, but "slow economic times" have made me expendable. 

I feel worthless. I feel like giving up. My son is starting college this year, he got a scholarship. I'm so proud of him, he's got a great life ahead of him. He doesn't need me anymore. He doesn't want me in his life. I live alone in a small one bedroom apartment, unemployed, waiting for death to take me away from my failed life. There's nothing left for me.  Goodbye.
