That crushing feeling you get when you realize it's never going to get betterI'm stuck in a position I never asked to be in, due to my mother's mistakes and self destructive behavior. I've tried to help but no longer feel I can. I have come to the point where I realize I can't help her it's never going to get better. Jumping off Fremont is probably the only logical choice I have left. I can't do this I'm only seeing myself up for failure by trying to bail out a sinking ship that my mother continues to drill holes in.
