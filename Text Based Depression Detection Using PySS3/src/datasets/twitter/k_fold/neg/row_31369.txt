I don't know what to do.*Insert generic depression story here*

My depressing behaviour started 4 years ago and it has lasted ever since. I don't want to share the reasons of why I have become a mess that I am now, but it doesn't even matter anyway. I have been a huge self harmer. Luckily, I was able to stop 2 and a half years after and have not self harmed ever since. *Except I relapsed a week ago.* Yeah, these past few weeks have been the worst and for the first time in my life I actually thought about committing suicide. I have gotten a bit better mood wise, but there's one thing that I've done that I regret doing. Smoking. 

*Wow, OP, so dramatic you should write a novel about it!* 

For my whole life I was a huge smoking hater. I disliked it with my whole heart but now I'm in a battle with my current self and my "good" self whether I should smoke or not. Of course, the answer would be *no* but I can't help myself. Whenever I go to the store I keep looking at them and how much I'd like to have more but I know I'll be mad at myself for smoking, then I'd self harm again and smoke again to make myself feel better and before you know it it's an endless circle. 

I don't even know why I'm posting this here, maybe I just need sympathy or someone to tell me to "fucking get myself together", who knows.
