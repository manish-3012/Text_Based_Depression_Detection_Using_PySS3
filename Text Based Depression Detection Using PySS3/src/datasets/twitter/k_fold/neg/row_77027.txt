My girlfriend just said goodbye over skype and told me she was about to commit suicide.What the fuck am I supposed to say to that? What am I supposed to do?! She's 17 and living in a hostel, I rang her friends there and told them and they say she's locked in her room they're trying to get in. If she dies I have no idea what I'm going to do. She always said that I was the one thing keeping her alive and then before she said it she asked me to make everything better but sometimes I just don't know what to fucking say. They can't ring me back until they are finished so I will have no way of knowing what's happening for a while. I can't get over there. Even if she survives what is going to happen? I just needed to rant and some help over here. What is the best thing to do?
