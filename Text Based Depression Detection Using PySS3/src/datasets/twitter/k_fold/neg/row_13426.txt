A childhood friend committed suicide and I canâ€™t help but think, why not me?Itâ€™s been on my mind all day as Iâ€™ve been so much more suicidal lately. However, all he got on his wall were R.i.p and a few friends who pretended to care. He had a son and I canâ€™t help but think of that. However, why couldnâ€™t it have been me? Iâ€™m 26, see no light at the end of the tunnel and jus tried of life. My grandmother who understand me passed in May, I lost my dad and aunt in 2017 and I feel like this is the worse year of my life.
