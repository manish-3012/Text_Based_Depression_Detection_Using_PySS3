Each day gets harder and harder and I'm losing the will to surviveFor the past month I've spent almost every day in bed doing literally nothing. I try to take it one day at a time but each day is just getting harder and harder and I'm losing the will to survive. My weight loss plateaued after 2 weeks because I have no self control and in turn overdrew my bank account $200 with no way to repay it, I started posting nudes because the attention I got was validating, and I've started cutting again for the first time in 7 years. 

I didn't ask to be trans, I don't want my life to be like this, I wish I was born as a regular person of either gender, but I wasn't. What I've gone through mentally I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. It destroyed my life. I keep going on trying to look at the big picture knowing that if I just survive I can get through it eventually, but now I've lost the will to continue.

I want to get through this and become a person I'm proud to be but at this point I can't see it happening. I don't want to die, I don't want to hurt anyone else, but I feel it's the only option at this point.
