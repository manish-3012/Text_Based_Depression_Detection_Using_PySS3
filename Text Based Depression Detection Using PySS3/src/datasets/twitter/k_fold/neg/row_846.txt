I can't do it. Please help.I, honestly, genuinely want to die. The reason? Life's just lost its colors, it's gotten stale. There might be more to it but I'm too tired to even ponder it. There definitely used to be more though. The closest I've gotten to doing "it" was to dance on the train tracks, but I only ended up with a slightly bloody hand and embarrassment. I feel like I'm bothering people and I have friends with real depression. I'd feel disrespectful to talk to them about my fake shit. 



A friend talked me out of it once, but I'm too awkward and cowardly to admit to him that I'm not fine this time. I don't want to drop hints because I consider it attention whoring. I mean, if others do it, that's okay. They deserve help.



If anyone asked me what was wrong months ago, I would have had a ton of reasons to wish it, but didn't want to do it. Now I have no reason to wish it, but I want it more than ever. This is why I can't even ask for help... I have nothing to say. Well, aside from school. That's probably one of the main reasons, but it's so insignificant and selfish that I'd be a hypocrite to talk to others about it like it was a huge deal, because it shouldn't be. But it really is. Still, if I don't want help, I want the easy way out.



I guess I have walking depression, but I can still laugh and smile all day. The only thing stopping me is the fear of the afterlife: if it exists, I go to hell and I'm fucked. If it doesn't exist, I just wasted what isn't even half of my life and prematurely plunged into the eternal void. I don't feel sad, but I don't want to live either. If you gave me a gun a week ago, I would have pulled the trigger. I don't know if my friends still like me, I'm probably annoying. 



I just want some words of peace, something that can give me courage and convince me to do it, I guess. This is the only related sub I know, although it's the opposite of what I want. Thank you &lt;3
