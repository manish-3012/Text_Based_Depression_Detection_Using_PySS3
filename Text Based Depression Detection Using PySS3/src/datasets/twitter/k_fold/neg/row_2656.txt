Lost the only thing that kept me going.My relationship is on a break due to my girlfriend feeling that she does not love me and care about me as much as I do with her. She has been a great thing in my life, a really outstanding support and the light of my life. We may not be over yet, at least not officially, but in my experience a break means the same as ending it, just delayed a bit. I am rambling a bit, but I just feel like I can't take all the pain, the feelings of betrayal and abandonment anymore. The pain just feels like more than I can take.
