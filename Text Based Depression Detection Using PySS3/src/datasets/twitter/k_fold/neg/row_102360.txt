After 3 months, I still feel the same.. Any thoughts? Extremely long and detailed :/Here's the story of our relationship and what happened.
I was with my 18F girlfriend/fiance for almost 3 years. I am a 20M. We were high school sweethearts. We were about to move in together and we had 3 miscarriages and now we have an amazing little girl. About 2 months ago i needed her help financially because i was suffering and our relationship was as well. My grandfather is giving me a free house and we were going to move in it. I just needed about 800 more a month so i asked if she could get a part time job to help me out. This somehow created an argument because i was focusing on finances and she wanted to focus on the relationship when the finances were going to help the relationship. So anyway this caused her to lash out and go party, drink, smoke, find another guy and have sex with him. I noticed her downward spiral and tried to stop her but she wouldn't listen. This happened early April and everyday until this week i was nice and told her I'll forgive her just stop and make this better. She would just be mean or not reply. At times though, she would lead me on so i would stick around by saying i love you and miss you. Even kissing me and doing things that we used too. She was my first and i was hers. I still love and miss her and always will. After i found out what my daughter had been around. The drugs, drinking, smoking and other guys. I decided for her it would be best if she wasn't around her mother. So I'm in the process of getting custody of her. This really sucks. I just wanted a family. Should i feel bad for taking her from her mom? I cant sleep through the night without missing who i thought she was. When i try talking to her about things even though she is with another guy she cries and just has to hug and kiss me. She really misses me. Then the same day she doesn't even want to talk to me. It's like she's trapped or doesn't even exist. Every day gets harder and harder for me.
TL;DR Basically my first love and mother of 3 unborn children and 1 beautiful little girl was asked to help with finances. She saw society's perception of "living" and didn't want to grow up. She decided to drink, smoke, get high, party and find someone else. Some times even around my little girl. I tried to stop her in this downward spiral and said i would forgive her if she would just stop because i wanted a family and i loved her. She then decided to lead me on while still seeing another guy if not more. Then when i found about what my daughter had been around i decided to get full custody of her.

Court was yesterday. 

In a brief summary. 

Her argument: 
1. I did this because of another guy. 
2. I hacked into her email. 
3. I still love her.



My argument: 
1. She does not have a job or license. 
2. Her mother does drugs around the child. 
3. Her step dad does drugs around the child including possible meth use. 
4. I watch her 85% of the time and buy her everything. 
5. She stated in text that she could not handle the child, the child was driving her fucking crazy and that she did not have the patience for her. 
6. 3 suicide notes from the mother. 
7. The new boyfriend brought drugs to the home while my daughter was there. 8. Along with tons of prove of all the above and more.

Her attorney attempted to get me for perjury which was unsuccessful due to me not lying.
She admitted that all the drug use was true she only denied the fact that i kept her more which i had a log and proved that i did.
She lied to the court saying she had a job and that she did not live with her parents anymore.


The judge stated in the middle that he would have to dismiss the case because it was taking too long and he had 7 more to go.
The final ruling was split custody.
What?! The judge put the child back into the environment that i had taken her out of.
Her and her family slip through the cracks very often because they know people.
I really love her and she acts like she wants this to work out and isnt with the guy any more but its just words and no action is taken.

I want to be in control of my life. Not by the judge, by the world, by my job or her. This has consumed me.
I dont get to see my daughter often now. I may have to pay child support that i can't afford. I have $30000 in debt. I'm a burden to everyone. The love of my life is gone and isnt the same person. I just a new job and it doesn't pay enough and I'm already in trouble for missing because of talking to my attorney and going to court. This is just a fraction of what's wrong. My mind works oddly in a good way at times. I just wanted a family and my goal in life is to help deserving people and make them happy and I've pieced together exactly what to do to accomplish that.


I keep trying to talk to her because i love and miss her. She is my soulmate. I have this incredible bond with her. At first she was trying to help me which made me feel amazing then i said some things that bothered me. Such as her leaving me for someone else hurt my self esteem in every way and that she took everything from me. She then started being mean and selfish. I left her alone for a bit and she turned around. Some. I went and picked up my daughter yesterday and she was so nice. She was smiling. She hadn't got ready or dolled up. She was just herself. This made me smile so big and almost cry. I needed a hug and grabbed her. She hugged me so tight. She hadn't done that in a long time. I can't even remember the last time she touched me and didn't act like i was repelling. She kissed my cheek. Then she just looked at me and kissed me. That feeling of love and happiness was back. I couldn't stay too long because of all this custody battle going on our families don't like each other. So i kept hugging her and kissing her. I was scared to say goodbye. Finally i had to leave. Now ever since then she's this different person that is just horrible. I told her i was depressed and what all was upsetting me. She replied with you're freaking me out. I don't know what to do or think. This is probably the biggest problem but they are many. I can't get or seek help due to me losing my job or her using it against me in court. Which she probably already will. 

Recently I started getting unemployment and have become to go to talk to a counselor/therapist.

I still watch my daughter more and buy her everything. Nowhere near 50/50.

Last week all Allison did was tell me what I wanted to hear. I love you. Lets be a family. I miss you. I want our family to grow. Etc. I didnâ€™t believe her and didnâ€™t let my walls down. But like every other time I eventually did. Last Friday I went over to her house and we made love and it was amazing. The next day we spent it together and got breakfast then we went out of town and spent the night at a nice hotel as a family and had a blast. Our daughter was making us laugh and smile all night. We went to eat that morning then came home. This guy continued to text her and wouldnâ€™t leave her alone but she either ignored him or told him she wanted to be left alone. Sunday night I had an awesome idea. Her grandmother kept our daughter and we went camping and brought drinks. It was a blast. We had so much fun. We were even messing with that guy she was with. We woke up and went home. She went and got our daughter and brought her to me and I took her to my grandparents because they had missed her. While I was there I found out she started talking to him again just out of the blue and was planning on going back to his house and staying there for the night. After all we had just done. I was crushed. Again. 

Now this week she has just been mean and ive tried to ignore it but she said something that got to me. Which I have found out so much worse this one was just the most recent. She said she left me because he provides for her and our daughter. I have my own house. A nice car. I was making good money at the time. It was just to hurt me. She has convinced this guy that I beat her daily. He is around my daughter and tells people she is his. 
Now I know a lot of things I can do to them. In a revenge kind of way. Which I want to because they threaten to do things to me constantly as well. All I did was love this girl and pure my heart out to her. Iâ€™m tempted to be mean to them like they have been me. But Iâ€™m not sure what I should do. She is threatening to get some girl I had sex with 3 years ago while we were both under 18 to file statutory rape charges against me. I donâ€™t understand why she is being like this to me. I never did anything.  I just want custody of my daughter and she can see her but she refuses to sign her over. Her entire family hates me because of the lies she has told about me and they encourage her to ruin my life.

TL;DR My ex girlfriend is satan
