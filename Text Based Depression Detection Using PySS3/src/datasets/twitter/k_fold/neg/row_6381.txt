ProblemHi,

So as I am spending New Year alone like every year it somehow starts to touch me emotionally.

I got used to the loneliness however past few days I began to notice I want to interact at least in some community.

&amp;#x200B;

However I realize that I always get to the point that I do not know how, everytime I try to join conversation or chat I just do not get it, I feel like everything is so generic and boring that I feel I only see bots talking and when the conversation is worthwhile I am immediately in opposition against all or bitter as hell.

Where can I study some human behavior so I can understand it better? I do not understand but I believe I can not handle another year like this.

Thank you.
