Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome kills meHello again. I again think about suicide. Iâ€™ve been suffering from chronic balanoposthitis, prostatitis since 13 yo. For more than 14 years. I canâ€™t patient it anymore. Everything became much worse with anxiety and depression. Constant pain, urination and ejaculation problems, anxiety, depression, balanoposthitis, undeveloped penis and realizing that I canâ€™t have sex, canâ€™t meet a girl. I limit myself from girls. Iâ€™m afraid. I tried all medicines, more than 30 doctors any specializations.  Took amitriptiline, fluvoxamine, paroxetin, alplazolam, diazepam and it didnâ€™t help me anyway. Iâ€™m tired of crying every day. How to finish it? Iâ€™m afraid to suicide. But Iâ€™m tired to patient constant crying and pain. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing it. Iâ€™m looking for any hope.  I donâ€™t know what to do. How to live. I hate everything, Iâ€™m constantly sad, people constantly ask me why Iâ€™m so sad, I canâ€™t answer. Recently I had girlfriend. While I was with her I cried much less.  She humiliated me in the end. She wanted children and sex. I couldnâ€™t give it. I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel how Iâ€™m going crazy. I feel pain in heart and my blood pressure constantly jumps. Sorry my English is terrible.
