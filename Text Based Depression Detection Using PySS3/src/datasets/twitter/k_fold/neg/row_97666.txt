Not at the very edge but far too close and I saw this coming years agoI don't really understand what I'm going through right now. It's been a few years.. nine, at least. Five since shit got weird for real. I am tired and I want so badly to dissolve. I feel as if I've been doing that anyway over the years, you know, dissolving, and now its at the point where I'm more or less just a skeleton with a thin layer of flesh. I kinda just want to get it over and done with at this point. Me, the skeleton, I hurt. These bones are creaking and I hurt. And god, this thought, "Just end it already", is honestly more annoying than anything, like a fucking mosquito buzzing forever in my ear. 

At this point it is mainly suicidal ideation; I am not quite at the point where I am calmly and seriously making plans to kill myself. Not yet at the point where people actually kill themselves. That's why I am posting here. I am afraid I will get to that point very soon. I am afraid, and yet I just want it to reach that point already so that I can be done with it. I can't take this and I don't want to take this, and I am this close to REFUSING to take this. I am tired of this soul torture. 

I am so sorry for everyone suffering. I am so so sorry. My heart breaks over and over for you and for this world and for this fucking mess that my life and my head is. It doesn't make it betger but i hope you all find peace in some way. I hope we all do. I dont know what else to say or do.
