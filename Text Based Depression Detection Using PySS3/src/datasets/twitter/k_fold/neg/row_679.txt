Thinking about it againYou have to be really desperate to want to go through a second suicide attempt. I tried once about 15 years ago. I spent 16 days in the ICU. I came out of it mostly unscathed.

But after years of trying to take my life back and move on I've found that I can't stand my family and I don't think I like myself anymore. I just want to go to sleep. I'm alone all day. I was thinking car and carbon monoxide.
