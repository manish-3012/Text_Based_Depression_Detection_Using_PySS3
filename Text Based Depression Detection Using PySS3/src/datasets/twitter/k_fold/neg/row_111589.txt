I can't do this anymoreI can't keep doing this anymore. I live my pitiful life feeling like I'm worthless and useless every second. I wish I wasn't, but as much as I hope and cry and try and practice and desperately try to feel useful. But it never works, and I always fail and feel more like a failure than before. I want to kill myself, so I can stop taking the world's resources from people who deserve it. No therapy could possibly help, and I just know it's true. There's no medicine to make me magically useful and I can't fool myself to believe it.

I'm tired of it. I just want to die, to fucking end my sad, sorry, worthless life from this existence. It would just be better for everyone if I were dead.
