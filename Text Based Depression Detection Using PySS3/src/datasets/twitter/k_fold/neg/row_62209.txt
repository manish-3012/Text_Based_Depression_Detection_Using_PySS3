I feel like I've hit rock bottom.About a week ago I felt great. Things really started to look up for me. I asked I girl I really like to prom and she said yes, spring break was close and I had some plans with some friends. These past couple days though I've just feel like shit. I've never felt this bad before. I've seriously started thinking of ways to just end it.
