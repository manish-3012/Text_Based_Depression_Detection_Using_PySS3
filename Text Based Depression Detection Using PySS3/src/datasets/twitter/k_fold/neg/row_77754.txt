no futurei fail everything, lost my friends, people hangout with me out of pitty. i have no hobbies, talents, i cant talk to people without having a panic attack. i fail school, going to a fucking community college. no plans after that. why am i even alive. i serve no purpose. im pretty sure no one has had feelings for me. there is no reason for me to be here. i just dont want my parents to be destroyed if i die. i wish i could dissapear.
