My parents failed meMy parents failed me completely. I had a treatable illness that they ignored, and it cognitively ruined my development. Research consensus shows that it can inhibit the IQ of untreated people by 20%. I'm a dumbass and struggle to get anything done. I'm riddled with intrusive thoughts and obsessions from my OCD. There's a bottle of cough syrup with opiates in it that I think I'm going to chug soon. Not sure why I'm writing this just wanted to get it out there
