Why am I here if I have experience everything everyone doesnâ€™t want?Do you ever hear time slow down?

My life has been a unexplainable amount of events. It almost feels as if every fear a woman has, I have experienced. 

It started with a highschool romance that failed. I was called a whore. 

To an engagement where I was abused. I was called a cheater.

To a positive pregnancy where I was with someone that was immature. I was called insecure. 

I look back at all these things. And honestly Iâ€™m not even a great writer. Why am I alive? Iâ€™ve experienced everything a women fears.
