I am basically a fraud and a moronSo I accidentally committed fraud yesterday.  I needed a signature on a document and without thinking I just borrowed it from a document that was basically the same and sent it up.  One of my coworkers noticed how fast I got everything back so I told her how I missed a signature and borrowed it.  She told me that it was fraud, we quickly contacted the other company and asked them to rescind the document.

Now I feel so guilty I actually want to kill myself.  Like I can't stop thinking about it, I'm not a dumb person, but acted like such an idiot just because I wanted to do my job more efficiently.  This could have consequences for my company or myself or possibly even the person who's signature I carelessly "borrowed."  I can't live with it.

I either want to kill myself or turn myself in.  But I'm scared if I turn myself in that my company could get in trouble.
