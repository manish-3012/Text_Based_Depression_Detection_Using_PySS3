Why are my thoughts so casual?Is there a reason why I can casually think/talk about me wanting to die? Like itâ€™s always there and it hurts less than it use to. Without being upset, I can say (what by bf calls horrible) things about myself and not feel anything. Before I would be emotional/in a bad mood while thinking about it. Have I finally accepted it? Is this normal? Why do I lack the courage to actually go through with it? Why can I say all this shit and feel this way, but be such a puss?
