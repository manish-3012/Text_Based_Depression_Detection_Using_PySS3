Now or Never?Iâ€™m 19 years old.

I was raised by my mother, my father was abusive to her and left before I was born. 
My mum only wants the best for me. But she had a very damaging upbringing (abusive parents) and I feel that affected her psychologically which I feel she ends up taking out on me most of the time. 

I have a lot of cousins of similar age, but Iâ€™m the one thatâ€™s ridiculed in the family. Treated like a piece of shit because Iâ€™m not good enough or because Iâ€™m â€˜too dumbâ€™. 

Iâ€™m in my first year of university and Iâ€™m finding it really hard. Iâ€™m constantly arguing with my mum most recently having to stay at a friends a month. This is affecting my grades and could affect my chance at getting a decent job. I genuinely think Iâ€™ve hated my mum since I was 7-8 years old. 

I would really like to kill myself and Iâ€™m not afraid to do it I just fear that if I killed myself Iâ€™d just be proving them right. Recently Iâ€™ve been taking modafinil â€˜smart drugâ€™ to help with my studies in large doses and it got me thinking about stuff like this.

Iâ€™m a bit lost as to what I should do tbh. I really do want to die but I feel like I should wait until Iâ€™ve completed university to weigh up all my possible options?
