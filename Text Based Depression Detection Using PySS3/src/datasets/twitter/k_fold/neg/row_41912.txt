Feeling like nothing will get betterSometimes I think that I just wasn't meant to live in this world and that I shouldn't have been born. I'm lonely and I feel like everyone's against me. I feel like I'm the only one who understands me. I feel like I'm the only one and that there's no one out there who can relate to what I'm going through. I feel like an alien to everybody. I feel like an outcast. I'll just have to be alone for the rest of my life cause it just seems like everyone's against me. So I'll just go live by myself somewhere and don't expect me to ever be there for you. Everyone just pisses me off. I'm just angry and depressed and sometimes I just want to die. Whatever I'll just be alone by myself. All I need is money to make me happy. Survival is all that matters because nothing else in this world matters but money and survival.
