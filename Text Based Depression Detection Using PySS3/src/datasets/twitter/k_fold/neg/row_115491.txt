I feel like a failure.I'm 18 I couldn't get in any college last year, tried again this year but chances look slim. I'm from India so I'm competing with a very large demographic. Father died last year and mom stays away from home due to work. Rationally thinking I don't want to die but there are brief moments when I almost climb up the roof ready to jump. Studies are piling up and it feels impossible to do something now.

I've been in my home for weeks now and I don't feel like going out, it all feels so meaningless.
