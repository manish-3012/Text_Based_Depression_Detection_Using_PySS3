25 Years Too LongI've been struggling with depression my entire life.  As long as I have memories, I've been extremely anxious and depressed.  I don't know what I'm hoping to accomplish by posting here, but I need to take action.  Literally every day for years, if not decades, I've been thinking about killing myself.  I've never had a plan outright, but it's there.  Every single day, usually at night, it's a reminder that every day is pain, and that there "is" an easy way out.  I've been to so many therapists I can't even count, same with psychs.  Been on 7 antidepressants, klonopin, adderall, been diagnosed everything under the sun and nothing can help me.  Normally I try to escape this through something stupid like video games, but for the last 2 months I've been physically incapable of having fun with them, period.  

I've become a recluse, I haven't seen my friends around me in a year probably.  I've tried calling the suicide hotline countless times also, and it just doesn't help me.  I can't trust any of these people.  I especially can't when I feel like I'm being talked to in a condescending tone by the people at the hotlines.  I just can't trust them, or any other mental health professional.  I'm starting to feel insanely frantic.  I've put myself under 72 hour psych evaluation before when things started feeling "this bad", it really turned for the worse. 

tl;dr - I really can't keep going on every single day wishing I want to die.  I can't bring myself to trust any mental health professionals whatsoever.  I can't trust myself to be self admitted.  I can't find help, I have no support network.  I seriously am on the verge of giving up, life has only gotten harder, and I can't keep carrying this weight on my shoulders.  It's been too long.
