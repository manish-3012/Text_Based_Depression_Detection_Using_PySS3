"I'll always be here for you" is the biggest lie i've ever head.I had back surgery which took away my job and many hobbies, my girl friend left me which took away my spirit and self esteem, i am now left a shell of a man who is trapped inside a dark room all day with no one to talk to or tell me its gonna get better. i reached out to everyone i used to talk to and everyone who said they would always be there for you, and not a single person came though. it may be selfish of me but im out of ideas, out of hope, out of everything. i daily have to take heavy doses of pain killers to keep going and heavy doses of sleeping medicine so i can pass out and have nightmares. im just tired of a life where i have no one to talk to, no one who cares, and yet i go to such lengths so i may be ready if one person decides to take a few mins  out of there day to say "get well" It may sound like im exaggerating but i really dont have anyone since i lost her, and i feel like ive been lost into the ether.
