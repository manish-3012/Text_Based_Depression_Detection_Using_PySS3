I feel like I'm a lost causeI only have fake friends who are never there for me and don't really give a shit about me as a person. My grades are horrible and I'll have to drop out pretty soon with no clue what to do after that. I have no talents of any means and can't commit to anything. The only thing I do all day is watching Netflix and surfing reddit/4chan which probably is the reason my self-esteem is next to zero.

Sometimes I think about just ending it all. Like I guess my parents would be sad and everything for a while but other than that nobody would really give a shit.
