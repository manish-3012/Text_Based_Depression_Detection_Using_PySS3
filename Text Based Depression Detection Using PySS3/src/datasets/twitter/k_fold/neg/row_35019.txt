I'm stupidI feel stupid because I tried once more to explain how I feel and what kind of burden is to live with a chronic illness and I got the least empathetic answer you could think of. I've basically been told to shut the fuck up. People will never understand, no matter how much I try. People always tell me to reach out for support, to give chances like I'm at a charity convention and I'm Bill Gates, the truth is they just won't listen or take advantage of the situation to put you down. 
I cannot recall a time in 4 long long months were people could actually help me. And I'm talking about profesionals, family. Not random people.

I also feel even more stupid because my boyfriend booked for a trip that I don't want to go because I planned to kill myself. Three long LONG days fake smiling and pretending and making plans that I know I will never do because I'm going to die soon. But if I told him no he would totally tell that there is something going on.
So i have to talk about june, summer, his birthday and stuff while I don't know if I'm going to live another week. But I cannot tell him my plan or he would tell my parents and I don't want to be hospitalised, so I have to fake it and I feel like I'm betraying him.

I just want to sleep forever. I'm not meant to be happy or have a good life or anything.
