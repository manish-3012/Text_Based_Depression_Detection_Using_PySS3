Girlfriend left me. Grandadâ€™s in hospital. Feeling bloody awfulIâ€™m 16. Iâ€™ve not had the best life so far, but Iâ€™m getting by (albeit struggling). I had a loving girlfriend who left me because she didnâ€™t want a close relationship and apparently me calling her pet names and telling her I loved her was too much. My grandad (who Iâ€™m probably close to more than anyone else in the world) is in hospital with heart and lung problems (doctors have said they can fix it, but Iâ€™m me. Iâ€™m gonna stress no matter what.) and on top of that Iâ€™m barely keeping up with my A level subjects (due to all this shit). This girl was the first person whoâ€™s genuinely shown me affection in years and she broke up with me earlier because I was too much and she doesnâ€™t like close relationships. Iâ€™m at a loss. 

I really donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve got no one I can really rely on and my plan for this weekend is to get super drunk and hope I donâ€™t wake up (I will, but thatâ€™s besides the point, you know?)
