NRN Old and OverSorry ahead of time, but this is going to be bitter, jaded, hateful. There is nothing of me to like. First of all, posting is a joke. There might be some comments, but they will fade away in two seconds. I tried creating pen pals, supportive ongoing communications with two people from here, thinking it'd be helpful for both, the first threw me away after a month and now this kid whom I have tried so hard to help for awhile now, just doesn't care anymore either. I am so throwaway, proven. All these other posts I read, I want to cry more. People think it's so bad because of a break up or job situation or family situation. Try being 57 and never managed to get married, never was successful ina  career, never lived outside the poverty line, just struggle every day, every year. Grow old alone. Believe it will get better"? H aha ha ha ha. Any minor support that comes from here will not last so is not real. What I wouldn't give to be the people who post on here because they are at such early starting points, things can change. Many complain about boyfriends and girlfriends and I'm thinking how lucky they are that they managed to have that in the first place. It's too late for me. I am serious about ending it soon. I have been hanging on by threads for so many years. There is no help that helps, no easing of pain, just gets worse. And the condition of the world scares me too, from ISIS to bedbugs to a million reasons to feel there is no security or joy for me to believe in. No love. I have EVERY reason to leave the planet, it doesn't love me nor I it. I am alone and I need to be gone physically as I already have been anyhow for years. I am all rotted up inside. And yes, every anti depressant medicine has been tried. It is hopeless.
