I am literally unwanted by anyone other than my parentsI feel like my parents are the only ones who give a fuck about me.  But even then, I'm not really close with them at all. 

I have almost no friends, my roommates and I aren't very close, in fact I hardly see any of them. 

No one ever texts me or messages me on facebook.  I can go through my day pretty easily without really talking to anyone. 

I have 0 dating experience, even though I'm 22 years old.  Women just don't give a fuck about me.  I'm on all the online dating sites.  I message everyone.  The black, white, mexican, asian women.  The oveweight ones, the skinny ones, the tall ones and the short ones.  I literally never get a response. 

I'm 6'4" and 190 pounds myself and yet women just don't give a fuck about me.  I've sent out so many goddamn messages and either they don't respond, or they send one response back and I never hear from them again.  

I mean, what the fuck?  There's this black girl that's like 6 foot that I messaged and she sent back a response so I responded to that and I haven't heard from her since, and that was like 4 days ago.  She's been online since then.  You'd think that a girl who's 6 foot would appreciate a guy who's taller than her at the very least right?  Or maybe she's just getting swamped with messages from tall guys /s.  It's bullshit. 

What the fuck is the point of life then?  No one wants me and I can't even get a response from a woman on fucking online dating sites.  I didn't know that women had so much selection that a guy like me is trash in their opinion.  

This world is fucking bullshit and I'm too tired to struggle anymore.
