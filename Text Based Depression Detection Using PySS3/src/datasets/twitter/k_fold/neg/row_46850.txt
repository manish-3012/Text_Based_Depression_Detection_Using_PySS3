My whole life I try to always be helpful and always put others first.Through my work I have $400k worth of life insurance (actually a little more than that) and learning that my 60-year-old dad is having financial troubles and not sure if he will be able to continue supporting everyone the way he does is really hurting me.  I Want to cry.  there is an easy way to get him the money and make it all better
