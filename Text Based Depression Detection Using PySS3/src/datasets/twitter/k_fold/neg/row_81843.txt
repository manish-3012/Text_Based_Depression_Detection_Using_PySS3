Going to end it after Christmas so I can tell my friends and family I love them one last time.There's no point going into how I got to this point. A lot of trauma, of foolish mistakes, mistreatment of my brain and body, unkindnesses that I can never take back. 

I've been living a fabrication. I've pretended for so long that I am not a slave to my impulses, that I've been in control, that I am grounded, disciplined. This is not the case. Substance abuse since I was 14 has lead to lying, deception, to chase dopamine like an uncatchable neighborhood dog. Prescription amphetamines in high school brought out the worst in me; turned me into a monsterous version of myself that I cannot shake. Being raised in a Catholic school instilled guilt that has never been shaken. I punish myself, day after day after day, for mistakes that I've either already made amends for or that most would simply move on from by now. Despite my sentience and self-awareness, I feel helpless as I watch myself sabotage my own future. 

Right now, work is the only reason I get out of bed; the rest is spent sleeping. I've been out to social events and cannot enjoy them as much as I used to. The last two months I've spent in desperation and wrapped in a feeling of impending doom. I've been relegated to basic functions; have not been able to take an endeavor into my creative side or pursuits that make me happy. I punish myself every time I shift my focus away from these feelings, try to escape, because escapism feels wrong in my mind. 

It is a horrible feeling, because I sincerely am a person who loves and regards others with a strong sense of empathy. Life is so beautiful, people have such potentiality if only they'd learn to love themselves. I regard my timeline as too late; that it is best if I remove myself, and leave the ones I love knowing that they are worthy of the self-love that society teaches them to deprive of themselves.
