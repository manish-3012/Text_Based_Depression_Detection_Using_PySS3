I can't stop thinking about killing myselfI've tried calling my boyfriend and my friends. No one has answered. This always happens. When I actually need people... That's when they're not there.

I've been feeling like this since about 9pm last night (it's currently 1.58pm AEDT the next day). I've tried to ignore it. I smoked weed last night so I could feel okay for a little while, it worked until it wore off and I unfortunately had no more. Then I got really worked up and stressed and couldn't stop thinking about suicide. I settled for cutting myself to avoid killing myself instead. I promised myself I'd only do superficial cuts, which I did. I didn't go too deep.

I'm trying to think rationally, logically, trying to stay calm and ignore the thoughts but it's getting difficult. Even my most rational thoughts are insane (cutting myself wtf? I haven't done this in 3 years). All I want to do is talk to someone I am comfortable with but none of them are contactable. I tried calling hotlines and things like that but as soon as someone answered I panicked and hung up.

I'm really struggling I don't know what to do.
