Well, I'll be leaving now.I'm a disgrace to my family. I'm a selfish asshole. I have no goals, and even if I did I don't have a plan on how to reach them. My mother has grown to hate me, and my father simply doesn't care anymore. They would be better off without me, and I'd be better off without anyone.

Let's just hope that a belt will work as opposed to a rope of some sort.
