the reason why im suicidali want to die because my mother took me off health insurance to try to control me, so i havnt been able to get help for anything in almost 2 years now and its taking a severe toll on not only on my mental health, but physical. for the past couple months ive felt like ive been dying. 
but the main reason i want to die is because of how fucked up people are, i dont want to deal with these people. this world is so fucked up its literally pre-hell (if you look up "how to survive in hell" by creepypasta its SCARY how similar this life is)
