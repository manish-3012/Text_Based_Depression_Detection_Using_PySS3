I lost everything in span of a month.Hey guys, 

umm...so I'm pretty shook up right now. 

Last month the woman who I thought I will marry left me five years into our relationship. 

I sort of dealt with it and did my best to move on...got my own place and started to rebuild my life. 

Today I was let go from work. This has been a massive kick to the chest for me. 

I'm in shock right now and the two events are kind of piling up on top of each other. 

My home and professional lives have been destroyed. I don't know what to do. 

I feel like I'm in a fog right now..I'm...lost. I just don't know what to do.
