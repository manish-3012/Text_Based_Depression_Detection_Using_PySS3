I'm not going to kill myself tonight......but I wish I was.  At least tonight I do.  A friend told me tonight they don't want to talk to me anymore because I'm too depressing. Another told me they were too busy canning to talk.  Canning?  Girl, how the FUCK is that preferable to going out to a bar with me?

I got my masters a few months ago but still haven't found a job.  A MA in math, in silicon valley, you'd think jobs would be fucking everywhere.  They aren't.  I got a job tutoring as a stopgap.  It's not what I want.  But it keeps me in a room and booze (/r/cripplingalcoholism shoutout!).  Parents let me into their HOMES to teach their TEENAGERS to pass the sat.  And they don't pick up on the fact that I drove there drunk as fuck.

Honestly, I come here sometime and I see a post from a 16 year old, and I can't help but think, "You fucking dumbass.  The next decade can hold such wonders for you, but oh? You broke up with your first ever love?  How tragic, nobody has EVER been through that!"  What an asshole I am.  At 26, I imagine everybody in their mid-thirties is thinking a similar thing about me.  I don't care.  I want to be done.  I want to be over.

I want somebody to switch me off, open up my skull, and fix me.
