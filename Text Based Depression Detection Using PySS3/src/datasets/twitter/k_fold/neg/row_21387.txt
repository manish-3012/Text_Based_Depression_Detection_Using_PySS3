I want to do itI'm 19 second year in college and sadly on academic probation subject to disqualification. 

I parents don't know I did bad in school. They've paid so much out of pocket for me and I know I can do so much better. This semester was supposed to be the make up for me but that went to shit.

If I never fucking secretly pledged this one fraternity then I would've been golden. I wouldn't have to deal with the stress of not knowing if I pulled up in a class to just keep on going to this university.

If it comes to that point where I am disqualified from school, I wouldn't know what to do what to say to my parents. 

I want to die. I want to end the shame I had brought upon myself.
