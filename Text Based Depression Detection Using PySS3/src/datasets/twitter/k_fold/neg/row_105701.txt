Please helpI've posted here before on a different account probably about 20+ times, for reference on having reached out in the past. Still not better.

I have night terrors every single night that I wake up from crying and panicking. I have clinically diagnosed anxiety and depression and I take celexa and see a therapist regularly to combat these things. I cannot think of a single moment that has passed by in the past 6 years where I've not been constantly anxious, even post-meds.

A constant grasping sensation in my heart. Always breaking out in hives. Scared all the time of even the sheer thought of going anywhere alone. Breaking down and crying for hours in the shower wondering why I'm this way. A lot more I can't even sum up with enough brevity to hold the interest of someone to the end of a whiny "I'm suicidal look at me please" post.

I've been cheated on in every relationship I've been in. I am a handsome man and I am a very sweet, caring person in relationships. But it's never enough. I'm never enough for anyone. Not even for myself.

Ranting on here used to sort of take a load off my chest. Now honestly I kind of just want to go end it. I'm so fucking sick of these nightmares. So sick of this anxiety. Nothing will ever be better.
