Today I snapped...I don't know what came over me...

In class, they asked one member per group to talk about a topic, and I did, and when people started to clap I said: "Please, please, stop clapping".

I got pissed off when they did that even before I said anything...

Then after I got out of class an old classmate talked to me... She was talking to me as if I were a kid... 

I did my best to remain calm and be polite to her, but I guess in the end she knew I was uncomforable...

Goddammit... I hate when everyone treat me as if I were disabled or a snowflake...

I almost cried after she left... 

I hate being treated like that, I hate when people just give me false hope, I hate that feeling so much...

That really hurt me...
