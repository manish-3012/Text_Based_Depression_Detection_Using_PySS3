Why canâ€™t we talk about God?I was depressed, suicidal and heard the most horrendous voices of hatred against myself for a long period of my life. The only thing that fundamentally changed that was knowing and experiencing the love that Jesus had for me despite the things I didnâ€™t like about myself.

It seems a bit counter intuitive that weâ€™re not allowed to post hope found in God without it being labeled â€œproselytizingâ€.
