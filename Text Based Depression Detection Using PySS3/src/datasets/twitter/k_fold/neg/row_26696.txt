A reset or deathEither would be a better state than the one my brain is in at the moment. 
I have overdosed countless times in the past. And whilst the desired outcome obviously hasn't been achieved, it has succeeded in resetting my brain back to a point where the question 'why don't you just kill youself' isn't asked every 10 minutes every day. 

After years of being fairly stable my brain broke again this time last year. Since then I've tried everything to stop it getting to this point again. I've been on 7 different anti-depressants /anti-psychotics in that time and now just started my 8th. The majority have given me crippling pain as a side effect and the only one that didn't made my mental health worse. 
Now been started on an MAOI as a last resort. It comes with a long list of foods and meds I can't take with it. 

I've been seeing the psychiatrist on a regular basis and even recently had an inpatient stay to help keep me safe from myself. 

But none of it works. None of it helps. 
And realistically even if these meds do work and I'm stable again it's only going to be a matter of time before this all happens again and I fuck things up for everyone around me. 

So the question in my brain has stopped being why don't you just kill yourself and has instead changed to when. 
When the kid is at school?
Should I go abroad so there is no one to try and stop it?
Shall I just head to the beach one night and not come back?
I figure the best outcome would obviously be not having to wake up again. 
As a second best, if it doesn't work then hopefully it will reset my brain.
If not I can just try again. 
This world is shit. 
There is no actual reason for any of us to live. We would all be better off dead. 

Congrats if you got this far anyway. Needed to tell someone my thoughts.
