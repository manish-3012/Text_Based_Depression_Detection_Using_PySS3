convince me not to finish thisIâ€™ve done the research and read the papers and determined that ingesting 40 panadol tablets will kill me based on my body weight. I am about to go to four chemists around me and purchase all these. 

why shouldnâ€™t I do this? what reason do I have to keep living? I have lost all my friends and they all hate me and have better lives without me evidenced by the fact that me disappearing for a week literally did not impact them nor did any of them try to contact me or even ask me where I was when I saw them briefly at my university 

I have nothing to live for because I canâ€™t have the life I want and thatâ€™s pretty shitty. donâ€™t get me wrong i know others probably have it a fuckton worse but i donâ€™t care anymore i canâ€™t go out and do things i want like go out with friends at night due to the now lack of friends but also the gigantic amount of pain i have being seen i have flaked on my best friend well now ex best friend so many times because i canâ€™t show my face at her events since I feel ugly and disgusting since Iâ€™m a degenerate tranny xDDD and hormones are slow and arenâ€™t working so yeet what a great time


I will not have any memorable experiences, iâ€™ve lost my teens due to depression and dysphoria and now iâ€™m losing my late teens and twenties to the fact I cant fix my body and canâ€™t fix my friendships

i deserve to die because i am a drain on this world and a cancer on the people around me 

what the fuck is there left to live for
