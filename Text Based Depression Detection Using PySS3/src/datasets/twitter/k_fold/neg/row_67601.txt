Planning to die tomorrow.. Even quarantine makes family bonds worseI as a person want to be happy because of my experiences even tho i am in very tragic situations, i always move on to  problem and be happy. My family is one main reason why I want to die. I think not only i will relate to this but i trust my friends mlre than my family. Heck and my family embarrasses me because of that and was triggered.. Are they stupid maybe? They cannot think if they could lower their pride i would respect them. Dont get me started on them cutting me of if i try to open up, they even higher their voice (my neighbors can hear it). Im doing good in school, even on my paintings and drawings but never once i see them appreciate it... I was never happy here..

Tomorrow i will plant my death at 4:00 est. My problems are too much. This is my last message to you, reading this. I love you! And be happy not because you live only once. But be happy because to enjoy life c:
