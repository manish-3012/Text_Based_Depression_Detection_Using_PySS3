Life is nothing but pain.Pain.

Overbearing and overwhelming

Saddness

Not an emotion but a state of being.

Help

Weak words with no meaning

Pleading

Gods, deities, and, powers...

Empty

I am what this is.

Suicide.

Why else are you here? 

I have chronic pain. It is a level 8 or 9 on the average. It doesn't go away. Everything in my life doesn't work. Body, car, uni rejected me, I am stuck in the closet, depression that resists treatment, eye pain that is slowly making it so I can't see. Medical bills that are ruining my life. I can't afford to live anymore. I am sorry. I am a failure.. I fucking hate living. I just want to cry and kill myself now.
