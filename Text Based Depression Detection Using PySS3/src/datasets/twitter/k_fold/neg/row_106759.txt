How long does it take to pass out after self-hanging?I've already got the rope, and I've been doing some research. Some sources say it can take about 10-20 seconds, others up to 30 seconds. Also I want to die by asphyxiation, so I can suffer the pain I put on others. So I'm not drop hanging.

From your knowledge, how long can it take to lose consciousness during the hanging suicide?
