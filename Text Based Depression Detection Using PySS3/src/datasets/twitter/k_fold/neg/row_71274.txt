NO.I have fucking had it with school. I talked to a counselor about my anxiety. I studied my ass off 24/7 a week before exams started and what do I get for studying? A fucking 70% while the average is 75%? You said it yourself I was a good student. Fuck you.

I talk to a counselor and I posted in r/depression. I can't do this. I can go days without eating cuz I never feel hungry anymore. I just wake up thinking about killing myself and ending all this bullshit. But you know what? NO. I'm going to fucking chop your fat, hoarding head off and throw it at the fucking dean bitch. I study and teachers act like they care about your issues. NO. They fail you even though you bust your balls studying. Well you know what? I'll give you a taste motherfuckers. I still have 2 exams tomorrow and I have lost all motivation to do well. I was able to still hope that I'd get decent grades and I kept studying. Now I just don't know anymore. Fuck this planet. All I want is to fall asleep and never wake up.
