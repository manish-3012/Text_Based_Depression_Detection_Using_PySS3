She saved me... But now shes gone too...

M23I was going through a rough patch and decided to end my life. One person on this subforum talked me out of it. She helped me so much. I found out that shes been through hell herself and has incurable diseases. She was going to die young. still she was so strong and i even got to meet her in person. we hung out a couple times and i was glad for a bit. But i kept worrying and going  back to my depression even though i was on medication and other things. She tried to help me and we got in an argument a few times. Now... she texts me "I'm leaving, please don't text me anymore" and I dont know what to do or say... I dont know if shes trying to protect me from her deteriorating health or if she is mad at me for giving up. Or maybe I'm just making it hard for her.... I honestly dont know... so now... I feel... like I let her down. I let everyone down. My family tells me they are sick of me. my friends the same... I had her to help me but now shes done with me too... so now i just feel completely and utterly alone... and empty. Im at my house now contemplating suicide again... and no one is around to stop me this time... If anything I wanted to post here to say thank you to this forum for prolonging my life a bit longer. and thank you to her for being there for me... I hope she will be ok... So now... I am done. All the bills, the family, the stress, work, friends, exes. financial problems... im just done...
