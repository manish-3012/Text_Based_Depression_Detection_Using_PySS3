My younger brother is suicidal and i dont know what to do.After reading the posts in this sub i also feel like i've made every mistake possible - not taking it seriously, proposing solutions, some 'tough love' etc.

I'm just lost. I'm not good with such things. Doesn't help that hes avoiding talking about it seriously and refusing my help, and i can't interact with him unless he actively wants to (i'm living alone and he's still living with our parents in another city so the only way to talk is over the phone/internet).

He's actually been talking about it a lot lately, often in a jokingly manner - in a casual conversation he can just say something like "huh, glad it won't concern me after i walk outta the window, now its your problem". I really didn't think it was serious, since he's always been the whining kid (he's 21 now, and i'm 24 btw), but the stuff from this sub's posts checks out, and i think he's been depressed for some time, which already has resulted in some unhealthy behaviour (namely, he's got health/weight problems because of overeating).

I dont know how i can help. I've tried to drive home the point that i'll support him whatever he does and all that (he's been going through some problems lately, likely will drop out of college), but im not sure that really helped. He refuses any help or pep-talk (just tells everyone to leave him alone) and also refused to go see a professional about it when i flat-out proposed to take him and pay for it (he has no source of income). Any advice?
