HelpI don't know how my parents can stand to look at me. I don't know why they haven't kicked me out already. They should. I'm just a piece of shit. I've ruined their lives and they'd be better off without me. 

I haven't felt like this in such a long time. I'm scared. I don't wanna do anything stupid but...I brought this on myself. It's all my fault. I'm no good for anyone. I'm a disappointment and a disgrace. Someone help me.
