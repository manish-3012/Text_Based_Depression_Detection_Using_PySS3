I can't wait to end this pitiful and pathetic existenceIt doesn't help that our civilization/society is falling apart due to the adverse effects of climate change. It's only a matter of time before mother nature wipes out the pathetic blimp that is humanity. Why the fuck should I even bother with this existence if we're all gonna die from climate change in a few years anyway?

It doesn't help that I am genetic low IQ trash. I can't solve basic puzzles and numeric problems beyond a middle school level. I have nervous breakdowns and anxiety attacks before stepping foot outside my house. I am afraid of other people and can be described as a cynical asshole with a vehement hatred of mankind and humanity.

Why should I want to live in a world where innocent people are viciously killed everyday? Why should I live in a world where the only thing guaranteed is suffering?
