Iâ€™m seventeen and I donâ€™t want to be hereIâ€™ve been suicidal as young as 13. 

Iâ€™ve gone through all of it, all sorts of counselling I can name ten just off the top of my head.

And it was all cantered around â€œcognitive behavioural therapyâ€. 

And finally Iâ€™m on PTSD therapy but Iâ€™ve made zero progress in the four months that Iâ€™ve been there and every time I walk in I leave feeling like shit.
 We canâ€™t even do the actual therapy part because we need to build trust and Iâ€™m in quotes â€œnowhere near where I need to be to be sent into what Iâ€™m trying to send you intoâ€. My therapist claims if she tries to recall trauma to me I wonâ€™t be able to come out of the hole sheâ€™ll send me to.

She told me how it may take years for me to trust her and reconnect with my emotions. And at one point I cut off my emotions and disconnected so I could survive but now I need them back and. I canâ€™t get them back.

Todayâ€™s been so bad, I want to kill myself and this year Iâ€™ve had 2 near attempts. But I canâ€™t find a good way to kill myself. 

Iâ€™m only seventeen and. I donâ€™t know what I ever did wrong to deserve the pain Iâ€™m going through. Iâ€™ve missed out chunks of my life feeling like
Shit. 

I canâ€™t wait any more years to get
Better. Iâ€™ve Done everything , Iâ€™ve followed every technique done good thinks, exercised ate well and gone to therapy and woken up every morning and gotten out of bed and nothing goes right. 

I canâ€™t do it anymore
