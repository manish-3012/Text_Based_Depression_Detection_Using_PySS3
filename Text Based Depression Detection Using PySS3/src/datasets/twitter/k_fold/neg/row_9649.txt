I should just get it over with alreadyIâ€™m this point where everyone is sick of me and no one will help. I saw my psychiatrist and explained Iâ€™ve been having breakdowns, panic attacks, and thoughts of suicide but when I met with her, I was in a upper mood. She told me I seemed fine and I would get over it. I went to my primary doctor but they didnâ€™t feel comfortable with making changes but they did make me sign a anti-suicide agreement. Like thatâ€™s really gonna stop me. My doctor referred me to a mental health facility to have a medication evaluation. I spent hours there only for them to tell me they canâ€™t see me for another four weeks. 

Iâ€™ve struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life. I feel like Iâ€™m meant to kill myself. Itâ€™s bound to happen some time, I might as well get a jumpstart on the process. 

I feel utterly hopeless. Everything is a constant reminder of what a failure I am. Iâ€™m always missing work or am behind because of how I feel. I canâ€™t share anything with anyone because the moment I did at my last job, everyone alienated me. Even though my bossâ€™s son committed suicide. My husband has a high stress job and struggles as well (now and in the past). His work offers confidential mental health support, which he has taken advantage of but somehow, everyone knows about his mental health and now heâ€™s being alienated. Heâ€™s fallen back into cutting himself. Seeing his marks just makes me want to end it more. I wouldnâ€™t be such a burden to him if I was gone. He could focus on getting better without having to be weighted down by my baggage. 

My father had a addiction to prescription painkillers.  Now I totally get why - easy to get a hold of and a great means of getting out of your head. 

Iâ€™m trying so hard not to do it. I try to think of my husband, our two dogs and two cats and how they wouldnâ€™t understand but Iâ€™m at my wits end.
