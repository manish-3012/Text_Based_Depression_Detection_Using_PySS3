HopeI don't know what to do anymore my anxiety is so bad I can barely even leave the house the intrusive thoughts are getting worse and I'm just thinking it's a waste of fucking time to be in this shitty world when nobody in it even matters when we all get replaced in time and life just keeps on going. The only thing promised is death nothing else. There's no such thing as living life to the fullest when the odds are stacked against you.
