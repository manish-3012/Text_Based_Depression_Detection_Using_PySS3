I need help/Can't understand myselfHi, this is my first post on reddit, so please tell me if I'm doing anything wrong. Anyways...

I just don't understand what's going on with me. I've been depressed for a little longer than a year, but I don't know why it suddenly started. Therapists always try to blame it on a death in the family or a big event, but nope, nothing like that.

I'm so empty every day, I keep pushing forward for nothing. Everybody tells me I don't deserve to feel this bad because I have a good life. I know it's true but I can't help it. The world would be better without me, I'm selfish and all I do is worry people.

I'm only 13 and I know that I shouldn't be like this. I want to die so badly. I feel so empty at school every day. I have nobody and I feel so lonely. Everybody expects me to be this tough kid but I'm not. I have no self esteem and I hate everything about me.

I've tried committing suicide 4 times already, but I'm still here. I'm not a religious person, but I'm worried that I'm going to hell when I finally die. Isn't it unforgivable to kill yourself?

I feel like I'm going insane. I can't control my feelings or my actions, and therapy isn't helping. I want to die more than anything but It's so hard. I'm almost positive I'll take my life on day and it's scary...

Does anybody else feel like they can't control themselves?
