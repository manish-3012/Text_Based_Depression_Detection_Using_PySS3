More than a year of thatI'm alone. Mom died. I don't have family. I have a husband, but my depression makes him depressed too. I can't go outside, can't talk to people, can't even use social media because of constant fears. I've been suicidal since middle school. Idk. I'm bored, tired, helpless, worthless, I don't like my personality, face, body and all shit I've done. I got my degree recently, so what do I do? I don't have a mind, my opinions are not mine, I'm crying and shivering with fear every day. I can't go to sleep, because I will see mom and her cancer again. Thanks for reading. I'm afraid of you and hate you.
