New year, might be my lastHi, throwaway for obvious reasons. I've been depressed and suicidal for a long time now. About 8 years, right when I hit puberty is when I started feeling this way. Between my parents divorcing, bullying at school, never finding a girlfriend, etc.

I spent a lot of my teen years playing RuneScape and Japanese RPGs to escape from the real world, watching anime, and it's basically all just backfired on me. I'm 20, living from family member to family member, just to be dumped onto the next one because no one wants to deal with me.

I lived with my grandpa for about 3 years, where I got severely depressed, and basically played games 16 hours a day, and slept the rest. I gained a lot of weight and my hygiene went out the window. My gramps was too kind to kick me out, but the rest of my family got together and kicked me out for him, and that's when I went to a training school where I lived in on-site dorms.

I just completed the training school program where I got a certification for a national pharmacy technician, but now that I'm with my aunt and uncle I'm finding it hard to find work, and my uncle is getting pissed off at me. He's threatened to kick me out and I've only been here a week...

Anyway, that's the current situation. I've made several suicide attempts in the past but I always seem to chicken out. I've never been religious, so death is basically it for me. I don't see my life ever improving, and I go through phases of depression to just seeing everything as a way to kill myself. My latest fascination is train tracks.

Also, no one I know understands what I'm going through and just say I need to get laid or make friends. I can't afford therapy and tbh friends have never made me happy they've just distracted me.

Am I a waste of space? There's lots to do in life but I don't think I have the support or motivation to do anything anymore. Sorry if I did this wrong but I don't want to call numbers and I have nowhere else to go.
