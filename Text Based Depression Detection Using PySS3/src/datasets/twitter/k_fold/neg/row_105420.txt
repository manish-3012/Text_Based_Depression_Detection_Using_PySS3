I canâ€™t do it much longer.It sounds stupid, I know. Iâ€™m only sixteen and my life is in pieces. I have never had something go right in my life. Never. I was born with a genetic condition and spent most of my childhood in the hospital. I failed middle school and a lot of high school. I have PTSD from my multiple surgeries and months upon months spend rotting away in a hospital bed.  I have a terrible family, with a verbally abusive, narcissistic, over the top religious father and seven siblings. We canâ€™t afford anything more than thrift stores and no vacations or nice food since my dad wastes all his money on Christian school. I have no real friends. Nobody has contacted me in months or responded to me. I have so many medical problems that nobody who hears my story believes me. They range from endometriosis to Ehlers Danlos syndrome to circulatory disorders. No college is going to want me as Iâ€™ve never had the opportunity for extracurriculars since Iâ€™m too busy parenting my siblings because my parents donâ€™t want to. Next to that, my grades suck. I applied for so many programs and scholarships and internships and have been rejected by all of them. I have no interests and no idea what to do with my life. Now this. I canâ€™t even leave the house with the virus. It is so painfully depressing and the only help I get from my parents is to â€œnot give myself up to satanâ€. I am so lonely. It hurts so bad. I just want someone who loves me and to be in a place where I have the freedom to be happy. I wonâ€™t have either of those for at least three years, as my parents are basically coercing me into attending community college and living at home when I graduate so I can keep doing the bullshit they want me to. I want to move across the country, as far as I can get away, but I donâ€™t know if I can make it to the point where I have the opportunity to leave. I canâ€™t hold on much longer. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m typing this here. Nobody will listen to it. I just want someone to talk to. That you for listening to me.
