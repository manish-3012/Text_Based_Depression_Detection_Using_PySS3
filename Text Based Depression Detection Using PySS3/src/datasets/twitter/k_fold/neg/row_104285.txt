I haven't cried in years.Ive never been very emotional or a cry-ey person, but the past few months I've really wanted to but i just cant. Its like when you have to vomit really badly, and you know that when you finally do it you'll feel relief, but it just gurgles in your stomach forever. But instead of in your stomach its mostly mental. Idk Ive never really posted or looked through any depression subreddits before even though i do take depression meds. Hope this was the right subreddit to post this to. Whoever reads this have a nice day.
