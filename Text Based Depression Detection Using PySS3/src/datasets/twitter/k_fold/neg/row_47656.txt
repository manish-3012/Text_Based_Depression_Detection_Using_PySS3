Husbandâ€™s Suicide AttemptLast night my husband swallowed nearly a whole bottle of Advil. I watched him do it. I told him immediately after that we need to go to ER, now. He refused. I finally thought I convinced him after saying I would have to call an ambulance, I wasnâ€™t going to let him die. He went outside before me and started walking fast up the street. I called 911 and followed him (my 5yo daughter awake and with me too through this all). The ambulance took him. He is currently stable in the hospital but they are keeping him. He wonâ€™t talk to me. He is blaming me. It hurts like hell right now.
