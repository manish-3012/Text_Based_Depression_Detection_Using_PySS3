I've had so many great experiences in the past year, but still I go through days where I feel like I should hike into the backcountry and end it allI don't know what else to say. I feel stuck. I feel like I contribute nothing to the world and just consume and destroy, and I feel like anything I do (exercise, hiking, nights with friends, reading, studying) just masks the feeling temporarily and does not provide any solutions.
