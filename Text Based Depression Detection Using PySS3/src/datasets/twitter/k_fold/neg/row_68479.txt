I have no friends (I think) and I drink everyday to improve my condition. But it doesn't workHello,

I would never post on reddit regarding this, 

but I need some actionable advice on how to solve this.

Alcohol doesn't work anymore, even though it used to work before.

I got to a doctor and I got prescribed a sleeping aid (mirtrazapine), because one of my main issues is sleeping. But I think my main problem is being depressed.

What can I do, right now (or tomorrow?) I feel like I need to do something now.
