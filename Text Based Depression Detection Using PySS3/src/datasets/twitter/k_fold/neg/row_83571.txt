TiredMy partner is trying his best to make me feel better. I took too long to fill something out for school and now I owe money and I can't blame anyone but me and I just.. I genuinely think I can't get a job I don't think I could handle it I'm scared to leave the house.. and so I'm unemployed and not in school and my family is also unemployed and I was the good one who was suppose to go somewhere and here I am high like the other seven, selling nudes because it's easy, and nothing to me. My only good quality is I have attractive features but I'm not charasmatic enough to use it or able to think right or anything. Everything went to shit and I want to give up but I think it would kill my partner because he tries to take care my dumb bipolar suicidal self... I just sit in my room all day alone, day after day. I'm tired I'm lonely I'm just trying to find a good way to do it so it doesn't go wrong. I wish I could go back to normal
