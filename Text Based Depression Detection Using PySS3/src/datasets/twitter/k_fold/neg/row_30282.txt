For you.We all try and outrun our own shadows but it's not a race you win, it's one you endure for as long as you can before you're consumed. You've all done well to get this far. Nobody could have understood, even though you spent your life trying to explain it. 
I pray for help in everyone moving on whilst wishing the pieces of my heavy heart I've so readily given may stay their feet.

It won't happen.

Life goes on. Friends become strangers again, Compassion and Kindness are wanted, liars are celebrated, the bounty is never claimed and the truth dies quietly in the confusion. 

I'm so sorry you were used. I'm so sorry you were lied to. I'm so sorry you had to live with them. I'm so sorry you had to live without them. Whatever brought you here to this land of the lost I'm glad I found you, if just to say goodbye. So here I am for you. Are you there for me?
