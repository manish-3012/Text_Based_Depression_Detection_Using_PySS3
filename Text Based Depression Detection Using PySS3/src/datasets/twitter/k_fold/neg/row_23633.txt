Girlfriend disappearedI don't know if this is breaks the rules or not but I really need some advice. My girlfriend who I currently can only contact online disappeared four days ago after sending me texts about how much pain she was in and how much she no longer wanted to be alive. I woke up about an hour after she sent those messages and there was no response when I replied. I do not have her phone number and none of her other friends have been able to contact her. I have researched online for the obituaries of her home town and suicides in her area and I haven't found anything relevant but I am still very concerned that she might've hurt herself very badly. She is one of the only reasons that I no longer want to commit suicide and if something terrible has happened to her I will probably take my own life too. I don't know what to do from here other than continue to wait for a message... someone please help me.
