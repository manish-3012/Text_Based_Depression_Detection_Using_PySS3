I feel so completely alone.I take my meds every day. I shouldn't feel this way, but every day I wake up feeling like I'm fighting a losing battle. I wish I had the courage to die, because the constant stream of negative thoughts never ends. I'm never going to be good enough for myself, no matter how hard I try. At the end of the day, I'm still me. But even more than that I wish I had someone who listens, really listens instead of spouting off reasons why I should be thankful to be alive. I know I should, but I'm just not.

I wish I had someone to talk to.
