I almost did it. Itâ€™s luck that I didnâ€™t die.I shut my phone off. Wrote my note and went to a local park with extremely windy roads. It snowed last night so the roads were icy. It was dark. I drove 70mph in a 30 zone hoping Iâ€™d slide off the road and itâ€™d look accidental. Like I was just an idiot driver. My wheels never lost their traction though. So, Iâ€™m still here. Now Iâ€™m home. I want to go back out. Iâ€™m so tired of living my life the way I feel. I know if I wanted to I couldâ€™ve just let my car go off the road but I didnâ€™t want to be the one who did it.
