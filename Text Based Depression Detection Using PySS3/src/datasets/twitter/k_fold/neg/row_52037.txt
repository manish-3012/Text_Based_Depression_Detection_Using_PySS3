How do I kill myself by carbonmonoxide.Read just the bottom if you want.

(My english isn't great) I'm not gonna rant about how or why I feel bad or anything. And I don't want you to try and talk me out of it or anything. Just want straight answers. 

What I know about carbonmonoxide poisoning so far. It's an easy and painless way to die.
What you need to do is be in a room where no air can escape (or atleaset as low as possible) and release CO (carbonmonoxide).

However I don't really know what CO is or how I get access to it. One way is to buy a tank but that's to complicated and not an opption.

Does anyone know how to make carbonmonoxide yourself easy at home.
