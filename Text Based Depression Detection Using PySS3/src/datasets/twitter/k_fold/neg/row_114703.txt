In a few days I'll be gone forever, and that's okay. Because now I feel free.Hello, this is my first and last account. I'm a 27 yo male, live in a small town somewhere in europe. I have been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember. Grew up with my mom who is an alcoholic. I've been bullied during my  childhood for more than 10 years due to not being white (I am half black half white). By just about everybody, even teachers made some nasty comments in front of the whole class. I've been held down by several guys and peed on in the school shower after gymnastics. They often beat me up, and sometimes even filmed it for youtube. 

Because of this I wasn't able to complete my studies. I became  very aggressive and defensive towards others because I never wanted to be in the position I was in my younger years. I've lied alot, because I'm very afraid to not be accepted for who I am. And if I lie about things I feel like there's a greater chance to be accepted. I've been using various drugs in an attempt to selfmedicate to cope with some of the extreme anxiety I have. I have felt subhuman, disgusting and useless since age 7 when I first started school. At that age I used to scrub my skin with brushes in a desperate attempt to look like everybody else. I was so tired of being called a n***er everyday and that I was ugly because of that. 

Now I don't feel anything anymore, and it has been almost 10 years since I got kicked out of school because I just stopped going there. Now I'm just sitting in my apartment doing nothing at all living on welfare. I've been thinking about suicide for many years now but I always postponed it. Hoping it would get better. I met my girlfriend 2 years ago on tinder who ended up cheating on me 4 times. Yes I was stupid and took her back 4 times because I was in love with her. She left me shortly after I took her back for the 4th time. That was 6 months ago. And I am still thinking about her everyday.

Sometimes I imagine my own funeral and that all the people that treated me really shitty would maybe feel bad about what they did. And I have to say that it feels worth it in a weird way that I can't really explain. I also had fantasies about killing all of the bullies. Very very dark thoughts that I am not proud of. And I used to plan it all out in my head over and over again.

I guess I made this post because I've never really shared my story with anyone before. And I wanted to share this with someone before I go. Thank you for reading :)
