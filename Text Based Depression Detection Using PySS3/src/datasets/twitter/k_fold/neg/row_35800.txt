I like Neon Genesis Evangelion :)So, I decided to do it finally. Year ago I cut my arm and got to mental hospital, I didn't have courage in myself to finish it, so it wasn't really a suicide attempt. Mostly because I was scared to make my parents sad. But now for some reason I stopped caring. This time I'm going to leave it hanging, if you know what I mean :).
Sorry, I don't have a story behind me, just don't have motivation to do anything, so I decided to stop being disappointment to everyone around me and especially to myself.
Tomorrow I will visit my psychiatrist, and this will be my last visit. I don't know, for the last year I was talking to a lot of mental health experts and was taking antidepressants, but it didn't really worked out for me. 
I'm kinda tired and tonight I'll rewatch Neon Genesis Evangelion (really cool, if you're into anime and still somehow didn't watch it, totally do it).
Not sure why I decided to post it here, maybe just wanted to do something suicidish.
My hands are shaking right now and English is not my native language, so sorry for mistakes and bad narrative.
It was nice reading this subreddit though.
