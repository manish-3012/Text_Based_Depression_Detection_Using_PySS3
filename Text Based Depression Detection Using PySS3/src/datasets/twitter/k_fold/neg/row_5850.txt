It's so fucking unfair that I have to deal with the urges to jump off a building every day.To everyone else happiness is a normal feeling, whereas feeling down, angry, sad, frustrated, anxious are only temporary feelings. Why the fuck is happiness only ever temporary for me? I see people with smiles on their faces every day when the only thing going through my head is how I'm never going to be truly happy. Every good feeling in my life is false pleasure lasting maybe a day or two, only for life to slap me in the face leaving me suicidal for what? Weeks? Months? I just want to feel true happiness again. It's so hard living without it.
