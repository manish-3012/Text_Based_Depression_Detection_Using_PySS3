I don't want to die. I just want to be dead.If I was an animal, I'd have been put out of my misery already. I do not want to be here. I do not wish to be alive or to even exist. I wish I could be erased from history. I wish my mum had miscarried me instead of my older sister. I should never have been born.

All I've ever wanted is a fucking friend. Like, an actual friend, not some bullshit fucking do-gooder who is only "helping" me to boost his own self-serving ego. "Oh, it'll get better", fuck off, when? I've been waiting since I was 10 and if anything, my life is just getting worse and worse. I'm sick of hearing the same trite cliches - I know people are genuinely trying to help but it just makes me feel worse.

My death is well overdue. Somebody please put a bullet in my brain. I'm too much of a coward. I won't do it myself until my parents are gone, but it is a certainty after that. I just wish I could leave now and not have to put them through that pain.

A year ago, after I was hospitalised, I told myself I would kill myself a year from now if this didn't get better. It hasn't.

Sorry, I know I've probably posted this in the wrong place because I don't even know what I want to gain from this post. I didn't feel right posting in SS, either. I don't really belong anywhere.
