M15. BulliedI am suicidal, i managed to get a rope but I have no idea how to tie it. I tried the wikihow page on how to turn it into a noose but i failed because I'm a retard.

Everyday I go into school, it gets worse. I'm physically hurt by some and ostracized and verbally abused by everybody around me. I have one friend who I confide in but that's it, i dont usually reach out to him at all outside of school. It's Halloween and I haven't done Jack shit because i dont have any friends as I watch everybody else post on their story. I've sat here on my arse playing games for a week, and even that's boring. Everybody has a really disturbing nickname for me and smears my reputation to paint me as a fucking creep, laughs at me being in confrontations.

 I cant fight back and I can't go to the teacher because that will lead to further negative attention. I can't do this shit anymore. I live in the UK, and at 15 years old you do your final year of school. My mock examinations for graduation are in a week and with all the stress mounting up I just want to end it. I'll have to go back to school the day after tomorrow and I dont want to face the same kids that will kick the shit out of me and intimidate me to elevate themselves.  I'm searching on here for answers that can help improve my life, as I feel if I tell anybody without being anyonomous they'll say I'm an attention whore and turn me away. 

Or, in some cases with other people I'm afraid they'll just ridicule me, as people that are suicidal have been laughed at in my school because kids love being edgy.

Ontop of that, everybody just doesn't like me. All my teachers hate me, the students hate me, i just don't think I'm a very likeable person. I'm a dumbass, so i dont see a future career I see failed grades, i am a waste of space.  I really can't see a solution to this issue. Help.
