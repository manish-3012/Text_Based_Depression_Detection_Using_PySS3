Will there be a tomorrow for me?Depression is something that has had me for 6 years. Everyday like many people I have to fight just to get out of bed but why should I even get up? Everyone around me tears me down. I never receive any compliments it goes right to negative and me just always doing everything wrong. Last weekend I thought Monday would be the day I killed myself I told myself I wanted one last good weekend. I saw my boyfriend we went to dinner, got a hotel, and argued the whole time. I wanted just a couple good memories before I went. Nothing was happy nothing to this day is happy. Yesterday I fell unconscious and heard a man saying " stay with me" and asking me "what my name is". I could hear him but I wanted to let go and I did I let myself go into unconsciousness and it was so peaceful everything was black it was like I was blind I couldn't see anyone or anything I couldn't hear I was just falling and falling. I want that feeling again but this time I don't want to wake up. Side note it wasn't a suicide attempt yesterday I have medical problems and sometimes I get weak and will just past out wherever I am. Don't really know what the point of this post is. I just wanna die I just want out of my head and all the misery. I can't do anything right can barely hold a job and afford to make ends meet. Everyone talks down to me no one tries to boost me up so what is the point anymore. My own therapist even told me o was regressing and he didn't know how to help me anymore. I'm just so lost.
