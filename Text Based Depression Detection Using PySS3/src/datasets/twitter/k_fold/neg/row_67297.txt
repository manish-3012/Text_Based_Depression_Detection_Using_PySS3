Why am I a fucking mistake?I feel like a complete dumbass. I know that I am depressed and have something fucked up in my head but I don't say shit. It's like I want to keep on being messed up and down all the time. I've been feeling this way since I was about 12, I am now 17. I feel like I should see a therapist or something but at the same time I don't. I have such horrible thoughts and want to kill myself but then I catch myself and say I don't want to because I'm normal. I don't understand myself. I want to die. I want to commit suicide and I hate living. I cry everyday because I am alive and how much I hate myself and my life. I find no joy in anything. I go crazy and punch myself, hit myself with objects but then again I say I am not crazy. I see how crazy I get but I don't get the help I need. I mean at least meds will help me but I don't want it to go on my record. I don't want to lose a job because I have a mental illness.

Am I stupid for going undiagnosed and not getting help? I cut myself, I bruise myself, I make myself throw up, I binge eat. I have problems but I don't want anyone to know. Why can't I be normal. I want to be normal again.
