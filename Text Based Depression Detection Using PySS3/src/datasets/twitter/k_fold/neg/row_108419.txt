everythings falling apartI'm 26 and I got in a really bad fight with my boyfriend. I love him so much, we've been dating several years and I feel like he will not forgive me for this one. I have held off telling him about my shitty past (rape drugs ect) and it all came out last night after i downed a fifth of tequila and got super mad at him for telling me that because our sex life is dwindling that I don't like him anymore... which is how I started to flip out on him.  I don't know, I just want it all to be over. I can;t do anything right and I cant make him happy. I don;t have a lot to hold onto here, and when leaves I just want to be done. ive disapointed everyone... my family called the cops cuz they were worried about me last night when I tried to just go out drunk and called them crying. Wish I could have od'd. I don't want to face this day I don't even know where to start. Im just gonna call into work and just disapeer from this town. I am so ashamed and beyond depressed. Maybe I need to just get out of Iowa.  Thats all thanks for reading.
