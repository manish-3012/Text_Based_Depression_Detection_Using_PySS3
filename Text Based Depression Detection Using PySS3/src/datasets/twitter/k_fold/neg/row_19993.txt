Thank you strangerI got a message from reddit saying someone reached out to them because they were concerned about me. It suggested a couple of resources for suicidal people like me. My eyes welled up with tears. Who ever you are that was so kind of you, taking time out of your day to help a stranger. Thank you to all of you for supportive messagesâ¤ the world should be more like Reddit. Crying so hard.ðŸ˜¢
