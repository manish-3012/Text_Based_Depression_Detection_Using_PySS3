Do medications actually work?I've lost count of the years I've been like this and I'm tired of feeling like this. I want to get better but I don't know how. I've tried sports and hobbies but I'm too busy and so far everything I've tried to focus my mind on just feels like a waste of time.

I am a little scared of the the effects that some medication would have on me and I definetly do not want to depend on them to feel better but right now I'm out of ideas. I would appreciate any information on this topic.

23M from Spain if it matters.
