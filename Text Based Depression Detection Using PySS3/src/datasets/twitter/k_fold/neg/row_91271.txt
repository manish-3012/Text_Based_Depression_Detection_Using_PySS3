Is it normal?I'm a 44 year old male in a 23 year old failing/failed marriage that's been on the outs for 5 years or so.  I know it's horrible and without honor, but I have another woman on the side.  My wife cheated on me 5 years ago with her highschool boy friend and I caught her and I can't forgive her for it and at the time i sought comfort in another woman who was hurting also.  God knows I've tried to forgive her again and again.  Until that point in my life i had never even thought of being unfaithful, but my wife crushed my heart and I have never been the same since.  I used to be a fun guy....maybe not the life of the party, but someone you enhoued hang8ng out with....not so much any more.  I alienated all my friends to the point that I no longer have any...none.  I'm angry all the time and I hate self for it.  I have 2 wonderful sons who are 19 and 16 and I would do anything for them.  However, I think daily what would be the easiest, least painful, most permanent way to commit suicide that would not look like suicide.  That way insurance would take care if my kids what I'm gone.  Do I drive into oncoming traffic at 80 miles an hour?  Do I drive into a bridge support?  Accident with a power saw?  I don't know what to do and I'm so alone and it hurts.
