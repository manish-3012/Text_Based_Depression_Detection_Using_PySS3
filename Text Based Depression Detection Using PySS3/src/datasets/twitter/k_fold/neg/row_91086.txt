Whatâ€™s the point of carrying on?To suffer another day? Iâ€™m tired of my life and everyone around me. There are so many things wrong with me physically and mentally. My lungs have deteriorated so much that sometimes it hurts to even take a breath. Iâ€™ve never felt attracted to anyone or loved them/ had a crush on them, which reinforces Iâ€™m mentally screwed. Iâ€™ll never be able to get ahead in life either, it costs so much just to buy food where I live because of monopolies. Also houses are really overpriced here due to poor government regulation. And to add to this the taxes here are pretty brutal on top of our all ready terrible prices, and I have no idea where that money goes because this city is still in ruins. 

I hate this place and endless cycle of suffering.
