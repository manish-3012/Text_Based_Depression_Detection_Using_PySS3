Increasingly heavy thoughts of committing suicideI work at a Taco Bell and will start at Burger King soon. I have a car payment and other things that need to be paid I canâ€™t keep up with. I have thoughts of how much of a better brother I couldâ€™ve been to my little brothers instead of the asshole I was. I see the face of my little brother crying after I would push him down or be mean to him when I would close my eyes. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m looking for or what I wanna be. Iâ€™m 350 miles away from both my parents. They would hate to see me do this but sometimes I canâ€™t handle. I need reassurance Iâ€™m not a terrible human being. That theyâ€™re not disappointed, that they donâ€™t hate me for not being more/doing more with my life. Sometimes I just wanna talk but I feel like I canâ€™t to anyone. Sometimes itâ€™s easier to reach out to strangers than it is to a loved one or a friend.
