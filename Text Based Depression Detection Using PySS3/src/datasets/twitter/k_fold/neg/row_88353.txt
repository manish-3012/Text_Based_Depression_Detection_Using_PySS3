Due to no fault of my own, I will be given the choice to isolate myself completely, die, or live the rest of my life attached to a machineI have been formally diagnosed with several learning disabilities, which means that my low risk family will have to leave the house and order food online for me.  The learning disabilities (low functioning autism and severe hydrocephalus) cause me to have a very weak immune system.  If I catch anything worse than a cold, I will either die or spend the rest of my life immobile, severely brain damaged and hooked up to a machine.

I hope to die now because nothing is worse than being alone in the dark (my dad puts the electric in and without him I can't do it myself because it requires a ladder and my hydrocephalus means I have no balance).

I hope to kill myself before the 23rd when my family will be ordered to leave the house and leave me with no electricity.  Even if they were allowed to stay, the electricity will still run out and I will still spend nights in complete darkness.
