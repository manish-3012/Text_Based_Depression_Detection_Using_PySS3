I think about it alotI made a throw away account so no-one knows who I am but I have noome really to talk too about my feelings and noome to turn too when im dowm which is most days. I dont think I have the guts to do it but I think about not being here alot, I think if i ended it now it would be a while before people even realised I was gone. I feel so lonely I dkmt know what to do. I miss the comfort of someones touch evem just hugging. I miss long winded interesting conversations. I am always by myself except whej I'm in work and I'm forced to act happy when im not. I know life can always be worst but that doesn't comfort me. Sorry if this is random but it nust feels good to type my emotions down.
