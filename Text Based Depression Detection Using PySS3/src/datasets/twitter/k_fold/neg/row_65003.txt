What's with the downvotes everywhere? Am I missing something?I keep seeing 0 or less votes on almost every post trying to help out an OP.  Yeah, there are some shitheads trying to stir the pot in some threads and they deserve down votes.  But I see many well meaning posts trying to help a person in pain receiving needless downvotes.  They're only trying to help in the only ways they know how, especially over an internet forum.  So how about instead of spending the time reading a poster trying to help and down voting them, you *post* what *you* think will actually help.  Instead of passive aggressively stating your shitty disagreement with well meaning posters. 

Edit:  I just saw the month old stickied post about some random person trying to police the sub.  That must be it.  I already upvote all the good posts but I'm definitely going to make sure to counteract whatever asshole is doing this when I can.
