Feel Unsafe. Not Sure What To Do.I'm just so sick of being myself. I'm sick of having to constantly ask for special treatments and extensions and being treated by everyone who knows me for any length of time like a China doll. I'm sick of being told that I should be able to do xyz and then disappointing people (and mostly myself) when I just can't. I'm incompetent at the few things I care about and don't have the confidence to pursue anything I really want to do as a career, nor the energy to pursue them (or anything, really) as a hobby. I had a few really good months on some new medication. When I say "really good" I mean "not waking up at noon and eating a bag of Doritos instead of the three days of meals you felt too tired to eat". Acting semi-normal is apparently a huge fucking accomplishment. 

I have so many things going right now and I just can't cope with them. I feel paralyzed and stupid constantly. I don't like this. I don't want to feel like a fuck-up and a failure for decades. So many of my family have been That Person and now we're not allowed to talk about them - it's like they never existed. Why wait around to be miserable for decades and then erased when I could just get things over with now? I don't know what to do anymore. I feel so defeated.
