I don't know what to dothe idea of bleeding out right here right now is so appealing to me I feel so numb and I want to die but I'm scared of death and leaving people behind I don't know what I'm going to do. my girlfriend always tells me to message or call her when I'm feeling like this but she's busy a lot of the time so she might not see any messages until it's too late, and I know that I'm way too annoying and clingy anyway and she probably wants me to shut up and deal with it on my own and she's just being kind. I honestly don't know what's going to happen from this moment onward.
