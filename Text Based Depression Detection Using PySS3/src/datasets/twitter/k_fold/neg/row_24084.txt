I'm sickHopping on this account for the last time, hopefully. I plan to commit suicide tonight/tomorrow, it's all planned out so hopefully I succeed this time. I just want to get away from my sick mind. No one believes me, I honestly don't think I'm real right now. My body feels o full of pressure, I need to break something, a bone or something... I don't know it just hurts. My heart hurts. I tried. I really tried. I'm not giving up mum, I'm just doing what's best for me. This isn't a good life for me, I'm sorry.
