The 9th will be 1 year and I am still here by the grace if God.The dark thoughts come and go but less often now. Maybe because of the upcoming date I am thinking about it again. I have no plans to follow thru with it. I am just extremely sad and want it to be over. Going to take zquil so I can sleep tonight. The pain is some unbelievable, I never thought it could drive a person to this extreme. "Talk to me Goose."
