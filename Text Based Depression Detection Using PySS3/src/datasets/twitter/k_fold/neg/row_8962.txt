I'm considering killing myself tonightI've meditated the idea of killing myself for years and I think I've finally reached my breaking point. I basically sexually assaulted my best friend, the only other post I've made is about that. She was fine with what happened and said it was just a mistake but today she said it's actually really got to her. She blocked me on all social medias and her friends said she doesn't want us meeting again for a good while.

Without her and without that friendship group I have literally nothing to live for. They were the only things keeping me going and the guilt I feel from what I did is UNBEARABLE. I don't understand how it's possible for somebody to feel pain on such an intense level. I would break every bone in my body to save me from this if I could. Cutting isn't helping anymore and I think I'm finally ready to crash my car as I've been planning for a little while.

People tell me not to kill myself because it'll hurt others but that only makes me feel guiltier which makes me more suicidal. I would rather be pumped full of morphine or something to make me feel ok for a while but that's obviously not possible so I need to take the messier route.

Does anyone have any advice for getting over the guilt of wanting to die?
