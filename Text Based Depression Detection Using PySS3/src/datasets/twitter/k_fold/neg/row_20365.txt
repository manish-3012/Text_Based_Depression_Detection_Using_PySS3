somebody explain to me how suicide isn't my only option.Feel free to look up my post history.  Self employed lawyer who can't handle it anymore.  There's other stuff but mainly that.  I can't function.  But it's not like I can go check myself into the hospital bc there's no one else to handle my cases.  I don't know what else to do.  I'm in therapy it doesn't work.  Neither do my meds.  I have no one to talk to.  Suicide is the only option left.
