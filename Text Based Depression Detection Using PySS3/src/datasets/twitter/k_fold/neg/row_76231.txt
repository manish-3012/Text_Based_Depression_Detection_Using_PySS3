Crying with my knife againEvery night I feel so lonely. Iâ€™m so useless and nothing is working. Friends have left me in the dirt, and the one friend I have left doesnâ€™t reply very often. Iâ€™m usually in my room wanted to feel anything, and I just donâ€™t. I took a whole bottle of my medicine and nothing happened.....I already knew it didnâ€™t work because Iâ€™ve been taking it since January and Iâ€™ve only felt worse. Iâ€™m crying in my bed with my knife again tonight, ready to see my blood and hope that maybe one day, Iâ€™ll be strong enough to cut my throat open instead of my legs.
