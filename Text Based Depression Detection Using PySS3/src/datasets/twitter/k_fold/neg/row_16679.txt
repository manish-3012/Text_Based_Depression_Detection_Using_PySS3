I Posted a While Back and Some Things ChangedI got a new job, so I'll soon be able to afford the things I need. 

The date of something traumatic that happened to me just passed. I distanced myself from my few close friends, but tried to explain to them during and after... they were not understanding like I'd hoped. My mother was diagnosed with a second, more aggressive and very unresponsive form of cancer.  

I hate being awake. I hate being sober. I hate being alive. 

I have no one in my life that understands my struggles, just the everyday pain I deal with waking up. But then I'm expected to be a domestic servant, a worker, lover... when I don't even want to be here. At least I'll have the money soon. Finally.
