I'm bad and worthless. I want to die tonight so bad. My boyfriend just dumped me and maybe that's a stupid reason to kill myself but I think of all the things I have and none of them matter. He was something that made me smile on a bad day and I used to daydream about the day I'd be able to move to California to be with him. But now I've got nothing. I've got shit. 

I weigh less than 110 pounds and there's a ton of alcohol in this house so I could drink myself to death easily. People do it in this stupid college town all the time I'd just be another statistic. I can envision exactly who would feel bad if I went: parents momentarily, but I've tried to kill myself so many times they probably feel it's inevitable. Roommates would find me tomorrow, or maybe never since I just spend all my time in my room anyway. The few friends I have would feel bad, but they'd get over it. I told one of them what happened they won't repsond til morning hopefully it'll be too late by then. 

Fuck this life, I've never been happy. I wish I was never born.
