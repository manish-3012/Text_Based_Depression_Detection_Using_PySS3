I'm a soldier in the British Army. I've done two tours of Afghanistan and watched more than two of my closest friends die horribly before my eyes.The army has repeatedly fucked me over financially and now my long time girlfriend has left me. I'm more than ready to kill myself, because there's literally no-one left in my life I can turn to. So fuck it, why not reddit? I'm not trying to be selfish but It'd be appreciated if you could try and talk me out of it, haha.
