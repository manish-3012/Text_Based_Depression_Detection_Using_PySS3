How many decades of depression are enough?I'm miserable.  I've been unhappy since I was 8 years old.  

I can't date.  I don't have an interest in maintaining friendships.  My career is stagnant.  

I just want out.  I don't know how much more of this I can take.  Life just gets worse and worse and worse.

To top it all off, I live in the US.  The single greatest threat to world peace.   Rampant and wasteful consumption is destroying the world.  There's no future.  Just misery and unhappiness.  

With 7.5 billion people swarming this planet, polluting it, driving on climate change, why is it such a big fucking deal if I want to die?

I've disowned my family.  There's no I care about who will miss me.
