Cant remember the amount of times where iv been suicidal, gotten out of it and been like â€œwow i cant believe i was thinking that way/that closeâ€I often get depressed ( 3rd/half of the year). Maybe suicidal 3/4 times a year .  Wenever i get out of the depression, into normal thinking im always shocked that i was seriously contemplating something like that. One time i actually had a rope in my hands looking for a place  to hang myself of, and im so glad i couldnt find anywhere. Please talk to somone you love/trust, it can make all the all the difference
