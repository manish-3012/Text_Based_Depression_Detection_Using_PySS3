New Suicide Date - January 31stI know you all are upset I am waiting so long but I have to. I don't have the needed supplies yet and I have some loose ends to tie up. 

Until then I have the privilege of: enjoying my life (impossible). Reliving good memories (none) or whatever else. Maybe if I meet some nice people here I can keep you company although that would require you to not hate me (unlikely)
