I'm worth less than a line of coke. I'm just tired of fighting.I don't even know where to begin :/ my entire life has been absolute hell and it just keeps getting worse. It's hard for me to justify my existence. I know I'm just a waste of space and it hurts. I want to be normal so badly.
My pathetic life story begins when I was just a baby. I was living with my mom and dad. My mom was  a stay at home mom I guess and my dad was out running his own truck business. My mom was often gone. My dad came home one day and found a small mirror, razor, piece of straw, and 3 lines of coke under her side of the bed and decided to hide it. When confronted he told her that could have killed me (I was crawling) and still, all she wanted was her coke. So he gave it to her and just told her to leave. She was gone for a month. Not even calling once to check on me.
My mom didn't really reenter my life until I was about 4 or 5 and by that point she was just a stranger to me.
Well as time passed, we became very close and she'd always told me she never wanted to leave me. Recently I've found out that was all just a lie... I found out aafter she kicked me out of her house and her life over something completely ridiculous. I didn't even do anything wrong.
I always thought my mom was on my side. And as much as I love my dad now, I'll always fear him. I used to feel like he didn't love me because he'd beat me up all the time. From those many traumatic experiences I now have PTSD. I also have depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Those 3 diagnosed when I was 12.  It was at 12 that I met my first love. We were together until I was 14 until our parents forced us to break up. He was very controlling and put me through a lot of painful things, but we had many good times too. Like an idiot, I held onto my love for him until the beginning of this year. He'd come in and out of my life briefly over the years but we were finally together again last year around the end of summer. That went down hill quickly. He started doing heroin at my house and bringing his junkie friends over to shoot up in my room with him. It ended with police surrounding my house and us being held at gunpoint. Side note: I don't do heroin.
After he was arrested, several months later I met a guy that was just so sweet and seemed to be everything I've always wanted. Around that time I broke it off with my boyfriend just a couple weeks before he got out of jail. Turns out he'd been doing some terrible things behind my back and only used me and kept me under his control disguised as love for all those years. Come to find out my first love is a sociopath.
This new guy seemed so wonderful though. So sweet and caring. We got close pretty quickly but suddenly he'd completely changed and it was like having the rug ripped out from under me. He told me he'd realized he wasn't ready for a relationship like he thought he was and still needed to get through what his ex did to him. Mind you, his ex came up in nearly every conversation. It really hurt. So to now hear that I was suddenly unwanted made me feel so worthless and stupid. Now whatever bullshit thing we have going on between us is very painful for me. He just now treats me as if I don't matter. Now all I feel like is the occasional fwb. Its completely shredded my self esteem and has made me hate myself more. I'm in this position yet again. And I don't know why I'm never worth it. Why I'm so unloveable. And it's not just relationships. My mom's entire half of the family cut off all contact with me when I was 15 and I haven't seen them since. They only care about the boys. It makes me hate myself. I truly loved them and they chose the men. The boys just want their money. They don't care like I did.
I have just a couple friends. I'm a loser. I don't drive and I don't have a job thanks to being mental.
I know I'm not the best choice due to my downfalls but I don't think it should make me unloveable. I have so much love to give but it only gets me heartbreak. I'm attractive, not a genius but I'd like to think I'm smart enough, have a great sense of humor... I don't know what's so wrong with me.

This is truly just the tip of the iceberg in my life. I've had my best friend commit suicide. I lost my beloved cat a few years ago because of my mother's parents and that wound will never even begin to heal. I was bullied so badly in middle school that I stopped going. I ended up having to be in 7th grade 3 times.

This is all just stuff here and there. There's so much more but it's so much to type. I don't want to bore you to death.

So because my life has been so awful, I just want to die. It only gets worse and I only stick around for a couple people because I don't want them to feel the pain I do from losing a friend. But I don't know how much longer I can only stay around for other people.  I don't feel like I deserve to live. I don't contribute and I'm just a nuisance. I don't want to be that anymore.
I have a couple methods in mind, but haven't gone through with it yet because I've got some things to do first.

My problem with suicide is that I'm scared and I don't know if there's an other side. I know I'll eventually have to get over those fears though. I can't do this forever. Nothing gets better. Not for me.
