I had never been happier in my life. Now I've never felt worse.Last December, I met a boy who I fell in love with so quickly. He and I dated for seven months, everything seemed perfect, he even encouraged me to go to college near him so we could continue dating through then.

So I enrolled in a college south of his; my job was going well, I was excited for college, I was excited for everything.

And out of nowhere, he left. He dumped me, told me he just didn't love me anymore, that as cliche as it was, he wanted a fresh start for college.

Now, I'm failing out of college, the boy I'm in love with now has ghosted me, my family barely has room for me in my old house, I have no motivation, no money, and no plan. I have never felt so fucking empty and pointless in my life. 

I don't want to exist anymore. I thought I had someone who loved me and wanted to be with me forever, *he said he did, he fucking insisted*. And he lied. I don't feel like I can trust anyone, I don't feel like I have anything left to live for.

The boy I love now stopped talking to me. He told me he wasn't sure what he wants, and then stopped talking to me. My heart aches because I opened up, he was my best friend and I fell in love with him over these past four months, and now he won't even fucking speak to me. I see no point, no fucking point in any of this shit. 

All I want is for this fucking lonely, heartbreaking nightmare to end. I can't take this shit anymore. I can't be alone, but I can't manipulate people into sticking around so I haven't told them how hopeless I'm feeling. I just can't do this anymore. I'm so fucking alone, and there is no point in existing if I'm alone. I'm such a piece of shit, and I'm just... I'm just done.

I know people have it worse. Other people's lives are harder. But I'm a weak bitch, and I can't handle this. So I'm just... done.

I think this might really be it.
