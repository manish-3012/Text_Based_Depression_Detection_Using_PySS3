No oneHi everyone, it's hard to write this down but I'm thinking about doing it so I guess this is the place to talk about it.
For the past 4 years I've drowned myself in sorrow, I was such a wonderful person, everyone admired me and had high hopes for. But the person I loved and cared for very deeply passed away, and since then life has disappeared for me.
I've tried, I truly did, to regain my senses, but it didn't work out well for me.
I began gambling, sitting down beside slot machines, talking to random people and forgetting about everything. It was relaxing, as mush so that I didn't realise that I got myself into debt and I'm not far away from loosing my apartment.
Now that I've reached this point in my life there is no other way out of it. I have nothing to give, I have no one to love, I have nothing to offer to this world. I may soon be homeless and alone, I don't drink so there's no escape in that.
Any other escape anyone can think of?
Thank you for your attention
