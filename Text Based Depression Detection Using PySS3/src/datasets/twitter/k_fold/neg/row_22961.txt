Tired of being abandoned...Iâ€™m not sure this is the right sub for this but I hope it is. Iâ€™m not feeling like Iâ€™m going to definitely commit suicide any time soon consciously, but I do feel like Iâ€™m going to numb myself until Iâ€™m gone. Iâ€™ve recently felt urges to drink again after giving it up a year ago. I donâ€™t feel psychically addicted to alcohol, I actually hate feeling sick after drinking it. But recently things have been so bad in my life I know drinking will suppress memories at least.
Iâ€™ve been depressed for over a decade now, with highs and lows. My mother was abusive, my first and second real relationship were not only emotionally abusive but also sexually. Iâ€™ve tried medication so far and talking to a doctor, but the side effects were pretty brutal. My current boyfriend finally admitted that he canâ€™t deal with my mental illness. He doesnâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll ever get better and frankly neither do I. I want to be better, of course, but the trauma I have is so deep. Itâ€™s more than just being sad, I have constant flashbacks of abuse that I have little control over. Iâ€™ve lost friends to my mental illness and Iâ€™ve given up everything to be in this relationship. I feel so hopeless knowing the last person I have doesnâ€™t want to deal with me anymore. I just need a little love and support. Iâ€™m starting to have thoughts of killing myself because I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever get better and Iâ€™m tired of dragging everyone I love down with me. Iâ€™m tired of losing those I love because of scars that other people made on me. I just need someone to hold my hand.
