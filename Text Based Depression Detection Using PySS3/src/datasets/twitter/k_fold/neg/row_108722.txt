Does it really get better? Are you ever cured of suicidal thoughts?Iâ€™ve struggled with depression since I was 10 years old. Iâ€™ve been through physical/emotional/sexual abuse. I had my first suicide attempt when I was 11. Went to the ER. Went into therapy. Had another attempt at age 14. Went to the ER. Still went to therapy. Had another attempt at 16. Back into therapy. Another at 17. Then 18. Then 19. Then spent a week in in-patient care. Made a choice to stop self harming. Went into group therapy. Surrounded myself with positive friends. Reconnected with my family. Left a toxic relationship. Got into Church. Found healthy releases. Got into the gym. My self esteem went up. Finally loved myself. I was actually happy. I went without even a THOUGHT about harming myself. Everyone was proud of my turn around. They even saw/felt the change in me. 

 Iâ€™m almost 22 now and for some reason the thoughts of being dead flood my mind. For the first time in 3 years I actually wanted to self harm/cut myself again (I didnâ€™t). I want to just leave my life behind. Runaway. But I canâ€™t. I thought I was fine. Everything was shaping up.

I thought severe depression was something Iâ€™d grow out of. I didnâ€™t think 10+ years later Iâ€™d still have feelings of wanting to die. Itâ€™s almost as if misery is a drug. And when things shape up, I keep fucking relapsing. Will it stop or am I just doomed for life? What else am I missing?
