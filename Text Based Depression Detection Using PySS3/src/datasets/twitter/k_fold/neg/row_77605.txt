Fucking family(bear with me on this) So my parents borrowed a little weed from me saying they would return it when they had more. They never did so I asked, and was told that as the stuff I had was cheaper than what they have they weren't going to give it back, but instead gave me a Â£2 torch?! 

This was part of a huge saga in which my mum has visited me 3 times at my home, which I have been living in for 1 year. Which is genuinely a 1 minute walk away from my parents house. Those 3 times were all for weed, because she's too busy unless of course I have weed....

....So I hung up on her when she said she wouldn't return the weed and received a voicemail saying she didn't know what the fuss was about. So (after a few stiff drinks) I wrote a letter explaining that my dad's repeated verbal abd physical abuse of me when I was younger (your insane, I'll fucking murder you, you need to be sent away etc) led to me believing him and carving the word insane into my arm. I also wrote that I had tried to kill myself 3 times, that I used to hear voice and that I still wanted to die. 

Fast forward 3 days, I have not heard anything from either of them expect my mum turning my partner away when he went to her house the morning after I gave them the letter, saying she couldn't work with him (he works for her). Side note: they get on well and he is not involved in any of this. This is also not the first time she has taken work away from him or threatened to when me and my mum have fallen out.

I'm babysitting my nephew today who told me that his mummy (my sister) had said a very bad word about me. 

So I tell my family I have tried to kill myself 3 times, that I self harm, that my dad's verbak abuse caused me alot of mental anguish and they ignore me and talk shit about me behind my back. 

Long story short I'm finding it very hard to get think of a reason not to commit suicide right now.
