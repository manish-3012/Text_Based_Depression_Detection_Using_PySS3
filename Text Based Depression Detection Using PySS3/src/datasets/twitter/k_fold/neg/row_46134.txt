Living for my little sisterHonestly my life is a complete joke. I am a complete failure and a joke and I have no motivation or interest in living in this fake society humans have made and deemed normal. I just canâ€™t. If it wasnâ€™t for my little sister I would probably be long gone by now. Sheâ€™s 12 and looks up to me heavily. I could not imagine the pain and suffering I would put her through if one day someone has to inform her that Iâ€™m gone and never coming back. Maybe one day things will change so I can finally stop living in this absolute mess of a world and my miserable existence can end. But for now, I just need to tough it out and be a role model for my sister. Itâ€™s going to be a very dark road ahead and I am not looking forward to it.
