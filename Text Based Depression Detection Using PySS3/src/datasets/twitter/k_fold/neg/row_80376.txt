off my chestWe gathered for a farewell party yesterday. Everyone was having so much fun. When they started singing at karaoke, I felt the thought of suicide creep up. I felt that this was the perfect situation to be in, where everyone and myself was happy, and that I would be at peace when suicide happened. Somehow in my head I knew it was going to happen the next day. I started tearing, and did my best to hide it from everyone (I think I succeeded).  I know I won't follow through on it, but I also do not know why these thoughts appear out of a sudden. I can never reveal I have such thoughts, not in the current industry I am in. I am exhausted at work, from work, and at life. I've had surgery which resulted in chronic pain. I don't take any meds for it as it doesn't help with the pain and only makes me depressed, so I am strong in that aspect, but I am tired of dealing with pain, and am tired of not being able to function properly because of this condition.
