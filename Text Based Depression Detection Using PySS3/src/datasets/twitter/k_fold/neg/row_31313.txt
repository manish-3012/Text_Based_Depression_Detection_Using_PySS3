When All Hope is LostI realised that hope is necessary. Being able to be positive and get back on your feet is subjectively not a bad thing. however in certain hopeless situations were you know that it'll be pointless to get back up, hope can be your worst nightmare. In those situations hope forces you to stand up even when you know you're going to get shot back down. It's exhausting. 

Consequently, I haven't been standing up much recently. It does make life a lot less brutal when you come to accept certain things and not put life on a pedestal or raise yourself up to such a high level that it hurts when you fall...

However lately now that hope isn't exercising itself it's as if it's power is depleting. I deeply fair that once All Hope is gone there will be nothing keeping me here.

 I was forced to learn from a young age that life is not objectively good. And sometimes people are just bad irregardless of the title they hold in your life. But hope has always been there, keeping me fighting in the hopes that someday things will get better. Better away from these people. 

I've always wondered how people build up the strength, nihilism (whatever you call it), to kill themselves. I realise now that when All Hope is Lost there's not much else to do.
