Idiot I posted here the other day. I don't have anyone to talk to. I think my deaths inevitable. I haven't eaten anything in the last couple days. Can't leave my bed. I know I'm being depressive and anxiety/mentall illness is distorting everything. It always has and will. Last two weeks been in bed staring at the wall at all times except for when I'm at work due to crippling anxiety and self hatred. Need to move out of a fucked up housing situation but no chance of making more money. No jobs. Probably won't even make rent this month. Ruined relationships with my family and friends that are beyond repair bc I lost any sense of self and don't know how to face the ppl who loved me that I abandoned years ago. Im cold a failure as a human and deserve to die. All I have left to motivate me is daydreaming about drugs and how it was not feeling this disgusting writhing core of hurt that I carry with me everywhere. That I always have and always will. I want to relapse. Just over and over and over in my mind.  It's the only thing. I just fantasize about pain pills. I feel pathetic. Might delete this. End feels closer every day.
