My case
So, I'm a guy who hates himself; since I've entered to college, I knew that I didn't belonged to that place, every day was saddening and depressive, I somehow managed to make close friends; but a part of me was just saying things like "yeah but you're still ugly and won't be able to have a single company from the rest of your life. And on top of that you're still a loser in college, you just survive but no one will ever consider you smart enough" that voice said that, almost every goddam day. Very hard to bare, my family loves me, and friends say that I'm a kind guy, but that made me think that they were just programmed to love me (I know it isn't like it in some cases and I'm sorry) I mean, friends just talk with you cause it's natural and don't fight each other knowing that they won't have to live together with you so, why change you? Jumping into conclusion I focused all my energies in looking for company, someone that just liked me, to this point I've tried with two different girls completely out of my league, they're smart, beautiful and very interesting people, in the end, one rejected me; I don't want to sound like I was dating them at the same time, it was a half of a year to recover I even lost an assignment because of the inordinated stress of feeling like I was never going to be good enough for anybody, that was probably my first and the last suicide attempt, it was back then when i found reddit, have to say that it's such a nice community. Now I gathered enough strenght and talk to the girl that now I'm into, she's very cool and almost made me feel like I had an opportunity when she asked for my number, this was a week ago. Now I just think that she did that in order to get rid of me just saying that she would call me. That's probably my main reason of depression, maybe the feeling of not being loved by a person who's no family or friend; there are more though, I have a pretty strange sickness called ankylosing spondilitis, I'm not good at simple tasks that require a little of common sense and I'm very amnesic.
So now I'm doing bad, I now have her number but she doesn't answer my messages, I love to write, so I wrote her a poem, gonna tell her how I feel soon so I can finally conclude that no one will ever love me and will be ready to part from this strange world.
Edit: TLDR basically, I'm saying that I have depression just cause I'm not able to find a couple.
