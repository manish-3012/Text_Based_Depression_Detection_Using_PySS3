I'm sick of humanity....Except for babies/young children. They are so pure and, as I've heard someone else say before, "wise".

Then they grow up to be bullying little shits and move on into adulthood, unscarred themselves, and preach about liberal issues and how everyone deserves equal opportunity.

If you're one of those people, then please just look at yourself and get off your flying unicorn you sheltered fucks. I've looked at myself on a constant loop, with people telling me I've done it too much, over mistakes that turned out to actually be all in my head - why should I be the only one? Why do I have to live with seeing myself as inhuman while those who swept through their normal childhoods wondering why people like me are complaining so much?

Angry rant over.
