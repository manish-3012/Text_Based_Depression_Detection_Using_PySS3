I told my friend my plan and I shouldnâ€™t have done that.Thereâ€™s nothing he can do. I shouldnâ€™t have said anything to him. Neither one of us are adults, and heâ€™s not even in the state anymore. He doesnâ€™t even know exactly where my house is. God I shouldnâ€™t have said anything because now heâ€™s stressed and worried. He was telling me drugs were helping him, and I told him I doubt theyâ€™d help me. I then told him I plan on taking a foreign language class abroad for the sole purpose of suicide. I shouldnâ€™t have said anything. I feel bad for it
