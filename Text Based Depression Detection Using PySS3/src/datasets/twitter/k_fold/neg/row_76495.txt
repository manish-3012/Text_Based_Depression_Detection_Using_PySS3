Just a joke.It's become obvious, I've been a joke.

I've. . .I'm not nearly the person that I thought I was to the people that I care about, that I thought cared about me. Thankfully, I am no longer tied down to anyone. So this decision is easier, now.

Life hasn't gotten better in years, and I have tried a multitude of the things to end my depression. I don't want to hurt anymore, and sincerely, I will be vaguely missed.

It was best to just let someone, anyone know. Cheers.
