I donâ€™t feel like itâ€™s getting better.Title says it all. Iâ€™m perpetually miserable, lonely, and hate myself, through and through. My life is a stagnant mess of the same melodrama and boring routine nearly every day. Iâ€™ve lost all passion for everything I used to enjoy and have no goals I want to pursue. Iâ€™m distraught over where the world around me is heading and am utterly powerless in that aspect. Iâ€™m sick of it all and am at my lowest Iâ€™ve ever been. I would like to improve, but Iâ€™ve no clue where to even begin and I canâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel. Iâ€™m *not* going to do anything drastic, Iâ€™m too cowardly for that, but itâ€™s starting to appear like the only path. If things wont improve and thatâ€™s the one solution available... to be or not to be I suppose. I donâ€™t want to go, but nothing is getting better no matter how much I try. Please give me something.
