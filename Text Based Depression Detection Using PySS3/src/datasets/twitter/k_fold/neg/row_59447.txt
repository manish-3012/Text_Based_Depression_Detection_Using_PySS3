Dear people that constantly tell me some bullshit quote from a famous person (specifically mom and bossy morons at my workplace and school ) And dear people who tell me someone has it worseTo the people who tell me the "inspirational" quotes:

 Believe it or not these quotes are not motivational and make no sense half the time. Also these quotes come from people that actually made a difference and an impact on society which is sure as fuck not what you're doing. Also these quotes aren't even true *You're in charge of your own world/life/ what happens to you* Bullshit if you hit me with a rock it's your fault that I'm bleeding my head. Same way if you get into an argument with me and yell at me and cuss at me for no reason other then you being an asshole then it's YOUR FAULT that my day is ruined and that I start feeling depressed cause I get to spend one day a year being happy and the rest of the year I'm miserable But you decide to take that little bit of happiness away from me by cussing me out just cause you felt like it. And then It's my fault that i want to beat your shit in? Are you fucking kidding me?


To the people who tell me "someone has it worse." Thanks my utter sadness.has now vanished like it never existed. Just kidding please slice your dick off and use it to fuck yourself. Just cause there's someone living inside of a plastic bag  and gets beaten up by 50 dudes every single day doesn't make my situation any less stressful. I'm almost at the absolute low of the economic ladder and the mental health ladder so shut the fuck up. Besides i bet you tell yourself that someone has it worse whenever you get fucked over *RIGHT*???
