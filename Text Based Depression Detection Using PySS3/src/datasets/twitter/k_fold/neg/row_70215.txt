Iâ€™m a ghost in my own lifeEver since I can remember Iâ€™ve felt like I never deserved love. Like I always felt like I was disgusting and repulsive to everyone around me so I never allowed myself to develop feelings for someone, and now I have. I donâ€™t know what to do because I feel so disgusting I feel so unworthy and if he ever found out that I had these feelings for him Iâ€™m scared that he would react with disgust. I hate living like this, I hate feeling like I donâ€™t deserve love and I hate that I hate myself so much to the point where I donâ€™t even take care of myself. For some background info I was diagnosed with severe depression and somatic delusions in 2017 and am currently on Prozac but it doesnâ€™t feel like its doing shit anymore. Iâ€™m so numb inside, Iâ€™m so terrified of everyone around me looking at me with disgust because Iâ€™m just such an awful creature. I will never be worthy of love especially not his and its absolutely destroying me. It destroys me when other girls talk about him because I know that they have an actual chance, while I have nothing. I want to go back to living behind my emotional walls where I was somewhat safe but lonely, I hate life so much I have nothing and I am no one. I am so much lower than everyone else Iâ€™m literally a ghost. I want nothing more than to sleep forever....
