i dont want to be alive.I honestly don't have values, i don't know why i am alive. I literally have no friends, no social life, no boyfriend. I have been led on by the same guy for 5 years and it fucking hurts me... i have dreams about him and it just turns into a long fucking thought process. I can't get over the guy i fell in love with when i was 17, before my PTSD started... then my "best friend" ruined my future, so now im thrown off and confused. I have changed a lot and feel so empty and gone. I felt "gone" for fucking 4 years. I want to go to a hospital but my job would fire me for not showing up and helping myself lol if this feeling keeps up i am going in
