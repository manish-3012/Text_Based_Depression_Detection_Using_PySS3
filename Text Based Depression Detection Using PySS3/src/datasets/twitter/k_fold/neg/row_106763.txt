I want to die. I should die.I want to die.  
I'm a failure. As a son, as a brother, as a grandson, as a friend, as a person. I'm a disappointment. A coward. A parasite. A weight for others. I shouldn't have been born. The world would be the same without me, if not better. I'm not able to do anything. I'm useless. My life, my existence, has no meaning. I only make mistakes. I'm a horrible person. An idiot. I should die. I should kill myself. I have no reasons to keep living. Nothing to look forward.  
Why didn't I do it sooner? Why did I wait so much? I believed... I convinced myself... that things could change, and I could be a better person, living a better life. It can't happen. I' can't do anythiing.
