Drugs are working but I still feel like it would be in everyone's best interest if I went awayI've dealt with depression since I was 11. I am 31 now. Recently I was diagnosed with bipolar II and have been prescribed a combination of medications that are working. I do not feel as depressed. Where before I was, on a scale of 1 to 10, a 10, now I feel somewhere around a 1-2 on a daily basis. I am able to engage in hobbies again. I generally enjoy life.

However I still can't get the thought of suicide out of my head. Instead of making me sad, the thought just makes me feel so peaceful now. I have a plan, although it isn't anything I would ever execute. I love my husband and I love my son but something about killing myself still seems so appealing.

What is wrong?
