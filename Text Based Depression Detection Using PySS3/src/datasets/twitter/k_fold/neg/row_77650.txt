Think before you speakEx falsely charged me with a DV in order to get a TPO put in place on my son so she could take him. Now that I'm days away from getting it dismissed and getting him back after a month, she is telling everyone that I molested him. I'm being charged, no evidence, but I can't prove that nothing happened (how the fuck could you?). I'm loosing everything. I cant afford a lawyer of that caliber. I'm not going to spend the next 15 years in prison for something I didn't do, just to get out when I'm 45, be on a sex offender list, and not be able to work in my field. Cops will be at my door before 4pm tomorrow. I've already sawed off my catalytic converter. This probably isn't the right sub to put this in, but here it is.

To any crazy fucks out there, think about the long term affects of lying to get your way.
