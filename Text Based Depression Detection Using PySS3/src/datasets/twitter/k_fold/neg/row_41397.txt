Im not sure if I want to live anymore.My own family hates me, Every time I tell the truth, they scream at me, saying how much of a liar I am.

If your own family hates you, whats the point? I might as well end it.

Edit: After a week playing Minecraft with my best friend, I'm recovering quickly, Thanks for all the messages, guys, It really made me happy again.
