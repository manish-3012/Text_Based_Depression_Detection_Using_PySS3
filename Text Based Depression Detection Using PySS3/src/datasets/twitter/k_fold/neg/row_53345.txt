I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong.I donâ€™t know how to start something like this. Keep it short and sweet or what? EDIT: Was not short and sweet, may delete soon, idk.

Fact of the matter is, Iâ€™m going to kill myself. And I donâ€™t know why. Well, I do. I know exactly why. But I donâ€™t exactly know how to explain it.

Nothingâ€™s wrong with me. I have a family that loves me. Friends that do too. As much as my brain often tries to say they donâ€™t. Iâ€™m not living in poverty, I have a job and no debts.

So why? I guess thatâ€™s what everyoneâ€™s thinking? 

I donâ€™t know. Thereâ€™s just *something* in my brain. Itâ€™s broken or something. 

Itâ€™s just that, whatâ€™s the point of all this? I guess Iâ€™ve been so â€œgoal oriented.â€ Graduate high school, get good grades, go to college, do well, talk to professors, get a job, etc. And I did. I did very well. 3.9 GPA, all that jazz. 

But then I got that job. And I think I hated it. Or maybe I didnâ€™t. Not positive. But Iâ€™ve just had this overwhelming feeling of â€œso this is it, huh? I just kind of keep doing this until Iâ€™m dead now? Like 50 years of this?â€

Just utter pointlessness, I guess? It just all feels like a giant waste of time. Everything Iâ€™ve done has been a giant waste of time. I want to do something else with my life, but then I think â€œWhat if I just end up feeling the same way about that too?â€ Then that wouldâ€™ve been a waste of time.

But even before I got this job, I still had these thoughts. All. The. Time. Since my senior year of high school. Sometimes I try and link those feelings to an event, and I feel better. But other times I donâ€™t know why I would feel that way.

In college a few years ago, I forget the date now, I was very seriously thinking about killing myself. I donâ€™t know why. Still donâ€™t. I know it wouldnâ€™t have worked. The plan was to take a bunch of random pills I bought at Walmart in my car while my roommate was out of town.

Like I said, I know it wouldnâ€™t have worked. I just wouldâ€™ve got vomit in my car, and felt like shit. 

Practically every day since then I continue to think about killing myself or something like that. Even when Iâ€™m feeling otherwise fine or normal; the thoughts creep in without fail. 

This past year, the thoughts have continued to be more concrete. More detailed, almost planned out.

Thought about buying a gun this past October. Looked extensively into â€œexit bagsâ€ in December. I found out what bridge has the highest drop in my state in January. 

Figured out you donâ€™t need a sturdy ceiling fan or tree branch to hang yourself in February; you donâ€™t need to be suspended to hang yourself. Iâ€™ve tied a noose and tried it twice only stop the pressure when I realize â€œLike oh shit, this could be the one.â€ Somehow knowing I have that option is a little comforting. 

Recently, aside from the continued thoughts of hanging (my current go to, I guess), Iâ€™ve tried cutting myself. For some reason. I have no idea why. I canâ€™t even fucking do it. My brain wonâ€™t allow me to even put that much pressure. So whatever. 

I havenâ€™t told anyone any of this. At least not seriously. Last year my father and I had a fight about money, and I blurted out how I almost tried to kill myself with the pills. He said â€œWe can talk about that later, but I really need you to sign this paper for my taxesâ€ even though I havenâ€™t lived with the guy in literally a decade.

I told a friend in an honestly jokey manner after weâ€™d both been drinking a bit. 

I havenâ€™t worked up the courage to tell anyone else. And I honestly donâ€™t want to put the weight of that burden on anyone. I donâ€™t want to scare anybody or make them feel like they need to say or do something.

Whatâ€™s usually stopped me from really trying to go for it, is a specific family member. And I donâ€™t know how much longer they have left. When they go... well, I donâ€™t know. 

Iâ€™ve been saying to myself more recently, â€œI donâ€™t see myself living past 30.â€ For some reason or another. I donâ€™t care about myself, and I barely try to take care of me. 

I hope Iâ€™m not the one that has to do it. Iâ€™m hoping maybe Iâ€™ll drink so much, thatâ€™ll kill me. Or I secretly hope that the next time Iâ€™m at a gas station, someone robs it and I can step in. Best case, Iâ€™m shot and thatâ€™s it. Worst case, I scare them off or something. 

I donâ€™t know. I feel selfish and shitty. My brainâ€™s broken and weird and self sabotaging. Then I read posts here from people who I really feel for. So many troubled lives, and here I am. Should be happy as a clam. But Iâ€™m not. And I donâ€™t know why.
