Help me help my friendIâ€™ve got a friend Iâ€™ve known for over fifteen years. We have a long history, most of it decent but there have been times in the past where she has dropped out of my life for two or three years.  About six months ago she came back in to my life and needed a little financial help, which was provided without any expectation of repayment. Over the last couple of months sheâ€™s visited the hospital for various mental health related issues and attempted suicide four times I believe now.  Knowing that back story this is where I need some assistance. It is extremely emotionally draining to go through this every couple of weeks, to be the only person she wants to lean on, to have to call the police in another city and have them come commit her for a day and have her right back where things started. I feel really horrible for saying this, but I want out, I canâ€™t deal with the additional stress in my life. I really want to see her get reliable help, and her fiancÃ© doesnâ€™t seem capable of caring for her in any way. She has issues staying on the medication prescribed to her as she is unemployed and apparently unable to fill her prescriptions in the city in which she lives. 
I donâ€™t know who to talk to about providing her help, sheâ€™s been committed involuntarily before and that seemed to really help, she mellowed out and was far more stable, but when she got out she was back to the same old shit within a matter of days. 
Help me help my friend, what can or should I do? My gut tells me itâ€™s time to cut ties and stop caring, but my mind tells me that will only end badly.
