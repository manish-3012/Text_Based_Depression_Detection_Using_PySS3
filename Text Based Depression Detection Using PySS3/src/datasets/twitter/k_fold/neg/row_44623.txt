The only thing keeping me from killing myself is those around meEvery single day for the past 3 months since getting lasik surgery I have wanted to kill myself. Unable to live with the guilt and regret of choosing this surgery and having it go wrong, I feel that the only way out of this situation is death.  

I am not afraid of death or dying, infact it brings me comfort just to think about it. 

The only thing keeping me from ending it all is my family, who would be devastated if I were to end it all. 

God damn it!
