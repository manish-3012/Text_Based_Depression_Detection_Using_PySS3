please helpthis depression is crippling. i feel so alone and trapped. i go to a college that i really dont like and i have so much work and im so stressed. i just want to go home and be in my bed with my cat.

 i've been sitting here for 3 hours crying deciding whether or not to just end it. everyone would be so surprised and maybe they would finally notice that things hurt. my boyfriend is no help because he admits he has no sense of emotions (which i really think is just him suppressing them but whatever). i feel like i;m going crazy. i dont know where to turn. i dont want to scare my friends. i dont want to die but i dont want to be here anymore. i might do it tonight. probably will take pills and cut my wrists if i go through with it
