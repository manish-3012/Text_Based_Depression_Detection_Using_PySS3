I've just seen someone saying they've just cut their wrists and their last goodbyes in a post on a subreddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/c5yke5/goodbye/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/c5yke5/goodbye/) 

I called 999 and gave them their username but they didn't say what they will do or if they even can help in time or EVEN AT ALL, so I don't know. Can I or you help somehow find who they are to be able to send help to them? Or somehow help in any such way or any other way?

I also messaged her directly and left comments on her post. But I don't know how she/he is, so I'm still very worried.

Thank you.
