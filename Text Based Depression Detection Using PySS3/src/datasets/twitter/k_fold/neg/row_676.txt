I just need to get things off of my chest before I do it.I can't take life anymore, it fucking hurts me to go through everyday. My life is fucking shit, I'm poor. I hate it. Most of the time I can't afford food, I'm living in a two bedroom fucking house with five other people. The only reason I can get on the internet it because we all pitch in on it. The only people left in this word that I have are my brothers, no friends. I know life will never be any fucking different for me, I can't afford college, hell I can barely make it through High-school. I'm a fucking poor idiot, i don't want to live like this forever and I think the only way to stop living like this is to just stop living all together.
