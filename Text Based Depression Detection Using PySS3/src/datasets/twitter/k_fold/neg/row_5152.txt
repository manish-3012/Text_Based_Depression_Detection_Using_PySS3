If I could disappearI told my SO that I just want to disappear. I would love to close my eyes and never have to open them again. I'm falling apart and quickly breaking into pieces. I think of suicide more than I admit to my therapist. I'm too much of a chicken to shoot myself or to cut.. just taking those sleepimg pills and slowly drifting away... It's all I think about anymore, I never sleep I just lay staring at my bathroom door where the bottle is... Taunting me telling me I'm toI chicken to actually off myself.
