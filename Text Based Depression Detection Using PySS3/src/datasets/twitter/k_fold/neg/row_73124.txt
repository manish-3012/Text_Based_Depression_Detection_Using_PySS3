I'm goingI'm afraid I'm going to die. I've thought about it a bit. I took zoplicone with alcohol and I know now I have to kill myself.  I wrote it all down why.
I messed it up everything all of it ever. There that's mature and rational sounding. But there we have it. 
I don't think I'll be going like my namesake because I don't feel it's fair. 
But this world just isn't for me.  I don't believe in anything after life but the nothingness there will be peaceful and quiet and all I ever wanted and at last I'll be perfect. 
I don't think I will need support. I guess just need to say goodbye.
