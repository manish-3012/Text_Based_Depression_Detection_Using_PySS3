What about my pain?One thing that always stops me from following through on my ideation is the pain it'll leave my loved ones with, especially my parents. The other is that I'm afraid of how painful dying will be. But what if my parents are the ones who have led me to this? Do they deserve that pain then? I don't have it in me to hurt them even tho they've caused me the most pain in my life. I don't want anyone to hurt bcuz of me. But what about my hurt? I don't know how to feel about it anymore
