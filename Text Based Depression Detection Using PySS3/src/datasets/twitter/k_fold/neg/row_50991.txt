I'm just so tired. I'm just so sadI am in a constant state of unrest. I just want to die. I know that's not what mothers and wives are supposed to think but I know it would be easier for my kid and SO. He wouldn't ever have to be considerate again. He could just do the $hit he does with zero worry. My son wouldn't grow up watching a shitty family dynamic, he might turn out alright. Today is a pretty horrible feeling day. I really wish I could stop the feeling of wanting to die. I feel so sick. I'm just so so tired. 

I'm just so sad. I'm not who I want to be. I'm not where I want to be. This is now how I envisioned my life.
