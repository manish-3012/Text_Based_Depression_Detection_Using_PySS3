I usually donâ€™t admit that I was about to kill myself but this I feel needed to be said.I was just in my bathroom, gun in hand, saying to my self â€œwho would care? Iâ€™m a burden on everyoneâ€. Then my one 3 legged cat came in and jumped on me and nudged my hand that had the gun in it with force. He was purring so loud and started meowing at the top of his lungs. I now know that what I did was stupid but I needed to vent. He just saved my life.
