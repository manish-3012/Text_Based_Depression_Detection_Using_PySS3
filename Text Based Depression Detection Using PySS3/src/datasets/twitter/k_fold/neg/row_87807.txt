What does it mean to "deserve" to be alive?I'm a very idealistic and empathetic person, which will probably be my downfall. I'm a college student (old for my year... I've been in school for a while). In one of the organizations I'm in, I heard a lot of people express that they didn't feel respected by the organization as a whole. I had similar feelings, so I decided to speak up about it and suggest that we work towards changing our organizational culture for the better. I basically asked for us to make more of an effort to be kind to each other. I didn't expect so much drama to come from that. Two people thought that my words were an open attack on them and made me out to be a terrible, hateful person who starts drama for no reason. People respect me even less now and since then, I've spent every day wishing my pain would end. 

The point is that if my empathy and my desire to make things better make me such a horrible person, then do I really deserve to live? What does it mean to "deserve" to be alive? How can I convince myself that I deserve such things?
