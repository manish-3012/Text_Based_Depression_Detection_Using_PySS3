i just want to be noticedi have PTSD from growing up in an abusive household and being bullied through school. (the ridiculous kind of bullying where people tell you to kill yourself and send you instructions) so, i think that gives you the idea hopefully that i don't have any friends now since. i was engaged to a guy who always put himself before me, and so did i. i broke it off because i was tired of coming second. im mad at myself and him and i can't help but feel like i wasted 3 yrs of my life when it could have gone to helping me. i dont really have anyone anymore and i dont feel like the people around in my life would notice or care if they knew how i felt right now. im so embarrassed and ashamed being 25 and not getting better with my mental health. ive had quite a few big blows to my self esteem lately, but nobody's stopped to say anything about it. idk if they think i can just handle it, but i can't.

i've already deactivated social media and any way for people to contact me. i keep thinking of new ways to disappear. oding, drowning, taking a bus to a random town and just walking until i die, maybe following some of the instructions given to me, idk.

i dont want to keep phasing out and feeling like a ghost in everyones life right now, i just want someone to notice that im in pain before everyone acts surprised and says "I never expected her to do that, she was such a happy girl" why am i so desperate right now? its embarrassing
