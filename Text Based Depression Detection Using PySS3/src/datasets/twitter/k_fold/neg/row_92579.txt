I don't really see the point in it, but can't actually end it.Life for me has never really been good.
 I was born into poverty. To the point where we had to steal food just to survive. Shitty clothes, shitty one bedroom apartment for most of my childhood.  We eventually had a place. Shitty and falling apart. Alot like my life. Only reason we had it was because my mom was dating some complete asshole who had a house. 
 In school I did absolutely horrendous and barely passed even after going to an alternative school, basically for idiotic teens who couldn't make it through regular school. I had a few girlfriends in school but nothing that lasted, except for one. Went on for a year before I found out she was cheating on me almost the entire time. I have one friend. And even she seems to be drifting off into the eather. No one seems to be able to stand me for very long.
 Even though the rest of my family is fairly attractive I just got beat with the ugly stick.
  Now I am where I am now. Working some shitty underpaid job that is going nowhere fast. Alone, most likely for the rest of my hopefully short life, and really just not seeing the point in any of it. Life has always been against me and seems like it is never going to change. I am a pile of shit through and through and everyone seems to cement that fact in my head.
