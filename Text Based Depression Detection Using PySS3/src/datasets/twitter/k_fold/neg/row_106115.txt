I don't care if I'm loved if i can't feel it.What if someone kept feeding you sugar or something saying it was good and so sweet and glorious but you had a phsyical issue that negated your sense of tasting sweetness? You never tasted the good, just the grainy painful shit like sand that never nourished.

That's how I feel when people say "don't go, you are loved."

I know I'm loved.

I know its sugar.

I can't feel it.

I can't taste it.

The only reason I stay alive when people say "you are loved" is GUILT. Isn't that fucked up? You're guilting me into suffering more because that makes you happy somehow? Either find a reason that makes sense to my brain or turn your back and let me fucking die already!
