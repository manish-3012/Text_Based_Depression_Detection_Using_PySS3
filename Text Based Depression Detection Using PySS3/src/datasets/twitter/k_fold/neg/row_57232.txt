Please help me. Just listen. Something.I really don't want to die, but too many things keep going through my head and I can't stop. It's been a terrible day at work, bad enough that I had to take a coaching and leave just to get away. I have no one home, no one to talk to. My boyfriend and I are going through some rough patches and he's not supportive in the ways I need. He won't comfort me when I cry and his anger issues get in the way of most of our serious conversations. My family is horrible. My friends are gone. Just typing this, I keep crying. Please god, someone help me.  It's pathetic but I don't want to be here anymore. I just want to go away. All of these things from past fights and my person history keep ringing in my head and I just...I can't even find the words anymore to say how I feel. I really can't. I just want to be done. It's taking me forever to write because I keep bawling and crying. Just help. Please. I don't know how but please. I just want to stop crying and i can't bottle it up anymore. Please.
