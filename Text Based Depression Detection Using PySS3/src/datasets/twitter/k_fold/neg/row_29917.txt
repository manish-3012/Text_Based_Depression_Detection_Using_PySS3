Theyâ€™re determined to keep me alive, but only so they can hurt me more.My parents have taken over my life. I didnâ€™t live with them for years, but after being hospitalized after a suicide attempt Iâ€™ve been forced to move back in with them.

Itâ€™s been over a year and they still watch me like a hawk. Anytime Iâ€™m not happy-go-lucky with a big shit eating grin on my face, they drill me with questions. â€œAre you hurting yourself again? Why are you not smiling? Do you need to go back? Why canâ€™t you at least TRY to be happy?â€

Then whenever I am truly feeling optimistic, they find ways to tear me down. â€œWow, you finally laugh and it wasnâ€™t even that funny. Why do you even bother to shower if you always smell like your cat anyway? Haha, youâ€™re going to be living with your parents when you are 30, how does that make you feel?â€

Iâ€™m only asking for one thing and I will never get it. Either let me live in peace or let me die in peace. Preferably the latter.
