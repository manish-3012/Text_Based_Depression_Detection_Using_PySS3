They took my medication away.The thing is, I still have the same problems. Depression, anxiety, pain. They wonder why I act out. The reason is that every night is a battle to sleep, every day is a fight with pain and anxiety. They know I'm a big wimp. That I'm afraid of pain. I have one way left that may work, but all I really want is for someone to notice me and take me seriously. How do I do that? They all think I'm some sort of big drug abuser now. I stopped eating for 2 weeks, and no one noticed. The shrink made it seem like it was all my fault. Please, just notice me...
