I've made a decisionIn the next couple weeks I'm going to finally do it. I've waited 5 years, and finally have the courage. Holy shit I'm so excited, you have no idea how long I've wanted to do this. 

 But I don't know how to go about it. I don't have access to sleeping pills to overdose, so I'm thinking about drowning. Any tips?
