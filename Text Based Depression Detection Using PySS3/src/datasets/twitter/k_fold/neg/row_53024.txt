Iâ€™m still alive and itâ€™s ruining my dayIâ€™ve been doing better in my life but I just keep having these moments where Iâ€™m reminded that Iâ€™m still not dead. Like I still have to deal with this shit. Breathing, sleeping, eating. It all drains me. People have promised me that they wouldâ€™ve killed me by now and in all honesty Iâ€™ve never been angrier at a broken promise.
