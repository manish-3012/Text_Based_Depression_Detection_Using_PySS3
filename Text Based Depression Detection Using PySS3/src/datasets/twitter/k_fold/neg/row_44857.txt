Hanging myself tonight when everyone goes to bed..I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m sorry to all of my family, my kids... but they are far better without me. 
Iâ€™m tired of going on. For the 23 years Iâ€™ve been alive, I have never been truly happy. Since I was 4 years old I was just made to be sexually abused. At the hands of my biological father and so many others in my life. I never understood what was wrong with me. Why I was constantly targeted by men. Always sexually subjectified even as a young girl.. I became using serious drugs at only 12. Starting cutting myself even earlier.. I hate myself and who Iâ€™ve become. Someone who is weak. All I do is think negatively. It eats away at my soul and there is nothing positive left inside me. I feel so bad for everyone who has known me. Iâ€™m just a piece of shit and they all know it. The only thing that I have to offer anyone is my appearence.. thatâ€™s all anyone cares about. I canâ€™t tell you how many stalkers Iâ€™ve had at every job Iâ€™ve worked. Iâ€™ve been taped by a bestfriend. Raped by my dad since a child and continually. Molested. Physically abused by ex boyfriends. I canâ€™t take this pain anymore. I canâ€™t talk to anyone about how angry I am and how much I truly hate myself because they donâ€™t want to hear it. But I canâ€™t keep it in anymore..... my babyâ€™s dad hates me and thinks Iâ€™m a whore with nothing to offer anyone. And I believe that. Iâ€™ve given men what they want at the expense of my own emotions. I am physically numb in my body. I donâ€™t enjoy anything in life. I never want to eat.. Each day Iâ€™m fading away. I have numerous health problems and none of the doctors can help me. Had an appointment for over 6 months at Stanford,the other day, showed up to find out I couldnâ€™t be seen.. I have the worst luck guys. I no longer want to fight for my health. I give up. So this is my goodbye. Iâ€™m sorry and I wish I had the strength in me to not let go but Iâ€™ve been holding this rope for years. Iâ€™ve lost my grip now. This beautiful world will be missed. But I wonâ€™t miss living in it with this body and mind.
