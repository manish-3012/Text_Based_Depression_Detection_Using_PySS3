I hope you don't care.I'm sorry, really, I'm sorry to whoever finds me in such a shit situation, whoever hears the shot ring, whoever rushes to my aid despite hearing the thud, whoever feels guilt over this, I would say nobody's guilty, but dad for fucks sake don't leave a  gun lying around, safety off, for Clark's sake. And, Clark, please continue to be the amazing person you are, please, the amount of times you've talked me down...it's unbelievable, don't stop something just because I'm gone. Eve, if word of this ever gets to you, it probably will, over the intercom, but regardless they won't read my note, thanks, thanks for trying to shed light on my situation, thanks for giving the friendly smile I haven't seen in years, thanks for just trying to ignore my depressing comments. My suicide probably seems selfish, and you're right, it is, I couldn't shrug off something, it just weighed me down, until I couldn't take it anymore.
I'm sorry, genuinely sorry, the last 14 years with me have been shit, think of all the rest to come that won't!
