I donâ€™t want to be usefulIâ€™m not a useful person. Iâ€™m not trying to insult myself, and I donâ€™t even think itâ€™s wrong, itâ€™s just not compatible with society. I donâ€™t plan on becoming useful in the future and donâ€™t do well with any responsibility(so highly doubt that I *could* become useful in the future). I have a personality disorder that there isnâ€™t really effective treatment for because nobody cares about this one since we are not out there acting destructively towards others(for the most part). So I will likely have it always. 

Anyhow, useless people piss everyone off because others only like people who are useful to them. Iâ€™m not really able to make real connections with people, and I donâ€™t wish to(nor do I think itâ€™s a skill I can develop. Thereâ€™s something missing about me). People keep trying to take care of me and then getting pissed when Iâ€™m not pitching in. Fair enough, donâ€™t take care of me, but then I will just let myself die because I am not interested in taking on that work. I donâ€™t want the responsibility of being a person but everyone keeps forcing it on me. I donâ€™t just mean a job, but eating, cleaning, even moving sometimes. When Iâ€™m left alone I just listen to music and walk which are the only activities I enjoy. 

I know Iâ€™m not a good person but I donâ€™t want to be better and I donâ€™t feel a responsibility towards myself or towards others. To make it worse, I have two kids. I donâ€™t like being a mom but I do take care of the basics(feeding, school stuff, bed, cleanliness). I am not great at any of it though and resent that there are people in my space. Terrible, I know.  Iâ€™ve thought a lot about maybe starving myself since I dislike eating anyhow. But it seems so slow and Iâ€™m 99% sure Iâ€™ll just end up being force-fed and that sounds horrid. And I have a ton of Zoloft and some other psych drug which I never took since I refuse to be medicated. Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™d work and donâ€™t want to just end up making myself sick. I guess Iâ€™m not entirely sure how yet, but I do know it will happen eventually.
