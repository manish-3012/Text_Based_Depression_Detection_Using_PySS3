It's exhaustingI've struggled with suicidal thoughts for 14 years, I'm only 19. I'm working hard for finals at school but what am I working towards? I feel like a polluted, sick human being. I was molested and it has festered inside me and twisted me into something with no hope for the future.  

I finally pursued therapy but can't get a second appointment until september and I don't know if I can make it.
