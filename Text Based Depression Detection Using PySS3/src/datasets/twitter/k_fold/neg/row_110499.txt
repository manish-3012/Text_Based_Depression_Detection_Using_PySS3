Iâ€™m 19, I have no friends. Whatâ€™s the point anymore?My entire life I feel like Iâ€™ve had one failed friendship over another. Iâ€™ve had close friends, but they all end up leaving my side for one reason or another. Iâ€™m assuming itâ€™s me. People tend to say Iâ€™m draining, but I just talk a lot because Iâ€™m so genuinely overjoyed when thereâ€™s people around me. Lately, all I do is work 45-55 hours a week, hang out with my boyfriend (who Iâ€™ve been with for over a year now), and sleep. I love my boyfriend, so very much, but I feel like all I do is let him down. I feel hopelessly sad sometimes, and I just cry and cry. He just doesnâ€™t understand it and takes it as me not getting enough from him. Iâ€™m just not enough for anyone. Iâ€™ve been wanting to die a lot lately. I cut myself for 6 years and itâ€™s been so long since Iâ€™ve done it, but lately itâ€™s driving me crazy. I just want friends. I just want people to enjoy hanging around me. I just want to experience a sleepover, or a night out at a party with friends, or even just someone who will come over and chat with me when Iâ€™m feeling down.. how do I make friends? Why canâ€™t people just like me? Maybe I try too hard?? I just know dying would be so easy because so many people donâ€™t even know I exist.
