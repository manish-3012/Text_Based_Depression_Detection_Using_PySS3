The day is setFebruary 23, 2018.  It'll be 10 years...10 long years.

1000 days from now I will kill myself.  I honestly have tears streaming down my face as I write this because I know it's true.

It doesn't matter how successful I become - all I want to do is end my life.  No one realizes the pain I have been in.  On one side I am successful professional in his mid 20s who is moving up the ranks.  Internally I am torn, pathetic, and a shell of a man.  I have no one I can confide in or trust.  Even if I did, I couldn't tell them as I don't want them to have this burden.  Moreover, they wouldn't view me the same.  

I'm sorry Reddit, I'm sorry familia, I'm sorry hermano, I'm sorry to all those whose lives I have ever touched.
