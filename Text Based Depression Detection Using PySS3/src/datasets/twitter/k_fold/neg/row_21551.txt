I would never kill myself, but I often think about how nice it would be if all my problems went away. Should I seek help?I'm married and have kids and I would never do it because I know how it would make them feel, but sometimes I feel like I am letting them down. I've been struggling with my career for about 6-7 years now. I have ADHD and anxiety that has caused some stress, though I usually manage it really well. Recently things have gotten much more difficult due to a downturn and am having to move my family for the 5th time in 2 years. I've decided to go back to school and finish my degree, but i'm scared that another failure is going to crush me.

I've noticed that I frequently (2-3 times a week) am hating myself and think that if I died all this daily stress would go away. I've broken down sobbing a few times in the last month and get minor panic attacks often before bed. I try to hide this stuff as much as I can from my wife so she doesn't have to shoulder my depression. She is amazing and really comforts me. My son (2 year old) sometimes comes up to me, hugs me and says "daddy, are you sad?". All this stuff REALLY helps, but sometimes I feel like I'm dragging them down and they would be so much better without me. I know though that me going away would do so much more harm than good.

Like I said, I 100% don't want to kill myself. In my head I know I would never do it, but I still catch myself thinking about it often. I just want to make sure that something like this doesn't slowly turn into something more dangerous and figure out if I am walking a dangerous path. Should I seek help?

Thank you for listening and putting this into words feels like a huge weight off my chest.
