I think I might be done soon.It's just starting to become too much. Within the last few years, more like ten, I just feel like noone understands me and its time for me to just go. I don't know if that means to cut everyone out of my life and move far away, or to just end my life. But ending my life is so much simpler than packing and explaining why noone will be able to talk to me or why I have decided what I have. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just lost and feel like venting so I apologize for the wall of text you are about to read if you do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have CPTSD that was caused by long term abuse by a family member. This was sexual, physical, and emotional. Long term is related to 3-5 years, I cannot remember exact dates or age but I know it happened for a long time, everyday, and it has destroyed my adult self. I was medicating myself with marijuana illegally and when I got into trouble I had this "awakening" or whatever and started to stay away from it. The downside of medicating yourself is that the emotions or feelings that you would have normally felt was all suppressed by the intoxicating effects of happiness from the weed. Someone with my mental health has found this relief very addictive since it took me away from my troubles or struggles or things that I was just tired of handling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once I stopped smoking weed, all of the suppression started to surface, like anger. I am a calm person, my CPTSD has me locked into a shell or commonly known as dissocialization. Basically, dissocialization makes the person numb to their surroundings, sensory. Noises sounds like you are under water and you cannot focus, and when you do, the other background noise becomes overriding, and say that someone tries to talk to you, you kind of freak out on them such as yelling or getting agitated or such. 

These type of feelings were new to me since I had stopped smoking weed. And when I get the most perfect GF, she experiences this bad side of me. I lied to her about smoking weed, and when she found out she asked me to stop, so I did and that's when a lot of the problems started. We started fighting and that was the worst cause I have never fought before. Then one day she smacked me. And it had put me in this stage of almost blackout and I smacked back. It was horrible. Please don't give me a hate speech about this, and judge me for it, I didn't mean for it to happen but it was a trigger to my CPTSD and I had lost function of thinking before action and I had reacted. I know it wasn't hard, I apologized and she even said it wasn't hard and that it just startled her. But it startled me to because I am a firm believer in men should not hit women and I had just broken it. 

&amp;#x200B;

We talked about my CPTSD and I explained everything that I was going through. She had asked me to go to a therapist and my reaction to it was why would I want to talk about rape to a stranger when it was hard enough trying to talk to you about it. Not just one rape, years worth of rape, not by a stranger but by a family member. And the thing is, is at this time there was no such thing as a boy getting raped or at least not talked about. Like if it happens, then a boy should just keep his mouth closed about it, and that's exactly what I was taught by my family. Like that trauma doesn't matter to a boy. It's just all effed up.  So anyways, I decided the therapist and told her my reasons and she insisted that I go, and every fight this was brought up. How me and my "abuser" should just go F\*\*\* each other using perfume (thats how it happened) and it's a constant trigger. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are talking about triggers, and you remember what happened with the first trigger, so know you probably want to ask if have I hit her more than once. Yes, I have. Because of verbal? No. All my physical abuse towards her was caused by physical abuse towards me. There was once that I saw her left leg jump up, almost like she was going to knee me in my groin, and in response, I had kicked her leg. If you are a guy, you know if a girl is going to knee you, you lift your leg in a way to cover yourself. My leg did that but mine reacted in a different way and made contact. Did it hurt her, yes it did and I spent the whole weekend holding and crying with her trying to apologize. Again, this was horrible and this is why I remember details about it. If I didn't care then I wouldn't remember. So we talked about seeing a therapist and I agreed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started talking about it, about my life, about everything and I was remembering a lot more, and it hurt more and it devastated me more. I became more agitated more easily, angry that with the ten years of knowing this girl, she never had a job, nor wanted to help me financially at all. Never helped with laundry, never did anything to support me. She ended up fighting with me and threw urine on me. Pulled down her pants, cupped her hand, urinated, and threw it in my face. Practically because I wanted to go to sleep. Now I know what your thinking, but I'm actually proud of this knowing that my emotions have just effed with me when it comes to this girl. But I actually laughed and did nothing. I wasn't mad about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months later, she threatened suicide. She knows how I feel about it and its nothing but negative. Like, with all the stuff that I've been through, what makes you feel like you need to kill yourself? Stuff like that, that is how I think. It's like, I was raped 100s of times, beaten thousands of times, and verbally assualted millions and you want the easy way out? She has done this a lot throughout our relationship and at first I was like don't do it, you are worth more than that, and after the 6th or 7th time it was more like, stop saying that sh\*\*. Well again, months later she threatened it and ran into the bathroom. This was a scare tactic cause thats just how she plays her game, been through it 100s of times with her at this point and I just lost it. I gave it back to her. I pretended to swallow a 500 count of IBu and she called the cops on me. At that point, everything checked out that I was okay but they sent her to the mental hospital for having razor indents on her skin where she tried to cut. I moved back home. 

&amp;#x200B;

We talked and I would visit her, and she ends up pregnant. After 10 years, she ends up pregnant with what I think is my child. And throughout this whole thing, she fights with me about moving back. I tell her no. My mom is sick, she weighed 70 pounds and we had her gain to over 150. And it was just a constant fight about moving and I would continue to say no because of my mom. Well my mom ended up having a stroke and she still asked when I was moving. While my mom is locked in a coma, can't breath on her own, she wants to talk about moving? I found it very disrespectful for the situation. Well, short story, my mom passed and she continued to asked when I was moving. But I can't support a move because I had just spent 9+ thousand dollars on a funeral because none of that was arranged. 

&amp;#x200B;

Baby is born. I show up and everything is great but I forget to sign the birth cert. And I brought it up a few days later after I get back home and she gets back home and she said that she told the hospital that I was a friend and not the father so that I wouldn't be able to sign. I agreed that the baby could keep her last name, even though its against almost everything I believe in, I agreed on not going to court, I agreed on everything that she asked, even no visitation since we live in different states. But not signing the birth cert on a child? That's like a last straw for me. She agitates my CPTSD with comments about it, agitates fights, constantly downs me, then says that I can't be on the birth cert. I'm devastated. And now, I'm writing this because I really feel like its the end. My family wants me to fight for custody now, and I'm against taking children away from moms but they are being very hateful about my decision and are threatening CS to get involved resulting in the child not being in either arms. Its like wtf. So I'm thinking, if I'm out of the picture, what fuel do they have? They can't hurt my boy, I don't have to worry about a name, the mother gets what she wants, everyone wins, and I just sleep for a long time. Which I like sleeping, its like my most favorite time because I can be whoever I want to be and do whatever I want to do. And when I'm awake, I have to deal with this sh\*\*, people playing with my mental condition and not caring knowing that it exists. Taking advantage of me because I have a huge heart.  But basically at this point, fuck it, I'm done you know?

&amp;#x200B;

Well thats the story and I needed to get that off my chest. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you were wondering and still pondering about my abusiveness. It's been close to 4 years since I have touched her in a negative way and I have been around her a lot since then. My therapy ended up helping my violent tendencies and they started to become more under control. Also I've been using CBD oil to help with my disorder. Please don't judge me for it, I was just in a bad spot and needed help but not wanting it. Bothers me a lot :/
