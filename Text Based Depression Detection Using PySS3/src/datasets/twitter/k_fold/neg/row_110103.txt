I humbly request my bones to be salted and burned.If anyone gets the reference in the title, I applaud you :D

Before anyone starts reading, this isn't really a cry for help or anything. I just would like to write my thoughts down and put it on SW. I'm not really good with all this stuff, but here goes.

So during my years in high school, I was existentially depressed. I could not find a reason to live, and didn't really care for one. I just wanted to commit suicide because I felt like life was unbearable. The reason existentialism and depression came into my life? A girl, as many of you will find to be a very common catalyst. But over the course of 4-5 years, I just stopped feeling anything. After our last and final break up, I felt the existentialism come with me, but my depression did not. I believe this was caused by emotional walls my mind had set up to protect me in its own way. It was very convenient; I now feel little to nothing. But because of those walls and my now wanton abandon for my life, I was able to enjoy many things.

Now, to the meat of what I wanted to say. I am going to commit suicide. Not because I'm sad, no. I am happy and fulfilled with my life as it is, and don't care to experience much more years. Much like the genius teenager Dario Iacoponi, I cannot find enough pros to outweigh the cons of extending my life. I plan to commit suicide within the next three years, which may seem like a long time, but it will be enough time to build something of myself and either allow me the time to find a reason to live, or to be able to leave something to my dearest friends and family when I am dead.

Also, if anyone is willing; I'm pretty open to discussion, and if anyone feels like they can bring something to the table that'll help me want to live or maybe just want to chat for fun, feel free to shoot me a PM or even comment here.

Thanks for reading.
