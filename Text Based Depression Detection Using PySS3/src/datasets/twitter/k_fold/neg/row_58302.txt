My own faultI fucked up a 12 year relationship and now I'm done. 12 years 1 kid and I messed it up. She's leaving after lock down and now all I can think about is the easiest way I can get out of everyone's way.

I'm not a good person never have been. I just need it to be done but I don't know how to do it.

Once they're out of the house it'll be easier but I still don't know how.
