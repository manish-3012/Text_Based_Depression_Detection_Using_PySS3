Haw haw haw, farewellI laugh, and i laugh a lot, i laugh so much i have developed smile mask syndrome, iâ€™m shaking as iâ€™m typing this. Iâ€™m crying as iâ€™m typing this. Iâ€™m laughing as iâ€™m typing this. Iâ€™m self-harming as iâ€™m typing this. It just feels so good, all the cuts on my arms. The blood is dripping on my phone, this might be a farewell. Hi there, iâ€™m a 16 yo, but out of iq tests and other official declarations i dont care about iâ€™m above average intelligence wich is just fucking annoying, iâ€™m diffrent, i like different music, i have different hobbies, i wear different clothing, i have an what people call here an â€˜old school social personalityâ€™. Iâ€™m a nice person but i absolutely despise myself. My life is all about music and iâ€™m not one of those kids whose fav song is something ed sheeran and cant play any instrument, no iâ€™m a multi instrumentalist, iâ€™m laughing to myself now. Why am i telling this, i donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t have any friends because iâ€™m different. Iâ€™m constantly crying, constantly laughing, constantly sick. I could ramble on about whats wrong with the world but it isnâ€™t worth it, this might be a farewell.
