My car is totaled, I canâ€™t drive and I want to die.My car is officially out of commission. After a small fender bender last week, my radiator has started leaking as of today and on my way home to prevent further damage from my car overheating. the hood of my car flew up and SHATTERED MY WINDSHIELD ON THE HIGHWAY. I donâ€™t know what to do, I feel like a fucking idiot for not towing it instead of driving it just because it appeared okay to drive still. I canâ€™t take this anymore. I told my friend and he was quick to tell me what I shouldâ€™ve done from the start, towing it instead of driving a damaged car.

I admit it was my fault for making that stupid decision, but I didnâ€™t have the money to even tow it, much less get another car. And now Iâ€™m forced to find a rental car or something soon or iâ€™m going to run out of money, in which case Iâ€™ll be dutifully evicted and back to square one. Iâ€™m such a dumb fucking failure. And Iâ€™m not saying that to gain sympathy, I truly am a magnificent fuck-up. I donâ€™t know if I should be happy I survived or not.
