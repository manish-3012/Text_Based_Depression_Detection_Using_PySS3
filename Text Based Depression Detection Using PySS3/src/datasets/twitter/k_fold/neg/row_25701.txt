Question about Klonopen/Clonazapam overdosesIf this doesn't belong here, I understand and I'm sorry!


I've managed to steal 22 of my old Klonopen/Clonazapam pills (a long-acting benzo). I say "steal" and "my" because they are mine and I gave them to my mom a few years ago (after about a year of not taking them because they didn't help) because I planned to OD with them but was unsure. She's been taking them recreationally and I've always had them there as my backup plan but she's going through them like candy so I took a handful and hid them. 

Anyway! 22 pills, 1 mg each = 22 mg. Would that be enough to do it or would I just take a really long nap? Google says the "max dose" is 25 mg and I used to take half a pill every day (4 years ago) Is 22 mg enough or should I grab some more? Also, what OTC pills can you OD on? Ibuprofen, benadryl, etc. I've got bottles of Ibuprofen/Naproxen laying around the house waiting for me to swallow lol

I'm not planning it (yet) but I'd like to have a plan in place so if I do, I'll have the resources.
