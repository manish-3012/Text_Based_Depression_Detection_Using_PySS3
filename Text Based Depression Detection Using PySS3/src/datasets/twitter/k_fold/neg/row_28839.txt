Made a noise for the terrible things Iâ€™ve doneIâ€™m a horrible person who has done terrible things. I donâ€™t know why they happened, beyond my own emotional trauma and pathetic insecurities. I just know they make me horrible. As much as my mind fights me to make me think Iâ€™m a good and just troubled person who can be better, I donâ€™t want to anymore. Iâ€™m done. I made a noose out of extension cord and a shoelace. Iâ€™m thinking I might toss it over an emergency sprinkler sticking out of the wall in my room. Iâ€™m in a single at my school so no one will be traumatized to come home and find my body. I may post on my Instagram story right before Iâ€™m about to do it. I know there are people who wonâ€™t talk to me anymore who will see it, I like to wonder what they might think but it wonâ€™t matter. Maybe theyâ€™d want me to do it. Iâ€™m taking myself out of this world to make it better for everyone else. I hope anyone Iâ€™ve hurt will feel relief. Iâ€™m scared, terribly freaking scared, of dying, but it will at least be the bravest thing Iâ€™ve ever done.
