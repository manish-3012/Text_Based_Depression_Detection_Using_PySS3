i am my own biggest problemHello, i tried (obviously failed) to commit suicide on sunday morning. I've felt like the piece of shit of the earth for some years now. The feelings have elevated in the last few weeks. I feel so bad all the time. I skipped on my last classes on monday, and that's the last time i went to school, because i just couldn't handle it. I can't focus enough to study. All i can think about is what  a fuck up i am, and how should i end this. Today was a terrible day too, i cried hysterically for a few hours and ruined another one of my belts. I'm so tired. I am very isolated, i have no friends. I don't think i'm capable of going back to school, everything is already majorly fucked up there as well. I just want to escape myself. life is too much of a hassle. i was thinking about going to a psychatrist and getting checked in or something but i'm not sure if its serious enough, and maybe it would just cause me more problems. I cant imagine talking to my parent about this, ever really.
I'm not sure why i'm writing this. If anyone wants to talk on skype, i can give more information its easier for me that way, then pm or something.
