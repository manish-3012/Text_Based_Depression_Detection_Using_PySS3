Spent my new years having a meltdown at a party..God I hate my life so fucking much, drank way way too much, now it's 4am music still going and I've just headed up to the house owners bedroom to attempt to cry myself to sleep as I can't stand the site of others cuddling each other, fucking kills me. God I hate being so so lonely and I just want to kill myself so badly. I had a meltdown Infront of like 20 people basically telling them I want to die over and over :( things are never going to get better for me, I want to stab myself so so badly.
I'm sorry for venting I know I'm a pain in the ass in which nobody cares about, guess that's why I'm going to die alone.. fuck my existence ;( I hate my life
