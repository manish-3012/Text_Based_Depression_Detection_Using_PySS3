I might have been losing my health insurance and felt like I wanted to die...I have Autism, am currently on Medicare, and If I don't have health coverage I lose all the services that I need to function in everyday life. If I lose those services I felt like my life was going to never get better and I might as well just kill myself. I felt like I was useless to society and the world would've been better off without me. 

I was perfectly mentally healthy and happy before I found out about what was going on, and hadn't had thoughts of suicide before.

It ended up being a clerical Error, so everything is fine, but I wanted to post this because I was amazed how quickly I spiraled into those thoughts, and how hopeless I felt, and how if there had been nobody to help me sort it out I may have had to have somebody drive me to a mental institution, or call 911 before the thoughts turned into actions... It was really scary, I never thought I could have those thoughts...

I'm feeling completely fine now again that it is fixed, no longer having those thoughts. Just posting this to hopefully hear some kind words of support.
