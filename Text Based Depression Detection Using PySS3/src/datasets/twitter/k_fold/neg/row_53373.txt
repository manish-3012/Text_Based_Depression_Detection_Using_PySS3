Video games are my safe haven, but are seen as an addictionOkay, maybe I can agree that I play too much to the point where it is unhealthy, but video games offer me an alternate reality. I'd even say **opposite** reality, beacuse in video games my worth and efforts are recognized, I have friends and can get along with them, I love playing with them and just collaborating and having the multiplayer fun, that can also help developing teamwork and leadership skills.

However, some people, like my "family" (I can't call them parents and siblings, they are too inhuman towards me) think I'm simply addicted, but video games are my refuge from the abuse I suffer chronically from family, school, basically everywhere... The only thing that keeps me 1 inch away from suicide are video games. Beacuse nobody likes me, I'm physically unpleasant (I stopped worrying about the way I look so I only take a shower once a week and I don't shave my hair) I have terrible grades, the teachers also label me as dumb and useless (can't blame them, everyone does). Video games also distract me from my ringing inside my head (can't tell if this is tinnitus or something else, but it's an annoying sound inside my head that takes my attention away, and it also annoys me, so it also impacts my mood). I also have ADHD, and this depression, or, well, state of mind has been haunting me for the last five years***...***
