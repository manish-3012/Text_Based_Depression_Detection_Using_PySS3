Why?Why? Day in and day out i ask myself why. Why get out of bed, why hand out with friends/ family, why bother spending time with my girlfriend. And every day its harder and harder to come up with a satisfactory anwser.

Just about everything i do i fuck up somehow or piss someone off and its been like this for almost 20 years now. No matter how hard i try no matter how much i focus something goes wrong. i'm just tired or hating mysself. I'm tired of having no motivation in life anymore because everything i do it will somehow backfire. 

I'm 28 and i have failed out of college twice, live in a two bedroom apartment with my mother and girlfriend both of which im not sure if i love or hate them but eather way i disapoint them almost on a daily basis. I work at a shit whole job that is going nowhere. I'm a fat piece of shit that cant bother to get healthy. I am in so much debt there is little hope i will ever get out from under it. And something new everyday goes wrong, car breaks down, GF needs to be rushed to the hospital, mother manipulates me into giving her money i don't have. I would love to move but i cant afford a cheaper place and don't have anyone else to move in with. Can't leave the area because i dont have fuck all for money to get away with.

I have had depression since i was in middle school maybe earlier. I have tried pills, i've tried talking to shrinks, i've done the exersice  clean diet bullshit and none of it makes me feel better most of the time. i just can't do it anymore, or maybe i just don't want to anymore. when someone with depression says thier tired it really feels like your brain just does not want to stay on anymore. You fight with it just to do the basic mundain task you do in everyday life just to stay alive. 

But after all of these years dealing with this bullshit you just come to this realization that there is no magic pill to make all of this go away. There is no person out there that can give you the awnswers to why you hate living. You have to wake up everyday and anwser that why question and i just cant find a reason to anymore.
