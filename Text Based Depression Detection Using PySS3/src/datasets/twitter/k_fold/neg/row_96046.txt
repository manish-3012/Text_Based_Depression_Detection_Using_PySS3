Please just help, pleaseI feel tired and empty. Like a failure. Like I'll never amount to anything. Pathetic. Ignored. Worthless. I can't find the will to go on like this. All my reasons for not committing suicide don't work anymore. I don't have any. No one will care, they'll forget in a few years, if not months. I will never achieve anything no matter how hard I hope or try. I want someone to just give me a reason to stay alive, honestly. I want to stay alive but I'm so desperate to escape myself, I'm scared I'll actually do it
