My only friend died and I want to go with him.2 days ago, my only friend died and I still cannot accept that. He was my only friend, even though he was a cat.  I donâ€™t have anyone to talk about this other than my family and my family makes fun of my suicidal and self harming thoughts. Also, when I talk about my problems with them they say â€œThere are poor people, be thankfull to where you are.â€ , â€œHe was just a cat.â€ or â€œJust man up!â€ 
Also, I have to add that, even though it is a minor factor. I recently discovered that my crush has a boyfriend. I have to accept the fact that I will never get a girlfriend, but I cannot accept it. Everybody says that Iâ€™m attractive and handsome but I think they are just telling lies.
I will never be happy like other people my age.
There is no one who I can call â€œfriendâ€ and talk about this. He was my only friend. Iâ€™m going to jump off the bridge.
