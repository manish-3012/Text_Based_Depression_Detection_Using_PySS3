Having a group of like minded suicidal friends is helping me a lotBefore I had no one to talk about depression and suicide with but. But my circle of suicidal friends, who are always there to listen to me is helping me a lot. I think the fact that they are suicidal too makes itâ€™s better Bc they wonâ€™t judge me but they hear me out and relate. I named this group of friends the PSI club. It stands for passive suicidal ideation club.
