Package is arriving in tomorrow. I'm tired of being scared of my family and being so aloneIt feels right, awful but right. I dont have anyone and I'm burden to everyone with my problems. It feels good finally having a release from this joke of a life I have. 

Life has always been exhausting to me, with no end in sight. 

I've never been lucky or had someone care enough to stay or be a friend. I'm tired of constantly being in shitty situations. No one cares to help people like me. So we commit suicide or end up losing our minds

The only help we can get requires money, running away, finding a place, like it's so easy. I've been stuck for 24 years, in a way by choice, but what choice could I make when my brain doesn't function properly
