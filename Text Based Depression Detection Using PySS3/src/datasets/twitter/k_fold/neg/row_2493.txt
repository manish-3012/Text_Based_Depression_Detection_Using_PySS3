some days i just think i really should do iti can't believe the state my life is in right now and all the shit that happened and continues to happen. because i'm a fucking piece of shit, a crazy lazy worthless stupid useless piece of crap. i manage to make EVERYONE hate me, EVERYONE leaves me, i barely have no friends left, i fucked up and continue to fuck up almost every single relationship that i have with other human beings and everyone just fucking despises me. i don't matter, i probably never did. most people don't even remember i fucking exist. if i killed myself my family and 3 other people would be sad but so what? honestly they would all move on (except maybe my parents) and overall life would be better and easier without my stupid crazy ass to bother them with my stupid "problems". i've been feeling like the worst piece of shit in the planet for quite some time now and i'm taking a lot of meds that just make me even more crazy and fucked up and sedated, something happened that triggered me which is why i'm freaking out right now but i was already having a bad day and now i feel like i might just explode. i have therapy in 30 mins and as always i will just pretend everything is fine and i'm doing better because it's just easier that way. each day my desire to kill myself only gets stronger and stronger. people make me want to die.
