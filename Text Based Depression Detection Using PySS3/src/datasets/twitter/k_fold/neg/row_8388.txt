Iâ€™ve been struggling for the past few monthsIâ€™ve barely bee. Able to pull myself out everyday but I think the time has come. My grandma just offered to take the baby if baby isnâ€™t sick. Iâ€™ve deleted everything and nobody even checks on me so I donâ€™t have to worry about that. The only thing left to cover is where my cat will go to when Iâ€™m dead. Sadly thatâ€™s it I donâ€™t have really anything else to do beyond that to prepare. Maybe finish off my drug stash? But I donâ€™t want using to make me reconsider. Today I was going to had everything planned and right as Iâ€™m about to take my pills my grandma calls me and I had to bullshit through the convo and then had to call her back with a status update and bullshitted through that too. 

Everyone wants me dead except probably my grandma. I canâ€™t do this anymore I canâ€™t face daily life anymore and especially I am no where fit to raise a child alone. I know I am hated by everyone and used and I never will mean anything much to anyone. I feel my son will grow up and hate me so I canâ€™t bank on staying for him and thatâ€™s not the only reason. Iâ€™ve weighted out my reasons and Iâ€™ve been contemplating for months now but I am ready to go. I just for the first time really got scared over what will happen after I die? Will it hurt and would that ever matter if it did? I hope itâ€™s not dragged out for too long and I hope Iâ€™m not super aware of it all when I do. I just want to no longer be here. I am scared what will not being here anymore even feel like. I just remembered the time I popped a tiny artery (I think it was pulsing with my heartbeat and lots of blood from a tiny prick) I felt dizzy and really really peaceful and I only was treated  for the wound because my baby daddy was there. I want to feel that peace again
