I need a thought I've never had before, an idea of something to do, some other option than complete loss of meaning. Something different than the same old, "it gets better, or I care about you thing."In college debt, hate my degree, kept me from the only girl that might have actually been able to live the life I wanted with, I've already logically denied any meaning to my existence, drained, lots of family issues, lonely, angry, sad, anxiety, depression, bi-polar, poor, the world has a dark future, nature is the only thing I care about and it has lost the battle and I can't get a job protecting it. I figure the best thing I can do to save it is to take myself out of the equation to stop using anymore resources. All I have is my physical health and my literacy which has deteriorated with the depression and stress.  Maybe do it in the woods where the animals can use my body as nourishment.
