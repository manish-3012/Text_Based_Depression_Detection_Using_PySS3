I'm fucking scaredI'm a 21 year old dropout. I spend all my money on alcohol and weed. I don't know where to turn, I got to the point where I had to call a hotline, and they basically told me to fuck off. Now I'm sitting here contemplating my death.

I'm worrying about running out of alcohol because I'm gonna get bad withdrawals.

I'm sorry for the shit post, I have nowhere else to go.
