I missed the curve and now i know it's a dead end up ahead.I dropped out of engineering 2 years ago and this summer re-enrolled myself because no other options were remaining. (Parental pressure)
Very bad at math,and almost every subject.
Skipping classes and doing nothing.
Used to go to the gym regularly but can't go due to laziness and depression. Losing interest in almost everything at a rapid rate. 
It's all bleak and i think i might do it before this year ends.
After a certain point,you actually lose confidence in your own decisions. Because the skeptical society asks too many why's ?. And people like me buy it and under pressure we don't take any risks.
Maybe i missed alot of opportunities and lost a lot of time.
