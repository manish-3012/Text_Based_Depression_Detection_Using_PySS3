I failed my suicide attempt and all it taught me was how little the people around me careLast Monday (16th March) I tried to kill myself via overdose. I wonâ€™t say what or how much because I donâ€™t want anyone else to try. It was a hellish experience. I was taken to the hospital and spent all day writhing and screaming in the worst pain Iâ€™ve ever felt. It was so bad that I wasnâ€™t even aware of what was going on around me. Everything was a blur and all I knew was pain.

My mum was there. She wasnâ€™t behaving any differently to normal though. Maybe she was in shock or something but she hasnâ€™t said much about it since. Sheâ€™s been treating it the same way as if I were taken to hospital for self harm like I have a few times before.

I donâ€™t remember much from the Monday. Everything is hazy, my vision was blurry and I had no control over my body. I was either contorting in pain on the bed or projectile vomiting who knows where. Eventually the pain didnâ€™t stop but Iâ€™d worn myself out enough to get some "sleep" if you can call it that.

I was awake most of that night and Iâ€™d been moved to a different ward at some point. The nurses and nursing assistants on duty knew what Iâ€™d done. I even had fresh self harm wounds that needed stitches on my arm. They acted like I was a freak of nature. I felt like a waste of resources, especially as news about COVID-19 was getting more and more widespread (this was before the UK lockdown).

One nurse in particular kept staring at me and told me "I donâ€™t understand how you can do that to yourself" with a disturbed look on her face. In hindsight Iâ€™m glad thatâ€™s what her reaction is because I donâ€™t want anyone to know or, worse yet, experience what Iâ€™ve been through. It isnâ€™t fair and I sometimes forget that this amount of trauma isnâ€™t the norm.

I was in hospital until Thursday afternoon where two people from the mental health team came to speak to me. All they had to say was that they agree Iâ€™ve been through a lot and they handed me a leaflet with a crisis number on it. Then I was sent on my way. 

Once I got home, it was strange at first. My sisters avoided me like they were afraid or didnâ€™t know how to react to me, which is weird because all they know is "I took too many painkillers". Theyâ€™re younger than me so donâ€™t need the burden of knowing the whole truth. Things got back to normal after a few days with them.

My mum, again, is acting like normal. I would put it down to stress but itâ€™s been so long now and she hasnâ€™t expressed any serious feelings about what happened.

The biggest impact I was worried about was the impact on my pets. My three guinea pigs and my Conure (a type of small parrot). My guinea pigs noticed no difference. I probably overestimated their ability to recognise different humans from each other but I saw on a video call whilst in hospital that they were behaving the exact same way as before.

My conure who I thought would really miss me, especially as he recognises and has different relationships with different people in the household, didnâ€™t really change either. He just continued as normal, eating the same food, playing with the same toys, he wasnâ€™t let out of his cage as often because I wasnâ€™t there but he didnâ€™t seem to mind because he just slept (in character for him because he is old).

Moving onto extended family: nothing. No difference at all.

Friends? Again, apparently Iâ€™m bad at picking friends because literally no one cared, all two of them.

Iâ€™m not trying to complain that I didnâ€™t get enough "attention" or whatever. Thatâ€™s the last thing I want, fake sympathy. I was hoping that, after I recovered and got out of hospital, the impact my suicide attempt had on the people around me would be enough to prevent me from trying again but as far as I can see, nothing really changes. The world continues on without so much as even a blink. My feelings that people would be better off without me are stronger than ever. There are little to no consequences of me dying and I can list pages of negative influences I have on peoples lives that change the for the worse by staying alive so *why am I staying alive?*
