I think today is the dayI read online that overdosing on SSRIs combined with overdosing on painkillers like ibuprofen can lead to bleeding in the stomach. Sounds painful af but at this point I really don't care I just want to be gone. I don't think I was made for life, I think I was a mistake. Somewhere in the evolutionary line I was created on accident and after 19 years of being alive I'm ready to throw in the towel. I'm tired of fighting, I give up.
