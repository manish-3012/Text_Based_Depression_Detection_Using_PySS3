My life hurtsI've been living with depression for 6 years now. I've got no friends and my family does not care. I've actively tried to find a reason to live and have also tried looking for someone whom I can call a friend, but it's hard to find someone who shares anything in common with me or can relate to me since my personality has died out due to years of solitude and being isolated away from any social life. The only time I feel something it hurts and I can't imagine this life being worthwhile.

I've had sucidial thoughts for about a year or so and I've fully given up on trying to find a reason to stay. This is probably the last time I'll reach out for help, so what should I do? I don't think therapy is the answer.
