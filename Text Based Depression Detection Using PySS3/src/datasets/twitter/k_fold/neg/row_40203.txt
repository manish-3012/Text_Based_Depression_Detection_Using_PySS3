I don't think I can handle this anymore...I've been struggling with depression for several years- but it's gotten so much worse the last few months. I can never focus on anything, everything seems so worthless and idiotic. My grades (in high school) are all D's, which for my parents A standards is, well, terrifying. And even though I'm burning future bridges every second, i just don't care- at all. It's like I've accepted failure and depression. I had this fantastic epiphany a few months ago that I cannot just get out of my mind. I can now see through everyone's faces, their thoughts and emotions- because everything is so primitive. Everything that goes through the mind stems from self preservation. I have this deep fear of people, of emotions and weaknesses. I can't trust anyone, my parents, friends and therapist are all idiots who, given a solid chance, would rip me down and manipulate me for their own benefits. People's lives seem so insignificant, and so does mine. Now that I realize all of this, I want nothing more than to just hang myself- fall at least 5 feet into thin air to avoid slow choking, because fighting to continue seems so pointless. Does anyone else even understand? So called 'higher' thoughts and 'emotions' may tell you that love, drives for success, adventure, bullshit etc, can give you meaning- but that's just for survival. We are just pure animals driven by instinct, it's revolting. I will have to delete this account in several days so they all can't track me down yet again to fuck with me- but does anyone feel this as I do? Every waking second, I think of ways to self inflict pain, of how superficial and lowerminded those around me seem. It seems so grey and dark all at the same time. I want to cry- but my tear ducts won't work, I've tried many times. There's no reason to live- for we all die anyways, in the exact same position as was before.
