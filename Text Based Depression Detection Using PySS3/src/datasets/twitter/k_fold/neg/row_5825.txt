DAE not open up about their suicidality because people would talk down to them/patronize them?I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. 

I already feel like a piece of shit and a waste of a human being, but being talked down to and treated like some crazy idiot who doesn't know what's good for him pisses me off and makes me feel worse. Whether it be staff in psych wards that use baby talk, adress me like a child, and withhold simple things like sporks or pencils, or therapists that try to fake things in order to get me to say the right phrases and use the right words to make the calls needed to take me away; yet do it in such an insultingly obvious way that I can see. Its all bullshit and makes me sick.
