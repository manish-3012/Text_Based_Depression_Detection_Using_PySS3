Itâ€™s here again.Those intrusive thoughts. Do I want to do or do I just want the pain to stop? Part of me wants to sink into the void. The other part wants to stay for the ones who depend on me. I try to distract myself. But how do you distract yourself from your own thoughts? 

Iâ€™m getting bad again and no one sees it. Or maybe they just donâ€™t care. Should I really blame everyone for always leaving? Iâ€™m not easy to handle. I donâ€™t want to feel the pit in my stomach anymore. I just need a break from life. I need a break from all of the sadness. Iâ€™m so tired. So so tired.
