I'm just scaredYesterday when I was sitting at a bus stop to rest during my walk, a man tried to hurt me because I refused to give him my number. 
He said he would kill me if I ever came back to that area...
All I asked was to be left alone, yet still I feel that I'm in the wrong? I was just minding my own business...
I was already having trouble with my mental health, but everything has just gotten so much worse. I don't want to leave my house. 
My partner isn't showing me nearly as much support as I need. I was threatened and almost assaulted....and all I can hear in my brain is "kill yourself before they kill you."
I hurt myself this morning and my partner didn't show any concern. I wasn't doing it for the purpose of eliciting a response....it's just a bad habit I've had since I was 13. I'm 20 now. 
I have...really no friends to talk to. And I've never been very social anyways.

I don't want to deal with this anymore. I've been bullied/harassed for most of my life and I see no end in sight. Please, can I just leave?
