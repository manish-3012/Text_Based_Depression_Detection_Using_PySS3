I don't know how much longer I can lastI'm 23 and a full time college student. While at college, I try to keep up appearances and act like a normal happy person, but in reality it's a lie. I'm constantly depressed and feel lonely. I live at home, and I often jokingly tell my mother that I'm going to kill myself to gauge her reaction, I tell myself it's a joke but I'm not so sure anymore. The only reason I think I haven't killed myself yet is because of my mother, but I don't know. 

My sister says I'm a pushover and I let everyone walk over me, which is the truth. My sister likes to take advantage of this character flaw and constantly fucks me over with no fear of repercussion, then acts like she loves me. It makes me both sick and furious.

I feel that I'm just an outside observer watching life go by and that there's no point in living if I'm just going to die down the line. I often think that we are all just waiting to die in our own way and we should just skip the waiting part and go directly to death.

I have a pathetic life and daily think about the least painful way to kill myself. I have 2 friends and my mother that would  probably care. My greedy sister would just show up and pretend to care while hoping to get all my shit.
