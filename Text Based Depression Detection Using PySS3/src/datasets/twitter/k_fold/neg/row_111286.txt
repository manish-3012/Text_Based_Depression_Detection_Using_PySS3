Worst Days of my LifeI fell in love with a girl over the course of a year and we made so many plans to get married and have children and do so much shit, then I learned she had cheated on me... I couldnt take it, I was sent to a mental hospital for 4 days and I was diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, and anger. Along with that they also diagnosed me as a psychopath. Everyone has started looking at me funny and making claims that I've threatened them and so much shit. I wish I had never left my ex, she gave me a purpose for living even though she did something bad I was a fucking idiot. My life has been flipped upside down, I have to take 5 different medications and I've already tried to OD on them once. I don't want to die, I just have no reason to live...
