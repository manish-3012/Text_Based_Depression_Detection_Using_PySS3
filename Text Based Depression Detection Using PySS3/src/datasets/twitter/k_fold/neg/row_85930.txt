Please HelpI met this girl on Omegle and she gave me her Snapchat. We talked for a bit and she gave me her Instagram. I asked for her age and she said 17. We played PUBG Mobile for a bit and she was telling me how she cuts herself and what not. As we were playing she told me her actual age: 14. I, an 18 year old, felt extremely weird talking to a minor so I blocked her the next day on everything. Her sister messaged me on Instagram and said she was cutting herself because of me. I told her that I feel really weird talking to a 14 year old when I'm 18. I unblocked her on Instagram and told her that I was sorry and I didn't mean to hurt her and that it just felt weird talking to a minor. She then sent a picture of her cuts saying, "what's done is done." I then apologized again and told her that I couldn't keep talking to her because of the age difference. Can I actually get jail time if she ends up killing herself? (God forbid)
