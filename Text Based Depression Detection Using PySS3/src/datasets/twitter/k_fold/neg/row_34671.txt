DoneIâ€™m not even gonna drag this out and make it sound sad Iâ€™m just fucking done. Iâ€™ve tried a couple times but this time I wont fail. Iâ€™ve thought about how to end it without any chance of survival enough to finish it. Thereâ€™s absolutely no love left anywhere in my life. Thereâ€™s no motivation for anything whatsoever. Thereâ€™s no cure. Iâ€™ve tried every medication, months of treatment for drugs depression bipolar whatever the fuck you wanna call it. All of itâ€™s the same. You just sit in a circle and bitch about your feelings. Everyone feels like shit sometimes I know but itâ€™s been years now and Iâ€™ve spent months sober and havenâ€™t noticed any difference. Weed and cigarettes wonâ€™t do it anymore. Iâ€™m either gonna go back to taking some hard shit or Iâ€™m gonna fucking end my life. I feel stupid because I know how pointless crying to random people on reddit is. I just want to talk to someone in the same mindset.
