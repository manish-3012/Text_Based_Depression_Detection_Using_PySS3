I will never get anywhere in life because I will never have good social skillsMore and more this is fucking hitting me HARD. 

I have at very bad social anxiety for as long as I can remember. 

I cannot walk up to someone and have a conversation with them that has value. 

I'm just too fucking scared to do it. I always feel fucking awkward as shit in every single little conversation I'm in. 

I will never fucking get anywhere in life because of this. I will never be able to form real connections with people because I can't actually carry real conversations. I will never not be scared of social interaction itself enough to actually get anywhere in life. 

I would just rather fucking did than work on my social skills. I have been trying to work on them for fucking years and I still cannot intuitively add any value whatsoever to a conversation. Every conversation is a fucking dead end because for some reason I just NEVER fucking get the hang of talking to people and communicating. 

I'm 24. There is no hope left. Life is not meant to be enjoyed by someone with absolutely no social skills and absolutely nothing to fucking say to anyone because I'm too fucking scared to even practice having conversations in fucking general. 

My life will always be shut because of this. FUCK having to deal with the bullshit "struggle of life" I go on about. The real fucking problem I will always have in life is that I cannot properly fucking socialize.
