I feel like I'm completely alone.I don't have any friends anymore, as most of my friends stopped talking to me when I expressed that I'm kind of struggling in the mental health area (my friends were all very conservatively religious and felt like mental health issues just meant somebody isn't "praying hard enough").  Due to social anxiety and having severe body dysmorphic disorder, it's hard for me to go out and "put myself out there", especially going to a college where I really feel like I don't fit in.   I'm twenty and have never had any sort of relationship with a guy... I've never even had any real guy friends because I have a horrible relationship with a father who has never made me feel important or worthy or pretty or any of those things, so I guess I just assume that's how all men will think of me... I'm not really sure.  While I'm a huge introvert and need my alone time, I crave human connection that I have none of at the moment, and I just don't see the point, really.  I'm just sad and upset and angry at my dad, at myself, and just in general.  I'm in therapy, I'm on medication, and I do try.  I don't sit around feeling sorry for myself.  But the fact that none of this is working makes me feel like it's my time to just leave, you know?
