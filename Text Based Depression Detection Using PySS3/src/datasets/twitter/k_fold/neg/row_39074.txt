I can't get over my guilt and regretI regret so much of my past. So many things I've done wrong to alienate people, manipulate them, emotionally abuse them. The feelings torment me. I'm to blame for being in such a fucking shit position right now. I did so many things that brought about my own destruction. I don't think I'll ever get back to my old self, the one that was going places and didn't think about the past.

I just wish that I was dead. I wish that I could go to sleep and never wake up.
