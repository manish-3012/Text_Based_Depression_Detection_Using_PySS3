I'm lost and alone and want to die.I've never found a place that feels like home. I've lived all over the country, seen countries all over the world, and never once have I felt happy. I had been dating someone for 3 years and I seriously thought he was the one. We were best friends. But he decided right now he needs to be alone because he gets anxious when he's around anyone. So he broke up with me. I've been on antidepressants for years now, and they work at keeping the suicidal thoughts at bay, but right now I'm lost. I just want to disappear and die. I don't know if I want to keep being friends with my ex or never see him again. I don't know if I want to surround myself with friends and family or disappear never to be seen again. I don't know if I want to move to a new state near where my ex and I lived to start again or stay in the state my parents and friends live in. I'm numb, depressed, angry, and in denial all at once. But this time I know acceptance isn't coming.
