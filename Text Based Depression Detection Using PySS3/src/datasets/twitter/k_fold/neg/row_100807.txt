i hurt myself earlier i was really upset. should i phone my friend to come over and help me? I'm OK.

There were problems from him and I'm sorto f mad at him. But its all shit that should be in the past and I have no real friends to help me.

I'm actually a little afraid of going downstairs in the kitchen because i may hurt myself

this almost happened last night but thankfully i stopped myself and it was a fucking butter knife


*I just don't want to make my friend's live full of shit. Ask for too much and be a fucking piece of shit sucking out the happiness out of people around me.* I don't want to die though. I think. I dont know. I got really numb
