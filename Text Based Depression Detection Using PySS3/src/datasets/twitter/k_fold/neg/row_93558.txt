Nothing new. Same story line same feeling.Iâ€™m no different than anyone here feeling suicidal. Iâ€™m alone hurt lost and worse I canâ€™t bear it anymore. Iâ€™m looking for help and it seems miles away. These suicidal thoughts started when I turned 29 and nothing excites me anymore. I hurt myself biking and I swear that was a moment worth living for. The fuck it part and the pain. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll  commit suicide but I want these thoughts out of my head....
