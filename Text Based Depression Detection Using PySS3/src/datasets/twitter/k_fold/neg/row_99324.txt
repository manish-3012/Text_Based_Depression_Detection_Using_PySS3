Is it worth to kill myselfBrief background on me: I'm 15 this year, and suffer from depression. I have a dark history with 'family and friends' and I'm not sure what to do anymore. Life's been a bitch to me, my studies have gone haywire, I'm losing friends and I think too much about murder and suicide. I feel that suicide while bringing someone down with me is my only way out. Help.

If it helps, I live life without a care anymore. Since life is a bitch to me, might as well don't give it any more chances.

Edit: Since i have nothing to lose, might as well leave my life story here.

I was a very well behaved kid from age 1-6. Then it all changed. My most beloved grandmother passed, and my mother, with no parenting experience took over after quitting her job. From Primary 1-6 (7-12), it wasn't fun. I was beaten and kicked out of the house for even just a small mistake. Back then my studies were fairly decent, averaging As on my tests. Bullying was a major problem, being shoved around, called names, hurt physically and emotionally. Seconday School rolls along. I'm fucked, I can't keep up in school, I'm simply starting to be ostracized. I feel helpless. Now I'm Secondary 3(15), today I'm accused of being a stalker, I'm getting blocked, and time is running out. My murderous mind is going crazy, I nearly leapt today. Close friend stopped me. One day I'm gonna be outta friends. That is when I know I'm a definite goner. 

Please. Help me for god's sake.
