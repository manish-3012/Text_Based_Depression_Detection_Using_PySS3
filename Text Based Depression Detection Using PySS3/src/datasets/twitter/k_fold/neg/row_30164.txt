School is making me suicidal, depressed, I hate everyone there. In high school, I've met some of the worst people in my whole life. And it's not only 1, not 2, it's more than half of the classroom I'm in. First off everything was great I thought it was a good class, but then one moron has changed school and moved into our class. He acted like a jerk from the beginning, everyone, of course, was so obsessed "how funny he is" with his elementary school humor and acting like a fucking child. In my country, you are an adult at the age of 18 and most of them are like 16 - 17 and they still act like fucking kids. That wouldn't be that big of a deal. But then for some reason, he began to have a problem with my friend. It all started with a nickname (as my bullying has) and ended with sending her nude pictures into class group chat and making fun of her because she cut herself because of their nonstop verbal abuse. Not talking about my fucking ex that I spent 6 months trying for, then she told she can't date younger guys and ended up dating the guy that is the same age as me and that she called "a fucking asshole, she couldn't even talk to". I really wanna drop out, but my family won't support me even if I tell them how hard it's to work in that class and that I have no intention of doing the specialization I've chosen and I'm studying now. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it like do finish school from home (dunno how to call that in English) and try to make some money making music. Of course, I would find a job in between and would be attending it.
