Means to an endI've had it. I really tried, I did it all. But let's not kid ourselves any longer. My existence is meaningless, I can't do anything right. I've been fooling myself with positivism and trying to hold on to the tears and the pain that really is crippling me. There's no therapy and no pill that's gonna change me or make me a better person because the truth is that I'm shit and I don't deserve anything. I've come to terms with this statement. Everything that happens every day reminds me of so. Enough with the up beat bullshit. Too many failures, too much pain, too much abuse. It's like my mind has an electrical shock. You know when you leave the tv on and then there's nothing on the screen just distortion and that very characteristical sound? That's my head and my brain. Dead. I've been losing appetite and just overworking. Trying to please everyone, fill everyone's needs. Not enough. It would be a lie to say I'm not afraid anymore because, just accepting the reality is hard enough, and attempting to go through the end is scary when you don't succeed, but I'm so sad and drained that I can't see anymore out there for me. I wish I could take all of your pain out there. I feel selfish for posting when there are so many people struggling in this place. Please forgive me, I needed to vent. Don't know how long I'll keep the act. I don't think I'll make it after the holidays. This time I think it's good to go through all the way. No more games nor mistakes.
Please forgive me again.
Love for everyone and specially to anyone that took the time to read this nonsense from this loser.
