Do your ever just walk around at night and think about how easy it would be to just step on the street and let a car hit you, but damn it's a beautiful night and you can see the stars and smell the scent of fresh rain.So easy, but why kill yourself if the moments before it are so so beautiful? I wish life would always be like that. But then there are other nights too. Nights in which you try to sleep. Nights like these where even the good music won't help. Nights where you just want someone to hold you on their lap and tell you everything is just fine.

This is the only time you are by yourself and the only time you can't run away by doing work or being busy living a life. Inescapable. You can not hide from yourself.
