Just can't deal with all of it...I'm at a breaking point. I'm failing school, I'll never get a girlfriend, I'm never going to be successful. What does it matter in the end though? Humanity is fucked. We're going to hit peak oil soon, there's a growing threat of nuclear war, terrorism is on the rise, sunspots are getting worse. Everything is going pell-mell. I don't want to kill myself. I love my friends. But it seems like the only way. I just want all of this stress and worry to go away.

Just thought I ought to add, I have been diagnosed with clinical depression. Possibly severe clinical depression. Oh and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BblV6AQsd2s) is my philosophy on life. I'm starting to think it's not possible. If I can't just swing it away, is it worth living?

EDIT: OK, I won't kill myself. It's still in my head, but I won't plan anything. Thanks guys. I might post an update in a while.
