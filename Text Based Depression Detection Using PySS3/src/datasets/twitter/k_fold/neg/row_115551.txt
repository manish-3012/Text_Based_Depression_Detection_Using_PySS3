Getting help isnâ€™t workingIâ€™ve been posting on here a lot, sorry. I guess Iâ€™m trying to vent, anyways. Through my posts Iâ€™ve been saying that I got help, but itâ€™s not working. I use to love going to my therapist, I felt like I could of told her anything. Now all my answers are â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€. Iâ€™ve become more on edge and irritated, I canâ€™t even handle and conversation with my own mom. When I went to the hospital they told me I needed some medicine, I donâ€™t know how I feel about it. I thought I would be happy but now I feel like Iâ€™m broken. I feel like a doll that someone is trying to put the arm back on, sorry that was cheesy. Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts, I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the anxiety of it all but I would much prefer not to be here. I dread every time I go to school, and dread every time I go home.  I wrote my suicide note, I mentioned that couple of times, sorry if my posts are annoying. I just donâ€™t think o have the guts to do it, and thatâ€™s what frustrates me. Yet the whole day i canâ€™t see motivation to try, I tell myself that â€œIâ€™m gonna die anywaysâ€ thatâ€™s there isnâ€™t a point anymore. These thoughts use to make me cry, now it doesnâ€™t. I still self harm, punching walls and scratching. I feel so trapped, everyone wonâ€™t leave me alone, and keep bring up my self harm. I canâ€™t take it anymore.
