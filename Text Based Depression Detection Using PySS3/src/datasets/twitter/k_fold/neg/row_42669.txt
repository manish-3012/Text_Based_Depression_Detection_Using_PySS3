i'm supposed to kill myself tomorrow.last month, i was in a very, very, very bad headspace. i wanted to die but i made a promise to myself that if i waited it out and gave myself time to plan accordingly, i could kill myself on the 1st of march.

i havenâ€™t stockpiled enough pills, but i think thereâ€™s enough resources in the cupboard to at least knock me out. failing that, iâ€™ve got my razors and a scar to trace down my wrist. and a few mouthfuls of vodka left to chase it down.

but do i actually want to do this? iâ€™ve been numb for the past month that i havenâ€™t actually explored if my suicidalness from when i made this plan is still here. has anything really changed from when i decided tomorrow was the day? in fact, has anything changed from when i was 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10? 

iâ€™m not sad right now, per se. i donâ€™t know if iâ€™m happy, either. iâ€™m definitely doing better than i was and i can handle situations again. i havenâ€™t been cutting, nor worrying about my weight. i havenâ€™t been stressing over friendâ€™s and their suicidal tendencies, and iâ€™ve let myself become more physical with guys. butâ€¦

i have to remember that i have had these positive moments before and theyâ€™ve been followed with a deep, deep drop back into depression. itâ€™s what has always happened. so, again, what has changed? if i donâ€™t kill myself tomorrow, then itâ€™s probably safe to assume that iâ€™ll get bummed -&gt; sad -&gt; depressed -&gt; back to where i always am.

so here i raise my question;

do i kill myself tomorrow, not out of sadness and hopelessness, but out of the knowledge that i probably will get sad again? to break from the cycle? to do what i probably should have done many, many years ago?

or do i not?
