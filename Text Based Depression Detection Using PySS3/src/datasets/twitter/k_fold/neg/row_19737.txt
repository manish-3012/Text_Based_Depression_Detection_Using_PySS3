I canâ€™t fucking take this anymoreI destroy everything I touch. Iâ€™m bipolar but Iâ€™m 100% sure Iâ€™m BPD. Iâ€™m to scared to talk to my husband about it. 

I feel like the biggest fucking source of problems and I cause so many fights while Iâ€™m dissociated and I almost caused a serious accident on my way home during this current fight. 

I get angry or emotionally overloaded and I just want to cut or die to make it all go away. 
Why the actual fuck does anyone think Iâ€™m actually worth the effort of keeping alive. 

I have a bottle of muscle relaxants, Xanax, and thereâ€™s plenty of alcohol to wash it all down. If that doesnâ€™t work, he has a gun in his car but I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll get to it know. Maybe just a knife in the shower. No thatâ€™s too messy. Wouldnâ€™t want to inconvenience anyone past being alive already has.
