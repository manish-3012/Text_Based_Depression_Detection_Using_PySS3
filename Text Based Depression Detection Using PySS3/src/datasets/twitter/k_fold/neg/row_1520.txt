I need someone to talk to.It's 4am now, and I still can't get to sleep. I've just been crying all night having suicidal thoughts that are worse than usual. I feel completely hopeless. The treatment I'm getting for my depression and anxiety doesn't seem to be working and I really don't know what to do anymore.

I want to die, but at the same time I'm too scared to do anything. I'm terrified that if I try to kill myself and it doesn't work out, that I'll have to face the consequences of it. I've kept my depression a secret from the majority of people, and if I failed and ended up in hospital they would all find out. I don't know what the fuck to do. 

I'd really appreciate it if someone could distract me from my own thoughts a bit. I'm in such a bad mental state lately and it seems to be getting worse.
