[Rant] I hate it when literally all recourses about helping with suicidal thoughts:Are always showing examples of idk people without arms living life happy like great good for them but thatâ€™s not really helping my situation is it. And also how everyoneâ€™s always on about how â€œsuicide is a long term solution to a temporary problemâ€ like shut the fuck up u have no idea if thatâ€™s the same with everyone. Some people have to deal with their problems all their life so donâ€™t give me that shit. Its just really annoying how i can never find recourses that actually help me with suicidal thoughts. Sorry just had to rant about this.
