Today is the day. I am sure of it. A few months ago my wife decided to leave me while i was in the middle of losing my mind. I am depressed and bi polar. I tried to over dose and would have made it to the other side, but for whatever reason i called this woman i work with. I am in love with her. I should clarify that my wife was never anything more than something i was guilted into doing. But with her leaving in that moment i was left with nothing. No car,house,money,emotional support.
 I hang out with the woman i called a few times a week. We have talked extensivly about feelings and whatnot. She recently told me that we could never be together because i would never let her love me. She is mad about my inability to be happy and the bad crowd i surround myself with. I am a huge emotional burdeon on her, i know this even though she would never tell me.
I think about killing myself almost every moment of the day lately. 
My car isnt running, i have 2 dollars to my name(literally) and very little family support. The only thing i do have is a noose. I keep it where the spare tire goes. I have been sleeping in my car outside of work for a while now, coworkers just now found out. I feel guilty for ever putting my bullshit on this beautiful woman and im sick of life in general. I have very little to live for and im to embaressed to ask for money for food or my car.
Today is the day.
(edit) the reason i mention the girl i called is because she somehow got the location of where i was out of me and got the police to my location. im all over the place with this. excuse my grammar and punctuation.
