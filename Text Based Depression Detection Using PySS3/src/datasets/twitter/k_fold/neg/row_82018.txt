probably my final days hereim 15 and most likely going to end up killing myself in the next few days or weeks and im happy and sad, in elementary school i was bullied by the school and my first love, i lost the ability to talk to people comfortably and do anything that has to do with talking to people in person, my mom and dad split up and my dad moved about 20 miles away but he worked alot so i couldnt see him much, our house got sold in a trust and we were staying at friends houses for almost a year until me,my mom and my brother moved back to our hometown a few blocks away (other brother has girl,house,job and is doing well) unfortunately i stopped talking to all of my friends and only talk to one, who doesnt care for mental health and doesnt believe its a real problem to him, for the past 2 weeks ive had the most straight forward and scary thoughts,dreams, and visions of killing myself and just saw a post on facebook from my dad with alot of alcohol and weed (fine with me) but theres also coke in a little baggy along with it, he  works so much and is losing himself and i cant do anything about it because he sees nothing wrong and cares more for his ethnicity side of the family that he kinda just gave money to and lives with more than the kids he raised and had the most memories with, the rests of my family chooses not to visit because apparently he did very bad stuff to us when i was too young to remember, i have no one, not even myself and i have nothing, no job, no sport or activity and no friends, and no one to look up to. just a broken and complicated family, which is the only thing stopping me, but i feel myself getting weaker and weaker, losing grip, i have dreams but cant fall asleep, i have people but no voice, i have love but not for anyone, i have â€œpotentialâ€ but dont see shit. i cant fucking be here anymore, this whole life never made sense to me since i was a kid, and if i dont end it now its just going to be pain, thats it, my last true spoken words, i hope this...helps? i dont know, i never did
