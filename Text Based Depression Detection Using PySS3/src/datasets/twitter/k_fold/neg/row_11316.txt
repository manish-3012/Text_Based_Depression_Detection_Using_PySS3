Dying sounds so much easierCan't take it here abroad for college. Hell, only a 1st year and it's driving me nuts. I realized so many important things right now. 

1. Fuck your parents: "they have a plan for me" and "we give you high expectations" FUCK THAT. I'd rather jump off a building than cater to them and end up being the one paying for their mistakes. Why the fuck should i care. Been sheltered for my childhood and once i take a step into the real world without any means of preparations, i'm screwed.
2. Be mentally ready for college abroad: college is hard enough, and trying to cope with the new environment with different people makes me want to show a shotgun barrel into my mouth, loaded and cocked. Hell, i wasn't prepared to be like them.
3. Education&gt;health: yeah, sadly i'm those people who would rather not be entertained until the assignment is done. If i ever fail, consider preparing my grave since i'm probably overdose on antidepressants. I'm already sleep deprived but i honestly wouldn't care less. I'll sleep in peace once the sem is over. If i die midway then whatever, i did my best.

Fuck this.
