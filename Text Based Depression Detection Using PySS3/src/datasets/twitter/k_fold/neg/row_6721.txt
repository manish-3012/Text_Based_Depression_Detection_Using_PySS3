I don't care about anything anymoreAbout 6 months ago I struggled seriously with self-esteem issues and suicidal thoughts. I never told anyone about it and I never did anything to get over it, I just sorta ignored it. Now i don't give a fuck about anything anymore. All I do is go to the beach and drool over the same girl I have been chasing for months. I have no motivation or fear of punishment. I use to be a straight A student with a 4.5 GPA. Now I have like 15 missing assignments in every class. Whenever I am punished it doesn't bother me. I can't take anything or anyone seriously. Even when my dad hits me for missing assignments or disrespecting him, it doesn't even phase me. I'm not scared of dying. I'm not scared of pain. I'm not scared of being homeless. In the end none of it matters anyway. Is this normal?


 I use to have a almost obsessive crush on a girl and now I still like her, but I don't really care what she thinks of me anymore. I use to do everything in order to impress her and now I just don't give a single fuck. And like I said before I don't give a fuck about school anymore. I was the kid who would stay after class and takes only ap and college classes and now I don't give a fuck if I end up homeless and without an education.



 I was a d1 baseball player and might have a shot at college, but Idgaf about it anymore and I've started skipping practice for the past couple of months. I still don't have my permit, why would I need it if my friends could drive?    My mom was screaming at me about my grades and I laughed at her. It seemed so stupid that some one was mad at me for a grade. I just want to have a good time. I started smoking weed again and drinking alone. I know that's not healthy but no one knows any different so why not. I think I'm gonna drop out and move in with my brother and if he doesn't let me move in with him I'll just be homeless. What the fuck am I supposed to do with myself? What the fuck is wrong with me?
