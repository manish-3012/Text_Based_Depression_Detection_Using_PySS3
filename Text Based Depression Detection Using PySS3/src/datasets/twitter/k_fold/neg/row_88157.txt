Why not?I am planning to kill myself if I end up going to jail. I recently admitted to myself that I am an alcoholic after I was arrested for a DWI. I promised myself that I would not drink from then on, and it's been six days since I last drank. But I feel so hopeless. I talked with my therapist today and we decided I can't face drinking again. But without that I turned to cutting tonight. I don't know what to do...I don't want to tell my therapist I am suicidal, because I would only do it if I went to jail, but I am feeling so low. I just want to keep cutting until I can't anymore. But then someone will see the cuts once I run out of hidden space. I want all of this to end. I am supposed to be getting my Master's this Summer, then moving on to a PhD program in August, but this DWI arrest has really opened my eyes to how bad things are.
