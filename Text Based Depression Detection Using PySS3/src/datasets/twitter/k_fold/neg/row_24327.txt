Why can't I be happy?I'm suicidal, that's just a fact. I idolize the idea of it, I think I would be gone in an instant if I didn't have people around me holding me down.

 I have an illness that causes massive gut pain, permanently disfigured me (huge scar lines all over including crotch, looks like inflammed herpes), I've been mentally unstable because of the meds I take and my doctors still don't know what the hell is wrong. 5 years of non stop pain, and I'm only 21, now on methadone/norco/oxy to try and function. 

My live in girlfriend, who does truly love me, doesn't have sex with me anymore because she stopped enjoying it. She just has no libido because we couldn't figure out how to make her finish and she got bored. I can't masterbate either because my meds make me not feel orgasms anymore. Life has been one kick to the balls after another. I'm not going to see 30 if this is what it's going to be like, I can't take it, no good food or sex or happiness or joy. Emptiness. So I sit, and wait until my girlfriend leaves for class, then I sob at home because I'm too doped up to do anything worth while (instead of being in so much pain I can't do anything...), and fantasize about how to end it and when. Why can't I just be normal? Why can't I just be happy? Why do I have to live like this? Fucking IBD, you have ruined my life, my body, and my mind. I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.
