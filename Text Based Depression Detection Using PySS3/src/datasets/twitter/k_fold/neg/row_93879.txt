iâ€™m a joke and no ones laughingi feel like the punchline to a joke- a sick, cruel, joke. a person who abused and bullied me throughout school is doing better off. iâ€™m behind in everything. i donâ€™t know who my friends are. and i canâ€™t stop feeling sorry for myself and wallowing in the pain. 

iâ€™m going to end up just like my grandmother. a bipolar alcoholic. iâ€™m going to be like this forever. itâ€™s not going to change. 

when i finally get the guts to end it all itâ€™s gonna be the first moment of peace in my entire freaking life.
