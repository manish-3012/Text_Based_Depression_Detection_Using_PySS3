Feeling the urge againI'm having a hard time dealing with loneliness. I wish I had at least a one good friend. It's partly my fault because I can't maintain a relationship, even if I somehow miraculously find myself having one. Mostly, I wish I could end my life because I really do not have anything to live for. I am really not getting better. I do not even want to get better. I want to vanish.
