Am I crazy?So, I've have been diagnosed with GAD, OCD, CPTSD and Depression.
I often have obsessive thoughts about a lot of things, including suicide, at times I feel it's the only way out, lately it has become routine. 
I hate emotional pain, I can take a punch or a kick or whatever,  but hearing hurtful things or feeling trapped, out of control brings me to my knees, closer to the ledge.
I don't know what I want, I don't enjoy things or people. I'm just here, I don't feel in control of who I am and all the things that keep on coming are making everything worse. The past few months have been horrible for everyone which it's understandable.
So, I cannot bother friends with my problems, they have their own and it angers me that I can't do much for them, but lately I've been having this strange feeling of going insane. 
I started to detach to the point where I feel out of place and it's weird, I see myself doing things then seconds later I'm back to where I was before, like it only happened only in my head, but it fee so real, everytime.

Have I gone mad? Is this normal?
Can anyone relate?
