Help meI dont understand whats going on in my mind. I feel like I'm aimlessly wandering through life right now. Anxiety and depression is at an all time high. I've had bad thoughts lately and it scares me, I've never before actually thought of suicide but now the idea of it doesnt disturb me as much as it should. I'm scared.
