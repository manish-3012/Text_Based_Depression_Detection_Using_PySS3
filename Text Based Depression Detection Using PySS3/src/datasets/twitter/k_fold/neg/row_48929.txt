My mental illnesses make me feel worthless and subhuman. I just want to die.Iâ€™ve dealt with PTSD, depression, anxiety, and OCD since high school (Iâ€™m in my last year of college right now). I had a mental breakdown in the spring and have had an extremely hard time ever since then. Iâ€™ve had a lot of therapy and was in an IOP over the summer which helped stabilize me, but once I got back to school I just want to die. 

My boyfriend doesnâ€™t have mental illnesses nor does the rest of my family. Iâ€™ve been such a negative person lately and I canâ€™t help it because my head is full of negativity and I feel like Iâ€™m sucked in a black hole. I feel like Iâ€™m such a downer to everyone and the fact that I canâ€™t just bounce back like other people makes me feel so worthless. I feel like I get on everyoneâ€™s nerves because Iâ€™m so down and sad and everyone would be better off without me. Iâ€™m just existing and I feel like it would be better for everyone if I was dead. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m trying to say here but I need to get it off my chest because Iâ€™m feeling so horrible but I donâ€™t want to annoy the people I care about by taalking about it.
