Harassment   So Iâ€™ve been working in one of the Best Buy stores for 2.5 years. Iâ€™ve always been picked on for being from the south and moving to the north, among other things. Lately itâ€™s been getting worse. 

   I get called â€œdumb fuckâ€, â€œfucking stupidâ€, â€œidiotâ€, with phrases like â€œItâ€™s (my name), nobody cares what he thinksâ€ and â€œwho cares about him?â€ every single day that I work by co-workers. Managers even brush me off every time I try to talk to them about anything and make me feel worthless.

   Lately itâ€™s been affecting every part of my life. Iâ€™ve been depressed, lost interesting in the things that I love to do, and feel like ending my relationship with my gf whom Iâ€™ve been with for 3 years. Iâ€™ve even been having thoughts of harming myself or ending my life.

   Many of you would just say â€œWhy donâ€™t you just find another job?â€ but the truth is that I love every other aspect of my job, except this. And I get paid decently for what I do.

  Any thoughts on where I should go from here? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

   EDIT: The main reason why I havenâ€™t said anything yet is because he home theater lead spot is opening up and Iâ€™m concentrating all of my effort into working on getting it.

   EDIT 2: Iâ€™ve spoken with my Store Manager once and the old and new Assistant Manager and they assure me that it will be taken care of and 2 years later nothing has changed.
