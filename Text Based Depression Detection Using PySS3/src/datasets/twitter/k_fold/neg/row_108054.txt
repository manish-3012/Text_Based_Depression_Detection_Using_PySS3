Suicide by dehydrationI'm tired of all of this, I know dehydration is a painful way to go, but I've got an eating disorder anyway and i think i deserve the pain of it anyway. I know it should take around 3 days to a week - I'm two days in now - but I'm wondering when it'll cause permanent damage. Part of the reason I don't want  to take an overdose is because I fear that I'll change my mind and want to live, I'd like to know what my cut off is where I can fix myself by just drinking water.
