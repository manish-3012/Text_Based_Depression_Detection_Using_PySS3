Is it still attempted suicide?Is it still attempted suicide if I know the gun is unloaded? My ex walked out on me about 9 months ago, it was really hard, but for a while I thought I was doing alright. Well I decided to move, started packing, and ran across all my ex's old stuff she left behind and I don't know what happened. One minute I was crying over an old letter, the next thing I knew I was making sure the gun was unloaded but trying to hurt my self with it... I'm scared at this point, and worried something is wrong with me. I just don't know if I just tried to kill me self or what. Sorry this prolly makes no sense to anyone. I'm just really confused at the moment.
