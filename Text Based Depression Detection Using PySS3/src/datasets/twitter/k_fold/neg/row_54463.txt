i see people happy everydayand i cant help think that maybe iâ€™m not made for this world, that i should kill myself because iâ€™d never make it.
i used to have the ambition to become a doctor, or lawyer, or politician. i donâ€™t have it anymore. i know iâ€™ll fail.
i donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
