I guess you could call it "suicide curious"I used to be really depressed up until about a year and a half ago. Every now and then I kinda start to feel depressed again, but it usually disappears after a good nightrest. One thing I do still strugle with is a weird kind of being suicidal, which I guess you could call "suicide curious", just like being bi-curious.

It's not like I want to die all the time, but almost every day I think about suicide. Like 'what if I just killed myself right now?' And then, 'What would my familly think?' And my friends and fellow students?' I know they would probably be very sad and stuff, but still I'm kinda curious. 'Would they be surpised? Would they ask themselves why they didn't notice it? Would they ask themselves why they didn't do anything to prevent it?"

It's not like I actually have any reason to do it. My life is pretty good I'd say. Got a nice amount of really good friends, my parents love me and I do pretty well in college. I'm not necessarily looking for death, yet I wouldn't mind if I would just die right now.  

This probably sounds really lame and may be kinda incomprehensble, but I just don't know how to express the way I feel about it. Also you might even think I'm mocking people that really are suicidal, but I'm not, it'snot meant like that. 

The reason I'm posting this is probably cause I'm actually kinda scared that I'm thinking/feeling this way, and I'm afraid that one day when I'm waiting for the train, I won't just wonder what would happen if I jumped in front of it, but I will actually "try it out".
