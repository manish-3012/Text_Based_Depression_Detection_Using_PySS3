Feels like it is time to go.In my situation, I feel like I am trying to hold on to my life as harsh that it may be right now. I don't want to whine about my shortcomings. I realize that life is worth living, and that problems are temporary and only as big as we let them. 

with that said...

I am slowly losing the urge to keep going. To the untrained eye, I seem cold and distant, maybe even emotionless to those around me. I see myself becoming more and more reclusive, sleeping all day, cancelling all of my plans, looking forward to never seeing or speaking to people again. Essentially disappearing, and then if I am lucky...dying in my sleep. 

I need help. I am hurting so badly. All by myself. And everyone is so self contained that they barely notice. I don't know. I may just go meet my little brother up in the skies. I heard it was peaceful there.

Thanks for listening.
