I can't think of a fucking titleI hate the fact that I can't be good at fucking anything. Not *everything* but *anything*. An important distinction. Not saying I wish I could win every fucking battle, just that I could maybe win one every once in a while. And of course I'm not talking about anything major or serious because absolutely nothing in my life is important at all, but just every stupid little fucking insignificant little problem I encounter in my day to day life. Most specifically at the moment, video games. I am 21 years old, I have been playing video games from back when I was too young to even remember doing so, from what my parents tell me. It's always been a part of my life. Just about every day (well, before my depression got out of hand and I almost completely lost interest in them altogether) of my life I have played some games or another in my free time. And the thing that's got me fucking worked up is that for as much of my life as I've wasted on this bullshit, I am absolutely fucking terrible at video games. I don't mean in a comparing myself to others kind of way, I mean I struggle to play pretty much anything on the easiest fucking difficulty. Doesn't matter the genre, doesn't matter the specific game, I can't name one single game I've ever been good at. Now, this is fucking pathetic in itself that I even give a shit, it doesn't mean anything, it doesn't effect anything in my life realistically whatsoever, why even bother worrying about it? Because it's the principle of the thing. Because I waste my life, hours upon hours of my time, day in and day out... It's all I ever fucking do, it's the only thing remotely close to a hobby I have, and I can't even fucking do that well. I can't do *anything* well, not even the only fucking thing I've ever spent time on throughout my entire life. I could be talking about any other thing I do, doesn't matter, I don't do anything else anyway, but that's not really the point here, I can't do anything right. I suck at even the most basic fucking shit, everything I do, I just suck at. I'm fucking terrible at everything. I don't have any real skills or anything relevant to the real world that would actually mean anything to anyone, but what little things I *do* do, I can't even fucking do that shit well. What's the fucking point in trying to do anything if I can't even do the things I do every god damn day well? There's literally no point in me trying to make anything of myself because there's a 0% chance of me not fucking up every fucking step of the way. I have no reason to be alive. I have absolutely nothing to offer anyone. There's no reason a person like me should even fucking exist, yet here I am anyway because for some sick, twisted, sadistic, fucked up reason society has decided it isn't ok for someone to, as they put it "take the easy way out". I'm so fucking sick and tired of being a worthless waste of space with no hope of ever changing that. I'm so sick of people giving their fucking "advice" about how to "make myself a better person" or whatever the fuck flavor of the month bullshit they want to pretend they actually fucking believe just so they can look like they give a shit about what happens to me when I fail at everything and say I'd rather stop trying to make anything happen because after years of trying I've come to the conclusion that my life is worthless. Meaningless. There's no reason I'm alive. There's no fucking *plan* for me. There's no fucking light up ahead. There's no fucking reason why anything should ever change and anyone who thinks differently is completely fucking delusional because they've had some level in success in life, they don't understand what life is like for someone who's never succeeded at literally anything other than being a complete fuck up. I hate this world, I hate the people in it, I hate myself, I hate being alive, I hate being expected to not hate everything, I hate that I have to pretend like I don't hate everything, and all I fucking want is a way out. I don't give a shit if it gets better. I don't give a shit if the worst is behind me. I don't give a shit if nothing ever really gets any fucking worse. I. Just. Want. Out.
