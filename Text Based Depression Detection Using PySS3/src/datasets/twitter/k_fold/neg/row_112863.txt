I've fucked up my life in so many ways that I don't even want to think about itI just want to get away from it all. Most of my problems don't have a solution anyway.

I don't want anyone to care for me after I die, I want to be forgotten, I want it all to end soon. I should never have been born in the first place.

I had my hopes up for a good life, but it's all fucked up now. I'm sorry to be unable to enjoy such a beautiful world because of who I am and the shitty decisions I've taken.

Don't reply anything to this post, just read it.
