I think about this all the time...Do any of you ever look all the way back to the first posts of this subreddit and wonder if those people are still alive? I really hope they found a way out..... I think about those people all the time man... it makes me really wonder if there is truly a god that answers wishes and prayers and guide others to a path of happiness...
