WtfLife is short it's a fucked up world, fuck my life  how am I going to get through this why can't I just rewind the past live in it and be like everyone else for a change also i was a shy n quiet person who've taken special ed and was bullied or teased in school sometimes  I'm also jealous of my family and friends and other people for being so damn smarter than me which makes me feel separated from everyone else and so much dumber too that's why I hate living in the present its too complicated much harder to live and survive life sucks for all the bad reasons I'm just a jealous person and I too sometimes hate the world too much drama because all of that sometimes there no point in living I just want to live in my childhood past  without any bullshit n try to fix all my mistakes as I get older  bringing my updated cellphone with me but nooo there's no such thing as going back or time travel isn't it. I just want to have a better past present and future mostly a better present and future I'm not so sure what the future holds anyways. I know there are some people or maybe a lot feeling the  same way as im feeling right now including depressed and a sad sore loser but maybe their stories are a bit different than mines and I think I'm bisexual I know y'all think I'm crazy after reading my story but I'm not and that's why the world is a fucked up place to begin with!!!!
