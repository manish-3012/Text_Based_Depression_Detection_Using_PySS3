DeludedSo life is fucked up. That's the nature of life for everyone in some way or another, there's no perfect life, and I've come to accept that. There's joy in an imperfect life, if you're lucky I guess. But the only life I have right now is in my head, the characters there, they sometimes keep me safe. It's almost like a story, I know that they aren't real, just some deluded thought process to try and keep me safe, but every transition from that fantasy world to reality hurts a bit more. I like it in the fantasy land, but I can't keep myself there, no matter how much I wish to. At least there, I can cry, and someone will be there. But I'm not crazy, or at least I am crazy, but in a sane way. I can't exactly call it sane to tie my ankle to the bedframe, but I know if I get up now, I will just keep walking, until I'm at my spot, where I plan to end things. So I'm doing something crazy for a sane reason, right? I don't know whether self-preservation really is sane when it goes against every feeling you have. But I assume, as I'm writing here, that at least my feelings are somewhat conflicted on this. And I want to go back to the fantasy world again, because I know in my head I can get them to understand, that I can be ok for a while, but I don't want to keep coming back to this. But I know it's dangerous to do it, because I don't want to delude myself, I don't want to get to the point where I want the fantasies to be real so much I make myself believe them.
