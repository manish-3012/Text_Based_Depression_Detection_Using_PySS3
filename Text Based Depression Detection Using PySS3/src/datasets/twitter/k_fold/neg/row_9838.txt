You've heard it all beforeSorry if I have spelling errors english is not my first language. I've been thinking of the reason why I should post here in the first place if I wanted to go silently but I know ultimately I don't want to die. Fighting this depression like all of you out there. Suffering can not be measured is a line that stuck to me. I'm trying to find something to hold on to. I feel like having exhausted all options. I'm feel tired forever. I can not forget what happened to us. I don't see a future with these memories. I hate love, because I never felt love. Grew up faking it all and now I don't know who I am.  have kept me distracted. I hate all my emotions. Confused by them not being able to accept them and move on to the nothingness that is my everyday that spin me in a hellish circle of agony. I directly started making cuts towards main arteries. I wish I had a gun but it's forbidden in my location. I'm disgusting, I would not want to know myself and thats why I don't let anyone know my true self. I tried professional help 3 times, talked to former fiends about everything, read books and took different pills but my head screams fuck that, to all of it. I looked for euthanasia in my location, but I'm not allowed to die. I don't remember the last time I felt ok or how it feels to be ok. Where do I go from here? I don't want to die, I just don't see anything right now. Sorry if my grammar is messed up. I just wrote what came to mind.
