In a loop i can't get out of.It's been over half a year since she left me and i still can't forget and move on. I think about her everyday. I can't do this anymore, all i want is for her to call me or write me, so we can talk atleast. I can't live my life without her, she was my everything. I never asked for this, i never did anything in life to deserve this. I'm sitting here alone again, with some booze and i'm planning to get hammered, go out and hopefully see her, if i do, i will tell her everything i want to say and then off myself. One night i will run in to her, one night i will have the courage to stop her and tell her how i feel and how fucked up i am and that night i will have nothing left to live for.
