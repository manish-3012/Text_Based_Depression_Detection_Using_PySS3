I just feel pure hopelessnessI don't know what to do to make it better and it's kinda terrifying.  


I've been depressed/anxious/mentally ill for ten years now. I have a chronic pain condition which exacerbates the depression and the depression exacerbates the chronic pain. My dad is abusive and getting worse, he's starting to act out physically slightly, and I'm terrified me/my mom/etc are next. He's a narcissist who wouldn't even apologize for stealing my prescription meds, amongst other things he's done. He'll do favors or "nice" things and hold them over your head. I can't leave because I have no money and my mom can't leave because she's dependent on his health insurance for her heart disease &amp; COPD. I can't afford therapy.  


I have no friends because I ghosted all of them. Yes, every single one, and I have no idea why. It just felt like it was too hard to keep talking to them and try to be a good friend. I don't leave the house because I have nothing to do, and it's not like you can really socialize right now due to the pandemic. I'm trying to get a job but it's going nowhere, and honestly I kinda don't give a fuck because I'm so depressed. I don't enjoy any of my hobbies anymore. I'll play a game for ten minutes and quit because it feels pointless. When I try to make friends online it's so fucking hard because it feels insanely difficult to try and be interesting and fun when I'm so depressed.   


I don't know what to do. I feel like nothing is ever going to get better and I'll be alone forever. Even if that isn't true, I can't handle the depression right now, and the fear of living with my ever-increasingly abusive father, and just the general toxicity of the house because of it. Everything feels like a sprint and my ankles are broken. I just want the fuck out.
