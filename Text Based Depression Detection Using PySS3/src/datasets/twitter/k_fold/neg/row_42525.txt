Help. Suicidal and considering checking into hospitalFeeling more suicidal than ever before. Been contemplating checking into a hospital but dont know what to expect. I heard you're left with a massive bill once they're done with you too. I don't want to die but the anguish I'm feeling right now is unbearable.
