thinking aloudi'm under no illusions. I have such lovely family, they didn't deserve this addict/pathetic/dependant/leech/manipulator. i've had chances. I've connected with some real gems in life, none i've ever deserved. I'm just so hollow, wanted to leave my own random anonymous post here. im lonely.
