I've tried to escape, but it's impossibleAhead of me is nothing. I don't know what to do. Everytime I try to make it better it just gets worse. I think I'll be dead before monday. I live close to a very frequented railway and it only makes sense to use it and let the TGV take me out of this shithole. Everything has a place and mine is in front of that train.
