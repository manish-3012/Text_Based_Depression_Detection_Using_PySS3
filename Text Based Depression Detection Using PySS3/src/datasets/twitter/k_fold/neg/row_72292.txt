I know Iâ€™m worthless.Hi. Sorry for my English (it's not my native language).
For a few weeks I've been here, reading.
I have identified with many of the people here, the majority to be honest. Thatâ€™s the reason Iâ€™m writting.

I found happiness for a while.
But he left me.

And today I feel worse than ever.
Today more than ever I want to die. And I'm afraid, very afraid. But I canâ€™t  find other way out. I donâ€™t want to feel like this anymore.
