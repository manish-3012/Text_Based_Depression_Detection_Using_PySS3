I tried killing myself last nightI dont really like talking about myself like this but I feel like my room mates just dont care anymore. Last night after a pretty bad fight with my girlfriend, I started to feel like even when I try my best it doesnt matter.

 Its not good enough. Im not good enough for my career, Im not a good boyfriend, Im not a good son. I was such a shitty kid to my mom while she died of cancer. I didnt do enough and the guilts killing me. The pressures to be an adult and have a job and a house and everything just drills into me more and more. I want out. I miss my mom, I miss being a kid. 

I dont know what I plan to accomplish with this post, the sinking feelings I felt last night are coming back again, I think its only a matter of time at this point.
