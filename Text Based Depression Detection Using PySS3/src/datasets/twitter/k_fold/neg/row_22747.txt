first time in a long timeit seems like the tiniest thing can set me off.  after weeks of watching it happen, today was the day i finally got upset.  my friends have completely disregarded me. i am not talked to, cared about, or even thought about.  maybe one pretends to care but damn, what did i fucking do to be excluded like this
having no friends is terrifying.  no one to talk to, no one who gives a shit.  i could hurt myself badly and wouldn't get a second fucking glance because its just how i am.  my life is great but fuck, i wish someone other than my boyfriend cared.  my mom, dad, anyone.
and as i finish writing this i wonder why i would ever get rid of my blades, and what kind of help i expect to get from posting this.  its been so long.
