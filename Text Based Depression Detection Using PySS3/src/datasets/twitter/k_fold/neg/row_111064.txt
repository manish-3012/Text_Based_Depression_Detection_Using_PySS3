LostI have been struggling a lot recently. For almost a year Iâ€™ve been too sick to do anything. Even though the root of my problem was my gallbladder Iâ€™m still having problems and wish I never had that surgery. Iâ€™ve missed over 50 days of school and will not receive credit for any of my classes because of this. My parents are sick of me and just let me do whatever now. Thereâ€™s nothing I can do anymore. Itâ€™s the schools fault for refusing to let me do homeschooling. I donâ€™t want to live like this anymore but Iâ€™m too scared to die to do anything. I really shouldnâ€™t feel like this. Iâ€™m dating the love of my life and I donâ€™t want her to be sad or anything. Sorry Iâ€™m just ranting at this point.
