I want to kill myselfI can write a long-winded explanation why in painstaking detail going over my sad sob story and I can hear all the people that are going to tell me it gets better, it's worth living, and, you'll find something that makes you want to keep on going but the truth is here and now in this moment of time I don't want to. I can't. we humans are creatures of pattern we will do the same things over and over and over and the monotonous of that scares me. But the truth is my story, the story I wanted to believe started with a girl and ends because of that very same girl. Pay no attention to this post honestly this is the ramblings of a Deadman lost in thought his final hour goodbye.
