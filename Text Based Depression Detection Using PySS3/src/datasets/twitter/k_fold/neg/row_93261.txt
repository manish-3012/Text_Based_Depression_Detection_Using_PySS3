Does my life mean nothing when it comes to money?I found out yesterday that our insurance doesn't cover inpatient or outpatient programs. I tried killing myself last week, and have since been going to IOP (Intensive Outpatient). My parents said "It's not helping me" but I know the only reason they are taking me out is that the insurance doesn't cover it.  I might be able to keep going in 2019 but I won't be able to go for the rest of this year.

I think that I'm going to kill myself. I'm scared that I'm going to actually go through with it because I have no help, nothing to look forward too, and nothing happening in my life. I stopping going to school, I rarely see my two or three friends, and my dad has given up on me. What if I actually kill myself and my parents feel like shit because they decided not to get me help because of money. I understand it's expensive, but I'm a human, a living human. Does my life mean nothing to them?
