today marks one year since i tried to take my life (vent)ive been thinking about it all day. exactly one year ago i was unconscious in the hospital, itâ€™s kinda surreal. ive been working on recovery and doing well for awhile, and i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll ever attempt again. itâ€™s kinda strange how it all turned out. i was sure i wanted to end it all, but immediately regret it 1 second afterwards. all i could think about was everything i loved and how much i would miss it. ive developed a new appreciation for life since but damn thinking about it all has been painful. cheers to another year, alive and breathing.
