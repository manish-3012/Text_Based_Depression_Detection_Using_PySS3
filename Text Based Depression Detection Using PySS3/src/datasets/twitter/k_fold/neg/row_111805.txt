What's the pointWhat's the point with living,
Other people seem so happy..I dont get how
I never feel happy..only depressed and sad..
What did I do to deserve a life like this..I cry myself to sleep everynight for hours, I cry for hours when I wake up, I cry all the time..I just want an easy way to get out of this..Been thinking of making an exit bag or something..anyone have suggestions?
