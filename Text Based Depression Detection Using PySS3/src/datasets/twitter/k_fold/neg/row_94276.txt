I feel like thereâ€™s no way outMy boyfriend and I are moving into a new apartment Friday.
I have been working a new(ish) job for the last few weeks.
I am severely unqualified for this job. I only got it because the last girl quit and we needed someone to fill the slot.
I feel like I am failing left and right.
I feel like I canâ€™t do anything right at this job, but I canâ€™t take another job I was offered because my boyfriend just had his hours cut due to the pandemic.
I feel like I have no way out. 
I have to stay at this job so we can pay our bills.
I have to figure it out so I donâ€™t lose my job.
I feel so lost and alone, and all my boyfriend can say is â€œthings will get better,â€ but all year things just keep getting worse.
I feel like the only way out is to take a gunâ€” any one of the 5-6 he has laying aroundâ€” and put a bullet in my head.
