Just to get it off my chest.I'm not really depressed. I mean I get sad sometimes, I'm happy sometimes but most of the time I'm just neutral. I don't feel comfortable. I want to die. But I would never kill myself. Best way to put it is. If I was crossing the street and a bus was speeding at me. I wouldn't exactly run to get out of the way. I'm bored and lonely. I'm 20 and about to turn 21, and have no idea what I'm doing with my life. I feel stuck and have no where to go. I want to just sleep forever and not worry about anything again. I feel extremely stresses out but have very little responsibility. Get up in the morning, go to work, go home and repeat. I haven't dated in 2 years from being cheated on by my last 2 girlfriends wich made my confidence go to shit. I have some friends wich I feel is all I need. But I still just, don't feel like living anymore
