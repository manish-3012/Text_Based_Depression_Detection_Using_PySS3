I don't really have anything to look forward toLike the title says, I don't have any dreams or wishes to go after. I'm 19, living with my parents. I don't have plans go go to college. Theres nothing I want to do. I don't see why I shouldn't just kill myself besides my family and friends missing me, which isn't that big of a deal to me. I don't have depression or anxiety or any issues that I'm aware of. I'm not religious so there's nothing I'm concerned about after dying. I enjoy playing video games, and watching TV. That's all I have been doing for the past year, all day. I've been told I should join a video game related career but a lot of that stuff you have to go to college for, which is a lot of money I don't have and can't get. That also takes a lot of effort and I don't want to put that much effort into having a pretty shitty life, when I can just end my life. Why shouldn't i? What do I have to look forward to?
