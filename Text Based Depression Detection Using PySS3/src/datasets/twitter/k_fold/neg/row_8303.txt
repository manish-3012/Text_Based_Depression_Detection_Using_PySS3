How do I help someone Who won't help themselves?I have a friend who has been depressed for quite some time now and recently has been talking about how they feel suicidal. I've told them they to speak to someone trained and need professional help as my help can only go so far. I'm there for them, to listen to anything or just to be there with them but in the end I don't have the know-how to make a real difference. I just don't know what to do.

Recently this friend has been posting on FB and IG a lot about how they just want to 'end it' and that they can't find any reason to live. This really concerns me but sometimes I wonder if a real red flag and a cry for help or attention (not that it would affect me trying to help to the best of my ability). I feel bad for even thinking it but is constant posts to social media about ending it a sign they're working up toward it or that they just need to feel that people care about them from the responses. ( I could even understand if it was the latter; being at your lowest point, wondering if anyone even cared about you, what better way to test the waters than social media).

Sorry if this is somewhat scattered, I just want to be able to help and want to know how worried I should be.

Thank you in advance for any help.
