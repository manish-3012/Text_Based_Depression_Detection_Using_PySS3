I'm so tired - why am I here?On Earth that is.

I'm so tired of feeling, having emotions.

It's been nothing but a huge pain in the ass. I'm tired of crying over people who wouldn't even think twice about how I feel.

Honestly. I'm tired of it all. Everything. I don't know why I'm here forced to live my life in pain and sorrow by myself. I just don't understand. 

Happiness? I'll never achieve it yet everyone expects me to hold my head up and be put on a strong face for someone else other than me.

Not once in my life have I thought about myself, I always put others first. Now that I've been battling depression unlike ever before all everyone expects me to do is think about how others would feel yet no one cares about how i feel.

I'm just tired. It feels like it'll never end. An endless cycle of crying and being alone, that's been my life since the beginning - I absolutely believe that's how my life will end as well. I ask myself constantly. 

What the fuck is the point.
