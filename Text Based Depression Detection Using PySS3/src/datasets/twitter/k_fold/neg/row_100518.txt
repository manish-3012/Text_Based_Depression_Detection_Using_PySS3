FarewellIn the past I could talk for hours on end about minor things in life. Looks like I've changed, I've become so weak that I can't say anything other than the pure minimum, even to my loved ones. The fact that we've become distant recently doesn't help, I imagine.

It's so hard to remain alive, for me at least. Every day is a constant struggle. I'm lost and I don't know what to do or where to go now.
