Today is her birthdayHi guys, today is her birthday. The woman that i pushed away second time... The woman who was there when no one else was... The woman with whom i wanted to spend everyday... but i pushed her away, because i was scared, to express my feelings, but to be fair she has a boyfriend and i said to myself i dont want to be an ass even though we had sparkling moments....:D ...i dont even know why i put a laughing emoji there... also a big part is taken by depression... hating myself and deep down knowing i would not make her happy... So... i want to wish you happy birthday bab, i love you... and i think i will love you forever... you deserve the best and only the best and i am sad that i am not the one who can make you happy... and maybe in a few weeks i will be gone, but i want you to know... that in my fucked up brain... in this mess, in this windy environment, you are the only clear and bright place... the place when i felt safe, happy... even though when  sometimes we met for just a few hours in a month, you were the reason keeping me alive... when i wanted to end it... but now i lost you.. i lost you because of myself... thank you everyone for reading this... have a nice day..
