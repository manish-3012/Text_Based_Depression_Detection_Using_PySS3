I survived.Yesterday I made a post about how I was about to jump off the 150 ft. cliff near my house. Shortly after that was posted I remember saying "goodbye world" and slowly falling forwards off of the cliff. Next thing I knew someone found me and brought me to the hospital, and now I have gashes all over my body and multiple broken bones. But I'm still in complete shock, and just can't believe that I made it out alive after that much impact on my body. The nurses said I was completely unconscious when they took me into the hospital. Maybe something caught me as I was falling. Anyways, I guess it just wasn't my time to go. And I'm really glad I didn't go. I also can't believe how much support I got from you guys on my previous post! I feel extremely loved now thanks to all of your guy's support! I'm so sorry to leave you all worried about me! And, I completely understand if you all are extremely mad at me. Just know that I'm here now, and I'm not going anywhere.
