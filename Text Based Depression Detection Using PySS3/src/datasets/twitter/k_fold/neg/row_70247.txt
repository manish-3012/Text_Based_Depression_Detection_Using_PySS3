Life is hardI'm feels as if I'm lunging around a vessel everyday and I'm just watching as a spectator. I have no purpose in life, no friends, I have no one but my two best friends irl, my mom and dad. Everyday I get up its literally the hardest thing to do, the second is saying im going to go through with something but not ever following through with it. For the past five years I'm stayed stuck in stasis and my life has bee. Absolutely miserable. I cant tell if I'm lazy or depressed anymore its gotten so bad. But......I have a friend here who wont let me give up and tells me I'm worth something even if I do absolutely nothing and for that I'm show my gratitude.
