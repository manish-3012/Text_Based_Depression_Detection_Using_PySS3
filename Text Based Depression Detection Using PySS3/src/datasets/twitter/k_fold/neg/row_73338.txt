I'm checking out reddit. I am considering posting my real account here, so you can see I used to be a happy person. I'm just so fucking tired. 

I have to gather some things to get this done with. Fuck. I wish I had the energy to get a gun. I've got some pills, not sure if they are enough. I can make a cocktail, but maybe hanging too. 

Don't let this happen to you. 

Goddamn there is a wonderful resolve to knowing you can do a thing. I know they say people who have really decided they are going to commit suicide feel better, and it's true. It's true. A peace that passes all understanding.
