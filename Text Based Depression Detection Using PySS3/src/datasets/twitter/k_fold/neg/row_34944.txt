UselessnessI'm going to be completely frank. I'm a completely useless piece of shit in this world. 

My friends don't give a shit, my family doesn't give a shit, and I'm not even sure I can make it to college without going off the edge. 

Every day, I almost hurl myself in front of the goddamn subway train and I still have no fucking idea how I'm still alive, 

I can't call anyone or text, so I've resorted to here.

I can't go on living like this anymore.
