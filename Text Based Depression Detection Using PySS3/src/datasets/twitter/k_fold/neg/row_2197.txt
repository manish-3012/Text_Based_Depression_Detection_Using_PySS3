I'm NEVER good enough for my parentsI'm 16 and live in New Zealand. I spend a lot of my time on the computer on the internet. Living with family but have no contact with them, I only go out sometimes to see friends. I am generally a shy person.

Every conversation I have they'll subtly suggest I'm a loser. The questions they ask, the way they word things. My emotions just sometimes absolutely jump. They complain that I can't have a nice conversation with them, WELL MAYBE STOP TALKING ABOUT HOW PATHETIC YOU THINK I AM. IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. I had to have several goes at typing that because I had a spasm of anger.

They don't realise I have their email passwords and can see the hurtful things they email other family members about me. It hurts more than their subtle questions, and is obviously a more honest approach.

I am often described socially awkward and they don't realise how much it hurts me. So many who are themselves hating judgement will quickly say it, and inside I will crush. Also weird. Everyone thinks I'm a weirdo. Parents tried forcing me to drop out of high school because I was 'different'. I don't see what's so bad about me.

I have little friends and have much trouble making any. When I do something productive or organise something everyone will hate it. It really hurts, I'm not trying to do a competition with other people. I just want to do my own thing. I've organised events which have been in the paper, a music website and a successful Minecraft server. All to receive negative comments from friends and people I know eager for me stop, eventually causing me to with no motivation to do anything else with myself. How nice.

Really, right now I just need a genuine opinion that my life will be good. I could see myself just ending my life off. My life consists of school, then locking myself in the bedroom. It may not be bad compared to others, but it's not healthy.
