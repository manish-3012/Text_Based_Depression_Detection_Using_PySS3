I want to kill myself, I am just not sure how. I have started planning, but I am not sure if Iâ€™m brave enough to do it.I am so tired. Itâ€™s just endless. I canâ€™t take much more. Since I was 8 I have been physically, emotionally and sexually abused. I was raped two years ago and Iâ€™ve had countless bouts of severe depression which ruins any progress I make in life. No one has ever loved me - I am good for sex but that is it. It hurts so much that Iâ€™m not good enough for love. I just want everything to stop.
