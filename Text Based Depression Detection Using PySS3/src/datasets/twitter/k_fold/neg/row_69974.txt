I need to talkI need to get this out and heard somewhere before I go back down a deep black hole again.
I was continually abused from a very young age. I was diagnosed with depression, ptsd and disassociation about 10 years ago. I was on the verge of taking my life three times. Slowly I started to learn how to live with my baggage, I even went back to school. After a life saving surgery two years ago my life started changing. I started feeling better and better. It has been good lately, but I noticed I fear of being touched is returning. I startle when people touch me unexpectedly, or come up from behind me. Tonight I have been horrible flashbacks, detailed and more vivid than they have been in a long time. They nauseate me, I want to cry but I canâ€™t, I want to sleep but I canâ€™t. If Iâ€™m going back this hole Iâ€™m done, I canâ€™t do it again.
