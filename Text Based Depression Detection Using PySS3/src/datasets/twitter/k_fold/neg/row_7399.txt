I want to die...I'm going through something and its bad very badFor the past 6 months I have been sick with something. Something that is taking every that i ever was and every will be from me and I can take no more. I really want to die but I am terrified of the permentness of it all. My body is failing me from the inside out. And I want out now!

EDIT: Illness has to do with my muscles and my mind. My muscles are poping and deflating all over my body, Just now I felt one on my left elbow one in my back and one on my right buttock.I find myself not being able to put any weight on my lower legs. Any weight is handled by my upper legs/thighs. Which makes walking &amp; moving incredibly uncomfortable and very strenuous. 

As for my mind I find myself losing sensations all over my body. I'm not numb or anything. Sences and perception are just not there. Losing focus and concentration. Complete memory loss of my past.I Keep saying "i'm not the "shaun" that i once was. Its even affecting my sexual function. Im not able to get hard hard like i once was. I don't shoot out like i once did, nor do i produce as much as i used to. I also dont feel the same orgasmic sensation that i used to. My orgasms have weithered away to NOTHING.

Im losing the sence and perecption of food in my mouth. After just a few bites I lose all feeling of food in my mouth, Its weird.

Im also loosing the abilty to feel myself breathe and every so often my breathing will get real tough. Like really labored breathing but that goes away..eventually
