Not OKIm 22 ciswhite male and seriously depressed, tonight Im just gonna go to bed because its 12:38am

but tommorow the cycle will likely repeat, I am always constantly depressed that I am alone, I have no friends, no love interests, Just alone. I live with my parents but mom and dad cant keep taking care of me forever, when I move out I'm doomed to eternal lonlieness.
I just want to know what it feels like to Laugh, to smile, to love...
