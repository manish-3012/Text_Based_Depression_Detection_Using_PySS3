Why am I losing?I feel like there's no escape from all this toxicity in my life. It has been a factor ever since I could remember; everyone's (family) problems have influenced my path in life and when I make an attempt to get help or find common ground, just something that will make sense. It's like everyone is just brushes me off or tells me to get over it. I have no where to go to find refuge ever since I moved back home to save money in college. It makes me extremely sad. I was already at a disadvantage before I could even start. I always dealt with my rejection long enough, but they really make me want to disappear at this point. I am just so so so so so tired of dealing with all these problems. I don't understand why everyone is depending on me to make their lives better and solve their social problems when I am only 19 years old. I don't even have a name for myself, and I'm just trying to figure myself out, and when I want help or just a simple conversation, everybody is so quick to shut me up or like give me money so I can feel better about something. I never ask for anything except a piece of your time, a simple conversation, a moment to CONNECT with someone because I'm an only child and everyone seem so preoccupied when I was younger, and now I'm older so why is it so hard? And my mother addiction to drugs only makes it worse because she becomes very mentally and emotionally abusive that tears me down in such innocent situations, so I developped a a negative traits. I don't know what to do. I am sad. I am hurt.
