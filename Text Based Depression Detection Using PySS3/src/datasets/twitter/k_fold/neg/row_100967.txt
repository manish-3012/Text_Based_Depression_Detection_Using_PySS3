F15 My mother just laughed at my suicide noteI hate this, I fucking hate it, SO bad... I never asked to be born, neither did I ask to have a "mom", of course the one who actually cared about me aka my dad HAD TO DIE. I fucking hate it, oh yeah mom, you really do care about me!! fucking yell at me every single day, say that its my dad's fault that I want to kill myself &amp; literally after looking inside my room because you thought I stole the keys, you opened my closet, and wow!! surprise surprise!! there was my suicide note that I wrote yesterday, which I wrote before almost dying yesterday. "Its always about you, never about me, you ungrateful piece of shit" yeah mom, you are always so FUCKING right, I have to live with you because I am ACTUALLY forced to live with you, I remember the amount of times that I said "I love you mom" but do I really love you mom? no, I definitely do not, why are you being forced to love someone that makes you want to kill yourself? but... at the end of the day mom, both me and you know that if I were to commit suicide you would regret all the things that you have done, beating my ass for saying "fuck" or beating my ass because I say that you don't give a fuck about me. Keep the money to yourself, I doubt you'll even waste money for my upcoming funeral.
