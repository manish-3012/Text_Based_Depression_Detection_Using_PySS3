Can you being suicidal without depression or sadness?I woke up today with orders in my head. A clear and crisp repetition of 'Commit suicide'. It's been happening more and more lately. I thought today was going to be a drag. But it's not. I thought I was going to be depressed all day. But I'm not. I'm quite content actually. I've got plenty of energy, and a big goofy smile.
How do I bounce back from suicidal thoughts so casually? Does anyone else feel suicidal without actually being down?  I'm not unhappy. I don't hate myself. I have a good life and people are generally really nice to me. I don't think I exhibit any signs of depression, other than this newfound lack of desire to connect/talk with anybody, even my own family. I figure I'm either really mentally sick and I don't realize it, or I'm becoming enlightened. Who knows?
