I'm not supposed to be here...I've struggled with mental health problems since I was 14 after I was raped, stalked and a bunch of other stuff I dont feel like getting into. Its messed up all my relationships even on a professional level. 

I tried to take my life 4 years go. Was unsuccessful.  Then 3 years ago my oldest brother passed away in his sleep. It's been so hard on me and my family. 

In February this year, I had a suicide attempt that landed me into the hospital. I am therapy, taking medications and doing things that was helping even if others around me didnt necessarily agree with them. Not once did I think of taking my life.

Then my youngest brother took his life three months ago. It was the first night of what was supposed to be our family vacation. 

Since then I am bitter and angry because why does he get to leave and I have to stay here? And I'm so sad and I feel like it's mostly my fault. Ultimately, my soul is in a great deal of pain and I can't bare it.

Lately all I want to do is sleep if I have to stay here. I'm making decisions I feel like I dont really want for the sake of my family. 

I dont plan on leaving but I really wish I could.


Thank you for reading. Just need to tell someone else other than the woman I pay weekly.
