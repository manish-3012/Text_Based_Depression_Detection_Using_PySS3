Giving inI've been unhappy for the past two months. I've lost the me I was before. I'm no longer content in living. 

  I had an argument with my mother today which was kind of ridiculous. She got mad at me for smoking the same brand of cigarettes this one individual smokes. She said I didn't have my shit together, that I didn't need her tax papers to file for financial aid (even though I told her that because I'm below the age of 24, the state still considers me a dependent under her.), she goes to compare me to my brother and how he's gay but he has an education, says I don't have my shit together (obviously you don't know that I'm dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts, you wouldn't understand.). 

  I'm done. I can't do it anymore. What's the point of living if you're going to be ridiculed for living in it. 

  I'm off tomorrow for work so that's a good thing. I work today though, so after work, I'll head home and I'll finish what I've been trying to do.
