My life in this 'story'Keep in mind I am in 8th grade.

There once was a man named Steve. Steve was not like the others. Steve was the person who was a social outcast. Since elementary school up to this point he had thought friends and life was going to be a smooth sail onto his ending days. As it had seemed a storm was brewing nearby that ship and had messed up the course of direction.
     This was Steve's description of 8th grade. The year were he had no friends, nor anyone to talk to, or anyone to care. Steve had always thought those past years life was going to maintain that smooth sail. but as all good things come to an end, that sail had.
     Because of his lack of friends, social skills, and abundance of depression he never seemed to be happy with how life has occurred those past 7 months in school.
     Those 7 months were a living hell for Steve. He had lost many things that were dear to him during that time. He had let his anger control him, which would result in him thinking of how he could of done better. Everyday he thinks of that thought he doesn't understand why he hasn't ended it all yet. Why he killed himself.
     Most people would forget in a week or so anyways as it would seem. So that's what he was going to do. This year in 2015 Steve was going to commit to at least one thing in his life and do this.
     It seemed during this time of distress he had forgotten what was most dear to him, his only friend. He had done exactly what he had done with his anger. Forgotten his surroundings and had already said he would do it.
     This failure would result in Steve becoming more depressed than he was in earlier months. Thinking of ending it all the being reminded of the one string that connected him to be his own self.

The 'one string' is a metaphor for my only friend. I seem to be losing touch with her however. :(
