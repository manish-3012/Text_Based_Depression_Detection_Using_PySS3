mindless roller coasterhere are how my days go

morning: either blissfully happy or dreadfully hopeless

Afternoon/evening: opposite of morning mood

And it happens every. fucking. day.

It honestly feels like I have two personalities, ones pessimistic and the other is optimistic. Im two fucking people in one.
