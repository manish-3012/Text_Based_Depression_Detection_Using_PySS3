Wish was less demanding, as youngerWhen didn't keep asking what is the point of everything, when it was hella funny to play that stupid old cell phone's mining game with my cousins, or playing with my neighbor, pretending we were Sonic characters and running all over the place (haha). Why did I change to a worse one, that can't feel happiness in anything? Who knows
