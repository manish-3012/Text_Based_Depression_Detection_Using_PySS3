thought i'd end it so didnt do any of my uni applications or important school essays, now fuckedIDK what to do, i feel like i need to at least attempt suicide to weasel out of this. im so fucking scared of dying but i feel like my hand is being forced. 
quarantine made me realise even more im not cut out for life, like that line about lucy in dracula. im too emotionally fragile to exist, i cry over the thoughts of pigs being killed, i dont want to love anyone other than a carbon copy of my ex, even the thought that this place is full of peoples last messages makes me feel like im going to have a heart attack and cry. its not worth living a life of stress and shame for moments of slight content. i dont work out to get better, i work out because i hate my body, et cetera

i dont even "want" to die anymore, i just don't want to live like this, but solving all my problems, fixing my uncountable personality flaws and mental illness, and finding a partner who loves me and i wont fuck up is a fantasy. the only way i could live a happy life is to hope the lack of oxygen fixes my brain or i get to just lie in hospital and think about my life without being misunderstood. i could talk for hours but i dont know what i want to say, its too much and its all fragmented garbage. i dont even care about some of it anymore but the memory still hurts and feels like a weight on my brain

i know this post is a mess
