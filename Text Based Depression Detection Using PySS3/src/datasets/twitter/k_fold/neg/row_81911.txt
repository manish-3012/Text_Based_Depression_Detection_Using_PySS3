Need advice and general help.Ive been dealing with depression for about the past 3 years and last school year has been the worst especially since my parents divorced halfway through the school year.

I was hoping this would be my last year of highschool and finally be done with it And do something I enjoy. But in that time I picked up selfharming as a way to deal with depression which only made everything more difficult. I skipped a lot of school because I didn't want to wake up or we had gym classes that day (didn't want anyone to notice my selfharm scars/cuts) the only reason I pulled thru it was because this was my last year of highschool and I was finally able to do something I enjoy after that.

The big mistake I made was to not talk to anyone in real life. I occasionally made some reddit posts or talked online to someone but that was about it.

So throughout the whole year I was only called lazy for not showing up and my parents forced me to go every day and I was doing everything I could to make it but because of all the lessons I skipped and I just couldn't make it and I failed my exams.

Now I have to redo the entire year over again. But this time I have to do it in a completely new class, ( I'm quite shy and last year I just stuck with 5good friends from the previous years) having  to live in a completely new house in a new neighborhood and with my mental conditions worse than ever.

I planned to kill myself at the end of the vacation, i got about 5weeks left.

I'm not good at conveying my emotions over text sorry :c
