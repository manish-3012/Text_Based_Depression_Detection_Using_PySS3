my suicidal ideation is returningi havenâ€™t had such dark thoughts in over a year. the last time i had these thoughts i went to the emergency room and finally got medicine for my depression. and it had been working until now. i donâ€™t even know if i actually want to do anything, but i feel like being destructive, like overdosing on pills or self harming but without dying (for now). can anyone else relate? what makes these thoughts go away? i live alone and iâ€™m scared iâ€™ll try to do something tonight and i wonâ€™t be lucky enough for it to not be fatal
