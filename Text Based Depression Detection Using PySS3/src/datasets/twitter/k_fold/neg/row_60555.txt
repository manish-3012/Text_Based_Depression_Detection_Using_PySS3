My life is incredibly empty.I have nothing. No friends, I don't spend much time with my family(and I don't want to), and I never really have the chance to go outside. I think my anxiety and feelings of hopelessness are to blame for this, mostly. I don't really see any way out of this shitty life.

Wish things could be better. I truly do.
