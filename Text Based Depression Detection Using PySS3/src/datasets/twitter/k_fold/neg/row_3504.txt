Iâ€™m really fucking strugglingI feel awful all the time. I lay in bed most of the day for most of the days. I donâ€™t see that light at the end of the tunnel anymore. My heart is broken. I canâ€™t move on from him for some dumb reason. I just want him back. I miss him so much. 

I recovering from rape. Two rapes in the past year. Iâ€™m at a point where Iâ€™m at a new low. Last year I was extremely sad and depressed. Now I just feel numb and detached. The only feeling I have is pain. 

Iâ€™m not sure how much longer Iâ€™ll be alive. My life is and always has been a nightmare. I can only be happy for like a month or two and then everything comes crashing down again. I donâ€™t get why I canâ€™t have a normal life. Where I donâ€™t end up in the hospital more than once a year for both mental and physical health issues. Where I have a boyfriend for a long time. Iâ€™m not even aiming for marriage at this point, I just want to date someone for at least a year. I keep getting dumped after a month or two at most. 

I feel sick all the time. I have no appetite. I know all the coping skills. They donâ€™t help. Theyâ€™re short term bandages for permanent wounds. Iâ€™ve been depressed and anxious since I was at least 10 if not younger. 

I just want to be happy. I want to be able to go a couple of months without being suicidal. I want to have a good life and I canâ€™t have it. Iâ€™m so close to giving up. Itâ€™s so clear that this is my life and that my life is a fucking nightmare. Iâ€™m having stomach cramps at the moment for fucks sake. Thereâ€™s always something fucking wrong with me. 

I want to give up. Iâ€™m starting to want to die. Iâ€™m so scared. I just want a happy life.
