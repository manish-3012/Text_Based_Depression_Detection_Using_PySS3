I (14m) was being raped by a close friend (22f) constantly for years. She killed herself.In her apology note, she states that all she did to me was because she loved me and couldn't show it normally, and she thought it wasn't mutual, so she used her body, the only part of herself that she knew I liked, to show it.

If only she'd have told me earlier. If only she didn't cause so much pain and confusion.
