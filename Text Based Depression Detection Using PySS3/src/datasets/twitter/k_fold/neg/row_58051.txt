why should i even botherI just graduated college, i have three degrees and yet i cant find a job better then walmart working the night shift. i make 10 dollars an hour just enough to pay the bills and buy food, maybe see a movie one day if im lucky. i also just recenlty came to terms with myself being gay. needless to say it been rough. i cant seem to find a better job, ive applied and applied and applied and i just cant find one. it doesnt help that my degrees are in things i hate, that i have been pushed into. im a smart kid that has no future. no hope of repaying the vast amount of college debt and can barely make it day to day. all i do is work at night sleep in the day and maybe make it to the gym at somepoint. i have to wonder what is the fucking point? why do i even bother, i have a mountain of debt, no job perspectives, no love, no friends out here (just moved to north dakota) a family im not in the remotest way connected to other then blood, but no real emotional ties or connections to them. dont hate them dont like them just feel mostly indifferent towards them. so i have to wonder why shouldnt i go buy a gun   with the the couple hundred dollars i actually have saved and just put one in between my eyes or buy some pills and od? not existing at this point seems like a better option then stuggling on thorugh shit and being a wast of space.
