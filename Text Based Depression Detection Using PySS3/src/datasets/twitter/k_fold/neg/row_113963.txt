I hate myselfI hate waking up in the morning doing the same routine everyday. I tried trying to get my mind off her and my probloms, I've tried working out, dieting, doing new things, tried talking to diffrent people. It dosnt help, I just feel hopeless 24/7. I havent felt like my self since November 17th 2019 when we broke up. I was so easy to throw away and forgot. Every relationship I've been in resulted in her losing feelings in me while I'm completely happy and loving them. I hate that feeling of loving someone so much but your partner is talking to someone so much better then you. I'm just the background character. I'm the text that no one wants to answer. I feel like the part of me in November 17th died that day and I'm left with the broken hearted shell. Ever since that day I've thought about suicide most days. And a couple times I had gone close to the deep end. I know the "your young, you have your whole life ahead of you" but what's the point when you dont have anything to look forward to in life. Everyone pushes me aside and pretends I'm not there. If I were to die in my sleep, No one would notice. I just hate feeling so alone. My whole life I've just been by myself. No you to say I love you no one to hug me. No one to ask how I am. I'm not really sure what I'm doing typing this tbh. Anyway. Idk what to feel. I dont want to die, but at the same time I dont wanna wake up anymore. I'm still working out and dieting. Been doin that scince September 15th. I've lost like 13 pounds and I'm 197.7 pounds. I dont really know why I typed that. Anyway, I'm just ranting ig. I just wish I was different or there was some sort of button I could press that made this feeling go away. Thanks for reading
