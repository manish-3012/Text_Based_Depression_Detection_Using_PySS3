The shame..5 months ago I was an extremely suicidal and pathetic mess. I contacted my ex. This conversation escalated. In the end she insulted me SO badly and it was SO spot on that I couldn't deal with it anymore. It kept repeating over and over again. When I woke up I felt like a piece of garbage because of her insults. Out of frustration I kept sending messages to her and deleting it within 5 minutes. I wanted to kill myself to make those thoughts stop, but I'd only prove her right with that. 

I feel so embarassed that I was acting like this too.. I feel like I lost my dignity. Her insults will repeat on my deathbed. I can't shake them. It fucking sucks. Something died inside of me after hearing what she's said and I'm very afraid it will never come back. It doesn't help that I'm extremely neurotic. 

My goal for the next 7 years is to become a very succesful and impressive person, but if her insults continue to linger then I'll never be 100% happy again and I'm very afraid that something so small and stupid as contacting my ex has ruined my life.
