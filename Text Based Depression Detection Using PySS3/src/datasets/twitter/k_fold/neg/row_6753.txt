I want to disappear and I wish no one knew (of) meI have no one who truly knows me. I have a single parent who is too preoccupied to give any attention to me. My younger sibling is too young to care. My "friends" are constantly expecting things from me while never bothering to give anything back and they are always pissed at me for something or the other, never bothering to talk to me about any of it. I just broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years because I feel like even after so many years of trying for him to get to know me, he still doesnt. I have been through things in life that not many ycan relate to and hence understand or talk about. I always feel isolated and disconnected from those around me. I am sick of trying to get people to understand me. I am sick of it all. and  I just wish that no one ever knew of me at all.
