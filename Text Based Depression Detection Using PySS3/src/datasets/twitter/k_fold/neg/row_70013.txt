I'm doneI have been depressed my whole life now. And I just can't go on any longer. I have been to shrinks for this, And after many sessions we came to the conclusion it was handed down to me via genes. Witch means I will suffer from it the rest of my life. And I just can't handle that. I'm 18 years old and have been depressed most of the time. I can't remember when I was happy for the last time. I can't enjoy things. Feel so empty inside. Nothing to look forward too. I feel like I can't control my own life since everything is going wrong. I tried getting my self out of this mind set multiple times. But for every step forward I take life just gives me a sucker punch. I lost the love of my life because I just couldn't get my self to be happy, and ended up dragging her with me in my feelings. 
And I just have had enough of life. What makes life worth it if I'm gonna be depressed 90% of the time. If I am not able to enjoy the small things. What makes it worth it when I hate myself so much that I can't look at myself in the mirror. Why would I keep on living if I can't think of one thing that makes me just a tiny bit happy. I have nobody I can talk to about this. 
So some may call it selfish but isn't it better to just kill my self. And be done with al this. I have no future why wait to see myself slowly become more and more depressed as everything in life is going wrong.
