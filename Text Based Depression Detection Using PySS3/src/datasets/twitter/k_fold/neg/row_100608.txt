Iâ€™m sorryIâ€™m a waste of space and Iâ€™ve never had any real friends my own mom didnâ€™t even know me I had so much fun yet somehow I was miserable for every second no one will remember me except for my family and Iâ€™m even helping them out no more bonds or stealing for drugs and alcohol or late nights picking me up from rehabs Iâ€™ve been kicked out of I donâ€™t want help I want silence I jus wanted someone to know the things going through my head today was the last straw I finally realized jus how much I hate myself really and how much I want this seemingly never ending nightmare to be over and I had it so much better than most people too I was blessed and cursed but all I can do is look back in it
