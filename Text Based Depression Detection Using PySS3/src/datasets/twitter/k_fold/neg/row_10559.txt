I can't take it anymore.I am turning 40 soon and I am still single and alone. I have put myself out there for eight years and all I got was played, used, rejected. I am so tired of being alone and single and never having anyone to connect with or get close too or build a life with. I am so tired of not having anyone to make memories with or get close too or share things with. to love and to be loved. I am so tired of being rejected and no one giving me a chance. I just can't take the loneliness anymore. Now I understand why my mom ended her life out of being single and alone. I can understand now how it can cause you to want to end things. I am there in that same boat. I can't do it anymore. maybe it is for the best.
