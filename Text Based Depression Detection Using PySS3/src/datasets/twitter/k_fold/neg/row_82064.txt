Felt like shit for 2 daysWell it's because of my boyfriend but I know people will say break up but idk how cus I've never done it before. I also feel like if we break up I'd have nothing to live for and it would hurt me so much I would snap. Living is such a chore when you don't want to be alive but I'm too much of a coward to actually do anything serious.

I cut myself again after being a few months clean, I just want to throw myself off something I hate feeling such pain and it goes then something small can trigger something and it comes back again. I'm stuck
