It's just not fairMy life isn't terrible. I have some friends, a family that fights a lot but nothing awful. I'm a fucking loser but that is okay. I'm just so tired of living, I'm so tired of being sad, so tired of trying to be happy and failing. It just sucks. I just want to be happy and I can't be. I don't want to die, I just don't want to live.
