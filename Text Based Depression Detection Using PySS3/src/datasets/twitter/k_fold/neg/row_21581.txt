i desperately need someone to stop mei will just get straight to point. i am so fucking close. So s o close. 
Iâ€™ve been purposeless since ages. And so fucking depressed since years. 
Recently a friend of mine gave her kitten to foster. 
She already had 2. 
well i got very attached 
And now sheâ€™s urgently asking her back after 2 months and this kitten was the only thing that was stopping me from doing anything and now sheâ€™ll go and i cant stop crying and my brain wont stop giving me ideas
