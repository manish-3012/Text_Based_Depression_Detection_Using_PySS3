I'd rather die young than grow old.Like the title says. Life's been shit up until now, 18 years literally thrown in the garbage. The only sliver of happiness I might get to experience will be while I'm still young. That's why I might just stick around for a few more years. I can't and don't want to experience my quality of life degrading day by day and reminiscing about the "good times". I'd rather end things on a high note.
