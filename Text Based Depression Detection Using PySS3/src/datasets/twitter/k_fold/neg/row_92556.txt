Suicide attempt**Warning: this is long w/ lots of characters. Humor me pls. I need unpack.**
Sunday night/Monday morning I overdosed on xanax and took a handful of asprin just to make anyone helping's life that much harder. I texted my friends goodbye and got a response from a friend. We are gunna call her *M*. *M* called me and tried to get info I didn't want to give out. So she contacts another friend, *S*. *S* is my most precious person. I couldn't help but tell her everything. *M* then used this information from *S* to then call my parents, she's in Maryland and I'm in Virginia, and got me to the hospital. Xanax OD causes respiratory arrest and knocked me out. I fell asleep, my breathing stopped, and my heart followed. *A* is an overdoser in the room next to me. "I was crazy worried b/c you sounded so young and you kept flatlineing. The nurses wouldn't tell me anything. I tried to tell them to send you to where I'm going, but they said you had to choose yourself." -*A*. Monday didn't happen. Not to me. It was blur of hospitals and text messages and snapchats and oh my god everyone knows now and I get flashes of memories. **Me and my mom in the hospital room. "Why did you do it?" "Why do you think?"**
**It's Monday 6pm. Last goodbye texts as my cellphone is taken and I'm shuffled into a van and trasported...  somewhere? Did I agree to this? Where am I?** Someone tells me to write down all the contacts I want to talk to while here. What? Why? Okay then. I pick three. *M*, *S*, and my parents. I ate dinner with strangers and go to an empty room and cry and cry and cry. Where am? What do I do? Who am I? The next morning is better. A nice man asks me what I'm in for and a happy lady is singing. *A* is here. We talk. We are  friends. We confide. And I tell people what I think they don't frown and they don't shy away. I simply exist as I am; imperfect, alongside other inperfects. Nurses who don't pretend to understand. Doctors who try. Patients who know. Our days are scheduled, but it's up to us to participate. I talk, I paint, I laugh, I color, I *live*. My parents never did pick up until Wednesday. *S* talked once but was busy with travel and was kept informed by *M*. *M*... is the reason I made an effort. She's harsh, sharp words that cut there victim without mercy; Tough love and "get your shit together". But also soft tones and hugs and "take your time" and "your feelings are valid". *S* gives me light. A future to work towards. "Let's travel" and "we can do better, next semester" and "don't leave me". She's my sunshine. And all the sudden it's Thursday and I'm being released? and I have medications and my parents are asking why I did it and why I am depressed and my social worker tells me my friends are temporary and parents are forever. And now I'm home. Away from schedules and knowledge of the mind. And I'm tired because *oh god everyone knows who let me have a phone while I was drugged?!* and I have the feeling to scream in the back of my throat. But I have *S* and *M*. I have a future and a present. And I have support and autonomy, I just had to find it. The thoughts aren't gone. I took one step into this house and my heart dropped and wanted to die again. But I know to take myself seriously this time. To reach out and distract myself.
TL;DR
I tried to kill myself and ended up in a psych ward and it was scary and great at the same time. I found my present and my future. I'm not "cured" or anything, but I'm in recovery. Sometimes you gotta fall apart to really put yourself together.
