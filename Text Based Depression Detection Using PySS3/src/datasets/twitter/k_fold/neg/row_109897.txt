at the end of the day being happy means nothingi wish i could enjoy without coming home to nothing but hatred and depression. i feel like every good emotion i had is fake and at the end all that matters is being honest with how shit i always feel, even when i don't. it's really, in the most real sense, impossible to feel ok, and perhaps being ok is what this is. being clear with how pointless and worthless every single thing is, at the end of the day. no amount of energy being put into anything holds any value, it means nothing and it changes nothing. i hope i die soon, and i hope it's not myself who takes my life, but it seems nothing else will.
