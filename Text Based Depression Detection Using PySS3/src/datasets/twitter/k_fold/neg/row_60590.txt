My brother (21) denies the fact that he has aspergers. It's ruined his and my family's life.I understand that not everyone with aspergers is like this. 

My brother was only diagnosed with aspergers last year but before that everyone would dismiss him as "very very shy". Because of this he never got the right amount of help at school so he failed all of his exams. Leaving him stuck at home and jobless. He refuses to get help now as he denies having autism as he thinks those with autism are stupid etc. He probably developed this idea from the internet and all the different stigmas.

 He's very abusive.
 I remember when we were younger I used to play computer games with him and every time I lost he would punch me, sometimes repetitively. I thought it was normal. Though this hasn't changed much as today he smashed up our table because he was angry at my mum for not buying him an expensive drink. My sister has called the police on him twice this year but my parents defend him as they know he'll struggle in prison.

It hurts a lot to think about how much he must be hurting, his life sucks. He has no friends and none of my family likes him, including myself. If I'm honest, lately I've started to lose empathy for him. 

I'm 16 and there isn't much I can do. 

Idk why I'm writing this and if this is the right place to post this but it's hard keeping all these thoughts to myself.
