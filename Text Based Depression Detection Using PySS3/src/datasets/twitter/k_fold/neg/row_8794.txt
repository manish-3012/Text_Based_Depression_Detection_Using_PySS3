Iâ€™m thinking about sleeping for good againIâ€™m thinking about leaving everything behind even though I had plans for my future. In this moment, I donâ€™t care. Iâ€™ll write one last note and say goodbye to everyone.  

I know thereâ€™s people that wonâ€™t take it easy, and I know thereâ€™s people that will follow my same fate (Iâ€™m certain that one person will at least) but I hope theyâ€™ll reconsider and get the help they need.   

I hope my parents will know that they did absolutely nothing to help me. They attempted to isolate me from my friends and refused to let me get meds when I felt I needed them. They shamed me for my body and Iâ€™ll never forget it.  

I hope those bullies in the past know that they finally got what they wanted. They told me to go die and thatâ€™s exactly what youâ€™re getting now. Youâ€™re welcome.
