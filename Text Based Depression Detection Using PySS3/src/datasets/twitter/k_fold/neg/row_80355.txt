F. Advice pls ;)Im 24 years old.... I messed up my university degree, low grades  i don't even wanna finish it..... My family knows nothing about it they think i finish on next semester, told them a couple of lessons left.  
I have a good job right now, in my dad's company... I work with computers (my field) and i help with accounting when needed... so its good money + i get expierience + i help my dad

But i cant tell him i fucked up the university degree and 40.000 eu wasted. That's why i was / am suicidal ...  
I have a friend in Canada that he can hire me , so i really wanna move abroad and start a new life. I can also stay with him a couple of months with free or very cheap rent

But my family dont like the idea, they wanna finish studies first (which is logical) and also stay here and help them with company

My first option is: Sell some items (2 good computers), and with the help of my salary, i take a ticket and go to canada with some cash  
My second option: Eat a lot of broad beans, this will trigger my G6PD deficiency - Allergy , and considering that im living alone and they will not find me fast, i'll kaboot
