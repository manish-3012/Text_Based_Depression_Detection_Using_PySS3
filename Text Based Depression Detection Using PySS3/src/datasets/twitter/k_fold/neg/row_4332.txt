I have gone from fantasizing to planning. I want to check myself in somewhere but I am nervous.I have been having suicidal thoughts for the past few months. Last week was actually a pretty good week. But this week I have gone from fantasizing to planning. I have a lot of violent, intrusive thoughts (like shooting my face) but would prefer to die peacefully and I am thinking of where to get barbituates so I can take a bunch and never wake up. 

I do want help - I have been in counseling. I feel it is not working or not to the degree that I need. Also not sure if my meds were right (welbutrin). Thought my suicidal thoughts were from the meds but I have since taken myself off of them and still want to die. One small event will hurt me so much that my anxiety spirals out of control and I am left with nothing but chest-crushing sadness and I weep. 

I am tired of caring for everyone. Tired of never feeling sweet, fun, beautiful, smart, special, confident, capable. Hate myself. Tired of feeling like I am not enough. Tired of feeling like nothing. I am so embarassed to be having these thoughts as well. 

I want to check myself in somewhere but I am scared of the unknown. I do not want to go to the hospital. Crisis hotline told me to go to the crisis center in my city but I get the impression it has many homeless people and the care is not the best. I dont want my mom to worry. I also dont know how to tell my live-in boyfriend about it. He also has depression and anxiety. I know if I go he will take it personally and make it about him instead of offering support. 

I just don't know.
