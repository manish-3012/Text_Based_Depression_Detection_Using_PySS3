I donâ€™t wanna die but Iâ€™m so tiredItâ€™s hard to act like everythingâ€™s fine and be the always happy friend. My meds are messed up and so am I. Iâ€™ve written wills but I know I wonâ€™t go through with it because Iâ€™m too scared. I donâ€™t know what to do. I wanna reach out but my parents will be disappointed and worried about me especially when I tell them Iâ€™m ok and smile like everythingâ€™s alright. Iâ€™m just so tired.
