I feel exhausted and tired of everythingI am 20 years old. I have had suicidal thoughts since I was 10. Things have never gotten better. I have tried different therapists, different chemical cocktails, all the things my counselor has told me, got creative hobby, started volunteering and what not..Nothing has worked for my depression and mainly suicidal thoughts. I am just so tired of fighting it. The only reason I have never actually did it because I haven't found any good method. I think it will be worse to live after failed suicide attempt with possibility of being in wheelchair forever. I don't know why I feel like this.

I have parents who care about me, long term boyfriend and best friends. I have bright career ahead and everything in my life seems perfect but me. Nothing interests me anymore. I am just tired of life. I hate waking up everyday. I don't know why I am posting this. Perhaps there is still hope or I am just trying to distract myself. I wish there was a way to kill myself very soon
