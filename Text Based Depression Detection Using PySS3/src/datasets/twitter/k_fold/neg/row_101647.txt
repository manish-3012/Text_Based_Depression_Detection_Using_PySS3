Sick of being sick. This isnâ€™t living.
Iâ€™ve been sick for ten months. One day, I was fine, the next I woke up with insane dizzinessâ€”like being in an F16 doing barrel rolls that never stoppedâ€”and nausea that was off the charts. I was so dizzy I could barely move. I couldnâ€™t get up, walk around, bathe myself or even get to the bathroom. I had ammonia burns on my bottom for months due to lying in my own urine all day, too sick to move. I was so nauseous, I felt like vomiting every second of every day. It was so bad I couldnâ€™t sleep. I would be awake for days at a time until finally falling asleep from sheer exhaustion. I could barely eat. I could only barely manage to drink a sip of water or small bite of food every ten minutes. If I tried to eat any more or faster, I would dry heave. I was so dehydrated, I had to go to the ER 7 times. Each time, the ER doctors told me I just needed to eat. Once, They tried to force me to drink potassium, only for me to start dry heaving after less than ten sips of it. I ended up losing 34lbs in 3.5 months. I had shortness of breath, pain in my chest, blood pressure drop upon standing and numbness in my legs and hands. I tried over half a dozen medications. Nothing helped. It went on like this for six months until I spontaneously began to get better. My dizziness lessened to the point that I was able to take a shower again and get out of diapers. My nausea lessened to the point I was able to start regaining weight. Over the next four months, I *slowly* began to get better. My dizziness evolved and although it was still annoying, I could deal with it. My nausea dwindled to the point that I was only having small bursts of mild nausea a couple times a day. Again, annoying, but compared to what it had been before, I thought I was finally on the road to recovery. Until about five days ago. Suddenly, my nausea returned. Not 24/7 like it had been before, but enough to where I couldnâ€™t eat much without feeling sick and donâ€™t really want to eat anyway. Sometimes, I donâ€™t have any dizziness or nausea for several hours, then a sudden intense burst of nausea will crop up, usually accompanied by a tightening in my throat and tongue and sometimes just short of gagging. Other times, my dizziness will crop up. Sometimes itâ€™s both. Sometimes I canâ€™t even drink water because I feel too sick. Sometimes even thinking about food makes me ill. My doctors have not been able to figure out the problem. And none of them seem to be in an all-fired hurry to help me figure it out either. Ive has to beg for help after basically being left to die, to starve to death. Ive been waiting seven months to see a doctor who *may* be able to help and still have another two months to go until that appointment. By that time, I will have been sick for a year. Iâ€™m so freaking tired of feeling sick. Iâ€™m so tired of doctors blaming it all on â€œanxietyâ€. This isnâ€™t living. This is existing and Iâ€™m miserable. Iâ€™ve hardly been sick a day in my life and BAM, my world is turned upside down overnight and no one can or will help. Often, I feel to nauseous to cry. I just want to freaking die.
