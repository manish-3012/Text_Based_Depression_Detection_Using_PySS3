please someone help meall i want to do is scream, "please someone help me. I'm in so much pain. I can't carry on." no one understands what's going on in my head and how much i'm in pain. I just want all of this to stop. They say the only person that can help me is myself but I can't help myself right now because I'm in so much damn pain. That's the whole point. I've been trying for so long to stop the thoughts but they keep coming back. I don't know why im still here when im this miserable. just need this to end now.
