Totally lost it. Need some options.Guys. I love you. You've been there thanks for the company.

Serious PTSD event going on. I need help. Like serious help.

Where can I get help that doesn't involve medication? Like...treatment options without pills...I can't have pills...I can't take medication. Absolutely no meds whatsoever no negotiations.

If I don't figure it out I'm going to probably take myself out here. I just want this to stop right now. Panic attack, just total loss of control of everything....I'm reliving every second of a fucking shitty abusive ex with this breakup thats going to happen it's not her fault either the current one. 

I hope I can talk to you guys and get through this one but I may not make it through the night.

I love you guys more than anything. You guys have truly been the most loving sweet people in my life. I wouldn't have made it this far without you guys...Kashi, Seardz, Riley, the copilot random username I love you guys more than anyhting.

I'm seriously going to try my absolute best, but no promises I just want to stay strong for you guys I want there to be hope for everyone here but I can't stop it.
