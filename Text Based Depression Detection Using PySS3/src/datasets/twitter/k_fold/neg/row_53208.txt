I want the thoughts to stopThe anxiety and suicidal thoughts won't stop. I play scenarios in my head, and I can't stop them, but I don't like pain. I wish it were quick and painless. Previous attempts were very painful during and afterwards. So I'm here. I just want the thoughts to stop. If I'm meant to stay for now, I just want the thoughts to end. I supposedly live a nice life, but I feel so empty, alone, and I want to die.
