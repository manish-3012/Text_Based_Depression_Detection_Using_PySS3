Feel like I'm in a nursing home, no point in spending the rest of my life like thisAll I can do is eat fast food and masturbate. The obnoxious advice like "exercise and meet people and do things you've never done before", well, all that stuff is inspirational but it makes me feel terrible and it never sticks. I'm tired ot sitting for ours refreshing the same web sites.

I can't read. I try all the time. I can't do it. I can't talk to people, I drool and mumble and forget words. I can't do anything without hours or days or weeks or preparation. I feel like I'm driving a naval carrier. Every little turn is exhausting.

Therapy is bullshit, I whine at him about all these life-changing things that I do, but nothing sticks or amounts to anything better. Life is still awful. I have a mild social life (over 10 parties in the last two years) but the social process is so traumatic that I'm overcome with suicidal urges for hours before and after. They ask, "what do you do", "what have you accomplished." Shit. I can't do it any more. I can't be a forever alone in my mid-30s with no money and no life. No one can help me. There's just nothing good for most people. It's the truth. I look at all these other people, they hate their jobs, they hate the people they know, they hate their lives, but they've just been trained into tolerating it. Then a few alphas watch over it all and collect their wonderful winnings while everyone else cringes in silence. It's no way to live. No friends, no hobbies, no enjoyment, just sitting in a bed sucking nutrients through a tube. Yeah, I'll "get along fine". It's nothing. I'm done. No more trauma, no more disorders and excuses and lying and fucking humiliation, I'm done.
