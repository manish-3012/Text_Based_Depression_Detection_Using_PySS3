regreti regret failing i regret not trying hard enough and i wish i was still apathetic enough to try again without worrying about how itll hurt others but it feels like my only purpose is to die 4 years ago was my best chance but my therapist could tell what i was planning to do and i couldnt live with giving her that guilt i feel like a burden to myself everyday because i wont give up when thats all i want and care about the thought of suicide is constantly on my mind i daydream about it its so out of reach i feel pathetic
