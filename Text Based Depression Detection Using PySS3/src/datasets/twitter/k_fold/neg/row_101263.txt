ive never felt like ive belonged and it's pushing me off the edgei'm a chinese adoptee. grew up in a white family. didn't fit in with them. went to public school for high school. finally get to be around asian people. didn't fit in with them, too whitewashed, too awkward and immature. i go to college. start dating a guy first semester. i feel like i belong for the first time. bad idea. he cheats on me with a 13 year old girl. we don't date anymore and i have a restraining order. i make several suicide attempts for months and quit school for a semester. i move forward as best as i can. still no friends i feel like i can rely on. he starts dating his coworker (i knew it would happen before we broke up). i don't have problems with her. i'm not jealous of the relationship. i'm jealous of the support. people know what he did to me. but because i'm crazy since i'm suicidal and have bipolar disorder i don't think anyone wants to hear it. even if i hide the really bad stuff. even as a pedophile he finds belonging. but me? no one noticed i was gone. i wonder if they'll notice if i really leave one day. why am i so unworthy of belonging? i try to be normal and i never make any offensive jokes, and i don't speak too much and i'm not shy. i leave space and i act myself. but. its. not. enough.
