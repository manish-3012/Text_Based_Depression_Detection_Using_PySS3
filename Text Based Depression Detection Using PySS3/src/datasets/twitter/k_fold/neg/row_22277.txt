Toothpicks?So if there is one thing I can't do its lie to doctors, so when my family basically push me through the door of a doctors office it all came tumbling out about how I just feel the world would be better without me, the lives of the people I'm around would be better. Which leaves the doctor contacting my family saying I'm not allowed to have things around me just in case, or that if I did I needed supervision with. Most of it it pretty predictable. You know knifes, rope, razor blades etc... until they say toothpicks. I mean I'm flattered they think I might be creative enough to kill myself with a toothpick but honestly this feels excessive. Forcing me to be bubble wrapped rather than getting help is making me feel worse for the pressure it puts on my family and when I do it, it's gonna push the guilt on to them for not being able to keep things away from me which just isn't fair on them at all.
