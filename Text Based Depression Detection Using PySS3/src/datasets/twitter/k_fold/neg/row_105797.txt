i donâ€™t know how to reach outi want to die, i want everything to end. but i also want to talk to my friends. theyâ€™re the only thing that makes things worth it, but lately all they know is that iâ€™m miserable all the time and probably a bad friend. i try to help them bc theyâ€™re all going through their own stuff, but i also want to tell them how i am and how i feel bc it feels like theyâ€™re my last hope. but i donâ€™t know how or want to burden them
