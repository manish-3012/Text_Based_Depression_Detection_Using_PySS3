Feeling pretty empty insideAs of late, Iâ€™ve been feeling like I have a void in my chest. Things only make me temporarily happy and it really bums me out. My girlfriend and I fight a lot, I annoy and bug my friends too much. Random anger also gets to me sometimes and I donâ€™t know what to do. I sleep a lot and still feel exhausted after a few hours of being awake.

This isnâ€™t the first time Iâ€™ve contemplated suicide either. I donâ€™t know..I know Iâ€™m just complaining on this post...but I just feel so helpless.

Edit: Not physical fights, just arguments.
