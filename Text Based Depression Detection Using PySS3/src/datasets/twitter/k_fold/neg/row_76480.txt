Nothing is working and i'm sliding back down.The more I think about things the more depressed I get and the more I consider suicide - or at least disappearing and living totally off grid - a viable option. The future is uncertain, bleak and terrifying and I can't see a way out. 

I'd give anything not to feel like this.
