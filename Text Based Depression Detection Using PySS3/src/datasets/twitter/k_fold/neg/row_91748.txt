There is only one way out nowI always thought life would be so easy. But now it just seems so impossible to live and be happy at the same time. Hell, I rarely ever feel happiness anymore. Usually all I feel are empty sadness and fear. Fear that I'll somehow piss off my girlfriend by simply breathing. Then she'll bitch at me and put me down. She'll yell and call me an idiot and make me feel insignificant and stupid. This isn't the life I wanted. I didn't want any of this. I would much rather just feel nothing at all. At this point, I don't even care about the pain. I just want it all to end...
