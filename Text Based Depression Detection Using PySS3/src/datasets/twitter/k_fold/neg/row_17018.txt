Why are we here? Why are we alive?Let me start off by saying that I am not religious. I don't believe in a Heaven or Hell. I've been religious for almost two decades, but nothing anyone could say would make me go back. Now then..

There must be a reason why we're here. We live life, and upon our death, we may/may not get all the answers that we sought during our time. But at least in death, we have peace.

I was always a well-adjusted kid. I have loving parents and friends who care. Until recently I had absolutely no idea what it meant to be depressed. But I've jumped so far past that line that I just want it to end. I have no energy to work, to talk, or to even sit up straight. I wish I could curl up into a ball and sleep on my bed and never wake up.

I guess this is all just a ramble. Transcribing my thoughts does not make me feel better, but this is all I have the energy to do. I'm going to take a sick day from work today.
