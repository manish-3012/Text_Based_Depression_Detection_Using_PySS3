Literally can't think of a reason why I should keep livingI've spent some time here over the past few days. It's been nice relating to people. But I catch myself agreeing with the OP posts so much that I can't even give advice. I'm looking for the same answers as they are. 

As the title says. I try to justify to myself why suicide doesn't have to be the answer but I'm at a point where I can't think of anything worth living for. I actively try to make things worse for myself now, which doesn't help. It's just all pointless haha. The longer time goes on, the more the idea of suicide feels good. By now I don't look forward to anything other than dying.

Don't bother with "the people you know love you and will miss you, that's a good enough reason" or something like *you* would miss me. You don't know me. I'm just one of many people on this forum with unfortunate circumstances. I'm no different, or special.
