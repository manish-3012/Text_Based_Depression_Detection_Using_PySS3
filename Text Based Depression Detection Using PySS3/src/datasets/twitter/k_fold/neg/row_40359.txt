Can't self harm anymore, might actually do itI always cut myself when I wanted to kill myself but I got caught yesterday and had my blades taken away. Went to counselling and tried all the healthy coping mechanisms. I can't miss any more classes without being with drawn. Would rather die than go to class feeling like this. Everyone is asleep. Can't get help.
