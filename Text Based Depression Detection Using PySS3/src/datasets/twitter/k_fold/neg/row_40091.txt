I'm sick and tired of trying to turn my luck around, and I'm ready to die.Over the past year, I've had a terrible string of bad luck.  Here's what's happened in that time:

-My parents had an ugly divorce.

-Both my grandparents passed away.

-My wife and I have been in two bad car accidents. My wife was seriously injured in one, our car was totaled in the other.

-My wife lost her job.

-I was demoted at my job.

-Our house was broken into and over $10K of things were stolen.

I could actually continue to add to this list, but it's depressing to even think about it really.  I've stopped being shocked anything something terrible happens.  

I've tried so hard to do everything that I can to turn things around.  I've applied to hundreds of jobs, have tried starting two small businesses, have reached out to professional help, have gone on vacations to try to make myself feel better, and so on.  Nothing helps.  No matter what I do to try to dig myself out of this hole, things continue to get worse.

So that's it, I've given up.  I find myself unable to focus on anything and I am completely unable to get anything accomplished.  I just sit and stare at my computer all day at work, then drive home and just lie on the couch the rest of the time.  I just have nothing in me anymore and I don't care about anything.  I'm numb to everything.

Instead of attempting to suffer more failure and more horrific things happening to me, I'm ready to just move on.  Life has nothing to offer me anymore other than disappointment.  At first, I was wishing that I would get terminal cancer or some terrible disease so I could at least get my affairs in order and everything.  But now, I'm so sick of dealing with life that I'm starting to have serious thoughts about how to do it.  My wife is as equally depressed and despondent as I am, and we've even had somewhat serious discussions about blowing what's left of our savings and then both just checking out once that's gone.  Life just has nothing to offer either of us anymore.  We're completely unable to better ourselves, cannot keep any friends, and both just feel completely lost in this world.

I think it's already inevitable that I'm going to take my own life sooner or later, it's just a matter of when, how, and what I want to do prior to doing it.  I don't even think I'm here looking for help and advice.  I've long given up on trying to accomplish anything or trying to fix my situation in life.  I just wanted to get it all out and maybe have a conversation about it with someone else.
