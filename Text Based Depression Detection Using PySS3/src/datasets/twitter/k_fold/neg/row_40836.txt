Itâ€™s only getting harderIâ€™ve had a hard time for as long as I can remember, struggling with school for years and now work, dealing with my parents who say my mental illness is my fault, and Iâ€™ve always been able to keep going. Iâ€™ve been able to pride myself on my resilience forever, but now Iâ€™m feeling myself break down. I donâ€™t have motivation, nor a group of friends or a family who want to help me. Iâ€™m feeling really alone and have been getting back into weed because I canâ€™t sit in this hopeless for longer than a day now. Iâ€™ve been crying 2-3 times daily, which is collectively more than I have this entire year. I just donâ€™t know where to go from here. Every time I think Iâ€™ve hit rock bottom, it just gets worse. I donâ€™t know how to keep going when Iâ€™m never okay. I canâ€™t survive like this for much longer.
