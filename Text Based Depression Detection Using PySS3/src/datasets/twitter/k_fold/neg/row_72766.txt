I think I'm failing college and I'm lost, lost in life.What it says in the title. The thing is, I'm getting there. slowly. Very, very slowly, but I can feel myself getting there. I don't sleep 14 hours a day. I've fixed my sleeping schedule. I'm eating regular meals and pushing myself to get things done, which is a lot better than I was even a few months ago, and it's taken all my energy to even get up to this level. But everyone around me is screaming to pick up the pace if I want to keep my head above the water, or I'm going to end up belly-up.

I'm at a fairly good uni, my parents broke their backs getting me here and me dropping out would quite possibly literally kill them, so it's not an option. The workload is pretty hard, though, and I'm having lots of trouble keeping up because of my mental illnesses (I have clinical depression, anxiety disorders and undiagnosed ADD), but I HAVE to keep up or else I"ll kill myself. More than anything else, I'm terrified of making a fool of myself, but I already have, many times. I thought that would be motivation enough, at first, to keep me going and not slip under, but I've slipped under much faster than I would have liked and I feel like I'm drowning. What's more, I feel hollow inside and I don't know what I want to do after uni anyway. I want to die. I have no hobbies except going on the internet all day, every day. I'm a disgusting bum and I know it but I can find no escape other than just dying.

edit: just wanted to add more points. i feel like my whole life has been led by my parents so far. do you think that if i kill myself tonight, they might recognize that something went wrong with me? not trying to be vengeful. i just want to break this cycle.
