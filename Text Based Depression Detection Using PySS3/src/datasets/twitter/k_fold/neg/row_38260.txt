So, what do I do?Teenager who feels like he can't go on another day because the future is hopeless and the present is too painful, feels like a bitch because of how he feels, wants to die but can't bring himself to take those pills. Tried to call the hotline and got nothing. Family will be home in two hours and I'm scared they'll just ignore what I say and exacerbate things. Just saw another post where a guy mocked a poster for grammar on this subreddit, so fairly certain this won't help, but hey, anonymous desperation here, why not give this sub a try before I either work up the courage or go catatonic and get slapped!
