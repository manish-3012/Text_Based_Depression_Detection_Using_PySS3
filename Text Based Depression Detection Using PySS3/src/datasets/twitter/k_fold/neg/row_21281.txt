I just want to quit.Iâ€™m so tired. I feel so fucking bad because everyone in here has actually problems. I just have my stupid petty child problem. Iâ€™m too young. I feel like I was born to die. I just want to give up, but canâ€™t because my family would be devastated. I know that they care SO much about me, but I just want to die. I donâ€™t want to disappoint them. If I kill my self, my mom will probably hate my selfish ass. I just canâ€™t fucking live. My problems donâ€™t even matter, Iâ€™m never good at anything I do, and I hate everything. Sorry for rant. Hope you guys are doing better than me.
