i just want it to endits completely impossible to get on hormone therapy in austria , it causes me dysphoria which then causes me to miss school because i am depressed,  my depression causes me to lose interest in most of the things i enjoyed in the past , not enjoying anything anyway makes me not want to go to a school or job since i will just waste time somewhere and not even have something to look forward to after i am done 

however if i just die all of my problems are gone , no gender issues when you are dead , no problems with missing hair from chemo therapy when you are dead , literally every problem i have would be solved that way , and theres not really many people who would miss me , my grand aunt starts having dementia anyway , my mother doesnt care about me , she literally is the type that sees cutting scars , just puts a bandage on it and goes away without even bothering to think why the person might be self harming , she wouldnt miss me one single minute , neither will my family 

i dont necesarily want to kill myself , dying through a normal death (like a desease)  would be fine too
