The miserable life of a 16-year old.Life's never been easy on me. I was bullied through the entire elementary school, and I'm still being bullied in high school, at age 16. My family's never cared about me.

I had a girlfriend about 2 years ago, but after a year I screwed up and she broke up just a week before our anniversary. 2 days later, she was with another guy. 

I've never been a good student, barely passing every year, and so disappointing everyone: teachers, family, friends... I tried helping other people out, just to feel better about myself, and this worked, for a couple of minutes, only to feel suicidal again.

 I just have 2 friends, who don't care about me and my feelings. Every time I want to  talk to them about my feelings, they just dismiss them as typical teenage problems. I feel they are worse than just typical teenage problems.

Every day, every minute, I feel that I'm drowning in the endless pool of misery. I can't stop thinking about killing myself. It would be so good to be finally relieved of being the idioditic, worthless creature I am.
