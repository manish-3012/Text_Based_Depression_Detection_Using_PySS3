Woo, dying sure does sound funSo a couple months ago, my first ever girlfriend broke up with me, I am thought to suffer from mild autism and a lot of autistic people are either fully or partially asexual and I happen to be partially. Anyway I got with the only girl ive ever liked and like someone who is with their first gf I went and put all my happiness into her. And then out of nowhere she said that she was having problems with her sexuality and thought she might be lesbian so we both made an agreement that she could go and explore and see what she likes and apparently from what I heard she was actually confused at first then out of nowhere just started dating another dude, didnâ€™t date or talk to a girl at all, just waited about a month and then dipped on what she thought she was and left me for another dude with my name. And some people might be thinking that she mightâ€™ve just been scared to be rejected by me and thatâ€™s why she started dating someone else, but no I said many times i support her and if she decides itâ€™s not the way she thought it would be I would happily accept her. I will also admit that a lot of people like me are selfish when it comes to relationships, and Iâ€™ve very selfish about it so I wanted to have her all to myself while trying to not put pressure on her about it, but now knowing sheâ€™s out here with some other dude doing whatever makes irritated, and I donâ€™t want to be like that and I donâ€™t condone that at all itâ€™s just my mindset a long with the asexuality. Almost a month ago she also got frustrated with me and said that sometimes I really annoy her, and my dumb autistic ass took that as she fucking hates me and so does everyone else and I have managed to completely convince myself that, something I still believe especially with what I just found out, so now at this point idk what Iâ€™m going to do, she doesnâ€™t know I found out so sheâ€™s dating this other dude so if I did kill myself she wouldnâ€™t suspect herself. But at this same time Iâ€™m really scared of death. Itâ€™s just so confusing
