Raped when i was 5so here is my emotional venting story. 50-50 that im gonna hang myself tonight but w/e just wanted to tell it to someone/anyone. so when i was 5, me and my brothers were good friends with out neighbor, a (then) 13 year old black guy from sri lanka who was adopted and was here since he was 2. All was well until my parents announced that we would move. He started doing weird shit when we were playing hide and seek, like touching my lower back etc etc. fast forward 3 weeks. One day playing hide and seek, we went in the garage where it was pitch dark, he asked me to do a favour and that i couldn't tell anyone. I agreed, he asked me to (leaving grapic material out but i got raped and didn't tell anyone). This continued for 2 months multiple times a week until we moved. I was always too scared to tell anyone. so now I am 19, i'm a racist piece of trash, filled with hate towards blacks, especially this guy. Tonight I am flipping a coin on whether to kill myself, or go on a hunt. 

I feel like i'm a loose projectile, ready to hit anyone or anything that comes in a way, i have no reason to live anymore. i've failed in school, become an alcoholic and a chain smoker, sitting in my room doing absolutely nothing all day except going to school to fail some more.  I cant deal with the pain anymore so i've got to release it, whether in doing something bad or killing myself. i see no other option.  


Anyway, thank you for reading, i hope you will have a great life.
