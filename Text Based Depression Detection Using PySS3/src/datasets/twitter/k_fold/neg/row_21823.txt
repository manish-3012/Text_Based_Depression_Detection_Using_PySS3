Looking for anything at this point.Hi all,

I know you guys donâ€™t feel like reading a book so Iâ€™ll try to keep it short and sweet. Iâ€™ve had awful anxiety and depression since I was a teen. Iâ€™ve tried so hard over the last decade to dig myself out of this hole. Iâ€™ve learned to socialize, made lots of friends and am working on graduating college this year. Despite all my best endeavors, none of this has ever brought me any fulfillment in my life and despite having great friends (who I know love me) I still always feel like an outcast. 2 years ago I had one brief glimmer of hope when I fell in love. I spent the only truly happy year of my life with her until my self-destructive behavior pushed her away. Fast forward to now, I havenâ€™t seen her, yet alone spoke to her in months and although I try to wake up every day and move on with my life I can feel my grip loosening. Now here I am 21 and questioning why I even want to live anymore if nothing makes me happy. Itâ€™s as if the pain Iâ€™ve felt since I was a child was amplified 10x because I was shown a glimmer of hope and now I have to live with the fact that I ruined it. 

If anyone has advice Iâ€™m open to hear it. I doubt it will help much though, itâ€™s always the same cycle of misery.

If I do end up leaving this world at least Iâ€™ll die knowing I really did try to get better. Iâ€™m just running out of strength.
