If you only had a couple of days left and knew it?Definitely not a cry for help, I'm not depressed, I've just got myself in a shit situation through my own poor decisions and now I'm stuck with literally no other option.
I won't go into detail but sufficed to say it involves the Police. Nobody else really knows anything about it, those who do know something don't know any details as I've kept it vague. Also means I literally can't talk to another human being about my situation, not even professional help. It's nothing horrific, but it's bad enough. 

So I've ended up in this surreal life now for a while now where I've had this axe swinging over my head so my job and every human interaction feels fruitless because I know it'll end. 
I got the call last week which confirmed my fears that the axe was going to drop, so here we are. 

What else is there to do? I've looked at so many years different methods, read up, got that online guide. Even had a failed Helium Bag attempt sometime ago. Woke up to see my cat staring at me like I was an idiot.

But it's weird when you've planned it out in advance, should I just spend all my money...? Go out with a bang? How do you do it? When?

You start eyeing up opportunity everywhere you walk "I could jump off there, looks high enough" etc.

My life had become a horror version of Requiem for a Dream. Nobody knows my situation. If you read this then you know more than any other human (other than the others who might have read). 
Pretty amazing power of the internet right?

Want to know the saddest part? With the knowledge of my upcoming demise, you'd think I'd be doing amazing things with the time I have left. But no, I'm literally wasting time doing dumbshit I normally would, eating crappy food etc etc. Oh well.

I'm still hoping for a miracle. It could happen. It's happened before.
