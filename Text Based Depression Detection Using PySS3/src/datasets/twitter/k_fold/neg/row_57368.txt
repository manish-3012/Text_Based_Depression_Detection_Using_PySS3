What's the point anymore if no one cares?I've tried to be nice to everyone, only for them to break me. No on cares. My only best friend who actually cared needed to take two weeks off from my friendship because I was overreacting to everything. This has been the nail in the coffin. She isn't there for me, no one has been. No one cares. I've had terrible Kidney issues as well which plague my life. I want to crash my car, as I have thought many times. Maybe if I hurt myself, people will actually care and realize that all I wanted from anyone is love. I cry every hour, just please help before I do something terrible to myself.
