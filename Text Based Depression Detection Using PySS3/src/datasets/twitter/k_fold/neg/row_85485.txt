I can't live with myselfI don't think of myself as depressed. Sure, I'm not happy persay but I'm not necessarily depressed either. My problem is I can't stand myself. I hate myself. I have friends and family who love me, I have a good job, I have incredible dogs, I am healthy and in shape, I am objectively attractive but I hate myself.

I wish I could just fall asleep and never wake up. I just want to dissappear. To stop struggling with myself. To stop fighting myself. To not have to constantly deal with my issues with trust and with people.

Last night I poked 4 holes into the artery of my left wrist. I wanted to see how easy it was to actually hit the blood flow. To see if cutting is a viable suicide option if I ever decide that living for my mother is something I cannot do anymore.

It is times like this when I am convinced that no one could ever love me again after seeing this side of me. I have to keep the mask on. The real me. The me that I hate, is completely unlovable.
