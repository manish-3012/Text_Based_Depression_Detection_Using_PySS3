At what point is it time to just give up?I am 31 years old. I have never had a real relationship.  I am objectively pretty but just no one likes me enough to actually date me. my job sucks I just found out the new 19 year old at my office makes 4,000 dollars a year more than I do. A salary I never will get despite having more experience and qualifications.  and nothing good has ever happened to me in my life. I have 1 good friend maybe 2 but the 2nd one doesn't like me and just insults me the whole time. I have siblings who cant be bothered to ever spend time with me or call me, same with my parents. Well my mom will but she will just tell me how shitty of a person I am. I think she would like it if I killed myself deep down it would get her the attention she loves. I ask my sister today name one good thing that has happened to me. She cant she just deflects the question. I am 31 years old and the only joy I gain out of my life is fantasizing about having another life. I wish I would have killed myself in the Navy because that way my parents would have probably got some money and I would have avoided the past 10 years of my life that has been nothing but shit. And what in the future do I have to look forward to? I will take home less money every year because of taxes. I will never make enough money to retire I dont even make enough to go on vacation. Even if I could go to Disney which is the only place I want to go. I have no one to go with. so why am I still alive? I have nothing to look forward to but more debt and more work. The second my cat dies I will kill myself. Or maybe ill just wait until Supernatural ends next year.
