I just attempted and he doesnâ€™t careI told my boyfriend I was going to hang myself, he said he couldnâ€™t live with it I said I donâ€™t think anyone can stop me, I said goodbye and he said goodbye, didnâ€™t try to stop me at all I guess part of me was hoping heâ€™d convince me to stop, I cried then went over to the noose tried to hang myself but couldnâ€™t do it, almost had a panic attack. Nobody ever cares, or ever will. I knew the relationship was to good to be true.
