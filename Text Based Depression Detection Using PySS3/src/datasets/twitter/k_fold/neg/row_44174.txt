Does everyone dislike me?I can't help but to feel that everyone dislikes me. I get this sense of people thinking I am annoying or just a bother. I usually get sad or depressed a lot, so it'll start to show and then I feel this way. I am starting to lose my reasons for why I choose to stay alive. I don't know what to do and I am just scared for the future. I don't want to end up alone.
