I simply just want to end it. (sickness, emotional instability, no hope.) I've had a hard time from years now and I just don't feel any happiness or meaning to this life. I have been diagnosed a few days ago with an infection that is spreading through my body and I swear to god, every fucking organ hurts like hell. 
 My family doesn't know what to do anymore and I can't do shit, since I can't get out of the bed. 
 I had a fight with my significant  other over the phone last night, since he drank a lot and decided to make me feel more miserable than I am. He doesn't talk to me anymore and I'm also scared I might be pregnant, I don't know for sure, this would be the last straw for me. 
 I was on medication a few months back, I stopped taking in august last year. I took some a moth ago for two weeks since I was having a really hard time. Meds, I mean antidepressives and some other that stop psychosis and activate the serotonin. 
 I can'te eat, I can't move, it'a even hard to keep my eyes open, I honestly feel like I'm dying in a really painful and slow manner.
 I'm really grateful that I have my parents and they are trying to support me in anyway but I don't know if I can do anything, anymore. 
 I honestly don't know what to do... I'm scared, I'm sad, depressed, angry, in pain and I feel like I have no hope, at all.
