I'm so tired of all thisI've recently changed schools and I'm been doing it online for a few months now. Already, I'm talking to a counsellor and as usual, they don't help. I have 11 chemistry assignments due by Monday, a bunch for algebra, and much more. I don't understand most of what's happening in the classes.

I'm just so fucking tired of this shit, is it even worth it to continue? I just asked my mom if she'll miss me if I die, she asked if I was stupid, and then I proceeded with saying I don't think living is worth it, and then dropped it.

I'm been cutting myself a lot more nowadays, I think about jumping off my building everyday.

Even if it does get better, what's the point? I'll just spend the rest of my days working and I know I'll hate it. I don't even know what I want to do.

I'm just tired, I drank some alcohol to see if that'll help and no, it didn't.

I have no motivation at all to do anything.
