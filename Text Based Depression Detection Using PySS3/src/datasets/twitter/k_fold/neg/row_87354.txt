not a single person gave a fuck my brother posted hereall you fucking assholes that love to post here, didn't give a single fuck about my brother who died a month ago. He fucking posted here, he didn't ask for any help but fuck you all. When evryone else posts, "hey op PM me" "hey OP we can go hangout if you want" fuck all of you. All of you always get care, he never did. I don't either. My parents are abusive and that's part of the reason he killed himself. I tried my fucking best to get him out of his stupid pointless fucking depression, and he posts the sweetest fucking note and nothing. All he wanted to fucking do was help shithead people, going out his way constantly. No one ever fucking thanked him. I tried so hard. He was always alone and I tried t be there as much as possible but I couldn't. Not even you Reddit assholes even thought of posting a nice thing on his post. Everyone else who posts gets 500 comments, so many shitheads caring for the OP. My brother, nothing. 
Get this post taken down so you fuckers don't have to read up on your guilt. Delete the fucking post i know it will be gone in minutes after i post this
Fuck you. Fuck every single one of you. The worst people get the most care. Fuck you.
