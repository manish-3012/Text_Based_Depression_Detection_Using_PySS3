Fuck me ...I have only a few weeks until I am homeless. I have no family. I have no friends. I have no options ... I am currently disabled from PTSD, GAD, OCD, Depression and a physically issue which is causing motor/nerve issue which dr's cannot figure out.

I only have a few weeks maybe 1-2 months before I live in the streets. I have no family left. I haven't had a friend in over a decade. I have tried support via the healthcare system. There is almost nothing I can take advantage of. I have basically been told I need to pull my shit together and do it myself.

I called a suicide hotline ... I was about to do it... they told me to fucking do it. Told me stop being a bitch. I have a massive gash down my arm. It seems to be ok right now but maybe will get infect.
