I completely hate myself for becoming suicidal againJust by having these suicidal thoughts I'm completely betraying myself and others, betraying my own identity and the trust people have put in me. There's no fucking excuse for it. I assured everyone that I would never get like this again, I even told myself that. So many people would be completely disappointed it me if I told them I was experiencing this shit again. I used to love life, now I want to end it. 
 
I've dealt with suicidal ideation before, and I was committed a psych ward because of it. But that was something I got over years ago, and it was mostly just depression fueled delusions, such as me being a burden or people being better off without me.  
 
What's awful is that I can recognize all this bullshit, while still falling victim to it. I can notice the serious warning signs in myself, I can recognize the awful thoughts that are perpetuating this, and I realize how much my death would hurt others. I don't have to tell myself that people would be better off without me, I don't have to fool myself into thinking that there is no possibility for things to get better. 
 
But I still want to kill myself, I can't stop thinking and fantasizing about it. I want to die, to a degree I've never experienced before.  
 
I'm supposed to be better than this. I've been through therapy that gave me the tools I would need to control and manage this shit. But I'm either too incompetent to use those skills or too lazy. 
 
It's fucking pathetic that I've let myself get to this point again. I thought I was better than this, but I was wrong. Just the fact that I'm seriously considering suicide is awful, and it shows how shit of a person I really am, for being willing to hurt so many people by killing myself. It's completely unacceptable, and I hate myself for this, but that hate doesn't stop it.
