I sabotaged myself academically and now I want to dieMy school work is FAR from my biggest problem right now. But it is a very immediate one because I haven't slept all night and I have class in 2 hours. I'm failing all of my classes. It's my senior year. I am weeks behind in every single one of my classes, and haven't done multiple projects and tests. I tried catching up but looking at how fucked I am, it's making me feel so discouraged and I want to give up again. The truth is I have loathed myself for years now and I feel like I've died on the inside. I used to do well in school, but now I've fell so behind partially due to numbness and partially because I just don't feel like I deserve to do well. So, I sabotaged myself. Now, I am slowly realizing if I don't graduate, I am even more fucked and it would mean I've wasted years of my mom's life, buying me school supplies and driving me to school. 

I honestly want to kill myself. I tried one or two summers ago but got scared last minute and I haven't told anyone. I am a burden in so many ways, but this is really the cherry on top. I have wanted to die since I was 12. I can't explain any of this to my teachers because then they will get my family involved and that'll be a whole fucking shit show. Another problem is I no longer can even focus on, or understand, my school work. I swear to god my brain has shrunken or something because nothing sticks anymore. It's like all I am good for is spending hours doing nothing but worrying and finding reasons to hate myself. 

I literally know the only way out of this is dying. It's all my fault. I don't know what to do. I just want to get back to my regular suffering without this on top of it at this point.
