Feel like my girlfriend is slipping over the edge, the fuck do I do?We are in a long-distance relationship.

She has been depressed for sometime but tonight was openly talking about committing suicide, 'as soon as she pushes away the people who care about her', like me. She is on anti-depressants but they don't seem to be helping.

The worst part is, I don't even know if I want to deal with this anymore. It is nearly impossible to have a fulfilling relationship with someone this depressed. Am I a bad person for thinking this? I can't hold her back all on my own.
