Please helpHello. I'm always a happy person, I try to get the best out of the worst situation. My family is quite wealthy and I have many great friends. But , the sad truth is im very depressed , till the point I just want to take a knife out and end it now.
Why? You ask. 
Recently, my stuff got stolen and I explained it to my parents. They didn't comfort me or ask if I was okay. They actually scolded me badly and said I was too stupid to think or what not. They constantly scold me but they always fail to see the greatness I've done to them, I buy them clothes, I help in house work and I even study really hard just to please them, but they always fail to see it.
I pray hard always to God to help me, guide me, all I get is nothing only more sadness... The girl I like not only doesn't care about me, I'm sure she hates me too inside no matter how kind I try to be. 
The only thing that's stopping me from killing myself is im afraid that I'll go to hell because that's why my religion teaches me. But the prayers that get ignored day by day makes me not believe more and more. Please help..
