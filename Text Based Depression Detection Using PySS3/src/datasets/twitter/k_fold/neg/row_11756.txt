So I submitted a post last night...And it helped. It really did. But I still feel like shit. I gathered all my pills up, and they're right next to me. I don't know what to do. I just want to be normal. And I know, "nobody is normal", but I just want to be functional like everyone else. No one feels the need to reach out to me. My parents are ungrateful, my friends never text or call me, and they only talk to me when it's convenient. I don't know why people don't like me. I'm not a dick. At least not a huge one. I know I'm a little weird. I just want people to talk to in real life. I haven't a good friend ever in my entire life. Other people that had similar problems, how do I become more likeable? I'm sick and tired of having mediocre friends. I would give anything to have a best friend. At night, I tell my parents I'm going out with my friends, but I really just drive around eating fast food, or skateboarding if the skatepark is empty. Please help. I'm not so far gone that I completely want to die, just part of me does. At this point I feel like nothing is keeping me from ODing on my meds. I don't think it would hurt. But I don't know. I'd rather be wanted than dead I guess. I even hate myself for doing this. I don't want to be an attention seeker. I don't know. I'm lost.
