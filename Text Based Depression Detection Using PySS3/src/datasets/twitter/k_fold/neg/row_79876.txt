Kind of my first attemptI had made a make shift hook and attached it to a belt. I put the belt around my neck and the hook onto the back of a chair and sat on the floor. My intention behind this was to test it. And it worked. And I let it. I think I lost consciousness, but the hook had failed and I woke up feeling disappointed. It's kinda scary how quickly testing it went to an attempt.
