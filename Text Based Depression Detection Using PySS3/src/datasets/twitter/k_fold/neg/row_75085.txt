Selfish?Hi. So ima case of....ive accepted I will, and geting there soon. I feel its the first time in my life I will be selfless. Any one feel like that? I have done so much shit to family, sometimes I feel sociopathic.  Anyone I have met I vampire them just to get what I want, fam included. When I do this I really feel like it will be my only selfless act ive ever done. I guess I want feedback from others who feel that.
