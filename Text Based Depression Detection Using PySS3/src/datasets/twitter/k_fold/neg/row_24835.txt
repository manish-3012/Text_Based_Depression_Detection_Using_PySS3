A few questions from non-suicidal personHey guys, I been reading some of these posts and itâ€™s making me sad that there are so many unhappy people.  Itâ€™s not my place to say anyone is right or wrong, I believe in free will whether itâ€™s a popular or unpopular decision.  However, I can help but wondering how life can truly be that bad forever? 

When I think about dying I think about how Iâ€™ll miss the small things that bring me joy like the warm sun on my skin on a nice spring day, the feeling of sand and water on your bare feet on the beach, watching the sun come up and hearing the birds start their busy day, or watching the night sky and thinking how amazing it is that we are on a rock flying through space.  Everyone must still find joy or happiness in some aspect of their life?  If not, everyoneâ€™s situation can be changed.  

Main question - Wonâ€™t you miss the enjoyment of small things that bring you happiness?

Edit - Thank you everyone for the replyâ€™s, definitely helps me understand.  What are some of the issues that cause such pain and grief?  Canâ€™t most situations be changed by removing the toxic people/situations?  This topic is such taboo and I appreciate everyone answering my questions.
