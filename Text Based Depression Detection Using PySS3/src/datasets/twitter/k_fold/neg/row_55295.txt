I wish I could hire a hitman to euthanize me peacefully. I would have a nice last supper, play my favorite record and pass out and never wake up.I have failed suicide attempts a lot in past so I donâ€™t think I will ever even attempt again (DONT WORRY) because my reflex kicks in and I donâ€™t want to â€œcommit suicideâ€. Just too painful and messy and stressful. 
I want to die peacefully with zero stress that what if I survive and become crippled or the pain that I will endure. That is all. Die Peacefully. Surrounded by good music. Wear my favorite outfit. In a nice sun-lit room. And take a permanent nap.
