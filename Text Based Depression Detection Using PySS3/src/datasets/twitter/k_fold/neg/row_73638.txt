I've got nothing going onI'm in my mid 30s, a virgin, balding, fat, but I lost some weight recently so I have disgusting flab on my arms, all my clothes are too big and I can't afford to replace them right now so I look like an idiot, I have fucked up teeth, a lazy eye, my tongue looks fucked up, I'm passed over for promotion/training at my shitty part time job in favor of new hires even though I'm one of the hardest workers and got employee of the month, I have no job skills to find a better job because they won't train me on anything else (try to get a full time job with just a year of stockboy on your resume and see how far that gets you), I think the managers are doing it on purpose so I don't have any skills to get a different job, I don't have my own car, my only real life friend since high school is one of my coworkers and we mostly just complain about our job on Facebook messenger and I've never seen him outside of work. My supervisor "playfully" (in her mind) spread rumors that I like a probably 20-22 year old coworker which makes me think all the girls at my job probably think I'm a perverted creep now (I work at a clothing store where 90% of the employees are women). I got a second part time job to try and cobble together 35-40 hours to hopefully save up to get a car and fix my teeth but it was pushing carts at a supermarket in 115 degree heat and I thought I was going to have a heart attack so I quit. The only full-time jobs in this town are for supervisors and managers meaning I'd have to give half a decade of my life to part time minimum wage jobs just to have the experience to even have a chance. I made a profile on POF and the only person that looked at my profile is a morbidly obese woman in her 40s.

I wasted my whole life until last year, partly my own fault but partly not, but now that I'm trying to fix it N-O-T-H-I-N-G is working. It's like I crawled out of my grave only to stumble direclty into a waist deep swamp. Depression finally motivated me to move on but trying to move on and getting nowhere is 100x more depressing and it's only now that I'm seriously fantasizing about killing myself and how people would react and feel sorry for me.
