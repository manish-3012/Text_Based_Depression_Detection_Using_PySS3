Iâ€™m gonna check outI am seriously just done with everything. I feel really guilty as I have had a lot given to me and been lucky but I just canâ€™t anymore.

I donâ€™t feel like I fit in anywhere, Iâ€™m so tired of being alone and not having any real connections with anyone. 

Iâ€™ll feel so guilty because my parents and aunties love me but I hide so much from them because I canâ€™t tell them Iâ€™m struggling. Iâ€™ve done it before but they donâ€™t know how to handle it. 

Iâ€™ve tried the pills, Iâ€™ve tried therapy. 

Iâ€™ve done some mean things in my time which I canâ€™t let go. I think Iâ€™m just faulty you know? I wasnâ€™t meant for this place.

Iâ€™ve been toying with this idea for the past few weeks but I think the time has finally come. I wonna check out of this wild ride they call life.

Not exactly sure how Iâ€™ll do it but I hope I succeed.
