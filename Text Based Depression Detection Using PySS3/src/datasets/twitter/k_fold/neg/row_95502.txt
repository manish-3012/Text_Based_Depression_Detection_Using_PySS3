Everythings so repetitiveWake up, eat, do nothing all day, go to sleep. Wake up, eat, do nothing all day, go to sleep. 

The same shit every day it's making me go mad and I just can't bare to live anymore. The anti-depressants I'm on make me somewhat more functional but as a side effect of that it makes me incredibly tired and it does help the suicidality too. In the sense that I don't have as potent spikes of it its more just dispersed and I want to kill myself all the time instead, don't feel much and dissociate a lot. 

I have no family or friends to speak of and im borderline homeless its getting to much.
