Please help meI am an international student studying in the United States. I moved here with a lot of dreams but all of them got crushed in my very very first semester of Masters. I failed one of my classes because of which I lost my scholarship and now I have no money to pay for my second year of masters. I can't get a student loan and I can't go back home. All I can think about is committing suicide. Please help me.
