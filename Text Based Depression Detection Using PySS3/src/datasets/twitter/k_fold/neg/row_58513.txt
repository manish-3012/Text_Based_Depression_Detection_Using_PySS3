Someone please give me an answer, I'm begging youI don't know why I shouldn't killmyself, all life seem to be is just a constant uphill battle that doesn't give you a reward at the end, why should I waste my time with it?

I would be lying if i said i didnt get happy occasionally, but just knowing that no matter what i do i cant escape the suffering to come is enough to send me over the edge. All the happiness i feel is accompanied by the thought that it can never be permanent and sooner or later im going to be sent spiraling back down into depression and i cant take it

And please dont give me the same cut and dry "Live for your friends and family" or "Look at all the beauty in life". I have nobody i can call my friend and i couldn't care less about how my family feels and they feel the same way about me

The only reason i haven't killed myself is because of that constant nagging in my head "just one more day" bullshit, the fact that my mind wants to die but my body wants to live so badly aggravates me, i just want to know how i can appease it and be at peace.

Life isn't worth all the suffering i go through, theres no supreme bliss, no meaning, no punishment, no reward, i'm just trapped in ceaseless ups and downs when i just want stability, so why does my body want to live so bad?
