Why shouldn't I kill myself?Im tired of the constant pain everyday brings. Im tired of crying all the time and having no one to go to because no one gives a shit about me. Im tired of the neverending anxiety and chest pains and how hard it is to breath sometimes. Im tired of living in this cold, unfair world. 

Im tired of being me. I hate who I am as a person and would kill to be literally anyone else. I have no goals in life. I have no redeemable qualities. Nothing I do is fun or enjoyable anymore. Im a loser. Im such a terrible person that even my parents called me a disappointment. 

Im doing terrible in college this semester because I'm a failure. I have an exam tomorrow that I'm pretty sure I'm gonna fail. People have been telling me "things are gonna get better" for 2 years now and they've just gotten worse. Why shouldn't I kill myself? What's even the point of being alive.
