I'm just so stressed all the timeEvery day I have to attend online school and do a crap ton of assignments since I'm behind and failing nearly all classes, I can't find a job, I live with my mom who somehow finds a way to stress me out even more, I'm broke all the time, I have court for driving without insurance since I can't afford it, and all this plus a lot more honestly makes me want to kill myself. I can't remember the last stress-free day I had. Probably when I was a younger teen. I'm 18 yet I still feel trapped in this dump of a town. I just want to be happy.
