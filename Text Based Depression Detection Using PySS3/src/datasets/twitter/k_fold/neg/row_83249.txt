My life has been a living nightmare ;(
I want to share my experiences with you. My mother abused my mentally and sexually. My family knew about it, but did not respond. My father was an alcoholic and is a psychopath. I had experienced whole spectrum of mental disorders: depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic attacks and psychosis. It was very hard for me to study, I had severe anxiety. I tried studying at university but with no success. When I first realized the scale of destruction that my mother caused and when I tried to stand against my brother and my mother in self-defence, I experienced psychosis. Iâ€™ve been in mental ward for 5 months. Later, in November 2016 Iâ€™ve got to mental ward for people with the experience of psychosis. There, after 3 months my past started to surface again. I got to restricted space for people with suicidal thoughts. There, I wrote down the following notes on my phone (I redacted them slightly, but as far as they are shocking, they are true)

{

I want to die. Hang myself. I want my life to be over. I feel like nothing in my life matters. Iâ€™m destroyed. My mother abused my mentally and sexually. She treated me like her partner. Iâ€™m exhausted. Iâ€™m just like my father, alcoholic, psychopath. I donâ€™t have any energy. Things that Iâ€™ve experienced in my early childhood was a living hell. It didnâ€™t matter how hard I cried, my mother never stopped abusing me. Iâ€™ve heard that I will never make it in life. That Iâ€™m fucking scumbag that hurts his mother. Itâ€™s all my fault. I regret being born. In early childhood my mother liked when I was touching her, so I did. My whole life I was afraid that I wonâ€™t understand something in school and I will get destroyed by my mother. My whole life is a series of torments, I just want it to be over. My mother was abusing my grandmother. My mother is a monster. Why I cannot remember what she was screaming to me. All my boundaries were breached. Iâ€™m, nobody. I donâ€™t have higher education and friends. Itâ€™s time for the suicide. Things that Iâ€™ve experienced in high school were like a living nightmare. I was scared of people, I was scared that they may be like my mother and that they can kill me. I was afraid to have friends. The worst thing is that I have to live with it for the rest of my life. Why when as a child, I was interested in sciences and mathematics, I couldnâ€™t develop myself? I was panickly afraid to get criticised. Why my mother destroyed me? I donâ€™t want to live anymore. I plan to kill myself after I leave the mental ward. I would never do let this happen to my children. This is bestiality. Prospect of death is sweet. This mental pain is more than I can handle. I thought that I shouldnâ€™t be interested in sciences. My brother told me that. I hate my mother and my brother. They didnâ€™t want to celebrate my high-school-leaving exam. Nobody abused me in school, the source of all the pain was in me or rather, my family. I hated myself for I was interested in mathematics. I needed help of others but I didnâ€™t recieved it, because I to afraid to speak up. I wasnâ€™t telling myself that itâ€™s good to be interested in mathematics. My mother screamed that I will never make it life. These are few pathological and very, very painful situations from my childhood:
-My mother screamed at me, when we were buying shoes for me, so that I rather chose those that were too small and then suffer than make her abuse me.
-When I wanted to buy a candy, she told me: take a hammer and killed. I thought that it was my fault
-When we were on holidays, she screamed at me, made me cry so hard that I couldnâ€™t take my breath and then laughed and said: â€œLook at the mirror how ugly you lookâ€. My head was swollen so badly that I couldnâ€™t recognize myself in the mirror.
-We were sleeping on a bunk bed (the bed that has another bed attacthed above it). She was sleeping below, I was sleeping above. When I was lying in the bed and she abused me and I was shaking, but I couldnâ€™t move, because I didnâ€™t want to provoke her to further abuse because I at the moment couldnâ€™t sleep.
-When we were at the seaside, she wiped me so hard that Iâ€™ve experienced pain in my penis.

My mother abused me when I caught cold. She always had to make my cry. As I got older, this took longer. Now I cannot cry at all, no matter how said I am. Once I enrolled in music school. She abused me, she shouted on me and told me that I was nobody. I was afraid to have any interests, so that I wonâ€™t become a victim. The worst thing is that for me to experience love and donâ€™t kill myself right away, I have live with myself and my very, very painful experiences. Sexual and mental abuse is the worst, because it doesnâ€™t leave any marks. If I had experienced physical violence, maybe I wouldnâ€™t have to live in my scary home anymore. When my mother embraced me, I thought it was in a erotic way. I shouldnâ€™t be born. What is wrong in choosing death as a solution? When my mother shouted at me, I could never escape. I always had to be there with her. I didnâ€™t even thought for the most of my life that I could defend myself. I was tortured by my mother.

If not for a childhood abuse, I could have pursued my passions. The loss is overwhelming. I donâ€™t know if I want to live like this. Instead of nurturing my passions, I got destroyed. I have to live with this huge trauma. I was frequently sick (mostly cold) in childhood, my mother was abusing me because I got sick. It would be best for everyone if I wasnâ€™t born at all.

It was very painful when I thought I have a heart disease. I needed help then but my mother abused me. I was lying on the ground and cried so hard that my face my swollen. My brother was abusing me then too. My brother laughed at me, because I liked to study. During psychosis my mother and my brother were my enemies.

Iâ€™m afraid to take responsibility for my life, because I can get something wrong. Itâ€™s hard for me to make mistakes because my mother could hurt me (now itâ€™s easier to defend myself). The worst thing is that for her mistakes she blames me, tortures were my fault. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m afraid to make mistakes, because I treat myself like my mother. I treat myself with no mercy, as if I was torturing myself.

During this torture, I begged in my mind for my mother to kill me so that my suffering would go away.

For me suicide is the termination of my suffering. My mother severely abused me when my anxiety disorder and depression appeared, instead of helping me. I felt responsible for her when she were said or cried. I thought, it was my fault. She told me that my mental disorders are my fault and Iâ€™m destroying her with premeditation.

When I make a mistake, I treat myself with no mercy and brutality like my mother treated me for things that werenâ€™t my fault, but she told it was mine.

I feel dead inside. I donâ€™t know if I can achieve any meaning in my life. Everything is washed out. I have the worst father and the worst mother. Iâ€™m a product of my tragic circumstances. Why I had to survive the abuse? Why she couldnâ€™t just kill me?

Bad memories are coming back. My mother shouted: you stupid fuck. Iâ€™m going to fuck out your head. This was very scary. I couldnâ€™t sleep last night. The worst thing is that nobody can help me. These memories will be for the rest of my life. No words can heal me.

Why my father was so bad of a human being? Why my parents couldnâ€™t put me to adoption?

Iâ€™m a small child. My mother treats me like her sexual partner. Itâ€™s hard to describe it. There is something frightening in her words, expression, gestures. She encourages me to talk about sex and touching her. I remember particularly good one such situation.

It happed on Childrenâ€™s Day (in Poland itâ€™s June 1st). Firstly I touched my mother and talked about sex. Then she cried and told my brother that she couldnâ€™t stand my behaviour. Maybe that Iâ€™m molesting her. Then I experienced true living hell. This time, not only my mother but my whole family started to abuse me. I remember that I couldnâ€™t recognize my reflection in the mirror, my head was so swollen. They took turns in abuse: my brother, my grandmother and my mother. They used every possible swearword. They treated me like an object. I was out of breath. I didnâ€™t even dream of suicide, because when mother would know about it and I was still alive, she would inflict more pain that death could ever give.

My mother abused me once a week/two weeks. She always had to make me cry, but as time went on it took more and more time but the mental anguish was even greater. I thought that itâ€™s my fault that she is screaming. I was afraid that my mother will kill herself because of me, because she told me so. I thought that Iâ€™m a bad child. Thatâ€™s why I had to be perfect in school. I was incredibly harsh for myself. I had trouble with open questions, because there couldnâ€™t be any repetitions, so the style of the text was perfect. Writing a text took me hours. I hardly slept in night. I was terribly tired.

Physical education was horrifying. I was afraid to play with others, I was afraid of their aggression.

I kept isolating myself from my peers. Why? I was afraid that people are like my mother. I was always finding some reasons in which a friend could hurt me. I didnâ€™t even have my own room in my home. Living conditions were tough. I was ashamed of this and didnâ€™t ask my friends to my home. Furthermore, I was interested in sciences and mathematics and was hard to find a friend to talk to. As time went by, â€œperfect studyingâ€ became a way for me to reduce anger of my mother and fear started to interfere with my interests, so I started avoiding taking care of them.

My mother liked to make me fat. Put large portions of food in me and look how fat I am. I thought, it was my fault. Mother told me that itâ€™s just the way I am.

When my mother screamed at me, I could never escape it. I always remained silent or cried as she screamed at me.

I was afraid to go shopping, because my mother always screamed at me and sometimes I bought too small shoes for myself so that I wouldnâ€™t provoke her to scream. We sleeped on a bunk bed. Sometimes, she screamed at me right before I felt asleep. I was afraid to flip from side to side even if I felt uncomfortable so that I wouldnâ€™t wake her up. Once I wanted to attend cinema night (watching movies all night). When she took me back from school and I told her about it she screamed at me so hard that I couldnâ€™t take my breath. She just didnâ€™t stop. When I was a child I signed for French lessons, but I remember her abusing me in this time and thatâ€™s why I started to critisize myself and I lost the intrest. Why she done this to me? I thought that itâ€™s because Iâ€™m a bad child. When I felt bad, Iâ€™d rather hide it so I wouldnâ€™t provoke her. She read all my messages, she didnâ€™t give me the right to privacy. She threatened me with death if I only call â€œNiebieska Liniaâ€ - hotline for people experiencing abuse at home. She frequently threatened me with death. She was telling me that she will fuck out my head. Sometimes it gave me some peace that those tortures will end when I will be killed. Sometimes it enforced the anxiety.

Often during abuse, she took my hand and shook it violently. Or she showed me with her hands that she will strangle me. She gave me maximum fear and minimal marks. I never told her to stop, because I thought that it was my fault.

She abused me severely when my mental health in high school deteriorated. When I was having depression and was lying in the bed all day, she abused me. I thought she wanted to strangle me and I didnâ€™t defend myself. Her hands were on my neck, but they didnâ€™t tighten. I thought she eventually will strangle me so my suffering will end. For me, death is the relief from the pain.

In childhood she hugged me and kissed me like her sexual partner. She told me, itâ€™s because she loves me very much. She made lay next to her and embrace her and I was touching her.

She almost always abused me when I came up with an initiative. She told me that I will never make it life. She screamed at me that I am ***, ***, ***, *** (hard to precisely Polish curse words in English).

I thought that in childhood I lived just to be her object of sexual tension and to be her object of abuse.

I remember when she abused me when we went to open day in high school and open day at university. I have a feeling that nobody supported me in education, even though I was a good student.

In high school I skipped lots of classes and they wanted to sue my mother because of that. My strategy was to avoid. I was just afraid of friends and teachers so that I skipped classes.

Just before the start of high school, I had psychosomatic pains in chest (because of my anxiety disorder) and I made cardiological tests. The cardiologist told me that I can die at any moment during physical exercise. Afterwards, I went to several other cardiologists and I found out that the risk of sudden death is only slightly elevated and I can be physically active with no worry. Mother in the meantime abused me. High school started and in January 2009 I got severe panic attack and got admitted to pediatric hospital. I was scared that I could die at any moment. The fear was so strong that I had metallic taste in my mouth and blurred vision. I was diagnosed with obssessive-compulsive disorder. I was attending psychiatrist because of my anxiety disorder. My mother screamed that I was z fuck-up because Iâ€™m meeting psychiatrist. I couldnâ€™t attend school. On top of that, I had depressive symptoms. I was under attention of psychiatrist and psychologist but I didnâ€™t tell them about the abuse because I was so scared. I hardly got through with first year of high school. In the second year, I also had problem with attending classes and my mother changed my high school. I was afraid to have friends, I had severe anxiety of people. After I skipped lots of classes in new high school, my mother wanted to sent me to school with permanent residence so she would not be responsible for me. During this situation she abused me, so it was much, much harder to cope with anxiety disorder and depression. I had first suicide attempt in third year of high school. Nobody was frightened by it.

In childhood I had felt a lot of aggression, so I was destroying things. I tortured them like I was tortured.

How to heal myself? Is it even possible? Some scars are to deep to be healed.

Iâ€™ve felt dehumanized, stripped from my dignity. I knew that I can always go out so that I will not hear what she was screaming, but I didnâ€™t do that because I thought this was all my fault. This whole situation with my mother took very long and took place in the critical time of my life: first 23 years of my life.

Yesterday when I wrote about the abuse, I had to hiperventilate so that anxiety would go away. When I think about my experiences, I have a desire to hang myself in this mental wardâ€™s bathroom. To do that, I have an idea to borrow the brush. Then go to the bathroom, attach a belt to rail next to shower with the brush and tie the other end around my neck and hang myself. Thatâ€™s how I would lose my consciousness and die.

Iâ€™m attending psychotherapy and now I feel strong enough to speak up about this to my family. Iâ€™m sharing it also with you, because I want you to know why I was isolating myself from you. And I feel that I need support. I feel much better now, but still am very lonely with those very, very painful experiences. :(

I don't even know how to recover from this. All I want is peaceful and happy life, but I don't know if it's possible. Because there may be no solution, suicide may be the answer ;(
