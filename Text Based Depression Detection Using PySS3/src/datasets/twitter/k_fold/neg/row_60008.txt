One of the biggest things preventing me from doing itIs the risk of failing a suicide attempt, which could result first and foremost in serious injury which would leave me arguably in a worse condition than I am currently.

I won't go into specific method discussion here, but I am truly amazed at how few options that only involve your own self can actually guarantee death.  Even the most lethal methods have a small risk of surviving unless everything is done absolutely perfectly.  

I am amazed that we hear about so many people in the news dying through accidents and other mishaps, yet it seems like when I want a guaranteed way to die, there's hardly one to be found.

I'm actually OK with a death that involves some pain, so long as it is reasonably quick and I am assured that death is guaranteed.

Seems like the most reliable death of all is just time, it kills us all with 100% certainty no matter how perfectly or poorly one's life has been lived
