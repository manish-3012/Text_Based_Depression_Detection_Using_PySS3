Hanging in peaceI was planning to do it for so long, gave myself a "due date" and so earlier I picked up the rope, tied it to my door the way I've been studying it and just...let myself hang there. I could feel myself get a little numb, a lot dizzy but also a sense of peace. 

That's the peace I've been looking for for years and it was right there wrapped suffocatingly around my neck.

Then I heard my cat on the other side of the door and couldn't do it. Nobody understand it and they're all very upset when I say this but...I don't push myself to live to spare my boyfriend or my mom some heartbreak. I love them all but they don't need me. My cats need me. We're a bunch of emotionally dependant and I can't leave one night without them freaking out.

So yes, as much as peace and quiet felt amazing and liberating, my mama side took over and I loosen up the noose.
