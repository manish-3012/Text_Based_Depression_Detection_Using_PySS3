My life is failure.I made mistakes. Too many of them. I often think the only right thing I should do now is suicide. Iâ€™m just miserable. Iâ€™m completely inable to earn money. Iâ€™m in 5000â‚¬ debt. I want someone to help me, to teach me how to earn money, how to change my life, how to get outta debt. How to be financially free. I canâ€™t wait much longer.
