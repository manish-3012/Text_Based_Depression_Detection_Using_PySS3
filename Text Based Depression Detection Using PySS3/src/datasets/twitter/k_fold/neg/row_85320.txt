Threw up because I canâ€™t dieI just canâ€™t do this anymore I feel so lonely and stressed school and everyone around me just threatens me to do what they feel is good for me or they wonâ€™t support me.

But I canâ€™t go on Iâ€™m just so tired everything is shit and Iâ€™ll get kicked out of school again if I donâ€™t go but I canâ€™t sleep for 2 days straight and I canâ€™t drink idk I think Iâ€™ll just end it now itâ€™s too much for me
