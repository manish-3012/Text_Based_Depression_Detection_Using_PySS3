I'm fully aware.I am unhappy. And I self sabotage,  and I cant stop.

I dont know why I do it. Other than because my brain tells me to. And even though I've tried to fight, in the end I give up. And no one knows. No one can tell. And I know the signs but I ignore them.

Once I tell everyone how good and happy I am, I start to go right back to fucking shit up. It's like I cant be happy. 

I got an awesome job, and I've missed this whole week. And no one knows. And I know I'm in trouble, and now I'm to scared to show my face. And the thing is no one can stop me. Because I just feel better when I'm broken. 

I'll feel better when I'm dead. It's not funny and I know it's not but I laugh. I never ever ever thought I'd make it this long. But I always hoped and was the "happy bubbly type" and I still am but all my shits hidden. I keep it from everyone

Cause everyone else matters so fuck me right?
But not because of them, because of me. That's my mental. I can take care of everyone else so I dont have to take care of myself. 

I dont think I have just depression, anxiety, ADHD. I think there is something more. And I can't figure out what. But something is wrong.

There is something wrong.
