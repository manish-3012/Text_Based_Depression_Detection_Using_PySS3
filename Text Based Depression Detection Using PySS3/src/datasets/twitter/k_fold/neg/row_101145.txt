Got kicked out, I guess this is rock bottomI didn't die yesterday. I wish I had, or had died before yesterday, before all this.

My roommate and best friend kicked me out yesterday via text message. I fucking deserved it. What did I expect? I was constantly trying to hide my worsening self-harm and suicidal thoughts, and she just couldn't handle it. Why should I expect her, or anyone to? I can't even handle it...

I feel more worthless than ever before. I feel like I can't come back from this. My brother and his gf took me in, but I feel like nothing more than a burden to everyone. I have no permanent home address, haven't worked in the past three weeks because I've been struggling mentally so much, and have run out of money. The only saving grace I have financially is that it's tax season.

All of this, and I'm also expected to make plans for the future and possibly going back to college. I can't even picture a future for myself. I feel so overwhelmed and alone right now. All I can think is that it's too late, I truly put the last nail in the coffin this time, I might as well take steps to occupy it.

I haven't made enough of an effort. I've failed myself and everyone else. I've hit rock bottom, and I'm not sure I can climb out.
