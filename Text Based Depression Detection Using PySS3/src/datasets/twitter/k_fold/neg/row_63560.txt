No HopeHey there, who ever you are !
After many chronic illnesses and one failed suicid attempt, Iâ€™m trying it again with a different method.
Fentanyl, Oxycodon, Tilidin and heating blanket.

I really hope that I slip into unconsciousness soon and die peacefully. 
Could have drunken some alc. but the taste was just to much for me .

For everyone:
We all know that life is ducking hard, but if you have the opportunity to change your life - DO IT
Run away, find a new job, take a long vacation - change your life while you can so that you donâ€™t regret your missed opportunities on your deathbed .
There are always changes in life, make the best out of those situations.

Live is for most people cruel and painful in soo many ways - change thinks you could change 

Everyone is different and has different circumstances.
I believe that everyone should have the right (with professional help) to end his own life.

Stay safe
