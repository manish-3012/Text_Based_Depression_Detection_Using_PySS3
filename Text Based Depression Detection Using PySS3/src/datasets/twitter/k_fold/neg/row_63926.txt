Iâ€™m completely numb and I donâ€™t see any point in livingIâ€™m so sorry if my English is bad cause itâ€™s not my first language. Iâ€™m a 21 year old female college student, living with depression for over 9 years (I officially got diagnosed at the age of 18). Since then I have been on meds on n off (currently I stopped taking meds and I know I shouldnâ€™t decide my own without a proper professional advice and I am fully aware its side effects and stuffs, but I felt like it was affecting me in a bad way). I attempted to suicide in November by overdosing. I was sent to psych ward right away after the attempt and had to stay there over a month. While I was there I tried my best to get discharged as soon as possible so I basically forced myself to be in a good mood and by that I could finish what Iâ€™ve started. You might be wondering what makes me so desperate, but Iâ€™m not planning to go on details and make it super long to read. I have many reasonable reasons to selfishly leave everything behind. I have really supportive people in my life, but mentall illness is not just an illness, it will slowly consume you overtime. Itâ€™s just like physical illnesses. Painful and deadly.
