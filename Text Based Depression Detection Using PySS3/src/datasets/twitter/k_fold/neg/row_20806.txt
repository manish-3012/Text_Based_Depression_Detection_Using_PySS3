A strange gut feelingI have 2 very good friends, both happen to be depressed and medicated, but in varying states of taking medication due to side-effects/cost. One of those friends recently confided in me that they attempted recently once, leaving room for them to have attempted. I expressed gratitude that they're still alive, and haven't exactly interacted since.


The issue comes with the fact that, compared to them, I feel like I'm faking depression. I've never attempted. I've never been medicated or even diagnosed. I whine and complain about wanting to hurt myself or be dead, but the most I come is dreaming up scenarios and maybe looking at my method, but never even stepping in the shallow end so to speak. I have consistently put up time and time again with the want to maim myself to unfathomable levels, only to do nothing about it and wander away unscathed.


I have this, incredibly strange feeling. It's telling me that I need to either stop lying and set things right by finding out how much 3% Hydrogen Peroxide it takes to kill, or cut contact with both of them to avoid feeding this recurring mindset that allows me to lie and complain.
