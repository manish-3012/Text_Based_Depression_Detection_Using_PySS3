Contemplated suicide a lot in the last monthMy girlfriend doesn't know the gfroed I'm going through and everyone I've brought up how I'm feeling lately I'm being told I'm selfish and only thinking about myself. She's out tonight enjoying halloween. I'm in bed alone drinking with a heavy dose of pills to go a long with it if I dojt pass out before hand.
