Feeling lonelyI've never had many friends. Throughout high school I spent all my lunches alone. In college I broke out of my shell and got to know some people, but managed to sabatoge the vast majority of those relationships. Never had a girlfriend, when i talk to my parents it is clear they are disappointed in me.

I suppose it could be a lot worse, but the loneliness makes it really hard to express myself and it makes the painful thoughts worse when they are stuck inside your head. I wish I had lived my life differently, but now here I am and there is no going back, and it makes me want to die.
