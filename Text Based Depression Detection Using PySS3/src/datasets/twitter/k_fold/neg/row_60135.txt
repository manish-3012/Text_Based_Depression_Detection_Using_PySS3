I've been experimenting with hanging, and now my head feels very oddSo I've been experimenting with hanging for a while now, but since this morning I've been feeling very woozy. I'd get a noose at head level then put my weight on it, but since then I've felt rather dizzy and quite sleepy. Is this to be expected?
