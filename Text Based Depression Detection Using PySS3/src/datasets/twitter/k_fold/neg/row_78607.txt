Please Don't ReadI think this is the final draft of my suicide note. I know it's probably clichÃ© to leave one, but who really cares. Every day I feel closer to the edge, and part of me wants to at least have some final words to everyone in my life.


Dear (insert name),

Â Â  All I can really say is that I'm sorry. I just wasn't strong enough. It's nobody's fault but my own honestly so please don't ever blame yourself. I just don't want to have to pretend anymore, I don't want to have to push on with the will I don't have, and more than anything else I just want the pain to go away. All I've felt anymore is everything pressing down on me. Maybe it's all weight I put on myself, maybe it's not, but it doesn't really matter anymore. My heart only ever aches anymore. My brain tears any shred of feeling okay to pieces. My eyes have lost their glow. My smile is forced. I don't even feel human. I just ask for one small favor from everyone that was in my life. Save your tears for when you really need to cry, and instead smile when you think of me. Close your eyes and remember the good times. I don't want to cause anymore pain that I already have in this lifetime. To anyone that needs to hear it one more time. I love you. I love you so much. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I was like this.
