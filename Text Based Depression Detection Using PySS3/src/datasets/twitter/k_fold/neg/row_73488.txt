It never endsI want to kill myself, I really do but I don't have the guts to do it. I firmly believe that life isn't worth it. It never will be in my eyes. I'm constantly paranoid and scared and angry and alone. It's a never ending cycle and it's just how things will be with me in my life. I spend all day thinking about how I should kill myself or all the bad things in the world, even if they have nothing to do with me or haven't even happened. I just want to die already.
