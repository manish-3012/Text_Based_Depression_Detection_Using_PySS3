After E3 next week I think it will be about time I leave.I was going to say I'm near the end of my rope, but I've since lost the rope years ago. How am I still going? What actually keeps me here? Well one I didn't have a method readily available, a quick method at that. Not much kept me tethered here besides a few people and my dog... I've lost almost all enjoyment of the things I once loved, I'm tired to the bone ALL. The. Time. And...I just don't see any benefit to me being here. All I ever do is frustrate and piss people off, even my closest friends. They don't deserve someone like me, they deserve someone better. I'm pathetic and can't do anything right. I live in fantasies all the time in order to cope with all my oppressive thoughts! 

There are many reasons why I want to die, but I just needed to get some of this out here.
