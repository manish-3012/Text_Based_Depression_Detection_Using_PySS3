Whatâ€™s the pointThatâ€™s how I feel everyday when I wake up. Whatâ€™s the point. Everyday it gets harder and harder to give myself a good response to the question. I feel broken, I feel lost, I feel hurt, I just feel too much, and every time I feel it might get better, it doesnâ€™t and goes back to the same shit.

I try so hard to be a good husband and father but I just never feel like itâ€™s enough. The worst part of it is my wife couldnâ€™t give two shits about how I feel, she may pretend, but she really doesnâ€™t. 

Im just so tired of feeling this way... I just want to sit here and cry all day but I have to work because people depend on me. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. But the one thing I know, is I canâ€™t keep living this way. I wish I could just get into some sort of accident because Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to end it myself. 

Iâ€™m just so tired of everything
