I'm too tired to do anythingI'm sorry if I'm rambling or if it's hard to understand. I'm awful with words.


I'm just exhausted. I don't have energy to do anything. I'm failing behind in school, I have only one friend, and my family doesn't seem to care much about me. I'm two year behind in high school (I'm supposed to be graduating this year, but I'm a sophomore for the third year in a row) and I'm not gonna pass this year. It's really stressing me out and my parents aren't helping. I should mention that I'm in online school (because of social anxiety), too, so it's pathetic to fail. I have one friend (who I met online) and they don't seem to care much for me, I'm just someone to talk to when their other friends aren't paying attention to them. My parents ignored to two times I reached out. I talked to a school counselor my freshmen year, then my first sophomore year. I told her that I was suicidal and self-harming both times. she called my parents, both times. They've never brought it up to me, but they do make fun of me for cutting myself. Needless to say, I haven't reached out to my parents since. They wouldn't let me get professional help anyway, I'm the failure child why would they spend anymore money on me. I'm sick of being alone. I'm sick of never being good enough for anyone. I'm sick of everything. I want to sleep all day but I'd get yelled at. I've tried to kms three times and I really want to try it again
