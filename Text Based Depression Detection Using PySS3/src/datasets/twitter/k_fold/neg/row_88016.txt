I think childhood rape has ruined meI'm 22 years old; male.  I stumbled upon a few reddit posts regarding the average body count/sexual partners most people have had at my age, and almost all of the them have said at least ten.  The only person I've ever had sex was with my own father who raped me when I was a kid.  My biggest fear is dying alone... and I'm completely going down that path.  I've never been in a relationship.  The two girls I came close to being in a relationship with ended up saying they weren't ready only to throw me away for someone else a week later.  I wasted my college years.  Granted I went to a community college and an antisocial commuter school, but still.  If it didn't happen there, when's it ever going to happen?  I can't find a job after graduating - not one worth taking, at least.  I don't see a situation where I'm not miserable at work.  I have like three friends.  I go nowhere and have nothing to do.  I'm pretty sure I've developed body dysmorphia disorder.  I hate my body, yet people of reddit said my body is average.  I've started to hate my face even though I used to feel confident and attractive.  I've had opportunities with some fairly attractive girls but either never took them or get turned down because they were with someone else.  The two opportunities that went anywhere, as I said earlier, blew up in my face.  At least I got my first and only kiss out of it, I guess.  Doesn't make up for years of pain and regret.  I've been looking for something or someone to blame for all my failures and all I can think of is my dad who fucking raped me for years.  I don't know how or why I can't just get over it.  It feels like a cop out/excuse for my shortcomings to me.  I just want to die.
