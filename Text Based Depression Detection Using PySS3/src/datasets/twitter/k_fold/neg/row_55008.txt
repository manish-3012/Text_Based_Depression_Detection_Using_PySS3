Suicide note?Iâ€™m right here , in my room , waiting to die , itâ€™s funny , because Iâ€™m turning 17 in less than 24hours , it just makes me sad that I would die on my birthday, but It is what it is for now .
I know how insignificant i am in this whole existance , but I just wanted to mark somewhere, that I felt betrayed by everyone , I have no one , literally, my family is more than a mess ,both of my parents intensely mentally sick which made them far more than just toxic and abusive , a brother that have abused me in all way possible including sexually , dealing with bullying and strange looks since i look different, barely had friends , or at least what I feel , mental illnesses , struggling with everything in my way , Iâ€™m basically just trying to keep myself from not ending myself for this whole time , nobody bothered to ask me if Iâ€™m okay , or to just hear about what I have to say , a little bit of patience and support even for a good 20 minutes would have felt so good , Iâ€™ve never been loved , or just felt like it , at this point i just feel like i deserve to die, such a pathetic life should just shut up and end it.
I donâ€™t have to make this perfect, soon, it would just be over , doesnâ€™t matter if no one has ever knew my whole story , how I felt the heaviness of my existence and how much I want to delete myself , how much Iâ€™ve patiently waited for better days , for simple dreams , for a normal life , a simple normal life where I just donâ€™t feel hurt every now and then. 
My heart hurt at this point from overthinking what will happen next , after I die , which was something keeping me from doing it , but it doesnâ€™t matter now , Iâ€™m leaving , with no one to stop me.
