Feeling closer and closer to the edgeIâ€™ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I tried to stick it out in the hopes it would get better but itâ€™s only gotten worse. I had to put my childhood dog to sleep last week and I canâ€™t stop thinking about ending it to be with her. My cat kept me going for a long time but sheâ€™s not even enough anymore. Iâ€™m so desperate to get a dog to try to give myself purpose again but my boyfriend wonâ€™t let me get one right now.

I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m just feeling pessimistic and sad about everything and I just want it all to be over. I canâ€™t stop wondering whether my stash of pills would be enough to kill me or thinking about finding my boyfriendâ€™s gun just to end it all.
