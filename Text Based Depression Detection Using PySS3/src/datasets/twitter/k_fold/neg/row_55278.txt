Everything is telling me to dieMy life is completely worthless. I work a customer service job with no future, I dropped out of college and couldnâ€™t get back in if I tried, and now I know I donâ€™t matter to anyone. I asked what few friends I have left if they had NYE plans, and not only did they not respond, they posted a bunch of pictures of their party. Everyone I wouldâ€™ve called a friend was there, and not a single one of them let me know. I thought I was worthless before this, but now I know I donâ€™t matter at all. Suicide is clearly my only option going forward, and I have a method, place, and time all picked out. Just need to follow through now.
