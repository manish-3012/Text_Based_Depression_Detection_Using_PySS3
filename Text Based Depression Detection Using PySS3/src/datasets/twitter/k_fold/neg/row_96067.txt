How do we know it's worth waiting for 'better times' more than it is to just die?I've been thinking about this recently and can't figure it out. What if dying isn't as bad as people make it out to be? What if there is a better time after dying more than there is staying alive? I really wish I could be with the dead or talk to them to know the answer. I've been struggling for a while and it's getting hard to believe someone when they say things get better when it's been years and things are still not okay. I'm too much of a coward to end my life myself, but I'll gladly say yes to someone if they ask if they can shoot me in the head.
