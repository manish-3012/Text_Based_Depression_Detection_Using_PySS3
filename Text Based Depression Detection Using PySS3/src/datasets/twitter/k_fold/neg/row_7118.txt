Male, 15. Just swallowed 6 koffein pills. Will I die?I am home alone at the moment. I just swallowed 6 caffeine pills. Is that enough for me to die? IÂ´m done. Done.

Edit: I figured I should tell a little about myself...
I am 15 year old boy named M. Suffer from BDD and depression. I just got informed that I have to start taking 80mg anti-depressants each day now which equals 4 pills. That basically means that there is something wrong with me. None of my friends are on pills like that. I havenÂ´t actually tried to kill myself before but the thoughts have always been there.

IÂ´m very good at school - the only thing I do when IÂ´m home is to basically study. I love to study languages, especially german. My goal was to move to MÃ¼nchen when I finished high school. I live in Sweden by the way.

Edit: I have to take a shit at the moment. My stomach is acting very strange. I will update you on my android phone. And - IÂ´ve never been so happy in my life!!! Every time I feel suicidal - 6 caffeine pills will go down my throat! This is the best thing I have ever done.

No, the therapist did not help. They basically just sit there and nod with their heads - minuters later they write out pills for me. This just sucks so much.
