why am i suicidal for no reasoniâ€™ve been fine for months, not thinking about suicide seriously. i got a new therapist right before quarantine since my last one left the company, sheâ€™s not a right fit for me and i donâ€™t really know how to talk to her but she assumes iâ€™m getting better so our sessions are spreading further and further apart. a factor might be that my boyfriends incredibly stressed from numerous factors, and passed out at the wheel today from a panic attack which almost got him killed. i donâ€™t know. maybe everythingâ€™s just happening at once and iâ€™m getting overwhelmed.
