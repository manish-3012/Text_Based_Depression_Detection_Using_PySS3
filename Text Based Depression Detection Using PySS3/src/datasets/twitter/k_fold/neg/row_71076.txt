I feel like I'm at my last straw guys :(Being in the army has made me realize three things:

-I am a complete social retard
-I am a pushover
-I suck so badly I can't follow the simplest of instructions

I've given it some thought. I know that army was designed to make you feel like shit. But how should I feel when everyone can do simple things that I can't? Like just remembering some goddamn instructions or not making the same mistakes. Or not being the outcast in just 8 weeks of being in the platoon? In 8 weeks, I've managed to be singled out as one of the most idiotic people in the platoon. What does that say about me? I have no friends to turn to, no counsellors I can approach without looking like a pussy and no parent I can tell without disappointing them. I can't fight this urge to say "fuck it I'm out" much longer. Every time I'm in camp, I beg myself to end it the next chance I get, so that I won't regret not doing it the next time I go back into camp. If I had a painless guaranteed way of going now, I would have done so already.
