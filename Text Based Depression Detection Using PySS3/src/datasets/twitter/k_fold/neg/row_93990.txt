Probably tomorrowI don't know why I'm posting here.. i don't really want help. 

Over the past few months my wife has been growing distant. I didn't realize anything was off due to differing work schedules and honestly just being completely oblivious. Everyone else seemed to notice that something was off, but not me. She had talked a few times about how the schedules we had was making things hard and that she felt it was hurting our relationship. I had been applying to other places around town but in this town either you know someone to get you a job, or you are way over qualified for the position, so i was stuck where i was.

I tried two different places over the course of the last 6 months. One wore me down mentally and had me on the verge of suicide, the other was too physically demanding and i couldn't do it. I still applied everywhere i could but it never went anywhere. 

In this time, my wife fell out of love with me. A couple weeks ago i was in tears because i noticed how distant she was being. I thought she had been cheating on me but either way i recognized that she was starting to hate me. She didn't talk to me unless it was about bills or if i talked to her first, if so much as our feet touched while laying on the couch she pulled away, she did everything she could to be away from me. 

The night i broke down she came out to the living room and told me she wanted a divorce. I cried the entire night. Over the course of the past two-ish weeks I've been staying with my mom. Im barely eating and doing nothing but watching TV and texting my wife when she isn't working. I'm pushing her away even more. 

She doesn't love me anymore, to the point that she already had feelings for someone else. She hasn't loved me for months. I did everything in my life for her and now i don't have a purpose. And honestly i don't want one. I married her to be with her for life. I don't want anyone else and i don't want a life without her. 

Tomorrow is our anniversary. It just seems fitting. I already have things planned out so that whenever she gets off she'll get a text with my wishes for my possessions, the money in my account and so forth. I'm scared of death, but I'm more scared of life without her. 

The shitty thing is i know this is all my fault. Refusing to do little things for her like the dishes. Playing video games rather than being with her. I wish i could take it all back. I wish she wanted to fix it. I wish i noticed something was wrong before it was too late. I wish i could just have her love me one more time before the end.
