Teenage Friend Needs Medical Attention, Cannot Consult ParentsHi guys,

I am a teenager in high school and have a friend who is currently struggling with depression. There have been comments made about suicide, and I am worried. They have spoken to the school counselor, and their advice was to talk to a doctor and get medication. My friend says they cannot talk to their parents about this issue, and feels that their parents will not believe them or help them. Knowing them, this is probably true. Are there any services through which a teenager can access mental health professionals / medication without the consent or knowledge of their parents? We live in California, if that helps.

Thank you.
