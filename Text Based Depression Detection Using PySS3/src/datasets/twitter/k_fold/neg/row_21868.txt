Fear of institutionalizationIâ€™d say Iâ€™ve had a few hundred thoughts involving suicide over the past two years. 

Whatâ€™s going through my mind right now is if i happen to decide to attempt to follow through with suicide and I donâ€™t succeed by trying to od from an opiate, Iâ€™ll be put in a state level psych ward for 6 months. 

I live in PA. Can anyone tell if thatâ€™s practical?
