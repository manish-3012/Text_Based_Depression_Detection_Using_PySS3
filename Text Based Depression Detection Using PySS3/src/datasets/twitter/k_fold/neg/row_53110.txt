I'm done ....Sometimes, alot of times, I feel so alone that there are no words to explain the feeling.  A dark void, 
that no one pretenses, because the mere act would prove their deficiencies.  
This is the/a battle, to climb.. 
to fall.. 
to find.. 
and maybe, 
just maybe.. 
to find..peace among the ruin,
for all fault and folly that is created and that all belong too, that everything belongs too.
Not one, 
but all in conglemerate,
Because the horizon is all we see and all we are.
