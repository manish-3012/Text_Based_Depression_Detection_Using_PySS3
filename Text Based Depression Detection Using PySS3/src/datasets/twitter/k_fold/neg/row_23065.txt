How this lyrics fits my situation...**Trigger warning: selfharm, alcohol abuse, suicide**

*I'm going through a lot, and one of the things is my toxic, yet only friend. This song is so relatable*

**Here we go again** ^((I'm gonna face the same things again))  
**I kinda wanna be more than friends** ^((I want u to kiss me. I want to be an actual couple))  
**So take it easy on me** ^((stop playing with my feelings))  
**I'm afraid you're never satisfied** ^((u say I have to leave u cuz ure so depressed. Yet u get angry when I take a break for one day))  
**Here we go again** ^((Well here goes your playing and pretending again))  
**We're sick like animals** ^((When I have a depressive episode, we gaslight eachother into cutting and suicidal behaviour))  
**We play pretend** ^((u pretend to switch to an angressive person. I pretend I don't know, and I pretend I'm not scared))  
**You're just a cannibal** ^((u feed on me giving u attention, while I go down with the pressure))  
**And I'm afraid I won't get out alive** ^((One day u will play too much with my emotions and I will break))  
**No, I won't sleep tonight** ^((I can't sleep cuz I'm crying. The only person who said they loved me, uses me for attention))

  
**Oh, oh**  
**I want some more** ^((Just break me already, so I have an exuse to cut my wrist. Cuz I don't wanna leave u, but also not stay in this))  
**Oh, oh**  
**What are you waiting for** ^((Yea, what u waiting for? Just hrut me already. U go over my boundaries little by little everytime))  
**Take a bite of my heart tonight** ^((That's how it feels when I happily go to u, and then u do this stuff again))  
**Oh, oh**  
**I want some more**  
**Oh, oh**  
**What are you waiting for**  
**What are you waiting for**  
**Say goodbye to my heart tonight** ^((If I just decide to end it tonight, u'll have to search another naive person who loves u, despite being hurt everyday))

  
**Here we are again** ^((Last time I bought a bottle limoncello to drink myself to death. It didn't work but I crave to the feeling of having all the time in the world. Feeling like nothing cares anymore, while I'm blacking out every minute and blood drips out of my wrist, like last time))  
**I feel the chemicals kickin' in** ^((I can feel the alcohol already / I can feel the calmness already when I think about cutting my wrist))  
**It's getting heavy** ^((together with the past haunting me, and the depression. This is getting too much))  
**And I wanna run and hide** ^((Everyday at night I wanna climb out of my window. Go to my forest spot and just sleep, drink and hang myself there))  
**I wanna run and hide** ^((now I just concentrate and get myself out of existense. Suddenly the world is not here. Only cutting and dissociating))  
**I do it every time** ^((At my bike, when I'm angry or stressed, I also get this feeling now. My body doesn't give me the feeling to stop for the upcoming road anymore; Yet I find some strength to just stop instead of purposly gettng hit))  
**You're killin' me now** ^((Instead of sometimes having these moments, ure now constantly depressed and I don't have any moment in the day I can go online without getting stressed))  
**And I won't be denied by you**  
**The animal inside of you** ^((u start to change into an animal, slowly killing me))
