suicidal but for fucking reasoni havenâ€™t felt suicidal in months but suddenly all i want to do is down a bottle of tylenol. nothing even triggered this. i think iâ€™m just overwhelmed, i work a lot and i donâ€™t have any friends i can hang out with (i live in another state) and the friends i do have donâ€™t want to talk to me about my mental health which i totally understand but fuck. 

iâ€™ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ednos. my life sucks and i literally have nothing to live for. do i just go for it? i donâ€™t know    

idk what i want to do for the rest of my life, iâ€™m 19. iâ€™m in school. i love my friends but i just donâ€™t know anymore
