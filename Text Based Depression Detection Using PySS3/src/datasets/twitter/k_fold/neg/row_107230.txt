27, Indian, Depressed, Single for life, want to stab myself in the neck.If I had known that life was going to be so depressing and sad, I would have plotted in the womb for my demise. Atleast my mother agrees with that, she used to say I wish I had killed you in the womb.

Life is so depressing that I spend 2 hours in the toilet when it can be done in 15 minutes. I am quite certain that people around me consider me ugly. I have no social skills. I wish I was good at communicating my emotions and also not have to struggle in making people smile or laugh. I love when people laugh at my jokes, but this might have only happened twice through out my life.

I don't want to get married. My parents are trying hard to convince me into an arranged or a love marriage, it would be my choice. I don't want to get married in the first place. I don't think I would a good husband or a father. I know that because I have never been a good son, brother and friend.

I want all this to end.
