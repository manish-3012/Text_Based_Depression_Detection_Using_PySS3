I want to stop existing but i dont want to die...The title is pretty self explanatory. My dad has traumatized me with physical abuse and my mother has traumatized me with verbal abuse. Im still only 14 years old so i cant just separate myself from them. Im scared that in the last moments before i die i will realize that i shouldnt have committed suicide. But i dont want to alive but im to scared to die. I wish there was a way i could get myself away from what is making me like this but my parents think its just for attention but its not. Im posting this here because i WANT a happy life but i dont know how to get past this because it will at least take another 4-5 years before i get away from them. Im considering asking them to let me go to my schools boarding house but i doubt they will let me. I have 3 pet snakes so they wont let me leave them with the snakes. I think i should give them away because i dont hold them and their not getting a good life with me. My parents again wont let me do anything that would make my life simpler though... also my friends are fucking dicks so i cant talk to them about it. Please can someone tell me what to do. My parents think it will pass but unless they change or i leave it wont. They are too selfish to let me leave them because they think that they love me for who i am but the only reason they love me is because they have to atleast try convince me they do because parents kinda have to try. 
Please help
