I am nothing more than a number.Everyone has a number that they are associated with. 

The number of people with your gender, hair color, ethnicity, etc. 

Right now both me and the person reading this are associated with a number.

If I committed suicide, I would just be a number. All that would happen is the number of suicides this year would go up by 1. 

Nobody would wonder who I was, what my story was, or how I snapped.

They would just look at the whole number and say â€œThatâ€™s sad, what an epidemic.â€

It shows how fragile existence really is and how no one would remember me in 10 years after my suicide. 10 years... or even less. Thatâ€™s all it takes to be wiped away from the world.

Once the last thought about me is over Iâ€™m done and I donâ€™t exist anymore. 

It seems to already be that way while Iâ€™m alive.
