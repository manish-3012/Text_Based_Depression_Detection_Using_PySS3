I'm sorry i tried  everything but I cant take it any more I cant take this pressure any more I try anything, but this is the last drop guys I cant afford to go to university but my mom is thinking I'm going I cant tell her I just cant live with my self anymore I don't have any friends or anybody to ask for help I'm just invisible in this world even thought I had really great ideas for cancer but nobody wanted to listen to me because I'm dead.
I haven't slept for two years I cant live in constant pain everyday taking my pills and lying to everybody , I just want I job so I could have something to build but nobody wants to give me a chance I had plas but every plan I had fall apart , 
Every day I wish somebody shoot me, every day I wish some car just crash me or just a cancer or heart attack 
I', 21 years old living only with my mother and I don't have any family left this year I lost almost ever live relative I had .

it's just to much for me , I wish my big bro was still alive he would help me.
