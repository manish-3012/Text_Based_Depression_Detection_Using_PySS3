Everyone is against meI'm terrible everyone hates me. 

My dad used to beat me with a belt and yell at me and scream and I tried telling my mom and she didn't care and my sister made fun of me.

I was always bullied at school ever since 1st grade. Everyone in school laughed at me, everyone hated me, what's wrong with me? What did I do? Why am I like this? Nothing ever helps, no one ever takes anything I say seriously. I hate myself too.
