I need to vent, I don't want to worry anyone thoughhi everyone first of all I want to thank anyone who took the time to read this post, I also want to apologise for the formatting, I'm on my phone

I don't know how to start this, or even what I want to talk about but I need to vent and cry because I've gotten too good at holding in my emotions

I'm a 21 year old, I'm young, maybe too naive for my own good. I've struggled with mental illness for about half my life now and that's pretty huge considering I'm only 21. 

anyways, I feel like I've come to a standstill in my life. I don't really have anything going for me anymore. I dropped out of college at 19 I think? I can't remember. I'm currently jobless, I'm waiting for things to happen which have been dangling in front of my face for over a year now and just nothing is happening. 
I can't bring myself to do anything about it though, I've disintegrated into a sad ball of mush. My life isn't terrible by any means I think, I have a loving partner who takes care of me, but I always feel like such a dead weight, y'know? I can't contribute anything, no money, no education due to mental illness, I can't bring myself to leave the house during the day. 

i sit or lay in the same spots everyday, looking out the window wishing I could be more than I am. there's been a lot of tears lately. I've been in this mindset before but it always seems like th deepest darkest pit with no exit in sight.

do I want to kill myself? I don't know. I don't want to live, I know that. I don't have a plan. 
I cannot stop that voice inside of my head that is constantly saying "kill yourself" 
my first reaction to anything that upsets me(which is a lot) is kill yourself.

I feel the sadness, the numbness in my bones, in my chest. Its so hard to ignore.

I've gotten help before, I'm on antidepressants, antianxiety meds, ADHD meds it just seems to never do anything.

anyways, I needed to vaguely vent about myself. thanks for listening.
