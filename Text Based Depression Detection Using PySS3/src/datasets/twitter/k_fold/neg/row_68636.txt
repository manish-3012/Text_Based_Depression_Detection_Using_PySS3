Deep rooted cynicismI grew up learning that people are unreliable.

Family roots mean nothing when they understand nothing about you.

They tormented me so well that I'm fundamentally broken today. 

I'm so broken to the point that I still feel it to this day, and I don't know a perspective where I can undo this cynicism. 

I don't belong here. 

I won't ever belong anywhere.
