I've taken sedatives to be colder now and able to handle my situation to not end my life and just cry all the timeI am so sick I can't eat anymore and I can't sleep. I was at a psychiatry today and got some medicine/drug/sedative. First I took the recommended amount for my case but nothing happened. I just can't control my feelings at all. I don't know what to do. I took then half of what I'm supposed to be the max dosis for a day and now I'm still having a breakdown. It was supposed to stop me from ending my life and to get through these hard days after a break up with my ex partner. But now I'm sitting here crying again and planning to end it. I now took even more of it and I'm getting so tired typing this because of it. I can only take a few of it to reach the maximum dose for today... My feelings are overwhelming. 
I think the only solution left is to get myself into a clinic so I can go on with it right now. But don't want to call my best friend, the only one I could take that step with. She's busy with exams and sleeping and I can't be the one that makes it harder or impossible for her.
I clearly feel how I'm getting more tired and tired so maybe I can just do it one more night. I don't want to lose everything I had. But I already did and there's no chance it will be alright. I'm so sick like I never was I just want it to be over.
Please why can't someone tell me what to do? What can I hope or is it all over already? I think it is but then my life is over as well. Please someone help me I don't wanna die now I want another chance :(
