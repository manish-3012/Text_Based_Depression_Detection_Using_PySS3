In the best way I could, I tried. But it didn't workLast night was hard. Harder than the rest. I won't lie, all my feelings of death were enhanced when I saw that my eÃ—, my first and only love, have the time of his life with someone else. I was drunk and sure I wanted to die. So I told a friend and she was sad, but I reassured her I wasnt going to do anything. When I went home to my apartment, I took a handful of ibuprofen pills and went to sleep. I probably should have taken more because I'm awake typing this. I know it's stupid to think I could overdose on ibuprofen, but I didn't have anything else. I'm so disappointed that I woke up this morning and saw a text from me ex, essentially saying that he has been over me for almost a year and that he was happy now and he was over it. Him telling me to get over it. The reason I want to die isn't because of him. However, knowing that whatever feelings I felt of love were unrequited, just makes me wish I wasn't alive to see it. I wish it was my last message. I wish it worked somehow. I'm just so tired of living my life, but there's no real way to end it. I'm trapped. Every attempt gets me closer to my goal, but I'm too afraid to do it. Life is so tiring and I can't keep pretending to everyone that I plan on being alive next fall.
