Starting to CrackAfter keeping it together for a little while after dealing with some hard times, I'm starting to crack again. Yesterday I nearly broke down on the train to uni. Nights have been difficult and I'm feeling emotional. I'm not sure if anyone else is like this, but for me, I can usually keep myself together for a few months at a time. But after staying strong for so long, eventually something happens and I break, resulting in crying myself to sleep every night and entering a deep state of depression where I am my most suicidal. This lasts anywhere from a few days to weeks and is very hard to get out of alone. Sometimes breaking down helps, like recharging the batteries so I can go on functioning again. Recently everything is starting to get a bit much and I feel as if I'm at the verge of breaking. Does anyone have any advice?
