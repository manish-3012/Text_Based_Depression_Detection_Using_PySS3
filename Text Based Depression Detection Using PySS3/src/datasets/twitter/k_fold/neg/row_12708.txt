I can't even kill myselfI tried to hang myself. I put the rope up, around the rafter, and around my neck, but I couldn't jump off. What the fuck is wrong with me, I can't do anything right, not even arrange my own funeral. This is what I wanted, isn't it? For this to be over?

I don't want to be alone but that's my fate
