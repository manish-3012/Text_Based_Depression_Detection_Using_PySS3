AgainMade a plan again. This Sunday will be the last day I live. Last time I failed and I wish I could say that I now appreciate life, but in reality I just regret failing. I regret that first time, not letting go. I want to leave. Iâ€™ve asked three friends for help so far with no reply, and this time I know I wonâ€™t fail. I just wish someone cared about me, enough to take the time to be my friend. I feel so helpless and alone. I am ready for this to be over.
