Last-ditch effortI'm ready. Everything's in place. I still feel bad for my family, particularly my brother and youger cousins. But knowing my family dynamics they will be fed some rosy bullshit, at least until they can stomach the truth. I think they'll be okay. As for my brother, I hope he will understand. 

That being said, during these months of prepping, I caught myself thinking alot about trying one last thing. The thing that came closest to making me feel genuinely slightly better was my first experience with group therapy. Many years ago, I was very young and maybe that's why it worked better then. Later attempts to replicate that have been utter shit. My main problem is, many people in group therapy are victims. They're usually the sufferers never the cause of the suffering. Not only that doesn't help, it sometimes makes it worse. I think group therapy could maybe work for me if the other people involved had similar stories and carried unbearable guilt, instead of resentment or shame. 

The few times I trusted my therapists enough to ask them about finding a group like this I mentioned I'd even be interested in meeting people doing time for involuntary manslaughter. Suggesting that always makes them think I'm worse off than they thought. Lol. Every single time I've been told that that wouldn't be helpful because my situation is completely different. It is according to them and the law. To me, it's not. 

So if anyone reading this is in, or knows about online forums of any kind, discord servers or whatever, or even group therapy irl (travelling is not an issue) geared towards people like me, maybe dm me.
