Iâ€™m so ashamed of myselfHey everyone, 

I donâ€™t actually know where to startâ€¦ that seems silly, right? So Iâ€™m a single Mom of a 13 year old boy. I work two jobs, and still struggle with money. I decided to try and get a â€œsugar daddyâ€ from an online website that specialized. Iâ€™d never done anything like that before. I had honest true intentions for it, maybe just to make an extra hundred dollars because a guy wanted to see my in my underwear, or needed checked up on to feel appreciated, whatever. The long and the short of it was, I was scammed. I was overpaid by the guy, I thought it was a real mistake, I tried to get the money back to him via Western Union and it was a mistake. I should have known, and I didnâ€™t. I just assumed positive intent, that it was a mistake, and I would want my money back. After the money was received, they (he?) cancelled his deposits. 

Thereâ€™s nothing the be done about the lost money. My bank account is now $-3600 dollars. Iâ€™ve contacted my banks fraud department, shut down the account in case itâ€™s been compromised. I even stupidly tried to beg the guy via the number he gave me, probably a burner phone. I just laid it out that if he could just return the money, I wouldnâ€™t do anything; press chargers, anything. 

I feel so, so stupid. So stupid and incredibly worthless and ashamed. Iâ€™ve cried all day, called off work, havenâ€™t eaten, havenâ€™t slept. And obviously Iâ€™m here because I canâ€™t pretend that suicide isnâ€™t the contingency plan. I tried to do the right thing. I always try to do the right thing. Follow the golden rule and such. And it meant nothing. I work two jobs, donâ€™t have days off, and still canâ€™t get ahead with money. I tried to do something that, while I wouldnâ€™t talk about at dinner, still considered honest work. Provide companionship, conversation, pictures, in return for money from someone who knowingly signed up with that in mind. 

I hate myself right now. I hate that I canâ€™t stop ruminating on all this. I hate that I work so hard to not victim blame in my own life, but canâ€™t extend that courtesy to myself. Itâ€™s over and done, and I canâ€™t get the money back, but why would someone do this to anyone, let alone a broke, single Mom? I donâ€™t have anything now. No money except for whatâ€™s in my wallet. The food situation is fine. But gas? Rent? Iâ€™m working on trying to figure it out. But in the mean time it really seems like itâ€™s never going to get better. Itâ€™s never going to get easier.
