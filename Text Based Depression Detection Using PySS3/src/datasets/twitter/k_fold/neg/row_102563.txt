Drowning in Debt. About to be Evicted. Hate My Job.* I'm broke and drowning in debt and I've just gotten served with an eviction notice from my apartment asking me to appear in court. 

* I'm also in graduate school and didn't get any financial aid this semester (because i am only taking 1 'course' which is bullshit because this 1 'course' is a mandatory full time internship and is unpaid). This means I have to work full time at my internship and then come home and work part time at a second job which doesn't matter anyway because I still don't make enough money to really get by.

* I also hate the second job that I have to work.

* I'm exhausted every day. No friends because I have no time for friends right now. Just totally miserable and alone. Not in contact with any family.

* I just feel so hopeless right about now. It feels like i'm running out of options. I feel like I can't drop out of school because I only have a few months left.

* The sad thing is that this will all ratify itself by July or August of this year when I have graduated and am able to get a job (it's easy to get a job in my particularly career because there is a shortage), but I don't know if I can make it that long. 

* It's really funny because you always hear that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem and that's very true for me, but it feels like the only solution for me right now.

* I just don't know if I can make it.
