What exactly are "thoughts about suicide"? I always hear "if your having thoughts about suicide, get help or talk to some one, but what counts as that?
    Today was kind of a really bad day, to be truthful i was sobbing uncontrollably for hours. i finally composed my self a bit but i have thoughts about what it would be if i wasn't "here" anymore and if its worth going through this.
