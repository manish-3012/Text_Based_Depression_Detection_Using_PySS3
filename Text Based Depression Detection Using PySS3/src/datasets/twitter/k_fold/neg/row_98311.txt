My life is insignificant and I donâ€™t see a point in living a below average lifeI donâ€™t know where to begin so Iâ€™ll just try to explain why my life sucks and why I want to die.

I lost my dad when I was 3 and my mom when I was 7 or 8. Iâ€™ve lived in a foster family since I was 3 but they feel like strangers to me. Theyâ€™re always mad about something so I just try to avoid them as much as possible by staying in my room with the door closed. I used to be pretty close with my sister but now I canâ€™t stand her and she canâ€™t stand me(not in a sibling way, in a more serious way)
I never talked much with my brother so I donâ€™t really know him and I barely know the rest of the members in my family. I havenâ€™t had a friend in a really long time because I donâ€™t know how to make friends and my self esteem is very low. I talk to some people over the internet but itâ€™s just not as good as having real life friends.

Iâ€™m 18 years old and I feel like my best years are behind me. I used to have a good groups of friends but that group slowly fell apart and now Iâ€™m sitting here wishing I could go back to the way things were. Iâ€™m taking some kind of education to get a job that I really donâ€™t care about and if I continue living then my life will be below average and I just donâ€™t see how it could be worth living who knows how many years if nobody knows or cares about you, I just feel like my life is insignificant and worthless, Iâ€™ll never be really good at anything and nobody will ever remember me so whatâ€™s the point?

I was gonna hang myself when I got my own place but since I still live at â€œhomeâ€ Iâ€™d rather just buy some pills and take them right before I go to sleep some day this week and hopefully never wake up again
