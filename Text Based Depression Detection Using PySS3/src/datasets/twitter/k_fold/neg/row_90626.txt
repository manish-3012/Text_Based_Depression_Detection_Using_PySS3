I'm tired of being an animalI'm tired of being an animal. I'm tired of having constant needs, of being hungry, horny, thirsty, sleepy, bored, unfulfilled. Of trying to satiate these material needs with shallow, meaningless patchworks of food, mindless entertainment, water, porn, sleep, chores, chitchat - distraction. The needs are never fulfilled, never satisfied. They come back again and again, forcing me to toil and grind with no end in sight, except death.

I refuse to live like this. I have more dignity than to give myself false hope or illusory meaning when all evidence indicates that there is none. I have tried medication, therapy, psychedelic drugs, careerism, nihilism, hedonism - anything, ANYTHING that would give my life some sense of direction, purpose. None of it works. Now all I'm told to do is shut up and take it. And for what? There's no reward at the end, no meaning, no purpose. And I'm supposed to keep myself in denial for the next FIFTY YEARS? Just for my family's sake?

I know the only reason I'm here is because two random people decided to have me for their own selfish reasons. Sexual pleasure, genetic "legacy," tradition, illusory happiness, the cute baby years. They didn't have me for my own sake. I didn't originally exist for them to have me for my own sake. I only came into existence on their selfish whims. But now when I point this out, I am called ungrateful, abnormal, "wrong in the head." There's nothing left for me, and it's been this way for many years now. I have too much pride to wait until my body gives out. I refuse to be an animal. I refuse to be alive.
