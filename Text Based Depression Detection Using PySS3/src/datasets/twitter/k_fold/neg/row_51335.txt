I'm burning myself out.Currently, I'm going back to school to get my grade 12, and then I'm off to College to become a Paramedic through the most competitive Paramedic's course in Canada. 
I'm working full time and visiting my daughter on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and in September, I'll be going into school full time. Right now it's online. 
On top of that, I'm looking into Volunteering with St Johns Ambulance for a bit of Paramedic Training before College.  
On top of ALL of this, I'm breaking down. I got into my mom's house, picked up my daughter, held her and sobbed. 
I was woken up at 6am today by being pulled out of bed by my hair by the drunken mess that is my boyfriend. I blame myself, because I bought the alcohol for him, and I know he's a ticking time bomb when he's drunk. But I can't leave him. I love him so much, despite everything, and it hurts to think about him being with someone else. 
I'm at the end of my rope, and I don't know what to do.
