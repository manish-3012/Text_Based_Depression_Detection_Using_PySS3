Friend is missing and i'm terrifiedI feel so so shit right now.
Today was actually an okay day. The least bad day in a while but my friend has gone missing and is suicidal and I'm so so scared and now I just feel so so bad and I don't know what to do.

If she dies, that will be the second friend I've lost in less than 9 months (fuck it's 9 months tomorrow). I'm absolutely terrified.
I met her Thursday afternoon and she started feeling bad Thursday evening and it's all going to be my fault all over again.
I'm going to be the reason another friend has died.
And if she goes, then there's no way I'm sticking around.
I'm so scared of hurting people, but she's one of the people I'm most scared about impacting and if she's gone then there's not much stopping me apart from that bit of sanity, lodged deep inside of me, willing me to live.

I don't want to live.
I don't want to wake up tomorrow.
I don't want to have to go to college, to come home and attempt to do work that I have no interest in and that I have no care about.
I don't want to live my days sleeping and feeling exhausted and numb and detached from the world.

I want to be okay. I want to be normal. But tbat isn't going to happen anytime soon.

I hope I crash out soon so there's no chance of me heading out.


Please please be okay H, 
Please.
I love you so so much.
