I dont know whats wrong because nothing is wrongIâ€™ve go to therapy Iâ€™ve gotten medication I have a support group but it seems I keep falling into these holes in where I start thinking about it again today just nothing seemed to go right and itâ€™s not just today nothing seems to ever go right when Iâ€™m around Iâ€™m just a failure at everything school,work,my love life itâ€™s all just messed up because of me I stoped going to therapy for no reason I stoped taking my medication for no reason itâ€™s all my fault and like my partner says I need to stop just falling into these pits of self pity Iâ€™m just so done with it all today I look up ways to do it and I see all the prevention numbers and signs and I donâ€™t even care no more I just want a way out
