VentingI want to die. I feel broken. Even when i manage to resist some form of self harm I feel broken. 

My girlfriend is away at school and she can tell i'm not myself. And i know i'm not. But i don't know what's wrong. Im just fucking broken. 

I have friends. I guess. I don't know, but i know they don't notice when i'm not there. They don't notice when i am there either. One of them doesn't even know my name-- so that's how important i am. 

Every time i say i want to die people mention my friends and girlfriend. As if they'd be effected. my girlfriend isn't even here. She won't even let me go see her even though we went to school together, and i have the money for a 2 (or longer) visit during our reading week. My "friends," don't know my name. You really think the girl who doesn't want to see me, and the people who don't know my name, are gonna notice when i'm gone? Really? 

I need a few more thousand. Then i'll have enough saved to pay my parents back for the semester i wasted before i killed myself. 
I don't think i'll make it past finals.
