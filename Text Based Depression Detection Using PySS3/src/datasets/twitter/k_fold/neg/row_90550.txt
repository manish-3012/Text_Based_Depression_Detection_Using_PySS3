I lost everything.My fiancÃ©e left me 3 months ago. I got really depressed and everything went down with it. 

I used to run a manufacturing business back then. I took a 2 week vacation to try and fix myself. When I got back, I learned that my partners, who used to be really close friends pretty much betrayed me. They cut me off and started with their own products. I can't really blame them. I shouldn't have let personal matters affect my business responsibilities. 


My family just keeps on pressuring me to find a way to fix all of this and get back to where I was instead of just being there for me.

I haven't eaten a proper meal in 3 weeks. I'm about to go homeless and over 50k in debt. I'm absolutely sure that I cannot recover from this.

Everyone gave up on me. I think it is about time I give up on myself.
