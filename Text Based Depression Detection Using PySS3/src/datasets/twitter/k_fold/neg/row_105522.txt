I'm so lonelyMy best friend got with the girl I liked. Me and the girl had a lot in common. It could be me spending every night with her, but in stead its him. I don't want to say anything because they seem happy together, and he's said stuff to me in the past that makes me realise that he didn't even know that I liked her. I've been crying myself to sleep for months and I'm tired. I'm tired of being sad and lonely, everyone would be sad about my death, but they would eventually be able to move on. I don't have any more purpose in this world. I haven't been happy in a while. Killing myself would give me peace
