I Can't Keep Doing ThisI'm trying my best to find a reason to keep living - a reason to hope. But...I can't keep living like this. 

I feel like an absolute failure. All my close friends are married, having kids, and are years into their careers while I'm floundering aroand and unable to make things work. I'm not lovable - and I'm not just talking about romantically. I don't have any redeemable qualities; I know everyone else's lives would be better if I died. It's embarrassing to feel this way, too, since I've always identified as a Christian...but now I don't know if God even cares. I feel ashamed of being religious, and I feel ashamed of my doubts. I just...I feel like I'm a fuck up no mattet what I do.

I absolutely hate who I am and really want to kill myself. I fantasize about various methods constantly. I know my life won't get any better. i don't have any hope for myself. I just wish I had someone who'd help me end my life since I'm too much of a coward to end it all. I wish my friends understood how soul crushing it is to live a life that will never have meaning. 

I didn't ask to be alive.
