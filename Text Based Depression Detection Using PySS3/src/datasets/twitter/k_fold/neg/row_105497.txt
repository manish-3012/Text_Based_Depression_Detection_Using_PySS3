I don't know what to do anymore.Hello,

I'm 14 years old and people just don't understand me. I'm looking for help for my depression over 2 years. My teacher said to my that I've to wait long to get help. Someone said to me that I'm bitching about my depression and my mom said that I've to try suicide. I've a personality disorder. I'm overly emotional and sometimes I can act very strange. I can get fast mad or irritated. a collaborator from a psychosical establisment said that I've brain damage from my childhood and experiences with life. I have nothing to do in my life. I've tried do play an instrument but I play 6 months and the strings are broke and guitar is damaged and I can't play nothing. I just wanted something for myself to have a goal in my life but I'm so bad at everything. Sorry for wasting your time, reading about someone who's bitching about everything in his life (Me). I've huge scars of trying suicide on my left arm. My mom is ashamed of my because I'm her failed son who isn't smart or have any talent and just fucked up his school and is fat. I'm so worthless. No one is gonna care about this post but I don't care.
