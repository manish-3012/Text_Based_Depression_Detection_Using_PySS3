I wish there was a buttonA button I could press to do a fee things, make my death instant and painless, make all my debts, issues, and past fuckups go away, and finally to clear the mind of all the people that care. I get really upset and sad when I hear someone took they're own life because I feel that pain, I understand it, and they're family is so sad and they're friends are so sad like I just wanna repaint my ceiling red I don't want anyone to be sad from it. I just want to fucking die. fuck. I don't want help, I had therapy for years, I take my anti depressants every morning fuck I even joined a gaming clan but depression still comes  it comes and it steals my happiness, rips away the last little bit I hold on to, clutching it and sobbing, begging for it not to take it away but it does, ruthlessly, telling me I'm worthless, human garbage and I should just stop wasting everyone's time. Stop trying to make friends. Stop trying to be happy. Just out a gun to your head and keep pulling the trigger till I can't anymore. Fuck I'm crying and shit god damn it. Fuck. FUCK why does it gonna hurt so much, why does it hurt more than when I cut my leg on piece of rebar. I guess pain you can escape with drugs and bandages but I still haven't found any drugs or bandages that fucking help me GOD JUST FUCKING KILL ME. Sigh. I breath. Let the numbness of my pain sink in deep so I can sleep. It just hurts, everything does. My cat is laying next to me purring and I haven't even touched her yet..maybe it's a sign I don't have to kill myself. Maybe I'm just sleep deprived and suicidal, heh, usual night I guess. God it's gonna be bad when I can buy liquor. Alright, I'mma sleep. Breakdown's over but I'm sure I'll be back on this sub within the week.
