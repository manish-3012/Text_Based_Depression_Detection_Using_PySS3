Anyone out there..Its getting worse everyday, I'm thinking about suicide every waking moment now and I've lost any motivation to go to work, drive, socialize. I'm here as a last resort cause I've exhausted all my options in terms of getting help. I get the same bs from the same counselors I've been seeing and they clearly have 0 life experience to even weigh in on certain issues since its plagued with self-entitled mid 20-30 year olds where I live and it's always so dry and frustrating when you talk to them and all you get is "yeah", or "hmmm". I feel like I could do a better job fuck sake. I've become completley discouraged how people are becoming more selfish each day, and the ones who would give their own clothes off their back to help others are the ones who get taken advantage of. I just need someone who understands or is going though what I am... anyone.
