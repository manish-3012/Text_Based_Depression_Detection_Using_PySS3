I've told my friend IRL i'll kill myself, he was almost crying and i've felt really greatIt was weird. I don't usually enjoy people crying, but this time i did, and i felt completely capable of kill myself.
Since two months ago, (literally) every day i think about my death, and since at least 5 years, i often have suicidal thoughts. My life is pretty ruined at this point.
