Completely burnt out and not even in my 20â€™s yet.I feel like Iâ€™m going through a mid life crisis already. I truly donâ€™t know what to do with myself, Iâ€™ve lived my whole life worthless and somehow have even managed to make myself even more so over the years - Iâ€™m an irredeemable person, because I know no matter how bad I get Iâ€™ll never be able to even attempt to help myself. Better to die young worthless than grow old so.
