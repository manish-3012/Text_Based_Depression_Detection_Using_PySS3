something slightly positive :)Yesterday I was fully prepared to end it. It was 4:46am I had cycled from my house to the bridge 5 minutes away from me. I sat on the edge of that bridge and as I looked down at the water below I thought of all the people I'd leave behind. I thought of all the things I'd miss out on if I just.. jumped. The sun was coming up and the sky was clear for once. I realised I didn't wanna kill myself yet, I realised I could still maybe find more happy moments so I got down and watched the sunrise from a bench at the end of the bridge. it was truly a beautiful sunrise and sunrises will always hold a special place in my heart, for reminding me that there is still beauty in this cruel world. 

Once I got back I had a pot noodle and a fat slice of cake, it was the happiest I'd felt in a while. I hope I don't ever get back on that bridge. 

If anyone wants to talk I'm here :)
