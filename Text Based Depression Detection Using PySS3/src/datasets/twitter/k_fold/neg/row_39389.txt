I thought I was going up.Two weeks ago, I told my therapist that things were getting better. I thought I was seeing color in the world, and for the first time in years, I was going somewhere.   
  
But you never get to stay happy, right?   
  
It's been five years of instability - constantly bouncing around. Losing houses, hospital bills piling up, and jobs that couldn't support even the cheapest rent that I could find. I wanted to do better for myself. I saved up money and started school. I worked so hard. I was the best student in my class. This was my dream job, and I wanted to change people's lives... That came crashing down last week when I had to quit.   
  
I just don't see how I'm supposed to continue. I thought I was past all this. I hate the idea of an easy way out, but why bother to keep going if I'm *never* going to be okay? If I'll never know stability, what's the point? Why continue if I'm only destined to struggle?   
  
I just want to give up.   
  
I can't call my therapist. They don't have an after hours number. The recording just says to call 911 if it's an emergency, but for what?! They'll just take me somewhere and rack up more bills that I can't afford and worsen the problem. 
  
There's literally no winning. 
  
I just can't win.
