I don't belong anywherenothing ever helps. i try to go to my friends and they either say shit that doesn't help anyone or they just stop replying. I don't fit in anywhere or with anyone. Nobody cares enough to help me through tough times which just makes it worse for me. My friends don't help. My private instagram doesn't help. Nobody cares about me or wants to be around me. I'll never be truly happy so I should just end everything.
