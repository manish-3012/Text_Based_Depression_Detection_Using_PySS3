Why am I feeling this wayI want to kill myself. Things have gotten so bad even though I feel as if they shouldnâ€™t. So much has happened to me in the last couple of months that itâ€™s overwhelming and I feel alone. My anxiety is eating me alive. Iâ€™m currently on Wellbutrin and buspar. Both seemed to be helping but the past two weeks have been hell for me. 
I donâ€™t know what to do. I have one more semester before I graduate university but I really donâ€™t want to finish. My life is not hard. Iâ€™m very privileged and yet I hate my life so fucking much. This causes me guilt because I have everything I could ever want. 
Iâ€™m so lost and scared
