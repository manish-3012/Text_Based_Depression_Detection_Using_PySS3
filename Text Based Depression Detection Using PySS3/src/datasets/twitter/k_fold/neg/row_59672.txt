give me a signiâ€™m honestly considering ending it all tonight. i have never felt so alone in my entire life. i lost my nan a month and a half ago &amp; the grief is unbearable. my nan is my best friend and i love her so much,, iâ€™ve always said that if she ever passed i would kill myself but i wasnâ€™t expecting it to be so soon. iâ€™m trying to stay strong for my grandad but i really donâ€™t think i can do this. iâ€™m trying to be positive abt the future but all i can think is my nan isnâ€™t in it. i just feel so trapped inside my head &amp; i feel the only way i can escape is if i end it. iâ€™ve been suicidal before &amp; the only way i got better was from the support my nan gave me n now sheâ€™s not here i just canâ€™t deal with it. i want to die so badly &amp; i doubt iâ€™ll even see my nan again but the thought of nothingness for all eternity is so calming to me that i think i should just do it. even if i donâ€™t see her again, my ashes could be put near my nanâ€™s ashes and i would be with her in this world. iâ€™m so sick and tired of this now. i have other reasons for wanting to end it but thatâ€™s the main one so idk. i donâ€™t even know what iâ€™m looking for here &amp; i donâ€™t want you all to be like â€˜your nan wouldnâ€™t want you toâ€™ bc sheâ€™s not here so sheâ€™ll never know. god i sound so selfish. i just want to die. 
none of friends or family seem to care, iâ€™ve been dropping hints since may &amp; iâ€™ve said it outright multiple times so whatâ€™s the point in continuing existing if i donâ€™t want to anymore and no one seems to care whether i live or die.
