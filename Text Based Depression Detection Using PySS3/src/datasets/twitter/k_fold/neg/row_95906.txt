How do I know when I need THAT helpIâ€™ve never done this but I think it has to happen

At what point does someone check into a mental hospital? And can you in this climate? Whereâ€™s the line of â€œno itâ€™s not neededâ€ and â€œyes, goâ€. I have so many awful intrusive thoughts recently and Iâ€™m trusting myself less every day I just donâ€™t know how to say things without sounding like a psycho or needing to be put away for a while. And Iâ€™m considering seeking a stay at the mental hospital but covid is covid so like.... is it available? Is it safe? 

Iâ€™m having the kinds of thoughts that gets people put away. Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™m not saying that right or sensitively. But Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to act on one of these thoughts one day and .... 

Anyway. I donâ€™t want to write them out. 

But they are scary. 

Iâ€™m scared. And I donâ€™t know how to say why without just saying my thoughts. Which are awful. Awful. More than just suicide.
