Happy Fucking BirthdayToday's my 18th birthday. I'm supposed to be excited right? I'm supposed to be happy? Exactly one year ago I remember being the happiest guy in the world. I'd just had the best week of my life, camping and hiking in Cyprus with the girl I loved more than anything. It's funny to see how in one year I went from being on top of the world, to some angry, depressed, suicidal, mentally unstable guy. It's just interesting so I figured I'd share.
