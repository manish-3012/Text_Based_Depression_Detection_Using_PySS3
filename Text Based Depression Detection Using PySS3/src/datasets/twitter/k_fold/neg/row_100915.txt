I feel myself getting closer to the edgeI don't even know how to start this but I am so desperate for some semblance of hope because I have felt that mine is all gone away. I have major depression and I haven't been on my medication now for almost six months and I don't really have access to it because I'm on a contract at my current job and can't find a provider. I know that I want to die and every part of me screams that. Tonight I was making myself dinner and I put a chefs knife to my throat and felt a sense of relief. I don't know where to even start. I have no parents or really any family .. well that's not true I live with my aunt and uncle but I have only met them last year and I'm 28. At my age most people are a lot better off than me but I will cut myself some slack in the sense that I have been homeless since I was around 21, I would live in a place for a few months but eventually lose my job because I couldn't get to it or even buy food. I had an apartment with my biological mother who wasn't in my life until I was 20, and I had never met her, found out she had a drug addiction because she was doing drugs in our house and she got me evicted. My life honestly has been hell ever since, I haven't recovered from that nearly 7 years later. I used to hide in relationships and I think that I ruined every single one that I was in. My last one I can't seem to figure out why I miss her so much because she cheated on me and gave me herpes. Now the one person that I did love and wanted to make it work out with, well because I we both had herpes, doesn't even want me. I'm out of shape and I hate looking in the mirror and I moved to a new city for a job that is on contract in the hopes that I could get full time and now I don't even know. I honestly just have no hope. More than anything in the world I just wanted to be in love and have someone that I could trust and feel safe with for once in my life and now I have figured out that I am too weak even for that. I'm not really good at anything because my brain becomes easily overwhelmed. Now that I am tainted I don't think I will ever find love because even before that what are the odds that you will find someone that you can be best friends with and be attracted to for the rest of your life, I feel that I have been tricked that this notion of love is simply a sham since most marriages end in divorce and people cheat and hurt anyways. What am I living for ? to be a slave for the rest of my life to a job or just simply to rot here until natural causes overcome me.. I dont know. I just wish that some of the people who claim that they care about me would check up on me. I wish that I could stop thinking about her even after all the times she hurt me, that I still didn't miss her this damn much. I wish that I wasn't so weak and that life gave me a break for once, All I god damn want is to just have love and feel safe for once in my life and I feel so far from that. I don't know how to save myself anymore or even give me hope. I can't even laugh anymore. I tried to google funny things and watch funny videos with a lot of views and it just had no effect on me. I know that I'm not doing well but I think that I just don't care anymore. I'm just waiting to build up enough courage to end it, or I'll just wit around waiting for something good to happen because I'm too weak. Probably just the latter. I can't see hope right now , but I'm hoping that someone can help me see some from this darkness that surrounds me
