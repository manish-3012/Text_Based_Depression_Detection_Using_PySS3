Why shouldn't I end it already?I'm just sick of living. My peers make fun of me, I'm falling behind in school. I need a reason to live. I've hurt others without realizing, and I deserve pain for that. My family is telling me to mill myself, so why shouldn't I? I hated living before they were so judgemental and they made it worse.

I already made my plan, it's just of matter of executing it.
