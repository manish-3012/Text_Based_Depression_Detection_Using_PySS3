This was never fun, I just did what people told me to do and went through the motions every dayI've tried just about everything to make my depression and OCD go away, including therapy and medication. I'm not actively suicidal at this very moment. However, I will seriously consider it when my dog passes and when my favorite manga ends. 

Literally every weekend I stress about wanting to do something "fun", but all the fun things I like to do are either too expensive or something my body can no longer tolerate. I used to be pretty athletic, but a brain injury from a violent attack forced me to be sedentary. Not to mention I live in a really populated city, and everything interesting is at least 2 hours away one way. 

Usually I'll end up spending the whole day just playing video games because that's all I can do. Then I feel that I wasted my day off. 

I thought that a new career would make me happy, but no. Hanging out with my dog was the only times where I was truly happy. She's old now. I will not die yet because my dog will be sad, but as soon as my reasons to live are no longer available, I'm not interested in hanging around. 

To be honest, if making a livable wage wasn't so hard, I'd probably consider living. But you have to fight tooth and nail just to get a job with a cunt boss and live paycheck to paycheck. 

This is no way to live, guys. I'm just a corpse that can walk and talk.
