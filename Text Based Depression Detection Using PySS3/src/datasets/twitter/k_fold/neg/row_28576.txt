I just paid a stranger on fiverr to record me a message saying they love me and to not give upI feel so fucking pathetic and worthless and unloveable. I dragged some random person in to my shitty life. I shouldn't have asked them. I'm so fucking worthless that I can't find someone to love me and mean it and I have to pay someone and it's so fucking selfish to drag them in.

Please don't throw me away any more after taking what you can from me. Please stop telling me that you'll never be like the others from my past and then preying on my brokenness to get what you want before doing worse than what they did. Please. Please stop using me and throwing me away so humiliatingly. Please. I'm a person too. I can only take so much. I'm a person too. Please. I can't do this anymore.
