I think my mum hates meShe said i hurt her feelings everyday. I don't know what to do. Everything I do and say isn't enough for her. One time she said sarcastically "Why did I have such great children?" And it hurt me. I feel like she'd be happier and I'd be less miserable if I just died. I'm sick of hurting her and my dad. I don't want to be a disappointment anymore.
