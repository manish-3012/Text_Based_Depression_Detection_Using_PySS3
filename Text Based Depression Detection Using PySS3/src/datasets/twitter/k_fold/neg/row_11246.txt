iâ€™ll be dead by the end of the weeki have an appointment with another school shrink soon and idk how clear i can make it that talking isnâ€™t what i need. iâ€™ve spoken to 4 different teachers/councilors/doctors at my school and they have all known about my past suicidal thoughts and self harm and yet continue to refer me to yet another therapist insisting that talking about will help. 
i need medication or hospitalization not talking about my problems. 
i canâ€™t help but lie when talking to professionals bc i donâ€™t know these people. i have no problem telling them i hurt myself and have severe depression or anxiety but i can force myself to answer their personal questions. i am always asked about my sexuality like itâ€™s why iâ€™m depressed when iâ€™m confident in who i love. 
i really am fortunate in the fact that i have no reason to be depressed. no abuse or trauma. iâ€™m just fucking depressed. they canâ€™t get me the help i need. 
the only other option available to me to stop hurting is to kill myself. iâ€™ve known this for a while. i guess nows just the right time.
