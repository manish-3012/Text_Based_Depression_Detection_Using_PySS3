Can't see the point anymoreIt's all bullshit. There's no point to anything anymore. Work to pay bills. Work work work. Jobs we hate that make us miserable. No time together the 3 of us because either of us is at work. Time we do get to spend together is miserable because I have a mental illness. I've clearly passed some of that on to my son.

 No family other than us that give two shits. No date nights, no family outings. Other than out to a meal spent in silence.

All the bills. No matter how much you make its never enough. The more you make the more they take. We make just enough that we're not in poverty, and not quite enough to do anything useful with other than sustain. 

I see no beauty in life. It's not a happy marriage. We are not a happy family. I don't want my kid to grow up alone. He has no one other than his dad and me. He has a grandma that lives 25 minutes away but will never has never driven here once or anywhere to see him and if we are lucky she takes him overnight once every few months. An uncle less than 10 minutes away that has been there a lot but rarely comes to visit his nephew and plans on moving out of state at the end of the year anyway. 

My family is why I have mental illness. My kid has 2 cousins and they barely know each others names or that they are related. 

I worry that I'm passing my mental illness to my kid? He'll grow up all alone and feel worse than i do. I don't want that.
This is shit.

Why do we bother? Why do I bother? Everything is meaningless. We're not even happy together. My husband doesn't even ,like the 3 of us together because he says I cause our son to act out a lot more. 

I want all three of us to die. I can't live like this, I can't leave my kid like that and if only my husband was left he'd probably just kill himself anyway too. 

I don't know. I'm stupid. Everything I think is stupid. I'm crazy and no one listens to me anyway.
