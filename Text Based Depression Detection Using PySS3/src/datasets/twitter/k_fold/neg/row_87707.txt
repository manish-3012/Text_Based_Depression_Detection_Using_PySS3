I'm not suicidal, but I'm sobbing and need a virtual hug and I am picking to cry vs cut. I don't know where else to post this.I'm drunk so all of this is my fault first. Second I went on Facebook and saw one of my Mom's friends talk about how to excited she was about surviving stomach cancer years and years ago. My mom died in 1999 leaving me behind with my father who sexual and psychotically abused me. I didn't have a home in my teen years. I thought I was unlovable... I still struggle with the ptsd and depression.
