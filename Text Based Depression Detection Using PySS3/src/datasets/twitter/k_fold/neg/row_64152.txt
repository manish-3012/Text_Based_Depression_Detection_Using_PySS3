Can Anyone Find Out About Me Calling A HotlineI think about doing it every day now, but if my mom found out she'd probably go crazy. She works at a place for behavioral health and tells me almost every day how shes glad I'm not like the other kids. If she saw any of my self harm scars or knew I was doing this she would most likely kill me. Along with this I'm still in school so I dont wish for them to contact the school either so would they be able to track me or would the suicide hotline number go on a phone bill.
