The Family DisappointmentI lost my papaw to suicide 12 years ago. He was my rock and my best friend. My motherâ€™s side of the family did nothing to help. I fell into a deep depression riddled with anxiety. I cut myself to cope. My mom caught me and I tried to explain that I thought I was bipolar (nope just depressed and anxious) and instead of getting me help she grounded me. Life has had its ups and downs since, but this year has been especially hard. Iâ€™ve been trying, but today my grandmother reminded me that I am indeed the family disappointment. I didnâ€™t go to college, Iâ€™m not successful, I make everyone worry. Our parting words were â€œI just donâ€™t see you getting far in lifeâ€ and â€œyeah, me neither thatâ€™s why I keep a bottle of pills at the ready.â€ Iâ€™m so tired of disappointing everyone. Iâ€™m so tired of them pointing out my flaws that Iâ€™m already well aware of. I want to cut them all out of my life so badly, but then Iâ€™m left with basically no one. Whatâ€™s better? A less than supportive family or no one at all?
