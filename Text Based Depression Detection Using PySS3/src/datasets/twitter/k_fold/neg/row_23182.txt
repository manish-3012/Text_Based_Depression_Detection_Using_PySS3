Need counselingIâ€™ve never truly expressed this to anyone, and finding â€œhelpâ€ or people to talk to with where Iâ€™m at in life just seems impossible to me. Iâ€™m 17 years old to start.

My parents are both alcoholics and have been emotionally and physically abusive towards me for years. I have my outlets, and I go off and clear my mind when need be, but at the end of the day, i have to be with them. 

Iâ€™m just really struggling to find a purpose with my life, I couldnâ€™t possibly fathom killing myself. I donâ€™t want to die, I just want to stop living. I donâ€™t know what I need, i donâ€™t even know what I want. I just want this feeling of pain, loneliness, and empty feeling to end
