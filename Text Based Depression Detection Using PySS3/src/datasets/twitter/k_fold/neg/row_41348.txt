I have a plan ready, should I be hospitalised?I came up with a plan yesterday. I've suffered depression since I was 8 and I've experienced great psychological stress every waking moment of my life. However, part of me wants to live. At the moment I'm on 40mg of fluoxetine and it's starting to lose efficacy.
