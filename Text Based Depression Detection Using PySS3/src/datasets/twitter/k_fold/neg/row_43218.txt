Ready to GoI'm absolutely ready to get the hell off this rock. This isn't me being all Emo and down on myself. This is me saying that there is dick-all to stay around for! I hate the way people are toward each other. I hate fake people. I hate you can't even talk to people anymore because they have their face in their phone all the damned time! I'm tired off all this. I go to bed hoping that this will be the time that I just don't wake up.
