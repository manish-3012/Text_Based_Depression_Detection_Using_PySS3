Nothing to lose. It's over.I dropped out of colleg. Even though it was free i don't know what my life purpose and can't think of anything which interests me except may be few things. I am diagnosed with depression, possibly autistic (have hand flappping, make noises). I don't have any plans for my life. I don't even want to die and don't feel anything. Life just passes by. I was socially isolated for 5 years. I am 24 and had sex only 2 times. I have erectile disfunction and other health problems. I can't even go to the gym. Tried drugs but realised i cannot run from myself. I worked only 3 months in my entire life. I have social anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder, paranoia, anger outbursts and breaks from reality when i feel like i am captain of a ship and talk with myself like an idiot. I hate the core of myself. I hate everything about this world. I know that possibly after death it will be even more bad, so try to stay there for a little bit and see what happens.
