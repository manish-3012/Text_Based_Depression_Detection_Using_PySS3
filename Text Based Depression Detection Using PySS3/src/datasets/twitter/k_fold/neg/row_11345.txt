I want to do it SOOOO bad!But Iâ€™m also scared to do it. Iâ€™ve always said I donâ€™t want to kill myself I just want to stop waking up every morning  but as my luck would have it I keep waking up! I truly believe that we all have a purpose in life and I think my purpose is to be punching bag for everyone else and I canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™ve tried to get help in the past. Iâ€™ve gone to the hospital in the midst of a very bad depressive episode and there idea of help was to give me an Ativan and have a lady talk to me for about 5 minutes telling me I need to be more proactive to not be depressed. She literally told me to go for walks and be mindful, if it were that easy no one would be depressed. And then sent me home. Iâ€™m tempted to take a handful of something just to be taken seriously. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I just want my pain to stop or my life.  Iâ€™m 34/f if that matters at all.
