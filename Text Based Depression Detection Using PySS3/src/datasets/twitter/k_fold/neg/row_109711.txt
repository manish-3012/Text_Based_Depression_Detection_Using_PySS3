Academic pressure has worsened years of depression and therapy isn't working, life seems totally pointless and I honestly wish I would die. Suicidal ideations are constant.I live in South Australia and am in year 12 (final year of high-school). I just got my school report back and I failed 2 out of my 5 subjects. 

I came close to suicide around 7 months ago, I was in a bathtub with something electrical. I didn't kill myself in the end and asked some chick out the next day. She rejected me. Before this all happened I was on prozac and scheduled to see a psychiatrist.

I go to the psychiatrist and he diagnoses me with borderline pd along  with some other cluster B disorders. I go off the prozac. I go to the psychiatrist once a week as he is also a psychotherapist. I have been going frequently for the past 6 months. I haven't missed an appointment. He's complete shit. I hate the cunt. I haven't gotten any better, in fact I feel worse. 

Lately at school my research project (bullshit subject that South Australia has condemned it's poor and unfortunate students to) has been treating me like shit. A rumour that I was dealing lsd got me suspended for a week and ever since he's been treating me like complete shit. 

He forced me to change my already approved research project topic (the first topic was approved by him and others and concerned the legalisation of psychedelics for therapy). Now instead of the normal 4 months that students have to work on part one of the project I had 4 weeks. If I wanted my work drafted I had to do it in 3 weeks.

Now he calls my parents in because he is upset with the quality of my work. They defend me. They are on my side and are supporting me now (initially they didn't). 

This report has made me feel like shit. I want to be study medicine and eventually become a psychiatrist. It goes without saying that I need good grades for that. Yes there are alternative means which would grant me admission into med school but they feel like such a hassle. 

Every night I cannot sleep and always cry when I am alone with my thoughts. I do have hobbies. I run and kickbox but they do help with the sadness or anger. I hate my research project teacher so much. I hate him. I cannot fucking stand him. Having to obey him and respect him kills me. 

I am not at school currently, all South Australian students have 2 weeks off now, 1 week till I am back school. I do have some advocates at school but still it all feels so bleak. 

I used to take many drugs, I have stopped recently. I am going to a new psychiatrist sometime soon, I'm just waiting on an appointment. Fuck despite all of this I am crying as I write this wall of text. I feel like I have nothing, I feel stupid, weak, ugly and pathetic. I don't see why anyone would want to help me, I'm worthy of loathing. I'm just disgusting and selfish. Every single birthday I have I cry. The last one was no different.

I don't know what to do I can't stop picking at my arms and creating scabs and occasionally burning them. What can I do? Sorry for the wall of text, I just can't stop feeling sad.
