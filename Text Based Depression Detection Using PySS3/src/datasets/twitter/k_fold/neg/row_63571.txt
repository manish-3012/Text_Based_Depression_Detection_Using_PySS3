I've made my decision.The past few days have been horrible. It seems that everyobe around me hates me and has given up. If today doesn't get any better, I'm going to down some pills and end it all. Nobody in my life seems to care. Not even anyone here seems to care. My post last night was ignored. I've already said goodbye to my girlfriend and her family. She deserves better than me. I hope she finds them soon.
