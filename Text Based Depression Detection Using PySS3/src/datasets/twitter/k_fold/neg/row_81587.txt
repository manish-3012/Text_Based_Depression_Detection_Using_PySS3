I'm just scaredI cut myself again tonight, and the numb reprieve I got didn't last nearly as long as it has before.  I don't know if I'd be able to off myself, I don't have plans to, but I just really don't want to exist anymore. My life is in absolute shambles and I can't see the light at the end of any tunnel. And I dug all of them.
