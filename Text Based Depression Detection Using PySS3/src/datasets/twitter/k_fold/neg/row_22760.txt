I have nothing.Male25, Iâ€™ve tried killing my self once before (obviously failed). And Iâ€™m thinking of doing it again.  FiancÃ© of 3 years cheated on me (had a kid) so I left her and moved another state away back to my hometown.. I have no friends here; the only contacts in my phone is â€œmomâ€ literally.. I have had no luck getting a job and have had my car repossessed, and only have about 50bucks left..my mom and dad are getting a divorce, I have no siblings, Iâ€™ve been on one date since Iâ€™ve been back (using a dating app) but she didnâ€™t want a relationship and Iâ€™ve had no luck with those apps (one girl told me to kill my ugly self simply for me saying â€œHey how are youâ€).. I feel like I have nothing, and will never have anything, after losing my fiancÃ© and kid Iâ€™ve become much colder, I canâ€™t go out in public without feeling really self conscious, and sweating from anxiety so I usually just end up coming back home.. Sitting inside, walking around the park.. I did go shopping and got some new clothes but someone messaged me in the town next town over saying it was the wrong colors and if they caught me in their town wearing those Iâ€™d be beat or killed.. Fuck it, I have nothing and I donâ€™t see a way out
