Shotgun QuestionWhich would be better for this case, when pointing through the mouth towards the brain stem - a 410 shotgun with birdshot, or a 44 caliber H&amp;R shotgun? I feel the 44 has more of a punch, but the shell of the other one has a bit more of a diameter to it and i'd hate to put a smaller hole and just end up in pain the whole time. I wish I could find where the 12 gauge shells went, but my license expired so I can't go buy any new ones.
