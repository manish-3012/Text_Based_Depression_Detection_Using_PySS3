Death is scary. But staying alive each second is more.Hello...

I'll try to make this as short as I can because there is countless data to take into account to understand why I do this.

I am an abused a child (by my own *parents*), who will soon turn 27 but it seems I'll need my childhood back forever.

I thought I could overcome this trauma by starting my own family, but there is no way this can be.

I feel like there is no person that corresponds to my standards, which come from my culture, a bit different than the usual "Western" culture of today. But people from my culture judge me as well because I have "Western" beliefs. This cultural gap on both sides has been a definitive barrier to any serious relationship with all the guys I tried to meet. And it's difficult to meet new people in the place I am (no parks, libraries, cafes etc), in addition to the social anxiety most youth are facing (including me) and that keeps them home with a phone or a computer.

It has been years and years I have exactly **0 friend**. Sure, I did in the past, but school days are over, and although I get along easily with people, there's no way to make our private lives cross. Never.

I have been diagnosed with severe depression since 2013, admitted to hospital twice, and took a medical treatment since, that I have stopped recently (with my doctor's consent). Many times, there has been "hope" and that's what I told the doctor last time. Since then, I have realized that all hope is false, and any medication stopped working, so I am just being my natural self and preparing to end it after planning it almost one year ago. I planned it after being bullied on an internet community, and after trying another one today it's the same result. Nobody accepts people who are different. Or, at least, nobody accepts me. In real life it's not better: I have been fired twice for racist reasons, and although I have a satisfying job today and the family side is better, it's far from providing happiness.

In short, I have major identity issues (a mix with religion, geography, family and culture - *any detail in PM*) and no one (zero - 0) who can understand **and** be supportive **and** be close enough to me to find a solution (it doesn't exist anyway, and it's too late). Everyone leaves, and anything you'll say won't convince me. I have left social media for weeks, and among all the people who know I'm suicidal (**dozens**), no one reacted. I know I should live for myself and not others, but try it yourself a single day first. I used to have several hobbies to entertain myself but stopped feeling any interest in them in recent months.

I know that people who post this kind of thing are (called) attention seekers and I don't pretend to be different. I definitely need attention, so that I can see people's reactions and am sure I have tried everything I could and leave in peace. Due to technical reasons, my next attempt may not be a success. I will still see if it's possible.

Time to write the goodbye letter, which main topic will not be about me but the urgent need to prevent/stop child abuse, which takes lives as I will hopefully prove. Thanks for reading. If you feel like replying, please do: Despite being alone, I am a talkative person and love exchanging thoughts.

Take good care of yourselves.
