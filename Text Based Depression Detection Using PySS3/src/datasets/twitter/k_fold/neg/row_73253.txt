I saw a cliff near my houseThis is a cross post from the FA sub.

I just want to jump and get it over with. I know nobody actually cares about me. Apparently my "anger issues" make me undesirable to talk to even on here. There is no help out there. They are only people who think telling me to do things I've tried will "help" despite the "definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over." When you know that nobody cares about you, and people seem to take "joy" in my suffering, what's the point of living? I'm surprised I haven't gotten a pm telling me to "kill myself" because I'm a "red pill misogynist" since I apparently am a piece of shit to them. I sat outside tonight drinking, watching couples walk by and realized how pathetic I am. I watched an attractive woman who lives in the apartment above me wait for a ride from her friends to go out. They showed up and she got in to I'm sure to have fun. I fucking hate my existence and certain posters here remind me why.

People tell you to call those "suicide hotlines" but do you actually think they care about you? You are just another caller to them. At the end of the day, they go home to their normal lives while we continue to suffer.
