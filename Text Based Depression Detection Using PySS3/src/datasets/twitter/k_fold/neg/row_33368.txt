2020 may be itI canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™m probably going to lose my scholarship and then the support from my family. Iâ€™ve been through too much and so have they. Most of it is my doing. Iâ€™ve not only failed myself but the people close to me as well. I plan on ending it during my spring break. Iâ€™m only doing it so far out because I want to change. I constantly think about how Iâ€™m going to it and Iâ€™ve come up with some peaceful ways that might actually change my life for the better and save me. I want to do it but I donâ€™t want to hurt others. No one deserves to feel the way I do. I honestly believe I am too far gone right now to try and find help. It just feels good to write this because I donâ€™t express any emotions anywhere else. Iâ€™m tired of being alive.
