I just keep fucking up (vent)I keep doing shit that makes me hate myself and feel ashamed and like a loser. I keep fucking up school work, I ruin all my relationships, I walk a morally and legally gray line that Iâ€™ve been trying to escape, and I keep coming back to the thought of suicide. I just really want to die. I was never cut out to be a human, I canâ€™t do or hand human things. God shouldâ€™ve killed me instead of cursing me with goddamn autism. I can never learn shit that helps me like â€œHey dumbass literally just donâ€™t do this and you wonâ€™t get in troubleâ€ Iâ€™m a fucking retard and I wish I could just get a gun and shoot myself right through the brain. I havenâ€™t wanted to live for the last third of my 15 year old goddamn life. I donâ€™t know if everyone is out to get me or if Iâ€™m just straight out fucking retarded and keep fucking up. Iâ€™m crying now because I just want so bad to make my parents proud but all I do is disappoint. I wish my mom stopped at 1. My older brother is such a goddamn amazing person and Iâ€™ll never be near that. If I live past 20 Iâ€™ll probably be found dead in some ditch missing my head because Iâ€™m so annoyingly curious and stupid.
