I am wierdMy mental state has crumbled too far...
I hate myself this world and the human race.
Now I have come here to ask the question, there is no right or wrong. But consequences are different... Ok let's get into it
There are many people and there is me and i can't handle it anymore. I will die either way. But I always wanted to kill someone and I got the feeling that I might just do that question is, is it going to be myself or someone else and I am pretty sure I won't stop after one and I am defenetly not going to let them take me to jail. Noone will get me living
