I don't remember the last time I meant it when I said "I love you"There's so many people I want in my life that just don't care about me. I want to tell them I love them, that they made such a positive impact in my life. Every one of them leaves. I'm only left with shitty friends who mostly ignore me and a broken family that I've never felt a bond with. I got a job promotion, got happy and then immediately shitty. I didn't know who to tell. There's no one I actually care about enough that feels the same way toward me. I told my co-worker that she was one of my closest friends and she said "yeah, work is super fun with you" How do I find someone to talk to? How do I find someone that I want to spend time with?
