I still have some shred of hope left, but if this year doesn't turn my life around I'm not sure if I'll manage.I don't particularly want to die, but I don't particularly want to be alive either. I just don't care anymore. Nothing goes right in my life, and when it does it just goes to shit shortly after. 
If my life doesn't improve, I'm not sure if I can cope. I'm giving it until 2019 to decide. I'll try my best to improve it, but who knows.
