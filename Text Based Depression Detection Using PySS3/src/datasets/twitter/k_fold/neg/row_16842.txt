Friend died. Possible suicide.I testify that a chain reaction of suffering has been unleashed in this moment throughout her family.  I witness that she has a close relative who suffers from severe depression and suicidal ideation currently who has just been holding on lately and I can see unfolding  before my eyes how a determination of suicide plants itself into a family psyche, giving rise to the possible phenomena of contagion.
