HelplessI know I'm not unique and I know other people are in worse places. I've been working out daily, eating healthy, I look good. I haven't drank in 30 days. I go to therapy, I'm on Zoloft. I want to kill myself. Ive wanted to kill myself since I  was 16 and I'm 26. I overdosed 3 years ago, was brought back. I wish I wasnt. I enjoy nothing. My best friend left me. Nothing is anything it's just the same shit day after day and I'm tired. I would say I feel nothing but I feel fear. Im afraid of the pain I'll feel. Im afraid of hurting my parents and siblings. I'm afraid my ex will blame herself. But I am getting to the point where I don't know how much longer I can do this. I can't tell anyone because they'll put me in a facility and I will never go back there. I don't know why I'm writing this I'm just tired
