Wanting to Go But Too AfraidMy life sucks now and most likely always will suck. Lonely as fuck, no friends, definitely no romantic relationships. If it wasn't for paying for sex I'd definitely still be a virgin today. Constant rejection from the few friends I have had over the past couple years. I don't see a point in continuing this hell I'm in but I'm too fucking afraid to do anything. Closest I ever came was driving to a bridge and looking over the railing a couple years ago. Just couldn't climb over it let alone jump. Not wanting to be alive but being too pussy to do anything about it is a special kind of suffering.
