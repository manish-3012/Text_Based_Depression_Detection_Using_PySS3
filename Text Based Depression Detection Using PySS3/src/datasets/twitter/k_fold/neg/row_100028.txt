i really don't have any reason to be alivei feel like i'm just coasting through life just trying to do the bare minimum to get through the day. nothing really brings me any joy. i make plans with friends when they ask me to and fake smile the whole time. i have no dreams, no hopes of the future, i act like everything is fine to my parents and friends and even my therapist because i'm scared of what they'll say. i'm scared of them freaking out and me being hospitalized. i harm myself because i don't know how i'll kill myself but i imagine it. jumping off a bridge, walking in front of a bus, hanging myself in the forest. almost everyday i just fall into this hole of hopelessness and think about suicide. nothing has been helpin im just holding on by my last thread
