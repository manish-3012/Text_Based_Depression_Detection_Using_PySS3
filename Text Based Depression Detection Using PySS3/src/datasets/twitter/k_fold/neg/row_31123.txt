Failed attempt 1 month ago, going again.I've lost all motivation to do anything, school work, any activities, even video games which I was completely addicted to only a year ago. Now I mainly just lay in my bed wondering why I even exist, for hours on end. I've legitimately thought about suicide ever since I was 13, with time this thought got worst and now at the age of 17 I've lost count of how many times I tried to take my own life. 

Just a month ago I had an extremely scary attempt. I hung a piece of rope from my door and suspended myself so if I stood on my tip toes I could barely breath, then I let my legs relax and swung them in front of me, I was completely blacked out within a few seconds. But then about 3 minutes later I just woke up for no apparent reason, the rope didn't break and there was still full suspension on my neck, but I still fucking woke up and survived. I didn't leave a note or anything, I just really, really wanted to fucking die that night.

That was scary enough to make me stop for a month, waking up with a rope around your neck, cold, with saliva running down your face, slowly realizing where you are and what happened. But now the suicidal thoughts return and I want to try again. Perhaps I should tell someone about my problems, but they'd just call someone and take me to a hospital. Being someone who actually wants to die, constant supervision at a hospital is not ideal.

School mainly instigates these suicidal actions, I once cried for a whole night over the score I got on a practice test, and I believe I came very close to killing myself that night too, anything can trigger it. I must just have a really fucking muscular neck because I can not kill myself via hanging, I have tried literally 100+ times now, but I'm going to keep trying.
