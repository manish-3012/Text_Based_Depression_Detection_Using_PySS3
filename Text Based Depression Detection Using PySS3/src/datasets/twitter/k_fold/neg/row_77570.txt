I'm relapsing for the second time today and I'm getting urges to stab myself. I have nobody to turn to, not even the hotline.It's fucking unbearable, I don't want to die but I want to be over. I keep thinking of the knife going into my body and gripping it in my hands and I don't think I can make myself do it but I'm scared. 

My best friend did something that hurt me and I expressed my anger in a bad way and he said it reminded him of how his dad used to yell at him (i think his dad was abusive emotionally at some point) and he doesn't want me to hate myself over it and that we both fucked up, but I do and I feel repulsive. 

I can't get it out of my head that I did that and I can't bleed enough to satisfy myself because I'm too weak to cut deeper but i can't call the hotline again because they'll try to send mobile crisis again and my parents will be mad at me for it again and even if I beg them to come take me anyways I'm scared of what would happen in the hospital, and if I get hospitalized, my friend will know how badly I handled him criticizing me and that feels toxic and he might leave me.
