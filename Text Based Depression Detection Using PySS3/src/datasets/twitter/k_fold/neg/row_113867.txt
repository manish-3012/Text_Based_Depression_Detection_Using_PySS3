inpatient has less appeal than death (having been to the ward I'd go knowing it won't fix my problems) which has less appeal to escaping chronic psychological abuse and being too many things to too many peopleand for what it's worth I have 6.5x the LD50 needed for me to commit suicide by a poison that tasted good but greasy and kills in 3 minutes. My biggest reason for living? What loved ones weren't complicit in the chronic abuse would be hurt even if they've either stopped picking up the phone or reaching out to drains too much to make worth it. I want to live. I just want to die more than I want to live like this and think I can't fix my life and have no one that can either.
