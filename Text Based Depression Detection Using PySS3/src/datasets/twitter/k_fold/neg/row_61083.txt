Absolute IntentHello, SuicideWatch. It's been quite awhile since my first ever post here detailing my intent to off myself. Obviously, I haven't done it; I opted instead to exhaust my options first and see if anyone could give me an ironclad reason not to do it. No one has so far, and I doubt anyone can or will. The many forms of therapies I've tried and the many therapists I've been to have not changed anything, nor have the medications I've been taking. I'm inclined to believe that this is because there is nothing actually wrong with me, my mind, or my thinking-they can't fix a problem that doesn't exist. In fact, the only sign that anything might actually be wrong with me is that I want to kill myself.

I'm not going to outline my reasons for desiring to do so again; anybody interested in them can check my previous posts and find them or just ask me directly for a copy-pasted version. Bottom-line is this: I intend to end my life. I'm not here for help; I'm not really that upset about it, to be honest. It won't happen soon; I have a very long suicide note to compose and details to organize before I do it. At this point, procrastination is keeping me alive more than anything else. 

So why would I be posting here? The answer is this: I want feedback. I want to know, for absolutely certain, that I am doing this the right way and for the right reasons. If you talk to me only with the intent of discouraging me from doing it, I will see through you and you will be wasting time for both of us (and one of us will have a lot less of it than the other). I expect any contribution to be solely a logical critique or suggestion; if I encounter a logical critique that cannot be overcome, then that will be when I discard the plan entirely. I can't get feedback on this anywhere else, so here I am.

And so, the countdown begins.
