Not enough pills in the house...Can't even kill myself right.Counting out pills, I don't have enough to feel 'safe'. I can't even do that right, can I?

I could go walk down to the store and get some, but I can't get there.

I wanna go backpacking, but I can't. I don't have enough money or the right supplies- my little sister lost my good sleeping bag.  All of you guys on here and on another depression forum said it's best for me to just leave, but I can't do that rihgt either. My boyfriend wants me to leave too, but he says I'm not at the right state to do that since I have no supplies.

I've always wanted to get out and see the world, always went on long, loooong walks or would get lost in the creek from exploring. My friend and I would go live in the old trashed out, broken down camper that was forever sitting in the driveway. I've wanted to be a traveller since a young age, I guess. But it's forever been out of my reach. I don't even know where I would go.

A friend of mine went squatting around Europe when she was my age, but since I just yesterday got fired, I can't do that. (I didn't get fired really, I got temporarly demoted since I don't know the menu well enoug to be a server, but they haven't given me a new schedule so I can't owrk until they figure that part out)

I want out, I want to just save up some money and go backpacking for however long I want, maybe live like that, I dunno. But I also have the one short film thing I want to shoot here in Dallas over the summer. But then again, Mom's kicking me out anyway. Maybe I can put the film off for another year or two, i've already had to can it for a year because of financial issues, I cna do it again. (I can't do anything right)

I don't even know what I'm saying, I just know I feel like shit and I want to run away, but I ALWAYS want to run away, so it's nothing new. I'm stuck. Again. Eternally. :/

I dunno what to do.
