It's past time for me to be gone.My in-laws hate me, and I don't blame them. I found a letter from FIL advising my husband to divorce me, or he'd take matters I to his own hands, and I can't say he's wrong. My husband and kids would be so much better off without me. I know it's super traumatizing to have a parent commit suicide, but it had to be less horrible in the long run than the trauma they live with by having me around every day. There's a video of a little girl crying for her daddy after he killed herself, and right now that's the only thing keeping me here, but I'm pretty sure my husband and kids would actually be happier with me gone. I am a complete waste of oxygen.
