I'm close to the end.I can't do this anymore.  All my work I've ever done in my life has amounted to nothing.  Every day I wake up and think it'll be the last day I ever see.  I've lost all hope of not failing out of college and now have no chance to actually make anything of myself.  I can't smile anymore and can't talk to anyone since I don't feel close to anyone I call a "friend".  My therapist is one who works for my Uni so in about a month I'm going to lose her when I need her most.  My family already looks at me with disappointment.  But people will move on.  The people I see now won't even remember me soon enough seeing as I always seem to make every social gathering bad and when I'm not there it's always a great time for everyone.  My family still have my star siblings who haven't fucked up their lives entirely.  I'm out of options now.  I feel like my life is a movie and all I can do is apathetically watch.  My life, safety, and health mean nothing to me anymore.  I don't think I'm going to be able to hold on past the weekend.
