I'm depressed because I feel depressed.I get in this fucking circle of despair where I get frustrated with some "hardship" in my life: not having a girlfriend(I've been in serious relationships before), making mistakes at my job, failing an AP test, or even things as simple as being bored.  It isn't these things that make me extremely depressed; it is realizing that I am depressed because of these pathetic reasons.  Then I just get more angry with myself and more depressed. 

Why can't I deal with this stuff? None of it is a big deal.  And now look at me.  Why am I even thinking about being depressed? There is no reason to be. I consider suicide, then get angry for even considering it, and then try to convince myself to do it for even considering it. My personal beliefs and convictions don't look kindly upon weak minded people, and these feelings make me feel weak. I just want to scream because I am so frustrated.
