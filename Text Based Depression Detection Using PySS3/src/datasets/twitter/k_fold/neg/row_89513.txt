I'm so fucking stressed out. I want to jump.I can't stop thinking about jumping off this fucking parking deck. It would be so easy. I don't want to hurt my family but I'm so overwhelmed I really don't feel like I can handle this any more. I'm working full time while trying to study for the gre and apply to grad school but the gre is fast approaching and there is no way I'm prepared enough to get the score I want. I've been taking adderall just so I can get out of bed in the morning and go to my job and get lose it but I hardly have it in me to shower, let alone work full time, study for the gre, and apply to grad school. I don't know that I even have the motivation to climb up this parking deck and jump off. I don't know if I could even if I did but fuck, this needs to end.
