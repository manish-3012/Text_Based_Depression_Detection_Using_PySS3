I donâ€™t know what to doSo due to shitty relationships (both in family and out), mental illness, and general traumatic shit in my life Iâ€™ve developed some self destructive habits. Nothing too special there. Usually I can keep it under control and keep my life progressing in a mostly positive way, but I fucked it up. As of Saturday night I am being charged with two class A misdemeanors for drugs. Because of this I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be able to go to college because Iâ€™m now ineligible for financial aid, Iâ€™ll probably lose my job, my family will either be super disappointed in me or just disown me all together, I could serve up to two years in prison, and my friend was with me so because of me heâ€™s getting charged with all the same things. I donâ€™t know what to do guys. This is the first time Iâ€™ve ever seriously considered ending it. I tried calling a therapist Iâ€™ve seen a couple of times, but he said heâ€™s too busy for a while but heâ€™ll get back to me when he finds some time, so who knows how long thatâ€™ll be. I donâ€™t know how to tell my family. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting this here honestly this is just the only thing that I can do
