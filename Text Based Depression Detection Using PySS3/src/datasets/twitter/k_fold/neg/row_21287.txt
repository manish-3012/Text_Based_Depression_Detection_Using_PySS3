how am i suppose to justify being miserable working?i dont want to work. i cant really see a reason to spend 8+ hours a day being miserable just so i can barely afford to stay alive. i just dont see any point in life if youre not rich and im not willing to spend the rest of my life working just for some slim chance that i get kind of rich when im old. im not really sure what to do. i dont want to work but i dont want to be homeless so suicide is only other option. but im too afraid of failing to try to kill myself so i dont know.
