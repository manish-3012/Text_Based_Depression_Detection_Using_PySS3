I can't live in this world anymoreAmerica is horrible, trump is horrible, racism, homophobia and transphobia are high, I've seen 3 news videos in the past week about racist rants and one ended with the racist murdering the guys that were defending the girls. People are saying we have gone back decades in terms of equality and racism like back to the civil war time. Why are people so cruel? Why would people want to live in this world? It's horrible. I'm done.
