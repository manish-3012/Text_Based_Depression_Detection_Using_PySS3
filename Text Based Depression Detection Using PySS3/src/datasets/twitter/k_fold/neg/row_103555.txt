my life is (normal?) but i want it to endI am I think what you would consider a very average person. Iâ€™m 20 years old. Female. Pretty. At least
thatâ€™s what people say. Some days I feel pretty. Most days I hate myself. 
Nothing is wrong but everything is wrong. I have a job. But I hate my job. Going into work is like a feat of anxiety I must hurdle over. I never get acquired to it. 
Iâ€™m in college. I like my school. But itâ€™s just a constant reminder that I am in a phase of life. Nothing is permanent. Everything is temporary. 
I donâ€™t have many friends. The ones I do are mostly there out of routine. But they donâ€™t know me. They donâ€™t know how I feel. They donâ€™t understand me or who I truly am. 
No one is in love with me. Quite frankly I donâ€™t think anyone has ever been in love with me. I catch feelings. Fast. I always end up being hurt. How can you believe that youâ€™re the pretty girl when no one wants you? 
Iâ€™d like to think Iâ€™m a positive person. Glass half full. On the outside. Inside? Always negative. Always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I never have to wait that long though. Because welcome to my life, the life where the other shoe always drops.
What am I good at? Iâ€™m okay at some things. But Iâ€™m not good at anything. Iâ€™m not special. Iâ€™m not unique or quirky. 
Nothing about me is keeping me on this earth anymore. Relationships are meaningless. My life doesnâ€™t seem to have any purpose. Why do I feel this way? Why does it make me feel better to think I want to end it all?
