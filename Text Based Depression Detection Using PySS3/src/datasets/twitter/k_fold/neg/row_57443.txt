I don't know.I feel weird posting this crap online. I just don't know who else to talk to. I have friends and family, but I don't think I can talk to them about this kind of stuff. 

I wish I was dead. I graduated from college a year ago and I have a job that I hate and it was the job that I always wanted to do with my life. I feel like there is nothing out there for me. I have no other interests and no other skills. People try to get me to be positive about my future, but it seems so impossible that the positivity just seems annoying or makes me feel more hopeless.

There is nothing of concern, I won't do it myself because I am too much of a pussy, but I wake up every morning upset that I didn't die in my sleep and I park my car wishing I was in a fatal accident during that drive.

I don't even know why I'm posting this, I guess I just need an outlet and I obviously can't use twitter or facebook. The "being anonymous" thing helps. 

I don't expect pity or help, I just need the outlet. 

I feel like this is it. College was okay, and now I'm in the real world where life just perpetually sucks every day.
