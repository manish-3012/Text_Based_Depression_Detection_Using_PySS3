Saved by the Virus?I basically was gonna off because I lost my job. It was objectively not even my fault, with the boss being proven to fuck people over... Im just so tired of being poor and all that... 

I was sitting at home alone just crying. 

Thing is, now fuckin everyone is out of a job and sitting at home broke and depressed. 

Something about not being alone just helped a lot? It made me feel like less of a loser.

Itâ€™s cringey to me to admit but letâ€™s face it, look at history (Romans, Japanese)... suicide is sometimes linked to pride, to a perception of social failure, of being a burden. 

I think I was able to feel hopeful that I can at least be accepted as an equal in society when I am not the only one struggling...? 

This isnt really how my values work. Im someone who thinks every homeless person should be respected and have a home, I dont believe in hating on poor people. I just have a double standard towards myself, low key... :/
