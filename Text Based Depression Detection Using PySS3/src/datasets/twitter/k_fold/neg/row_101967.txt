i need help to save my granddad.my father passed away 30 days ago, it's stressful for all of us, especially when you lose your dad just as you graduate from high school. but im trying to stand strong for my little brother and everything im trying my best and starting to feel better, trying to not let him sense bit of sadness and always telling funny stories my dad was telling me when i was a kid. however this is not about me, even tho i had fair share of suicidal moments myself but got over it eventually, this is about my grandfather. he is 67 years old, and really weak. i mean you can just tell by looking into his eyes that he has never been sadder... i have seen many sad, depressed people. but i can just tell he is suicidal, every symptom matches he is shaking, cant think straight and just walks around, standing in the middle of the street on very sunny hot day. never stays home, always out. he had really terrible life, lost both his sons during his lifetime and his dad committed suicide. i try to hug him, calm him down every chance i get, talk to him but there is just no help, i just cant help him... im really worried that he might do something to himself, im studying in college at the different town, so i cant be next to him at all times... im just scared that he might die and i just cant help. so im asking you to tell me what to do, i have no idea at this point im really worried i just dont know...  sorry for my english, i'm not native.
