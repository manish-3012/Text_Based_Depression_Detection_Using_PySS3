Explaining myself. A suicide noteI'm done. I'm completely done. I can't take it anymore. These past few weeks have been the worst. the worst. 

I cry every time I go to sleep, I wake up with suicidal thoughts, started self harming again, battling battles with inner me is again a problem. On one side I wanna end it on the other I try to find hope and a better good. Well honestly I'm done battling, I gave up.

I got called selfish so apparently all my effort was worthless. 

This thursday I'm back home. I'll run off my third period and end it all downtown. I'll run off school grounds to go downtown where I'll end it. On my way downtown I'll be fucking wasted so I feel less like shit. I've made my decision. 

The past 5 months have showed me that even you try your best it's not enough. I didn't self harm, I got into a relationship with a person I absolutely love, got better grades, had fewer suicidal thoughts but that just made my fall worse.

To everyone I've known: I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough to be here by your side right now

Goodbye, on Thursday 12th I'll be no more in pain. I'll see you on the other side fellas.
