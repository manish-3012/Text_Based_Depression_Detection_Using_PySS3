Im an educator, an animal lover, and a people enthusiast. I canâ€™t stand living anymore.I just canâ€™t stand it. I love everything but genuinely hate myself with every fiber of my being. Every time I see something good, I think about how horrible I am. Every time a student tells me how I impacted their life I want to end its so I stop the bleeding. I am a cancer. The only reason I donâ€™t end it is for the positive impact Iâ€™ve had for our younger generation. But me, the selfish asshole, I want to just end it all so the lie can stop. 

So these kids can wake up and realize none of this matters at all. Where my situation doesnâ€™t help them. My death either cancels out their idea of self importance or I just do it and I donâ€™t have to worry about it.

I know suicide is selfish but for once in my life I WANT to be. I hate my existence because I am needed constantly yet accomplish nothing. For the past five years thatâ€™s been my life. I want that to not be my situation, before you tell me to change my surroundings, I know all of that. Iâ€™m locked in.

I have considered all of these factors and deletion seems the most comfortable option. I really donâ€™t see an alternative.

Iâ€™ve moved, Iâ€™ve changed my lifestyle, Iâ€™ve changed my friends. Nothing makes my life have any value, at least in my mindset. At least for me.

Iâ€™ve tried therapists, Iâ€™ve tried psychiatrists, Iâ€™ve tried â€œgod forbidâ€ my fucking family.

I think Iâ€™ve exhausted everything and have reached the final solution.
