Broken down to nothing for the last time.I'm 20 years old, and I'm pregnant with my first child right now. Up until March 6th, 2015 I was under the belief I couldn't have children. My SO and I have had nothing short of a very rocky relationship, me always feeling the weight to make things work because he doesn't seem to want to ever try. It's been almost a year and half we've been together, off and on sadly. Yesterday I made dinner nothing fancy but I tied, and made brownies for desert. I was left waiting forty five minutes to come back home for dinner, I'm going to add in there he was the one who told me to wait. Fast forward to late night, all night he hasn't spoken to me just sitting on his phone. He decided he wanted to get high, I decided I was going to sleep in the closet because there's a pillow fort so why not avoid arguments... He comes in the closet later and tells me we need to talk then proceeds to tell me he doesn't like me anymore. I feel my whole world is falling apart, he doesn't believe I love him, he doesn't want the child, so I have to get an abortion. I honestly am just done I don't care anymore I've been broken down so many fucking times by so many people I'm just over trying my hardest Putting others before me just to be told that what I do doesn't mean anything to them. I guess this is my way of saying I'm done, finally. My minds made up.
