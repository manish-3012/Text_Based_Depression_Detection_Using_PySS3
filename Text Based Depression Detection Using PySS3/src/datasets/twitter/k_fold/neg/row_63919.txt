struggling to get over a relationshiptoday was meant to be the 8th year anniversary of my ex-boyfriend and i.

&amp;#x200B;

he broke up with me at the start of the year and then we went on a holiday together a few weeks ago, and then he finally decided he didn't want to talk to me anymore and just cut me off completely.

&amp;#x200B;

i've worked so hard after we broke up so that i could be good enough for him again. i've gone to therapy, i've worked hard at the gym. i got a new job that pays me a great salary and none of it matters because i miss him so much and everything feels so pointless and arbitrary. i don't know what to do. my friends told me to use a dating app to get over him but using something like that just makes me feel like offing myself because it all feels so superficial and fake. i have no interest in anything anymore. every day i just go to bed and wake up and go to work hoping to kill time and then i get home and try to kill some more time. i haven't felt a spark of chemistry with another human being in so long.

i take the train to work every day and i work on the 7th floor and all i can think about is jumping and i just want it to stop. i'm so tired of missing him and of having thoughts of him creep into my head.  today was worse than usual -- i guess because it was an anniversary day.

i'm 27 and it just feels like time is running out on life. god i hope it gets better.
