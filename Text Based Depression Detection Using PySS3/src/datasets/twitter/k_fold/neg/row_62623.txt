please helpi used to be a straight a student and now my parents have found out i havenâ€™t done any school work. now i have no freedom. i have to tell them all of my school work with them right after school. i also have to do all of my school work with them. i cant do anything during lunch except for homework or nothing. i cant play video games or talk to my online friends at all until all of my homework is done which takes all day. when i play video games or talk to my friends itâ€™s the only time i feel truly happy. then ofc they are forcing me to hang out with my irl â€œfriends.â€ i also now canâ€™t get answers from my friends even though thatâ€™s what everybody does. if i lie to them about school they wonâ€™t let me play games for 24 hours and maybe take my phone too. they keep telling me they wouldnâ€™t be doing this if they didnâ€™t know i was capable. i would have done the work if i was capable. i want to die more than i have in many years rn
