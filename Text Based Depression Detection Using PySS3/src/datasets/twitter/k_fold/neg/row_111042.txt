See no futureSo I learned that I will be up for dismissal at my local college. I feel like I ruined my future by fucking up my grades and not giving enough focus on school. Now this isn't the first time I've gotten a kick in the ass because I was on scholastic probation and it seems I still haven't learned anything from my previous mistakes. I can only imagine what my parents will say once they find out. I feel like I disappointed them and I honestly cant even see myself living out the next week. I am a 23 year old failure who still can't grow up.
