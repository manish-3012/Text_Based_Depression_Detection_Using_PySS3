Well Iâ€™m not sure what to do?Hi, uh this is a little weird writing this down publicly but hey Iâ€™ve done it once before. I made a post about a year ago close to two under the account ThatOneFriend04 it basically talked about how I was super sad and all that Jazz. But Iâ€™m not sure what to do anymore Iâ€™m 14 now about to be 15 and Iâ€™m just so tired, I tried to kill my self, as you can tell it didnâ€™t work. But ever since I did that Iâ€™ve just felt so empty I had no want or need to hurt myself but I just wanted to lay down and not get up. Itâ€™s like my whole being is just over it. But I canâ€™t be over it because I have school and if I miss school my grandparents will be held responsible and I donâ€™t know what the fuck to do. I havenâ€™t talked to my mom ever since she got arrested for domestic abuse (which was about 3 months ago) and on that same day my sister decided to attempt sheâ€™s fine but I donâ€™t understand if people promise that they will be there for you, you believe them but I have stoped believing in anyone everyone betrays you. Iâ€™m so fucking tried but all I do is sleep.
