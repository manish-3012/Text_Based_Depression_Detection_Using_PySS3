Can't take it anymore..Long-story short, I'm a 26 year old guy and my 8-year relationship ended a few months ago and I've been in hell ever since. The breakup ended badly.

I practically invested my entire life into her(I know, I shouldn't have, but I trusted her..a lot). I went all-in because I had a really high amount of faith and confidence in our relationship.

So now, I'm just really lost and feel like wanting to die a few times a day. I'm angry and my only desires and objectives are from my rage. Everything I had, especially my future, I invested in her and the relationship.

I think back what I was doing before my relationship was serious and I can't even remember. I don't even know what I was doing back then. Like time just skipped and 80% of my being was taken from me. And things that I was doing when we were together, I have no desire to do anymore. That includes all my past hobbies and interests. 

I'm under an unbearable amount of stress. My financial situation is critical. I've started getting panic attacks. A lot of breath shortages and my heart constantly hurts. I can hardly think straight and I've been making a lot of driving mistakes because of that. Today, I was yelled at over the phone by a customer at work and I just started crying.

I feel like I'm just not able to keep adapting. And I don't have the will to keep going. The suffering just isn't worth it anymore.

I do have friends and family that support me, but that hardly affects me or my decision at the end of the day. I just know that the next time I put a gun in my mouth again, it will be final.  
And that's why I'm here, to hear some opinions.
