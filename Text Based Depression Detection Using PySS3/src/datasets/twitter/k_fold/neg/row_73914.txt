GirlfriendHello, throwaway account here.

Girlfriend just tried to end her life while I am away on vacation. I don't know what to do and too scared to tell anyone else because she'll feel betrayed. As another person with depression, I feel overwhelmed with the pressure of her life in my hands. 

What can I do? I'm on the other side of the country, if I come back home, it's another reason for her to feel guilty. I'm scared of calling on the phone, because I get impatient and irrational. Suggestions of selfhelp are deflected with every mention. 

Help. It's taken a toll on me. This has never gotten this far, as they were empty threats before.
