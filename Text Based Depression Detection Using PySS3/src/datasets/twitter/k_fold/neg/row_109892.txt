just wanted this off my chestmaybe this is the wrong place to post. but this random night has me thinking about death a lot more than normal.. iâ€™m in university and the constant desire for me to be dead doesnâ€™t stem from school. in fact, i have amazing friends and a supportive family i live a relatively good life. although there has not been a single day for as long as i can remember that i didnâ€™t prefer or wish to be dead. i know my death will impact my family, and i am somewhat scared of ending my life, therefore i have just become reckless in hopes i can die suddenly in some accident...  overall i really just donâ€™t feel like living no matter what. everything in the world is shit and i donâ€™t feel as if my existence matters at all.  i would miss the ones i love, but people will move on eventually and i would no longer live everyday feeling the way i do. 

i donâ€™t really know why i posted on here, i donâ€™t really need to be coaxed out of trying to kill myself; at least not right now. but iâ€™ve never told anyone how i felt because on a surface level i have no reason to feel this way. iâ€™ll probably delete this, but right now posting this feels like a small pressure being relieved. thanks to anyone who took the time to read.
