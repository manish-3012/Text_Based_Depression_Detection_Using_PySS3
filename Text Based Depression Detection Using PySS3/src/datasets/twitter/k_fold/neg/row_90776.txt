Please wipe me from existence.Hello, I wouldn't be surprised if this gets lost amongst all the others.

A few months ago I lost the most important person in my life to cancer. It has been nothing but hell for all of my 23 years on this planet. I get the thought of putting a gun in my mouth everyday it is torture. I just want it all to stop I just want her back. I'm lucky to have people around me unlike some others, but it doesn't help because they cannot see. A coworker helped me through quite a lot and now will hardly ever talk to me and its driving me nuts. I think I'm using her as a cover or something and now that she wont talk to me I'm feeling even more lost.

I just want someone to end me then I can join her.

Please help.
