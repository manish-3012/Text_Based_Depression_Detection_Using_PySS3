loss of beliefhas anyone ever dealt with no longer believing in things? i feel my depression has gotten to a point where absolutely nothing has a purpose. i donâ€™t believe in that anymore. i was raised to believe in a god, i believed in santa until i was 10, and i believed in magic (like legit harry potter-hogwarts actually existed) past that. over time i obviously outgrew the childish beliefs, and then i stopped believing in god, and now i donâ€™t believe thereâ€™s any real reason we exist or anything is real. not only am i numb, but i donâ€™t believe thereâ€™s a reason for anything, 
is there someone that understands this? it weighs on me a lot
