I could use some help.Not bothering to use a throwaway - fuck it. I'm a married 26-year-old man considering suicide mainly for financial reasons. I owe back taxes, am unemployed, have other debts (and student loans) and really have no way of taking care of any of these things. We're currently between apartments, and it's seeming more and more like offing myself might be the answer, possibly after signing up for some kind of life insurance that isn't voided by suicide. What are your thoughts? Bankruptcy isn't really even an option, because of the 30k worth of un-removable student loan debt.
