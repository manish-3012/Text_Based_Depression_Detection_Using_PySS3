Worth nothing of value to anyoneI am worth absolutely nothing to anyone. There will always be people
in the world that can replace me. Iâ€™m not meant to be loved by someone else. All of my fantasies of meeting someone who actually likes me back will never come true. Theyâ€™re just fantasies and they always will be. Iâ€™m too undesirable as a human being to be loved by someone else. I even have an imaginary girlfriend, and even then the fantasy can only last so long. I only do this to cope with feeling alone. No one will ever love me and I should just cut my life short. Thereâ€™s no use in living a lonely misery filled life. Iâ€™d rather die early
