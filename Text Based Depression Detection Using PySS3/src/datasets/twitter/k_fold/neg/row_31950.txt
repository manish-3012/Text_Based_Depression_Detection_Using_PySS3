Round two, time to see if I place it to the more willing, if they will notice.Thought it would be best to come and run this yet again, by anyone. Not like it matters to most anyhow. I posted it on the depression sub, nothing as expected. So let's try here.

 Well, this is it. More or less everything I see in my life has gone to shit. My dreams have been smashed, I suffer from multiple issues, may it be medical, or mental. I have little friends, and the ones who I do have don't live anywhere close to me/are always busy, as they all are finishing up university/have jobs. Everything is ending that matters to me, and no matter how many times I seem to post and run something like this, it meets the same end. I get happy for a bit, and the same nonsense is drowned back to nothing. I want to be a youtuber in the fields of things like music, animation, voice overs (impressions, one of the only things I am actually good at), and the likes for my fandom (Mlp). As well as write stories and such, but I am not exactly talented in this case or in any others cases besides the one above (though that took months of work, but hey, it's still something) , so it's 10x harder than usual, as I am just stagnated at a sudden ok it seems. So as it is, the odds of these things are a needle in a haystack, and it's more than likely I will fail and end up in a dead end job as a computer technician, serving asinine customers for minimal wage. Oh the joys of being in a third world country. One where everyone forgets I ever existed, and I crumble to nothingness into my hollow grave. You know, once I end myself. That or drinking myself down the road of the ye ol' pops. What a bloody world.
