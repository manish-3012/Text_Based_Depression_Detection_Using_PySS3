I'm ready to end this suffering.Hi, English isn't my first language so if there are any errors please bear with me. I will get my scorecard for my college tomorrow and it seems as if I won't pass this year. This will be my second attempt to pass college and if I don't make I know I won't make it in life. When I got my scorecard last year I was ready to end it but I've almost forgotten what made me think otherwise. If I don't make it tomorrow I don't want to see the disappointed look on my teachers faces, even my parents and my friends who supported me. I can't believe my parents were ready to invest money in me in the first place. 

Where I live everything is associated with your result, they judge you on the basis of your marks, It's almost normal for people to demean others who have got a shitty scorecard. I had a talent but due it being almost non-existent in my country I was stuck in a place where a piece of paper does decide your future. This education system which prioritizes memory based learning and due to corruption my   
 college board gives students lower grades compared to other boards.

I'm grateful for the things I have and feel very disappointed that someone more deserving to live than me goes to sleep without a roof on his head. I received education from amazing teachers and the amount of time they spent for me will all go to waste If I fail tomorrow. 

I have almost stopped eating for the past few days and also don't sleep. It's almost as if my body has given up. I have lost the will to live. I'm afraid if I speak to someone about this I'll be admitted to a psych ward. I have lost nearly all hope and have started taking certain OTC medications which deal with anxiety but they're running out and I can't go out during this Covid situation.  

I'm 18 and I think I don't have much time, they'll announce the scorecard in 11 hours and I will be ready. If I do pull through I will make an update and if I don't then I'll just leave this world and be less of a burden to my family.
