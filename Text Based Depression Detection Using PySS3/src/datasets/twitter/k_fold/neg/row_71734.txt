i like the thought of being "that girl who ended up killing herself"that's it. I've dropped out of school, and I like the thought of people thinking "she dropped out, and then killed herself". I like the thought of people thinking of me and the fact I've committed suicide. Teachers, people who used to be my friends, people who ive met briefly but would still know who I am, I like the thought of them finding out I've killed myself. I would never do it out of spite, but I like to think of it as a big "fuck you" to some people.
