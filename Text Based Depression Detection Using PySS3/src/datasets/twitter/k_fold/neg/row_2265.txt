If I wasnâ€™t pregnant, Iâ€™d take my own life tonightI donâ€™t know wtf is wrong with me. Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™ve never felt this way before. Iâ€™m in therapy. I just said bye to my mom, she was really abusive. And this pregnancy was so wanted. Before getting pregnant, I had what seemed like a perfect life. I canâ€™t stop crying. I dont know what to do. Someone please help.
