I donâ€™t know how to ask for helpEvery night i go to sleep with a pit in my chest , in my stomach, in my mind and iâ€™m so tired of this just empty ass feeling. i literally cannot express how bad i wish i knew know one , i cared for no one , and no one cared for me. I need to leave. i need to know whatâ€™s next. the mundane life iâ€™m living is so tiresome. When i try to ask for help people think iâ€™m joking. I want to be happy. I want to enjoy the simple pleasures of life. I just canâ€™t simply figure out how to enjoy them. help.
