DAE feel like the universe is fundamentally against them?Even though there are good times, it always comes back to this.. and I am so tired of this. I can't do anything right.

It feels like I'm just destined for suicide. I can't imagine myself reaching my next birthday. I can't imagine myself getting married, having kids, etc. I can't even envision any of my relative's futures with me being a part of it. I love them so much but their lives will be so much better off with me gone, so it's just plain selfish for me to stick around. 

There's this unexplainable feeling deep inside that I am just not meant to be here. I don't know if there even is a God, but if he doesn't give me a sign by the end of this month, then I'm drinking a litre of vodka. 
I don't need any advice, I just wanted to get this off my chest.
