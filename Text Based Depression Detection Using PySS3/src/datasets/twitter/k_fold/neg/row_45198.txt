Im in the hospital for attempted suicideI tried to kill myself last night over the fact my fiance decided a few weeks before our wedding she wanted to be with someone else and left me for him. It has broken me, she was my world for years and gave me purpose,ambition and a will to strive, now that she's gone I feel nothing but a deep,deep emptiness, has anybody else been in this position and could you guys give me some advice. Love in advance
