Wondering if I should be worried about a friendI have a friend who has a very self deprecating sense of humour, and that includes making a lot jokes about hating life and killing himself. I'm not sure if there is any cause to be concerned or if he does it just because he knows he can usually get a quick laugh with them. He is also at the butt end of a lot similar jokes, its just banter but I've been trying to stop making negative jokes about him just in case. 

He has a good group of friends, we hang out all the time and he gets invited to everything and up until recently I assumed he just had a really dark sense of humour. But what's actually making me concerned for him, is the fact that he recently dropped out of school and quit his job. For a few months he was literally doing nothing all day. He recently got a job so maybe things aren't so bad?

I've thought about talking to him about it but always manage to convince myself that he's fine and they're just jokes. 

What do you guys think?
