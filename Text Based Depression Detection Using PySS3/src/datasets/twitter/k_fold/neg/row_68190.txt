after reaching out to talk, i only feel guilt for the way i feel.Idk whatâ€™s been going on with me lately but itâ€™s scary...thereâ€™s days when iâ€™m completely optimistic and nothing can bring me down and then I eventually fall back into my old bad habits. It doesnâ€™t help that Iâ€™m having to be quarantined at my parents house as Iâ€™m 24 now and my relationship with my parents is completely strained. Me and my boyfriend fight almost every day and at this point I have no friends left except coworkers that I donâ€™t want to know too much about me. Iâ€™m so distant because of my depression. When I speak to my boyfriend about how I feel he normally gets mad at me or just doesnâ€™t say anything and sits on the phone obviously texting as Iâ€™m crying my eyes out or having an anxiety attack. If i donâ€™t respond to something he says as Iâ€™m having a full blown anxiety attack and can barely breathe correctly he gets mad at me and hangs up on me. Itâ€™s a full indicator that Iâ€™m wasting his time...and a reminder that anytime I try to come to someone for help itâ€™s nothing but a waste of everyoneâ€™s time and even my own because Iâ€™m just left feeling more guilty. 

I tried reaching out to my cousin but I felt guilty about it and stopped myself from getting further into detail about how I feel. I just feel so worthless and emotionally weak. I canâ€™t handle anything anymore and I feel as though thereâ€™s no more hope for me. Itâ€™s to the point where my self worth and esteem is at its lowest. When I reach out to my boyfriend he tells me Iâ€™m not the only person suffering and that I shouldnâ€™t be so sad. Itâ€™s hard feeling comfortable with my emotions and moving forward when the only person I have to talk to tells me that I feel the way I feel because I want attention or feels personally attacked for the way that I feel when all I want is comfort. Iâ€™m at a point where itâ€™s so hard for me to be alone because without him I really donâ€™t have anyone that I can speak to and not feel judged or want to stop myself from talking the moment I open up. Honestly I feel like posting this is something Iâ€™m going to regret but I know I need to because I self harmed today and after speaking to my boyfriend for comfort it only made me want to do it even more...
