Been in a rut but doing okayDepression has followed me my whole life, I suffer from PTSD from indescribable horrors I experienced as a kid. But somehow I'm making it through life. I surround myself with people that love me and make me laugh and they keep me tethered and remind me of the good things that can happen in a dark world. I'm grateful for them. I never used to think that I would make it this far after going through so much but I'm so glad that I stay the path. Life is so full of horrors and horrible people but it's full of great things too.
