Heroes die young? But do I? How mentally ill do you think I am?"HeroesÂ dieÂ young"Â isÂ aÂ quoteÂ that motherÂ calledÂ OlympiasÂ toldÂ herÂ sonÂ AlexanderÂ whenÂ heÂ wasÂ youngÂ and indeedÂ AlexanderÂ didÂ becomeÂ aÂ heroÂ butÂ heÂ alsoÂ diedÂ relativelyÂ youngÂ at theÂ ageÂ of 32.Â I'mÂ notÂ Alexander. I'mÂ notÂ aÂ hero, norÂ doÂ IÂ haveÂ aÂ motherÂ calledÂ OlympiasÂ butÂ IÂ always knew as aÂ kidÂ IÂ wouldÂ dieÂ **young**.Â I was always the weird kid the one who was un ruling, the one who would get in a fight with his teachers, the one who wouldn't share the same opinions as the rest of the population, the quiet kid who would pick up bullies but beaten them up after school, the one who wasn't social and liked to be alone, the one who didn't date girls because he saw no point in it, the one who listened to Beethoven and Metallica at the same time, the atheist in the Vatican, the one who wouldn't drop a tear when someone died, the one who had no ambitions nor interest's in doing anything in his life while others were dreaming of becoming doctors, astronauts, politicians,Â athletes etc.Â I'mÂ 18Â year'sÂ oldÂ now withÂ noÂ plansÂ for aÂ longÂ life.Â I'mÂ goingÂ toÂ finishÂ high school inÂ 2019 (ifÂ IÂ don'tÂ failÂ anyÂ subject).Â I planned on going to university in some European countries, but that seems far-fetched since I probably don't have the grades nor financial resources for that kind of thing.Â I will try to, if I succeed then my life will probably go on for a couple of years more.Â IfÂ IÂ don't get intoÂ universityÂ thenÂ IÂ have no idea what willÂ IÂ do.Â IÂ haveÂ scoliosis in my lower back, it's not severeÂ (13Â°)Â butÂ hurtsÂ likeÂ hell.Â There's really no fix for scoliosis and when I think of living for 50-60 years with every second feeling pain I want to end it instantly.Â MyÂ motherÂ hadÂ aÂ tumorÂ (she wouldn't talk about it with me.)Â so sheÂ hadÂ toÂ give birthÂ and wellÂ IÂ ended up withÂ havingÂ 17Â year's younger brother.Â MyÂ parentsÂ areÂ concentratedÂ on himÂ now, andÂ that'sÂ goodÂ sinceÂ myÂ deathÂ will notÂ haveÂ theÂ sameÂ impact ofÂ losingÂ the only sonÂ as itÂ wouldÂ aÂ yearÂ ago.Â IÂ hadÂ aÂ planÂ ofÂ finishingÂ university, getting aÂ jobÂ andÂ workingÂ tillÂ I'mÂ psychologically able,Â raisingÂ someÂ small creditÂ thenÂ quittingÂ job, saying goodbye toÂ myÂ familyÂ andÂ goingÂ toÂ someÂ placeÂ whereÂ IÂ wouldÂ wasteÂ it partying,Â thenÂ findÂ someÂ niceÂ isolatedÂ placeÂ whereÂ IÂ would drink venom and endÂ myÂ lifeÂ but nothingÂ goesÂ toÂ plan, right?Â Any recommendations?
