how long will it take my boyfriend to recover once I'm gone?I don't want to upset him, because he's been the only genuine friend I've ever had, and the only person to express any romantic interest in me, but there's no point in being here anymore. I live in poverty, have no job skills, have questionable mental health (autism, depression, dyslexia) and will probably live in poverty for the rest of my life, and the odds that I will become homeless in the next few years are pretty high. I'm almost 30, I can't do it anymore. He does his best to encourage me, and tell me i'm responsible because I've worked the same job for a long time and have no debt, but he just doesn't get it. He has an education, a career a nice apartment and a large group of friends, I have nothing. Had stable parental figures to teach him the things he needed to know, A good work ethic, the value of education and how to be a respectable person. I had to figure all of that out on my own. I've tried to better my life so many times its not even funny, but I always fail, give up or return to stupidity. I have zero interest in being alive anymore, the writing is on the wall, if I was going to get it together, I would have. I can't think of a single reason to live, a single thing I have to look forward to. The fear of death I've had (like any sane person) disappeared last year and has left me wondering why I'm still here.
