GirlfriendHello everyone,

My girlfriend and I have been dating for two years now and we're very much in love. I'll just start from the beginning. 
Her father passed away in 2009 from MS and she still hasn't been able to move on from this. (I know it's not an easy thing to do). She's seen multiple counselors/psychologists, but she always stops going and says they don't work.
Her mother and brother handled his death strangely and they just never talk about it. Almost as if he never existed. (In her words). She's on Wellbutrin and Xanax because she has anxiety as well. She has a history of self harm and bulimia. 
She's had one suicide attempt through pills, but thankfully her mom saved her. I creep on her tumblr (she doesn't know) because she doesn't tell me all of her problems, but on there she is 100% uncensored. I saw a post that says that she is saving pills in case she wants to kill herself, although she said she probably wouldn't do it anytime soon.
I love her so much, I've been very supportive throughout our relationship, and I was the one that encouraged her to seek help from a doctor (that's how she got prescribed the medicine), but I feel like she is getting worse and I'm very worried about her. 

Thank you for listening to my story. Any advice would be appreciated. 
Thank you.

EDIT: She also has a minimum wage job at 22, doesn't go to school because of anxiety, and she feels like she's stuck and won't go anywhere. I'm encouraging her to enroll in college because she wants to go, but is too nervous.
