Iâ€™m just so tiredIâ€™ve never attempted. Iâ€™ve thought about it a lot. But Iâ€™m just so tired. All of the things I have to compartmentalize on a daily basis to keep going is wearing me very thin. I just lost my dad. I just lost a cousin. I know if I went it would seriously wreck my family. But I donâ€™t even care anymore. I just want to fall asleep. I donâ€™t want to keep fighting. Each day gets harder and harder and I feel crazy. I do what Iâ€™m supposed to and itâ€™s just not working anymore. Thanks for reading.
