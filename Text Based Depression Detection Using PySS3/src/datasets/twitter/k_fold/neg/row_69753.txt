Can you will yourself to want to live?I was talking to a good friend of mine yesterday and he said that if I force myself to improve then I will naturally enjoy living once I have sufficiently self improved.


What do you think of that? 

I'm not sure as I have never wanted to live and have always resented being alive for as long as I can remember. Even during so called 'happy times'
