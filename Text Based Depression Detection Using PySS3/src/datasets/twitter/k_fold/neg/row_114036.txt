I don't want to kill myself, but I don't want to live anymore...TL;DR is in the title. 

I have been struggling for so long. 6 years on June 10th to be exact. A simple ankle sprain at work turned into a 4 year misdiagnosis in which I lost everything. My spouse. My house. My self esteem. I don't even know what confidence is anymore. I live in pain 24/7 and suffer from PTSD, GAD, and severe depression. I have not had proper medical care for the injury through the worker's comp system throughout this whole time. I have been held on seven 51/50's since 2015. 

I don't want to kill myself because I know suicide won't end my pain, it'll just pass it on to one of the very few people I have left in my life, but I also don't want to live anymore. 

I lost my job at the beginning of this month due to my last 51/50 hold. I'm supposed to have another surgery next Wednesday which may not fix me and regardless it will keep me out of commission for the whole summer. 

I've been struggling keeping a roof over my head, keeping my power and trash service on. And then today, even though I went in yesterday to make a payment with the last of the money I have for both PG&amp;E and Tracy Disposal Service, they still suspended my trash service.

What is the point in continuing on? Everything has gotten progressively worse over the last 6 years. That's more than half a decade. What am I supposed to do anymore? I just don't understand why I should try to continue on. I am really wishing that something goes wrong with surgery and it kills me. Because I'm not courageous enough to do it myself yet. I don't know. I just don't know anymore.
