I want to dieAs the title states it: I want to die.

Iâ€™ve been off my antidepressants for three years now. I thought I could handle being off them since I canâ€™t afford them and eventually make enough money to get more meds, but I was wrong. I canâ€™t get a job. No one wants to hire a person who has a spotty resume. Iâ€™m so unmotivated to do anything. I lost the motivation and determination to work on my art, to get up and do things like find my lost cat, and to clean my crappy apartment. 

What makes it worse is that my memory is slowly fading and Iâ€™m only 23. I can barely remember what I did last week, and now my roommates say I chose a different soup the other day even though I was so sure I chose a certain one I wanted. 

Iâ€™m useless to society. I want to just end my life or end up in a coma. I want to just stop existing as itâ€™d be better if I wasnâ€™t around. My roommates would be happier if I was gone, Iâ€™d cause them less trouble: Iâ€™d be less of a burden than I already am.
