Iâ€™m going to get diagnosed this week.I suspect that I am on the autism spectrum. 

I feel like itâ€™s pretty severe. And Iâ€™m pretty sure everyone around me probably suspected it too. 

I might be considered high functioning but tbh, Iâ€™m probably not cause once something overwhelming happens I end up quitting. 

Iâ€™ve always been developmentally fucked. I always knew something was wrong with me. Always. Just didnâ€™t know what exactly. itâ€™s been a struggle for me to live my 33 years of life and Iâ€™ve always wondered why. Always wondered why Iâ€™m obsessive,and repetitive, and why Iâ€™m not like a normal 33 year old woman. There might be something else wrong along with that. I was diagnosed with BPD, but never did treatment. 

My constant depression over the years has crippled me. 

And it still is. I havenâ€™t accomplished one thing in life. I honestly donâ€™t think Iâ€™m capable. Iâ€™ve always wanted to die, maybe thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve always been so fucking reckless. Meeting people off the internet hoping for that one person to just take me and kill me. Iâ€™ve always read those stories. Yet, out of all the people Iâ€™ve met..... Iâ€™m still here. Why? 

Living inside my head is traumatic, I feel like no one understands. No one will. My kids deserve a better mom. Iâ€™ve struggled. I donâ€™t think I do anything right and to top it off no one gives me praise to keep going. I wish I would have known that something was wrong with me developmentally and I probably wouldnâ€™t have kids, cause they donâ€™t deserve a mom with disabilities. That canâ€™t go to social settings, that canâ€™t talk right. That canâ€™t act right. It breaks my heart. 

The money came through. Which I wasnâ€™t expecting. So tbh, Iâ€™m just waiting for the perfect day and time. My bday is coming up and I donâ€™t want to turn 34 with nothing to show.
