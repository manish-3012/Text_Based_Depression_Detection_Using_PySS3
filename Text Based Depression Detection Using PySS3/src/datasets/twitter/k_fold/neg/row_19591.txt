Just arranging a few thingsMoved to London from Paris a few weeks ago for a job.
Job is shitty. Job is killing me. They ran after me for weeks and it's the worst thing. Everything hurts. My colleagues don't even care for me - they're supposed to train me but they can't be bothered.

I'm going to help my boyfriend secure a nice flat close to the job he just got - he's gonna make a shit ton of money in a very nice company. I'm gonna make sure he's all fine with access to broadband and plenty of soylent like food.

Then I'm going to go. Just arrange a few things and go.

I don't know how yet. I just know I've got no future. I'm ugly, I'm fat because I was raped too many times and my head's fucked, my brain is non fully functional due to depression, I've got nothing.

Not even friends - no social life here, very limited in my home country. 

That's the last option there is. That will hurt less than anything else.
