I canâ€™t keep on doing this shitI really try you know? I try to do all the shit iâ€™m supposed to do and I somehow manage to fuck up even then. Thereâ€™s seriously something wrong with me and my Anxiety is actually going to end up killing me I canâ€™t do this shit. Today I just curled into a ball and struggled to breathe for what felt like hours, I canâ€™t help but think if any of this is even worth it?? why couldnâ€™t I have just been healthy?? I just want some fucking relief from this hell hole of a brain!!!! And I bet you I couldnâ€™t even type this shit right, iâ€™m sorry if it doesnâ€™t make sense
