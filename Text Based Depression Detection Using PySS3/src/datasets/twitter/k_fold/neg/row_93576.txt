I wanna mean somethingI feel like I donâ€™t mean anything to anyone I feel like Iâ€™ll always be nothing to everyone everything I do doesnâ€™t matter Iâ€™ll always be second place compared to everyone, and when I feel like one person hates me I feel like everyone hates me. I just feel stuck I want someone to care about me as much as I care about them but they donâ€™t and everyone tells me to just get over it but I canâ€™t I feel so behind and I just wanna be happy I just wanna be a big part of someoneâ€™s life I wanna feel like Iâ€™m doing something, anything I look for validation in the wrong places and it ends up making me feel worse. It feels good in the moment but at the end of the day it hurts it feels like anyone could take or leave me. Iâ€™m nothing to no one, Iâ€™m no one going nowhere. It fucking sucks people only want you to see what they can get out of you.
