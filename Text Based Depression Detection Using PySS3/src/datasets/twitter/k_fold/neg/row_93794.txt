My finances are pernamently ruined, the usa is falling apart, and suicide is my only optionRight now suicide is my only option because my finances are pernamently ruined from covid and not getting another stimulus bill. There's no way I'm ever going to be able to leave the usa when Obamacare ends up getting overturned. And I don't even think I'll ever get to leave my parents house ever again. I can't even pay for my cars registration and my state doesn't have the option to extend the payment of it. Then we can't forget about climate change, its now almost October and it's still almost 100 degrees outside in California. It doesn't even look like there's gonna be a winter this year
