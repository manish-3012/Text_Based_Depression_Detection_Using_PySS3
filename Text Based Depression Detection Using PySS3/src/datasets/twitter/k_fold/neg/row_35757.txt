I just need to make the next 72 hours or soIm a garbage person. Im staying at the family home cause im in between jobs.  Yesterday my family said they were having xmas early and they thought it would be better if I wasnâ€™t there. So I gotta disappear for approximately 72 hours. Starting in about 12 hours.  I think about setting myself on fire alot because I donâ€™t want anyone to see my face ever again. But then i think it will be a whole ordeal for my family. But then i think they do not want me around and I should set myself on fire. But then i think im being over dramatic. Then i think that I should pull a frodo and just disappear. Then i think I should wrap myself in heavy chains and jump in the big river and maybe if the donâ€™t find my body atleast they can pretend im out wandering somewhere. Something has happened in my brain cause two years ago i was thinking how i was gonna bake a pie for my family and how can I make it extra special. Now I am thinking how if anyone sees me whats the fastest way i can kill myself. Im literally reassured that i got a bit of cash in my pocket and worst case scenario i can go to the gas station buy gas and set myself alight; that is a comforting thought to me now. I might just run away that seems fine.
