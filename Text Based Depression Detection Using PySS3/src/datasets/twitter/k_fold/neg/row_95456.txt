What does it mean to be suicidal?It has recently come to my attention that a lot of people lurk here who are not suicidal. So I thought it might help to explain something. 

I think people who have never been suicidal don't understand what it means. They get the impression that a suicidal person is just very sad or upset, but it's way deeper than that. Sure, sometimes people get sad and have "thoughts of suicide", that's normal and probably happens to (and I don't use this word lightly) literally everyone. 

But to actually be chronically suicidal is different; it's the symptom of several diseases. The primary function of the human brain is self preservation, so taking that into consideration chronic suicidal ideation is organ failure of the brain. It convinces you that it's for the best, that you are actually doing harm to the people and things you care about by NOT killing yourself. That's not just a fleeting idea, you believe it, it is obvious to you the same way the sky is blue. And the physical sensations are excruciating. Your mind feels like it's on fire, not in a metaphorical way. 

That's why we don't want to hear your empty words about how we're great or it gets better. That has no meaning to a person suffering in that way. The words mean nothing, it's just gibberish. We don't need words, we need medicine, the same way someone in kidney failure needs dialysis. So if you really want to help make changes to the healthcare system and ask how people are doing BEFORE they're suicidal and cannot hear you.
