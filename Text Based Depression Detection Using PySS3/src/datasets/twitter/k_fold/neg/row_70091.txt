im sitting in my laundry room wanting to die.im sitting downstairs in the basement while my parents are fighting upstairs. I'm 16 and I dont see any point in living anymore. I've been down here for roughly two hours and have cut my arms a fair bit. I dont know how to make it stop. my feelings.

Both of my parents are serious alcoholics in denial, its teared all my siblings apart. my dad is also getting checked for colon cancer so if he actually does have it (and he has a lot of the symptoms, it all lines up almost perfectly according to him), they wont need me ontop of the thousands of dollars in medical bills and what will happen after he dies? my mom refuses to get a job and she'll never stop drinking.. will we just rot away?

I've had depression for roughly 7 years now, and I've been diagnosed with extreme anxiety and panic disorder along with that. I dont know how much more I can take. I tried killing myself in November, I want to try again so badly but I dont want anyone to deal with finding my lifeless body.

I'm too scared to get up off the floor, theres no way to leave I just have to sit here until things calm down but my heart is beating so fast, they're yelling and throwing shit the last time this happened last year my oldest brother got his finger broken and it never healed properly.
