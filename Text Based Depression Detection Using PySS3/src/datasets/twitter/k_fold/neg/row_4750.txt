I can't feel worthy enough of lifeI always feel so guilty, about everything, every little mistake I make

I was always alone before, only having my family, and I was already feeling guilty about being a bother to them

And now, I got friends and more people who seem to care, and the guilt is way worse than before, I just wished I would finally destroy the fear I have of pain or of failing in it, and just kill myself

I know well enough how useless I am, and I just wished I was alone, really alone, so that i could feel less guilty 

I cant handle when people care for me,  it always makes my heart hurt like hell, and I just keep repeating in my mind, I'm sorry and I just wished i was dead

Or when my family is worried because of some bad habit of mine, like skipping meals, and they just keep trying to make me eat, and they dont know I do it to hurt myself, and it feels so frustrating, I just feel like screaming how much I hate myself and how much I want to die
