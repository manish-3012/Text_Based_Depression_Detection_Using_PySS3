*******************

I'm just slowly losing my sanity. I'm 16 and it's like I'm too young for this and I shouldn't have anything to complain about. And yet my i feel like my world is falling. I have a girlfriend or at least I I think she still wants to stay with me but maybe my thoughts got the best of her. She doesn't like my suicidal thoughts and it takes it's toll on her. But besides that I don't even think I wanna survive the night. I'm losing my sanity and It's like I don't know who I am. My school life is falling apart. I'm really a smart kid but I go to school just to sit in class then and wanna leave. All I do is walk home after half the day. I think I'm losing this girl who I never got over for two whole years but I got her back. I'm a disappointment to my parents. I hope tonight I die. Just thought I'd share. 

The thing is I'm losing my sanity. I don't feel right in my head. I've done things in my life that should've never been done in life. I'm failing all my classes and I'm pretty sure the school counselors won't care if I'm not contributing to their test scores. I have an appointment to see a therapist but it won't matter. Ill probably hang myself or OD after that appointment. I don't have hobbies. Nothing makes me happy except my girlfriend who I feel I'm losing.
