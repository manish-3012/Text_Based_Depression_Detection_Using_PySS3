Y'know what I wish?I wish I was lovable. Not cute or charming or confident sort of lovable. Getting dates and meeting people is the easy part it's the price to really love me that is a killer 

Now mind you I speak generally when I speak of love, whether it be romantic or platonic 

To love someone is to understand them, and to understand them is to meet their demons, flaws, and, burdens and look past them, accept them, and be happy to be with them as companion or lover. The price of knowing, so to speak.

The problem is my price tag far exceeds my value. The inside walls of every human being's world are bleak, agonizing, complex and sorrowful. 

But I tend to find myself bleaker than most, that or incredibly uncaptivating to many others. 

It's always either I have too much baggage to front or generally ignorable. I suppose that is why I have fell into my social niche as the Jester/ Pseudo-Guru that entertains many skin deep commrades and friends today 

The type who always has a good story, can make witty banter, and is just complex enough to say tomes of cryptic advice with the little wisdom I've gathered in my short life. Easy to hang around, seemingly confident, supportive, and seemingly sharp with no price. Something everyone wants 

To most it's like I've dropped out of sky to hang out with them. My life has no details besides the generals and even those are skewed. 

People hate baggage, I'm all baggage, 96-98% tops. Maybe it's not talking about it that has lead it to fester into such a repugnant pit in my life but it's selfish to make another bare my bleak bleak world and my greivances that they would much rather ignore

I have plenty of companions. Not very many true friends, romantic love is an impossibility though I'm mostly fine with that- the idea of sharing my entire life with another makes me uncomfortable and paranoid as most things do 

This is my wish that or death, swift clean and easy
