Iâ€™m tiredIâ€™ve been really stressed for a while and everyday I keep thinking about killing myself. Iâ€™ve been crying a lot throughout the day when Iâ€™m left at home alone for no specific reasons. The only thing that stops me from killing myself now is the pain from hurting myself. But Iâ€™m really scared and I donâ€™t know what to do. I still donâ€™t want to live but I canâ€™t kill myself. I just wanna be gone ASAP
