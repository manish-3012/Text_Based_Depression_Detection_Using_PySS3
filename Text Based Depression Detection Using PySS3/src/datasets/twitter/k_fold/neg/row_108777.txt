I've really just fucked up everythingI've let myself lose a job that I really liked with people that I loved working with. I'm now working overnights which hasn't bode well for me in life before, I end up feeling more depressed and suicidal when I work jobs like this but it's all I could find.  

I've fucked up a lot of friendships and relationships recently because of my attitude towards the world and my attitude towards others, getting mad at people for no good reason and I'm guessing it's exhausting dealing with me. 

I've ruined the closest thing I've had to a relationship with this guy. I doubt he'll ever want to talk to me again after what I just got done getting upset at him about, and I don't blame him whatsoever.  

I joke about suicide a lot because it's how I dealth with my suicidal feelings a few years back, but the jokes are becoming reality and I want nothing more than to not be alive anymore.  

I know this all sounds really fucking stupid and I have nothing going on in my life that warrants me wanting to put a gun to my head but I don't know what else to do. I'm a shitty person that has absolutely no future, why keep living life like this?
