I want to disappear, but my friend did it first and I saw how it affected everyone elseAnd I shouldnâ€™t feel mad, but I just want to disappear without thinking about everyone else. I wanted to overdose on pills in the cabinet a few days ago but was too weak to. The next day, I find out my friend is missing. They have been known to be very optimistic and it has been speculated they may have had a breakdown prior to the day they disappeared. Word spread around quickly through posts shared by their friends and family. They never left my mind until news that they were found, and theyâ€™re still recovering. I thought it was enough to convince me to stay alive, but Iâ€™m back to square one again. I always get scolded for being â€˜stressedâ€™ because I have no right to be stressed when my parents are more â€˜stressedâ€™ than I am. That I have no right to go to a therapist because my depression isnâ€™t as â€˜heavyâ€™ as others. Iâ€™m too weak to kill myself and I can do nothing but cry about it. I canâ€™t even sleep through my pain without being woken up and then scolded for sleeping in through the day. I pray one day I wonâ€™t have to suffer anymore.
