fuck the worlda lot of people say that these days women r more respected but fuck that. all i get is being treated like an object. fuck this kid louis (iâ€™m dropping names cuz fuck louis) we have classes together since grade 7 (iâ€™m in grade 10) he always touches me inappropriately and one helps. teachers see this and the way he verbally abuses me and they donâ€™t do anything. i didnâ€™t tell anyone because idk iâ€™m shy and donâ€™t like to speak up. until last year, i was so sick of it i went to my school counsellor and they said they would talk to him about it. he got no punishment only a warning. iâ€™m sick of his getting away with this, i hate coming to school and seeing his gross fucking face. covid isnâ€™t any better, my grades r dropping and all my mom does is nag me to try harder. iâ€™m honestly trying my best but whenever i start an assignment all i think about is him calling me stupid and only good for fucking or my mom yelling at me telling me iâ€™m gunna end up on welfare like my aunt. the simplest things take so much effort to do idk how much longer i can do it. all i do is fail, iâ€™m not good at anything or have any passions. i feel empty like a shell. i have no reason to live, iâ€™m just a disappointment to my family.
