I just want someone to talk to about what I'm going through, and maybe give me some advice.i thought you guys would be my best option, if you know somewere else im all ears.

i'm in my teenage years and it feels that i want to be a comedian, but in my environment of school nobody else thinks so. whenever i make a joke there is constantly awkward silence afterward. i also am not doing the greatest in school, but that's a mix of me not wanting to try and not feeling motivated.

i have a loving family that i talk to often on these kinds of subjects, but they can only do so much. and lastly i dont really have any good friends in school.

and while the thought has passed my mind a few times, i am NOT going to kill myself. see username for more information.
