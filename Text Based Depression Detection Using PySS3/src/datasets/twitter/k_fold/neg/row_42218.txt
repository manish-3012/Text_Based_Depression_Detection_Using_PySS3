[UPDATE] I think this will be the last week of my life[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/yc7ad/i_dont_want_any_sympathy_or_anyone_to_tell_me_not/) is my last post. A lot of you commented and showed that you cared and wanted to listen which i really appreciate.

However, this week is the deciding week of my life. I have a lot going on this week and I feel that it's gonna be the end. I can't see a way round it and can't see me coming out the other end of this week.

I no longer sleep, I go to bed at around 2 every night and will wake up at 4/5 ish feeling ill and sick. I work 40 hours a week and get extremely run down, making me even worse.

like I said, a lot is going on this week and I think it's gonna be the end. There's no way round this week and at the end of it I'm gonna  be tired. Not physically, but emotionally. I'm going to be tired of life.

I have lost a lot of weight recently and now weigh under 10 stone, which for a male isnt good. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I live off having paracetamol and smoking to get me through each day.

I thank you all for your support, but the fact is, I've just been dealt a shit hand in this life. No other way to describe it. I try to make the best decisions i can but somehow i still manage to screw up. 

Thanks for all your time and support and listening but sometimes it's best to just let go I think.

Thank you
