Honestly, Iâ€™m just feeling really detached with reality.By all accounts itâ€™s probably some kind of mental disorder, probably schizoaffective. Itâ€™s probably got a bane of some sort. All I know is, Iâ€™d be okay if it was all gone tonight because it feels like a dream anyways. If I was to cease to exist tonight, at least Iâ€™d be done with these weird dissociative feelings. I donâ€™t even think Iâ€™d be sad because it all feels unreal anyways.
