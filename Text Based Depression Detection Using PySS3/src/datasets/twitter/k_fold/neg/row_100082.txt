17F, feeling less than human, no other option feels right.I'm not going to act on my feelings yet but they've lasted consistently for weeks now. I'm going to lay out background and whatever else.

I'm not new to suicidal thoughts. First thoughts around 14; was bullied and unhappy with how school was going for me. I was accepted into an early college program with a schedule full of classes I wasn't interested in. Things were rocky as ever when I started high school. I was fine in English class but not very remarkable in much else. My grades didn't reflect any sort of good that they used to. I had an unsuccessful attempt at 15 over a bad report card grade I had trouble explaining. 

As a result, I started medications for anxiety and depression back in August (I know, it's a long stretch of time in between, seeing that the attempt was in December). They worked well enough to soothe my physical symptoms, but the pharmacy always gave my mother and myself the runaround about what the psychiatrist prescribed. Basically, it seldom got filled on time. The issue has been talked about but no proper change was made. 

Prior to psychiatric involvement I was in school-based therapy with therapists that simply weren't right for me. You know the kind, the "stomp out those negative thoughts and breath" kind. Tried a therapist in the same facility that prescribes my medication. I was incompatible with this one as well; guessing this particular one was used to younger clients than myself. Pediatric care in general feels too "small" for me because of my age but there's not much to do but wait. I kept trying with therapists, but the one I felt connected with had to leave the state permanently early this semester to care for sick family. This came as a surprise to me because my school didn't even tell me she left. I was mentally limping from the hurt and shock of failing out of the early college program so things felt more alien than they should have. I was relearning how to handle high school. I found out by going to her office and an administrator simply telling me. A new therapist was hired soon after. Things were *okay* for a while but I just couldn't connect with her and recently terminated our sessions. I think the COVID-induced teletherapy clarified our incompatibility. 

In general, I have a problem with connecting to people. I have friends that I talk to regularly but I always feel alien even though we mostly have a lot to talk about. I listen to them talk about their favorite actors, their other friends, and their crushes and I don't *understand* it. I can rationalize and sympathize but it's like I don't have the capacity to understand thinking someone's attractive in passing over being able to recognize actors and be fans of their work or feeling like a song "saved my life." I've seldom felt it myself, though. What I have felt, however, are romantic feelings for people that have lasted a year or more. They're always intense. I always "study" the person and develop those feelings along the way. I don't always talk about it but I tend to care a lot and get confused when I realize what I feel. I've never had a significant other and sometimes that gets me down, despite my disliking of how high school relationships play out. People have shown interest in me, but the first time, it was mutual but neither of us really wanted to directly confess. He switched schools and didn't really want to hear from me after that. Approximately a month after, someone else showed interest but I wasn't feeling the same. We get along but there are things that'd stop a relationship. For one thing, I'm bisexual and he's homophobic. A match made in Heaven. I've never been to dances, never found someone attractive simply from looking, and not sure if I'm even capable of a relationship. Most people who even find me attractive just say it in passing then I never hear from them again. 

Throw in body image issues, "wahhh my mom doesn't understand me" to the nth degree, feelings of being an idiot because I constantly feel on the crux of failing high school (despite having the possibility to graduate early if I play my cards right), and the tiny detail that I get stuck on one topic of interest when I talk to others for too long. Then the unintentional rudeness and blocks of text I write trying to explain myself. How I learned what the phrase "social cue" meant at 16. You'll pretty much have everything making me feel worthless.

TL;DR- Not Like The Other Girlsâ„¢ teen is bad at school, communicating and connecting with people, can't get a date, and mental health services around here suck. 

Sorry things are jumbled; I have trouble with figuring out how to put things in proper order.
