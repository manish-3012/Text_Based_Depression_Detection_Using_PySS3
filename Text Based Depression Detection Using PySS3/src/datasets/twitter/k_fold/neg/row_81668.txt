What if I die and hell is realI am 19 years old and I want to kill myself. My life is a shitshow consisting of going to work, and spending the rest of my time drinking or doing drugs to try and dull my brain. I see no way to reconcile the mistakes I have made. I look back at my childhood and think about what a smart and good kid I was and I realize I can never get that back. There is no future I can picture that would be better than the nothingness of being dead. The 2 things stopping me are the fact that I dont want to make things worse for my family, and that I am afraid that there might me an afterlife. Nothing scares me more than the idea of being forced to exist forever. How should I deal with these thoughts?
