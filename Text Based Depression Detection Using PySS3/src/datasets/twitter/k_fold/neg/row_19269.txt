Doing it this Saturday It's been a couple years now that I've been thinking about it. I've tried ODing, hanging, cutting, etc. Lets start with school. I pretty much don't have any friends anymore. People now exclude from lunch, parties, hanging out etc. I don't talk to people anymore, or have really much social contact. I'm failing all my classes, except computer applications. My teachers gave up on me, along with my parents. My father is verbally abusive and probably bi-polar. He bullies me verbally as much as any kid at school. My mom is amazing, but she's always working. My only friends are Alex and Cailin. Cailin goes to a different school, and alex goes to mine. Alex is just like me, and we think the same way, and we're both pretty fucked up. Cailin is the most amazing girl in the world. She talks to a fucked up person like me, even though she's pretty and popular. I love her. But, she's not enough to keep me from killing myself. I'm addicted to ADHD pills and alcohol. I've smoked weed, nutmeg, and salvia. I hate myself for doing all those things. I'm a failing artist/guitarist and all my work just plain fucking sucks. I'm not smart enough to have a good career, and im too lazy and worthless to change. I'm overweight from an eating disorder known as being hungry and tired all the time. I have clinical depression (99th percentile) Anxiety (93rd percentile) and insomnia (73rd percentile) and I'm on ambien and depression medications. Still nothing helps. This weekend is the only opportunity I will have to end my life, and I'm going to take the opportunity. I don't know who tell besides Cailin, so I told you reddit. I have a suicide note written out that's quite long, and yeah. Any ways you guys can help, or am I doomed?
