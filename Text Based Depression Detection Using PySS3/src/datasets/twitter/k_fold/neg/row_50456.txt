half /r/offmychest half /r/suicidewatchI am so god damn fucking tired of living. I really am. nothing ever really gets "better" it just goes on. and on.. and on... troubles come and go, things get better then worse. that's life. 

no one wants me to go, i hear excuses like "it doesn't matter how you go someone will be affected by it, someone will have to clean up your body" welll that is kinda why we pay people to take the corpses away... why we have morgues, and funeral homes.

hey look at that, i just gave justification for those jobs, there's a reason to do it. it's not even selfish.

speaking of selfish, why the fuck are we called selfish for wanting to end our own lives? what living a life time of misery isn't enough? we have to do it so others don't feel the pain of loss? fuck that mom. I shouldn't have to live so you don't feel loss. that pain to you isn't going to be nearly as deep and as long as i have suffered. and in part thanks to your shitty parenting. thank's for ignoring the fact that i was severely depressed from a fucking early ass age.

I hate living. no matter what i do i'm wrong. even when i'm right i'm somehow wrong. 

i don't want a logical reason to keep living, because i have a hundred logical ones to come back with.

I don't want an emotional reason to live, i'm to fucking tired to give a shit anymore. 

All I want is a god damned hug, and a bottle of Malibu, and this fucking nightmare to end.
