I'm gonna intentionally OD soon can someone talk to me while I waitWell I never thought I would be here contemplating suicide. First off I'm homeless and a opiate/alcohol addict. I quit doing opiates and drinking about 1 month ago but I recently just became homeless so I moved in with my mother. My mom is a alcoholic but she was clean up until recently. I'm depressed and using opiates/alcohol to cope with the stress of being homeless since I don't know any other way to cope. I recently just found out my mother is drinking again and she used to help me with my stress but now that's she's drinking again she is never home. I feel alone and the only thing I got left to at least help me cope is opiates and alcohol so obviously I relapsed after 1 month of being clean. In a couple hour I'm gonna load up a rig so I can intentionally OD. All I want is someone to talk to in my last few hours. Sorry for the terrible wording and grammar I'm shaking really bad due to my anxiety attacks. I'm not asking for help only a friend in my last hours.
