One night ruined my life... and I'm so lonely it hurts.Sorry this post is long. I really need help and if you have it in you to read/ reply it would be great appreciated. 

TLDR AT THE BOTTOM

At the time, all the time my group of friends, especially the ones "closest" to me or the ones i hang out with most, always talk about how they have sex with girls and usually put it in a bragging manner. It's not just once, it's all the time. I'm 21 years old, similar for my friends. I'm a virgin and i hate how i cannot connect with girls.

I met a girl a long time ago at a party, although we messaged from time to time because we're both the same ethnicity. Maybe 2 years later i ended up being super lonely and felt pressured for being a virgin (especially by my "friends", even if not direct pressure), so i messaged her to smoke and we talked for a while. We go back to my car and i ask if she's down to have sex. She says sure. She asks if she can give me head and I say sure. She never mentioned if she has std's or if shes clean. I also ask if we can make out. I'm not good at this and I didn't realize at the time, but I should've asked if she was. I assumed she was because she didn't say anything... I figure people will be honest and will be nice to you because you're open and nice to them... lesson learned. I was too nervous to even lose my virginity, which i could care less about.

Next day i message her, and i have to force a response out of her if she's clean; i ask if she's clean and she tries to beat around the bush. Then i ask what do you really have. She also doesn't say straight up; she says herpes, and i ask what kind, only THEN does she say genital herpes. I think she gave me more than just genital herpes, but obviously she does not mention. I really hate how one night of me being very nervous (as usual) and me not knowing the norms for how to do things lead to me fucking up my life for the rest of my life. I cannot even lose my virginity now because i feel like nobody would want to mess with me because of what i have. I also cannot enjoy it the way i want to when i'm older... I'm upset because i shouldn't have to deal with this; she is literally the first person i did more than kiss with, and literally the 2nd to kiss, and she knew that...

She's since blocked me on facebook and snapchat, ignoring me and not helping me mentally. She asked when we were smoking and I mentioned I don't really have solid friends, and feel like i don't have friends. Even then, she doesn't care about me and is willing to block me, not listen, and fuck up my life.

I'm really depressed. This was maybe 7 months ago and i still haven't been tested. I have been taken care of by my dad and I'm fairly lucky in some aspects. My dad has been trying to take care of me because I broke my phone which is because of this situation, but he doesn't know about that. I "should" be happy because of "good" things happening in my life, but this is holding me back too much. Good things happen and i'm still really depressed. I cannot and have not told anyone about it. I don't have friends. My problem is also I don't have anyone to love or have sex with that i'm attracted to ( I just have a hard time dealing with attraction, i feel like it has to be emotion based as well. No one really gives me a chance and i don't take or i miss my chances).

**TL;DR:** I really feel like i cannot keep on living. I'm the happy and kind person (though not always perfect) to people. I'm the one who also never fits in. I don't have friends and no one really cares about me, even my "closest" friends. I really do not want to live in this world. I would be happy to suicide and fade away. Life is beautiful and i know that, but at this current moment it's just too much. I don't want to work hard to try and live a shitty life with no friends and no significant other. Even enjoying good things in life wasn't enough for me, I'm still depressed. I'm so lonely it hurts. I have tried many escapes but i don't feel there's truly an escape; everything is just a lie we can tell ourselves.
