Should I really consider suicide?I really don't know what to do and I don't even bother creating a throwaway account. I have those depressings thought almost everyday because I'm feeling helpless. I have the fear that I won't be able to improve my situation at all in the next few month. 

Still living in an apartment with my sister, not even sure if I'll finally be able to complete my college degree. I've been doing the job of a specialized educators for more than one year and I've been volunteering at a suicide hotline (see the irony) for more than two years (not working there anymore) and still they refused to admit me for part time study at a college near where I live.

I'm just working shitty evening or night shift with no possibilities to get a more reasonnable schedule in the near future. I just fear I will have to endure this schedule for years if I can't finally be admitted at school in September. I know for sure, I won't be able to do it for more than 2-3 years. I have almost no social life and I need to wake up at 5pm when the sun is already gone so I see almost no daylight. I love the job, it's just the constant pressure of working at night.

Also, I got really close to a female coworker last year, it got to the point where we were meeting almost every week and going to cinema but now, I can't see her more than maybe once a month. I feel as if I'm losing again another friend. As if the past is repeating itself, I had no close friend when I was in high school and I was ridden with social anxiety. The future was dark as I had difficulty to even approach a employer for a job, I had to do poor restaurant job because I was too shy and depressed to get myself something better. Sometimes, I feel like the past is repeating because well, I love working with people suffering from mental health problem but in the meantime, I feel stuck.

My birthday is coming next month, I will be 28 and still feeling like a failure
