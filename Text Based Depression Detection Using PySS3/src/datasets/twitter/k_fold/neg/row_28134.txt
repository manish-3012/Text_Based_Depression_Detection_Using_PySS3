The worst thing about a suicide attempt is if survived it you have to live with the scarsThis is part of the reason why Iâ€™m afraid to really attempt killing myself. I say really because my left arm is covered up scars of me cutting myself. In different areas the scars are deeper than the others because I was trying to kill myself but like always I coward outta of it. I guess I donâ€™t really donâ€™t want die but want to escape my life. I havenâ€™t lived the best life, definitely wasnâ€™t good human being. I just donâ€™t feel like I deserve to live and I should go to hell. I always look for shortcut, manipulate people to get ahead and life is finally getting to me and I feel like Iâ€™m ready to pay the price with my life. I know that there is better human beings that lost their life and that deserve to live than me.
