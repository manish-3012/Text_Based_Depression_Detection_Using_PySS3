im very tired.I feel so shitty I'm really tired. I'm only 15 i know I have my whole life ahead of me but im exhausted all of the time. I can't talk to anyone about how I feel bc I'm scared they will think I'm insane or annoying. I plan on taking all of my medicine sometime this week. not sure what the point of this is just wanted to get it off my chest since I can't talk to anyone else about it without getting the "it gets better" talk.
