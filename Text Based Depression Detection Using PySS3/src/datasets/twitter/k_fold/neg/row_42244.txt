I'm not doing wellI needed to say something to someone before I do what I'm going to do.  Reddit has been like a family to me for 2 years and I want say goodbye to someone.  I finally got a gun and today I loaded a full clip.  I can't tell you how ashamed I am for what I am about to do.  I always tried to be strong but thats just not who I am.  Thank you for giving me some relief in between my wild mood swings....this is one of the few thing that could make me laugh and something I will truly miss.
