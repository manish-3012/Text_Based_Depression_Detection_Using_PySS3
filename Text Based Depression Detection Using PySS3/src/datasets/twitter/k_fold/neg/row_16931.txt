contemplatingiâ€™m just going to vent here since i literally have no one to talk to . for the last 5 years , my grandfather has beaten &amp; mentally abused my grandmother with Alzheimerâ€™s &amp; dementia almost daily . iâ€™m only 17 &amp; try to stop him when i can , but my mother &amp; grandfather threaten to kick me out whenever i try to stop it &amp; when i try to call 911 . but today after my brother &amp; grandfather held me down and beat me , i called the police . i showed evidence of him abusing her &amp; pictures of her bruises &amp; told them about them holding me down and beating me . but the police couldnâ€™t do anything right now besides involve DCF &amp; shit . so now iâ€™m kicked out , i literally only have my phone &amp; the clothes on my body ,no money , not even any shoes on .i donâ€™t have a single family member i can go to or any friends . my bestfriend died a couple weeks ago &amp; i literally have nothing or no one . i am going to kill myself , most likely tonight . my life has been NOTHING but pain . to anyone reading this , i hope your life gets better &amp; i hope you get out of the dark place you are in &amp; live the beautiful life you all deserve . just because iâ€™m weak &amp; chose to die doesnâ€™t mean you should . i just donâ€™t feel i deserve to live anymore .
