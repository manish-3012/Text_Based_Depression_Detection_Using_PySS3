Not Today, Maybe Never Today I did it.

I was sitting on the couch watching TV around 8'o clock, I decided I was going to kill myself so I wandered into the basement and opened up the gun locker and grabbed my dads revolver I loaded one bullet into the chamber. 

I went back upstairs and sat at the table, I wrote out my suicide note. Once I finished I sat and contemplated for awhile, "Was this a good idea" I thought, I spoke out and told myself "Yes, this is the only way to end it"

The barrel of the gun was staring me down from the other side of the table now. I reached for the gun and put it to my head.

I looked out of the large sliding glass door that on looked a large lake and a field, the sun was setting, I'm about to pull the trigger now.

I take one last look at the sunset over the lake and ask my self " What am I doing?" I put the gun down, and opened the chamber up and removed the bullet, i put the gun on the table and walked outside to the shore of the lake and sat down.

This was the first time I've tried to kill myself, the sunset made me realize that, I'm still young, I've got my whole life to explore and do new things everyday.

You may have seen my first post, the medication I was prescribed is working now, I no longer feel depressed or have suicidal thoughts, I don't cut my wrists. I start school in a few weeks, there I will be ridiculed for my looks, lack of intelligence and anything else they can think of. I'll just tell myself "Will this stop me? No I stopped myself from suicide, nothing will stop me"
