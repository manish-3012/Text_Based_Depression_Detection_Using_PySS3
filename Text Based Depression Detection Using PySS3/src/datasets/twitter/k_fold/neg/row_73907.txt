Thoughts of dying in a car crashSometimes I think of crashing my car. I feel like I've let down and disappointed too many people in my life. The two big things holding me back are:

1. The thing I don't want to happen before I die is having regret that I may have ruined someone else's life by trying to end mine.

2. The last time I saw my best friend was before she was in a car accident. I don't want anyone to have to lose their best friend even if they're a complete stranger to me.
