Hope for those of you who suffer from depressionHi guys, I am lucky to not suffer from depression myself. Still I feel like I need to tell you this. I have a boyfriend for 14 years now. 8 of these years he had depression. It was so bad he couldn't do anything but stay at home and play video games or read. He couldn't work, go to college or du any house chores. We couldn't do vacation either. At one point he planned a suicide but didn't go through it because he didn't want to hurt me. So he made a promise to himself to stay alive even if he felt like this forever. He was in such a bad state that he wouldn't believe he would ever get better. He wouldn't see a therapist either as he didn't believe it would help. However at some point two years ago it DID get better. He started getting hopes for the future, slowly started to go out again, after a time he even started college again. It isn't perfect still, there might be times when he feels off again, is very nervous, or even has panic attacks. BUT he lives, not as in breathing but actually living. He studies, has plans for the future, we do activities together, do vacation and the most important thing: he can feel happiness again. There are moments when I see him just laughing out of joy while in his depression times I don't remember seeing that at all. So what I'm trying to tell you is that it might feel absolutely dark and hopeless for you now, it did feel like that to my boyfriend, BUT that doesn't mean it has to be that way forever. I don't now what caused the change for him, to me it seemed like absolutely out of nowhere that he started to feel better. So HANG IN THERE! Just don't give up hope!

Although it seemed like out of nowhere there might be one hint I can give you. I feel like at some point there was a slight mood shift for some reason and what my husband did was to try to work his way up with that and not to be frustrated by little backlashes. He focused on having tiny achievements every day, something like going out for a walk with me. And from time to time the achievements got bigger, like applying for college or later visiting the courses.

Anyway maybe this helps you, I really hope so. And I wish you all the best of luck in life!
