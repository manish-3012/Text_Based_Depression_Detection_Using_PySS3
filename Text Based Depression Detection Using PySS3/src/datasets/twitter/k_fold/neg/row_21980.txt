I'm contemplating if I should follow through with killing myself tomorrow or reschedule my suicide dateRight now I have my final day set to July 31st. So not too much time left. Although I did decide on the date a few months back. I'm not opposed to leaving this world tomorrow tho. I have a few methods I can use to kill myself. Which includes hanging, jumping off a bridge or building, and/or taking lots of pills.
