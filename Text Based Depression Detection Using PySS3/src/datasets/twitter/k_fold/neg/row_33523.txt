I wanna die but I can't???I want a foolproof way, I don't have access to a gun (because reasons) bleach is not really that effective, they don't have those fancy tall ass buildings where I live, skittling my wrists takes too long, hanging is too painful, I'm considering maybe fire? Or just straight up electrocution because I might as well go out flaming (whatever)
Otherwise... I'm stuck?????

A little backstory: this world we live in is truly and utterly fucking faked up and I wanna die so I could wake up (daaaaamn) 
Seriously tho, I can't anymore, I mean I love my parents and shit but there's only so much I can take, and I can't live anymore knowing that THIS is actually life, like literally I'm gonna end up with nothing if I give you back story just fucking answer the question please, 
Is electrocution legit?????
