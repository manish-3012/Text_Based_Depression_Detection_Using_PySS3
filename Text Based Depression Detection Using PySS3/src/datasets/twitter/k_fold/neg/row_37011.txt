I want it to endI moved my family to a town I dont know anyone in. I have a constant thought of just ending it all and getting it overwith. I have nobody to talk to all my friends are far away. The only friends I talk to on a regular basis is my friends I play xbox with. My wife thinks that's lame and has been leaving to go see her friends regularly and either coming home at midnight or just staying the night. That makes me think shes doing other stuff behind my back. I dont want to get a divorce because I cant live while paying child support for 2 kids. So why not just end it? I've been in a dark pit lower than any word in my vocabulary and I seem to be getting deeper and deeper with no bottom in sight.
