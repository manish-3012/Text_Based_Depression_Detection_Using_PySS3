Iâ€™m just disgusted with myself.No one isnâ€™t gonna really care but. I just hate how everything in my life is going. Itâ€™s even to the point I canâ€™t really explain itâ€™s like everything can come out right when Iâ€™m talking to myself out loud (crazy I know)

I just hate that really keep up with my hygiene and I knows itâ€™s expected of me cause Iâ€™m a girl. And you know I always get the â€œwow you as a girl you take care more of your appearance.â€ But itâ€™s like Iâ€™m too bored or depressed to do that. Hell even doing simple stuff 

I hate how hyper sexual I am even now as a 17 year old. Even as much as I try to change it just for my safety. Itâ€™s like I canâ€™t change anything about it. Iâ€™m just naturally a slut I guess. But, either way men donâ€™t like depressed ass girl even when there hyper sexual 

Iâ€™m just so bored and depressed with just everything I canâ€™t even really get out of bed. Iâ€™m always just under my covers either crying or on my phone seeing more negativity cause itâ€™s always there. â€œOh just shut off your phone and do something you always in bed.â€ I know that you donâ€™t need to always throw something in my face that I already know and I hate it. I wish I can just be gone. But, Iâ€™m too depressed and my anxiety is too much of a mess to even kill myself. 

Not only that Iâ€™ve gotten so many comments on how skinny I am because of me not eating a lot. â€œYour so lazy to eat. And you only eat when someone serves you.â€ I just donâ€™t really think about eating, Iâ€™m even too depressed too do that. I was even a little disgusted on how my dad said oh your butt used to be a little bigger but now itâ€™s your much more boney. 

I just wish I was like myself when I was younger I wasnâ€™t as depressed till now. But now Iâ€™m just a terrible waste of space.
