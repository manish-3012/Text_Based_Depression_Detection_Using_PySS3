How to assure a suicide note is delivered?Do people ever deliver their notes directly to be put at ease that they know it will be read by them? In the situation of having multiples they want delivered to different people. I've thought about this frequently... what if the person that finds the letters decides not to pass them all along? What if they get lost/ damaged somehow befor hand? What if they decide to be nosey and read ones that were meant to be only for a specific person?

Just wondering if it's a thing for people to mail out their letters. Or hand deliver it to people with a stipulation of not opening it till a specific time?
