I forgot my suicide binder in school(Sorry if this doesn't belong on here. I just needed to put it somewhere...)
I wrote a suicide note and had it printed off and ready to put in my binder (I write a suicide note for one person every day just in case I ever have another attempt.) The worst part was I left the binder on the desk when I walked out and when I came back to get it, it was gone. I'm so scared and I dont know what to do! It had pictures of my scars and cuts in there too. I just hope my parents don't send me off! I'm sitting here right now just scared for what's to come when I get to school tomorrow
