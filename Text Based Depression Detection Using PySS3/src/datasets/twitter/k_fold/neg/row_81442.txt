Iâ€™ve been having extremely vivid suicidal thoughts, then the one good thing in my life turned out to be just a lie.I found out my bf has been hiding a lot from me. He could be hiding more for all I know... he hid the fact that he was talking to an ex which I wouldâ€™ve been fine with if he told me upfront, instead I found it in his phone. She even asked â€œwonâ€™t your gf get jealous of us talking?â€ He said â€œyea probably but Iâ€™ll deal with it.â€ I found this out 4 days ago, it happened over a month ago. Last night I found out they hung out on one of the only days we werenâ€™t together (we basically live together, aside from the occasional night he goes home to take care of some things). When I asked if he did, he denied it til we went through the messages together. 

I love him more then I think I have ever loved someone. I told him about my past with my exâ€™s cheating on me doing the same exact things.. itâ€™s like he doesnâ€™t care about me at all. I want things to work bc I honestly thought he was the one, but I donâ€™t know if I can ever trust him. Every opportunity I gave for him to tell me the truth, he decided to hide things instead. For the past 2 weeks my suicidal thoughts have gotten worse, to the point that it scares me. It consumes me at every point. Iâ€™ve been having extremely vivid thoughts and I havenâ€™t had them this frequently in a long time. But everytime I saw him, I felt better. I felt safe. I felt loved. Heâ€™s the highlight of my day, my best friend, and the love of my life. Iâ€™m going to try to be strong... but I have no clue how. 

The fact that I gave him my full trust and I thought that he would never lie or hide things from me like the others did... only to find out heâ€™s just like them... I canâ€™t trust anyone. Iâ€™m not saying that if i do go through with it that itâ€™s because of him, itâ€™s just like it was that one good thing I had. Everything else has been so shitty lately. The world is so cruel, and I thought I found the one nice genuine person... but I was wrong. There are no good people.
