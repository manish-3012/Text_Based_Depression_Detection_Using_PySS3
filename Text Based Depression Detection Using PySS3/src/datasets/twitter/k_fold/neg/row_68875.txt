TerrifiedI dunno why I'm doing this but I'm struggling a lot right now and need talked down.
My life recently has hit the shitter.
A few false accusations mixed with white lies to make my life seem more put together than it really was has slowly started to cost me literally everything. I'm $2000 in debt, losing the love of my life, and the only people standing with me are people who know the truth of everything happening. I have to sue people for slander and defamation of character but it's only gonna cost more time and resources. I'm 25 and I feel like I am starting all over again with nothing due to mistakes from the past that I have and haven't made.

I can't go to a professional about all this because I know they will just tell me that "It will be ohkay in time" I don't need time. Cause it will be better but then get worse and then better and worse yet. I can't keep doing this. I need help.
