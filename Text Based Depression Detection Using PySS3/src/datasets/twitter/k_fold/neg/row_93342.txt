StuckI had an attempt two years ago, and lately have been seriously considering it again. My mother thinks that I'm doing better and couldn't be more oblivious. My father hasn't been working because there is something wrong with his discs, and he can't go back to work until something is done, but it seems like no one is doing anything. My dog is has been having health issues for the past 2 months and probably won't be alive for very much longer. My relationship has been on a steady decline and I am so easily annoyed or irritated by my partner. I have lost all of my friends. I struggle to make new ones. I have no one I can talk to. I have tried medicine and therapy to no avail. I can't help but feel that any time I interact with someone, they would rather be doing something else. I get so anxious over small stupid things. I don't think anyone will believe me. I don't think the doctors will do anything. I don't have the power to do anything. I feel like there is nothing left I can do. Any time I try to bring it up to anyone, I feel like they get frustrated at me or give up on me. I hate bottling this all up and then sharing it to someone who doesn't know how to react.
