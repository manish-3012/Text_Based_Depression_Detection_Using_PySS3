Reaching for nothingI'm plagued by these thoughts. I know there are so many people who have it worse than me. People who keep going with a smile on there face. Some days are better than others but today is bad. No matter what anyone says it doesn't help. Their words feel empty everyone seems fake. I feel like no one can relate although I'm sure everyone knows what it feels like to be sad and alone. I feel so helpless.
