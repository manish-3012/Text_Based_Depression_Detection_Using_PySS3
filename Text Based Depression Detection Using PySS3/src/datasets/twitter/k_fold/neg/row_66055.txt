Viscous circle of being weak  I just don't know what to do. Getting help was always my life line, like if it got too much but i can't. I keep going and going to my Doctors and telling them and they keep referring me to webpages which i've read a thousand times, they keep saying i'm young and i'll grow out of it even though i'm nearly 21. My family doesn't "abuse" me but they have the mentality of school children. Any slight weakness and that's it. I'm 20 years old and all i want is for all this to end. I've tried everything i can think of but this has gone on since i was 15 and i'm not a strong guy, 5 years is 5 years too long for me. I had therapy sessions when i was 17 for this type of thing and for a while i was ok but it came back and i can't cope. I'm completely dependent on alcohol to suppress my anxiety, i can't leave the house for nausea. I've just failed my 2nd year at uni because i had to attend the exams drunk to cope. I've lost all my friends, i can't get a job for anxiety. All i can think about is cutting myself open, the only thing that stops me is seeing the scars on my wrists and remembering i'm too cowardly to do it properly not as in i found something to live for, just that i'm a wuss. But at the same time this isn't living, this is barely surviving. I can never have a life like this, hold down a job, have kids and subject them to this. I used to think that if you talk about suicide that means you don't want to really do it, i mean hell i'm reaching out to strangers on the internet, but when i think i'm 20 years old and i spend my time drinking until i can suppress these thoughts, it's never seemed more appealing.
