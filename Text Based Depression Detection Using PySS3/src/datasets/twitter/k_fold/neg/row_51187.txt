I'm going to kill myselfI'm a 20 year old girl with anxiety, depression and mild Aspergers. My teenage years have been difficult to say the least. Now I've just been diagnosed with Chron's disease and the beginning of arthritis. One of these is already bad enough but I feel as though I'm being tortured. I've tried so hard to be positive but I give up. I have no hope for the future, I cannot live in fear for my lifetime. I don't even have any plans for career or university wise so I'm just a worthless POS. I want to die
