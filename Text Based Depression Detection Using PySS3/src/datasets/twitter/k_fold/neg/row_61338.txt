Help! I live in US and got a call from someone living in Hong Kong that is more than worrisome. I have no idea how to contact Hong Kong police.I don't have international calls on my phone so I tried google phone but google phone doesn't accept emergency things like 999 and the other police lines I've tried came up on google phone like "Hong Kong police" but said they couldn't connect. Should I call my emergency line 911 or IDK what.
