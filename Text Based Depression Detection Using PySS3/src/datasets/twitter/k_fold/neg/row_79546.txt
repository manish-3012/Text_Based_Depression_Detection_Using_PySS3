Feels like nobody loves or respects me anymore 16mI'm the black sheep of the family, always being made fun of and nobody stops it. My dad is emotionally and verbally abusive. It feels like family is all I've got since because of them I have no friends. My father ends up scaring them away. My mother seems to be the only one who cares but she says generic shit and I feel as if she doesn't really care and I'm depressed and a fucking mess. My sibling, mother and father can get angry at me all fucking day for no reason at all, but if I retaliate they tell me to shut the fuck up. If I'm angry, I'm suppressed easy as that. I'm getting ready to leave.
