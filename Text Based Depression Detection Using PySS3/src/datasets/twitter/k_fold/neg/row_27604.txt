I dont think life if worth living anymoreIve been thinking of ending it all  recently. I feel like I have nothing to live for. Im 21 and Im still not sure of what im doing at college. Im supposed to be graduating this year but im way behind. I have no friends and I distanced myself from my family. I havent been happy in a while. Ive had a partner that made it better but he left me. I feel so lonely. I think its time I go away I just dont know how to end it. I just want to never wake up. Have a peaceful death because I dont know how to end it. All i know is i just dont want to be alive anymore, I dont want to live. I just want to be gone.
