My life is destroying the lives of those I love.I feel like I'm just another empty soul pouring my self-pity into this forum. I understand that others have felt this way, and worst of all, I know that others have had it far worse than I have it now. I know that I have no right to complain; I have a wife and kids, a good job, and a good home. 

I have come to realize that my wife hates my fucking guts and my children are terrified of me. A couple years back, I got in a nasty wreck on the way to work. While I don't have the courage to actually kill myself, I wish beyond everything that I had just died that day. They could have been completely over me by now, and happy with whoever my replacement might have been. 

When I commute to work, I long to go headfirst into the median. Maybe it will look like an accident; my kids won't have to grow up knowing that their father took the easy way out. My wife could move on without having another divorce on her record, and without having to explain to her kids that dad killed himself because he thought she had found someone else and she had started to hate him.

/sob story. I have so much more, I just have nowhere to go right now. I'm home alone; my wife left me for her friends again, and my kids are at their grandparents house because there's no school tomorrow. I don't really have a method to do it tonight, but I keep feeling like it will just be another day before I steer into oncoming traffic. I just appreciate the fact that someone might read this and know that I tried so. fucking. hard.
