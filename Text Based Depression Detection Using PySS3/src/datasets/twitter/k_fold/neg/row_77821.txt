Socializing makes me want to dieI wish I was just being dramatic right now

Itâ€™s just that Iâ€™ve never fit in anywhere before. I havenâ€™t had an irl friend in years. People tend to dislike me because Iâ€™m extremely unattractive and socially awkward. 

Tonight I got invited to a voice call and I had a panic attack and left. There were a lot of people I recognized who werenâ€™t necessarily that friendly to me before and it just triggered my fight or flight. Iâ€™m used to people hating me so I had to yeet outta there. Sad thing is, this made me want to self harm but I didnâ€™t. Itâ€™s stupid but stuff like this gives me suicidal thoughts. Itâ€™s insignificant, but after years and years of being rejected and made fun of Iâ€™m just exhausted from it all
