Help me help my suicidal motherHi Reddit, I don't know if this is the right sub. Please help me help my mother to get away from suicidal thoughts that she starts getting more and more often.

My mother is 57 yo. Here's the situation: 

* She has been unemployed for a few years. She did babysit and do house cleaning on and off but it's just too exhausting. She knows age discrimination is real and gets more and more demoralized as she gets rejection upon rejection. She is qualified for other types of jobs (manager assistant type) but can no longer get them as employers privilege younger candidates with more self-confidence.
* Her mother (my grandmother) passed away a year ago. My mom was very ambivalent about it, going from "Good riddance" to "I miss her so much" and everything in between.
* I've been living in another country for 10 years. I see her every once in a while but we talk almost weekly on WhatsApp.
* My mother lives with her husband and my 3 half-siblings (19, 17, and 15 yo). They live in a 2-room apartment belonging to an old and ill cousin of my mother's. When he leaves this world my mom and my step-dad will be without a home and will need to pay rent.
* She has no savings. She must start selling my grandmother's stuff to pay her debts.
* The only thing that improves my mother's mood was going to the gym, but as of late it's no longer the case.

There is no substance abuse involved in the case of my mother, and she never had mental illness but she's very fragile and as time goes by she gets deeper and deeper into her depression. I don't think she would refuse professional help but she cannot afford it.

She just wants to end it all as she sees no purpose in living, she feels a failure and a burden. My step-brothers are concerned so they sent her to the gym :) But that will work only so much. She just told me yesterday she contemplates suicide but that she wouldn't want to pain us by having us set up her cremation (she witnessed this first hand for my grandmother). Notice she didn't think about our feelings but about the difficulty of setting up a cremation arrangement.

I must confess that as of late (1-2 years) I dread phone calls with her and I avoid them because she's always depressed and it's up to me as her eldest child (33 yo) and only daughter to comfort her, but this drives me nuts. I don't know what to do. I bribed her with a promise of a vacation to Greece in 2020 to bask out in the sun (but this is gonna be costly as I have to invite both her and my step-dad; I \_can\_ afford it but I am a bit annoyed).

Help?
