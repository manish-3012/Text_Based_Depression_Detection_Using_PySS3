My friend killed herself.In the last few years Iâ€™ve had life really tough. After having a baby I was bullied by my jealous boss out of my job and despite taking it to court (where she lied on oath) the case was dropped. My mum had a heart attack and post operative complications and was in a coma for some time. As my baby was newborn and she was on a clean ward, my husband had to stand outside with baby whilst I sat by her bed, nipping out to breastfeed. Driving 140 miles 3 times week to the hospital.
Then my dad had a stroke which left him disabled and unable even to say my name. Lastly I had a cancer scare (all clear in the end but a great worry). So anyway I had a nervous breakdown. I was on a bottle of gin a day and I was putting on my shoes to jump off the motorway bridge when I thought of my beautiful children and I called 999. Itâ€™s now 12 months later. Iâ€™m doing well, Iâ€™m no longer suicidal or drinking and though I struggle with some panic attacks and claustrophobia Iâ€™m feeling positive. My husband has been amazing and talking to him has been the best. Iâ€™m doing this without medication as I have an addictive personality so itâ€™s all herbal remedies and long walks and writing.
So a few months ago my husbands staff member and a friend of us both hung herself entirely out of the blue. She had relationship issues and money worries but it was just not something we expected. Iâ€™ve supported my husband best as I can and the funeral was heartbreaking (she was 29.) But I donâ€™t feel able to talk to him about the guilt I feel. I was her, basically, last year. The only difference is I reached out for help. I see the devastation my friend left behind, I donâ€™t think she would have done it if she knew how many people loved her and would have dropped everything to help her. How could I think of putting my family through that, even if I was ill? Iâ€™m angry with my friend, too, for not asking for help but I know she wasnâ€™t in that place and then I feel guilty again for being angry at a sick, dead girl.

... all I am saying is I understand what it feels like to want to die (or at least not want to live) yet I also understand how it feels to lose someone to suicide and I wouldnâ€™t wish it on my worst enemy. Please, please if you feel suicidal, please talk to someone new because I never thought Iâ€™d feel this... content and itâ€™s a cliche but thereâ€™s so much life ahead. Iâ€™m just so so sad my friend wonâ€™t see any of it.
