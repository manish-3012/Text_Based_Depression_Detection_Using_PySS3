I don't think things can continue like this.If the next 30 years are like the last 30, I am positive I don't want to experience them. I don't know if I could do it, but I have the means, sitting in front of me presently, and I can't quite get my mind off it. I can distract myself for a few days at a time, and try to be cheery when around people, but I consistently come back to this state of mind when the weight of my loneliness comes crashing down on me. I sincerely believe that a life without love is a life not worth living, and I am faced daily with the realization that it is almost certain that I will die alone. I maybe wouldn't want to slog through an extra several decades to come to the same end.
