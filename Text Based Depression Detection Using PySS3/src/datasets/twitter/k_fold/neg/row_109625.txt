The military sucksBeen in for a little under 3 years. Wanted to die like every single day since then. Just quietly deal with the bullshit, go to therapy, and pretend you don't want to get run over by these stupid soft tops that are slow as shit.

I really wish I would have died downrange. Life blows.
