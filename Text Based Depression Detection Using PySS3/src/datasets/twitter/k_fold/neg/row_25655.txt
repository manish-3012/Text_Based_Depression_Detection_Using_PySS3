I can't go on any farther.Nobody is helping me, and i have reached out to no avail. Life always kicks me when I'm down. I thought i was going to get a job, to buy hormones but i was wrong, so very wrong. Back to square 1 i suppose. I was hoping things were going to get better, and i caught a glimpse of happiness. But for some reason, i apparently don't deserve it. My whole life was meant to be painful. From the moment i could remember, all i remember is abuse.

Just abuse, and pain. There was never a time period where i was truly free from it. I was exposed to physical abuse by many people, held helpless by adults. Add the fact i was raped once, and once suffered from horrible seizures makes for a hellish life. Also gender dysphoria combined with depression, it's horrible.

And i cannot bear it anymore. I have suffered for too long, holding the weight that lays upon my shoulders. Well, my shoulders are collapsing with nobody to help me. I'll still be around for a little bit, maybe i can enjoy halloween but i ain't going on after that.

I was hoping for things to get better, but i was wrong. See ya on the other side within a couple of weeks.
