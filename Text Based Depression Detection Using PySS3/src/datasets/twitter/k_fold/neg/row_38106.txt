i think i'm abusing my familyi shout at them when they do the least annoying things and scream and swear at them when i'm angry. i've pushed my mom and hit my brother i don't fight him because he scares me but i'm still horrible to them in every way possible, i manipulate my mom and run away from everything. I've been doing stuff like this for two years now, i'm 16 and my mom has already had to call the police at least 10 times because of me.
i don't go to school anymore, my neighbors slam their doors in my face and people on the street look at me funny and i feel so paranoid and guilty and try to hurt myself instead a lot of the time but it's just me trying to be the victim! again!
i need to get out one way or the other but right now my family despises me, for good reason, and i have no right to get better so i'd rather just get out the other way
i wish i could do good for my mom for once but my whole life isn't real my friends think im kind and nice but everyone else knows who i really am it feels so selfish
im sick of how fucked up i am and i hate the things i've done yet i just want the easy way out of not being held accountable for my actions even if it means there will be consequences on my friends who are innocent
i hate this so much fuck
