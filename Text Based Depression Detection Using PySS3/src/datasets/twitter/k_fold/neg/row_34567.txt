Read the postFuck my life. Insomnia has me up at 2 in the morning. Depression is deteriorating me. I dont give a fuck. Im going to snap and there is nothing you or I can do to stop it. Too many fucking things. Seasonal allergies are killing me. Acid reflux is absolute hell. I am a worthless human being.
