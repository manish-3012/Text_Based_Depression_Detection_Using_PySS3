Suicide over breakup griefI broke up with my girlfriend over religion and long distance and now she is with another guy.
I feel like I wanna end it all. I want no more pain.
The pain of regret and guilt and the pain of never being happy again. I just dont see the point in continuing. I want to end it. It has been two months since the breakup.
Please God forgive me
