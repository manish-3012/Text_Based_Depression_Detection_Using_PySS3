Things feel gray todayI really just want to write this out in hopes that afterward I feel better.

Suicide has always been a taboo topic in my family. I'm not sure how common that is, but discussion about it was always avoided when I was growing up. When I was an early teenager, my little brother attempted suicide by overdosing on insulin. My parents had been separated for a few years, home life was bad, and my mom was out at bars at the time. I'm not sure why he did it or why he told me what he had done, but I was able to save his life with some sugar and a 911 call. After he got out of the hospital, we really didn't talk about it other than the initial apology conversation and my reassurance that I care. I only write about this part because of how close this hit home for me. This was the first time I really thought about what things could be like without me.

Fast forward years later and I'm going through a divorce. I initiated it because neither of us were very happy, we were fighting all the time, and nothing was working to fix it. Believe me when I say people change as they grow up. This time was particularly hard for me because I lost many of my childhood friends at the same time. My wife was also close with them, and they alienated me for whatever reasons they came up with, but I really felt alone then. My Mother, who has also been critical of my life decisions, had also been pretty hard on me about it and trying to work things out. Near the end, much after we were already separated, I learned that my ex had been cheating on me with someone throughout our marriage. I found out after I had stopped by the house to pick up personal items. I "stumbled" across some notes between the two when looking for my things in the house. It didn't really hit me until I was in my car leaving, but I remember it vividly. I sat in the driveway and it was pitch black outside. The only light on was the garage which was one of those daylight bulbs with bugs swarming around it. I sat staring at it feeling sad, angry, and very trapped/cornered like I didn't have control of anything. I didn't know what to do, but I cried for awhile while everything was fresh running through my head. I wanted everyone to understand what I was feeling, my friends, my mom, my ex. I wanted them to be just as sad and I this was the first time the thought of suicide entered my head. I rationalized this thought as a sure way to put them in the same space I was in at that point so they could understand just how much pain I was feeling. As quickly as I thought about it, I  I was also terrified of it. I felt alone on an island with my thoughts, but ultimately my self preservation instinct took over and dismissed the idea. I eventually calmed down and drove home to my apartment, but it was still a few days before I felt better.

Without going into great detail, years passed and things got better. I moved on with my life, remarried and started again. I hadn't really felt the same way that I did then, until very recently. I attribute it to the following context. My wife and I are struggling with starting a family. Not just a little bit, but rather 3 years of fertility attempts with multiple failed donors, in multiple freak situations - including a pandemic hospital shutdown. As I type all of this out it sounds made up, but sadly it's not. Thousands of dollars later and we're really not much closer. To add to the roller coaster, we were pregnant in-between fertility attempts, in a one-in-a-million chance because of her situation, but we miscarried the night before our first ultrasound appointment. During this mess my wife lost her job when the pandemic started, which isn't the end of the world for us but it does make things more difficult considering the previous situation. And while all of this is going on I have a number of uncontrollable stressful work situations. The kind that make me feel like I'm a failure and that I'm bad at what I love doing. One in particular this evening put me in a place where I once again have that same fight or flight feeling that prompted me to write this entire essay. I talk to my wife about all of this, but it's difficult when she's in a lot of this situation with me. I just don't want to feel like this and could use a refreshing perspective I guess.
