Ending up in the same exact place no matter what2017 I dropped out of college due to severe depression and stress of college. Spent most of my days alone and drinking 

2018 Abused alcohol and drugs to cope with the depression

Late 2018: Got into my first relationship to one of the most beautiful and wonderful people iâ€™ve ever met. Dug me out of my hole and put me on top of the world I got a full time job and my life had purpose

Mid 2019: Store I worked and closed and relationship ended. Enrolled in classes before this happened and now I struggle to sleep/ get out of bed in the morning considering dropping out. Back at square one abusing alcohol to sleep and my psychiatrist has put me on zoloft but itâ€™s just not working and now all my friends are 3 hours away at college and iâ€™m alone here. Ex-Girlfriend has already moved on.

Seriously just feels like I will always be in this never ending cycle of getting false hope and just come crashing harder than before each time. Despite all my past struggles and depression I never really considered suicide but the past few weeks has me heavily considering it because my life has hit an all time low. Money issues because I canâ€™t find a job that will take me with my school schedule, My classes are overwhelming at this point, and the only person who has ever given me a hint of happiness has moved on a month after we broke up. Oh yeah, I also got drunk when we broke up and texted another girl to come over but she was asleep, few days later my ex found out and said any chance of us getting back together is definitely never happening so thereâ€™s that.

This is my lowest point and I know things will get good just to get worse than this and at that point I fear that my only solution will be to finally do it.
