Leave of absenceMy school put me on involuntary medical leave of absence for being suicidal and having panic attacks. Iâ€™m held back a year, they kicked me out of dorms and Iâ€™ll lose my insurance. Theyâ€™re forcing me to do therapy program before I can come back which I wonâ€™t be able to pay for without insurance along with my meds and psychiatrist. I canâ€™t work because Iâ€™m no longer a student so I canâ€™t be an intern and Iâ€™m alone with my thoughts for the next 8 months. I think this is the most suicidal Iâ€™ve been, how ironic. Iâ€™ve been crying everyday and probably would have died already if it wasnâ€™t for my mom.
