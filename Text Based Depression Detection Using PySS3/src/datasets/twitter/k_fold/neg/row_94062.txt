I am just so sadI have a shitty life. I have a shitty job. I have a shitty vocational certificate that I can't get work with. I have no money. I owe money.

I don't really requiremuch in life. I like to think i'm pretty low maintenance. I want to love and be loved. I want to have a bit of luxury once in a while.

It was easier with him. He made me believe that the shitty things weren't so shitty, that you know I'd find a good job soon. In his arms, the pain and sadness weren't so bad.

But he's gone. I don't know why but he doesn't see me as a girlfriend or a lover anymore. more of a friend. and I don't know how to bear it anymore. I can't see what there's worth trying for anymore.
