Someone please help me, I don't want to die.It's been almost four years now that I've felt depressed, my entire life as a teenager has been me trying to deal with thoughts of worthlessness, unending loneliness, and suicide. I have no way of judging how badly my depression is anymore, I just know that I've been imagining shooting myself for three and a half years now, every day, and I've never felt as lonely and pathetic as I have the last couple weeks. It's always come at night, the guilt and the pain and the unbearable loneliness, but now it's always there. It's noon now, and I feel like I'd be crying if my family wasn't home to see me.

Logical arguments only seem to ever make me worse, there are only two thoughts that ever comfort me, hearing a girl tell me that she loves me and that everything's going to be okay, and shooting myself. Of the two, I've become literally convinced that the latter is a more likely occurrence, despite how much of a coward I am.

I feel completely worthless, unlovable, and at times, evil. And if I can think of any redeeming qualities of myself then I instantly remember that it doesn't matter because I have literally no social interaction with other people my age, and that I can never feel normal no matter what happens. I can't watch TV or read books that I haven't read before now because they always make me feel stupid and worthless, whether it's a comedy or an action movie or god forbid "coming of age" stories which guarantee that I'll want to shoot myself afterwards. There have been a couple moments that I've actually tested an extension cord to see if I could hang myself with it, and thinking about how easy it would be to overdose on my mom's medication or drown myself in the bathtub. I don't want to die, but the pain is just too much, and I have nowhere to go. Any time I feel better it only lasts for twelve hours and it's gone. I'm hopeless.

Please, somebody help me, I just want to feel human again.
