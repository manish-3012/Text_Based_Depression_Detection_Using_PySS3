TIMES UP PUHUHUHUHUHUHUI'm stuck in this destructive cycle, a decade has passed and nothing has changed. I'm just falling deeper into an inescapable depth of despair. Hope has since long abandoned me. I'm aging, no, rotting away in my room without ever having had anyone by my side. I've no friends, no job, no education, nothing, and I never will have any of these things because I've fallen down this endless abyss beyond the threshold of return, I missed my opportunity of rectification. I've lost my sanity; it withered away a long time ago. 

I'm only alive because I was weak, unable to achieve the salvation that lied within my grasp. I know I have to do it, otherwise the torrent wont ever come to a halt, it's ravaging my mind and at this pace I'll turn into something unrecognizable in no time at all. More so than intrusive thoughts eccentric delusions have already found it's way into my mind and conscience, I've gone psychotic. I have to put an end to myself before it's too late.

Most lack the empathy and mental faculties to understand my thought process and reasoning, no point in interacting with anyone else at this point. It's not like I've anymore insight to gain anyway, I'm perfectly capable to reach a conclusion on my own.

This will serve only as my final parting words in this world. This world set me up to feel nothing but despair from the very start and although I've succumbed to the agony of it I'll now through strength and tenacity put an end to this pointless charade, I will be tormented no longer. 

I DIDN'T LOSE, I WON. I have the power to end this world as I know it and I've also the strength to do so. I've won, I became the god of my own destiny.
