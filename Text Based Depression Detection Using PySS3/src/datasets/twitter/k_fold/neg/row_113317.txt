Here we go againDo I curse that I woke up again or be thankful for another day where things "might" get better. I could be thankful just for another day period, regardless of if things get better or not.
Sadly, the depression says..I wish I hadn't woke up. I don't feel like going thru the motions today. Sometimes its just too hard. Well..off I go with mixed feelings about being alive for another day. 
Praying for a freak accident to happen
