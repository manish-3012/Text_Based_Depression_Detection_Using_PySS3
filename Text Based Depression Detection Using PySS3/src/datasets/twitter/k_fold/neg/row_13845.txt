I think I may starve myself.I've dreamed of it since I was ten years old. And I can't get help. The mental health center won't return my calls. No one else will see me because I have no money and no insurance. And the office that handles food stamps won't return my calls either. 

It feels like everything is telling me to do this.

It seemed dishonest to not tell someone what I've decided on, so I'm telling you guys. I don't want to tell my friends. I don't want to hurt them. 

UPDATE: I finally got an appointment with the local mental health place. I had a friend notice how little I've been eating confront me and feed me. I don't feel okay, but at least there's those things. Thank you guys for trying so hard and being so kind.
