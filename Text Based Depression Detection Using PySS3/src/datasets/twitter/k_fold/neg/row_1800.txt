Any advice on stopping suicidal ideation?Lost my job and Iâ€™m a loser.  If it werenâ€™t for my kids Iâ€™d have walked into the ocean forever by now. Canâ€™t stop thinking about ways to die.  Iâ€™m a lousy husband and a disgruntled employee who gets fired.  

My parents named me after a grandpa who killed himself.  

What works for you to stop the thoughts?
