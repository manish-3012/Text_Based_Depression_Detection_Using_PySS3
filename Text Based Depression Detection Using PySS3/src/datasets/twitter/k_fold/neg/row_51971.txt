I'm ready.I have meticulously planned my suicide. Making it as painless and tidy as possible. And I feel great. 

The only thing motivating me right now to change my life is that at any moment I can end all the pain, just a quick trip home and I have everything I need to end my life very quickly. It's the only thing getting me through the day.

Does anyone have any other advice on motivation?
