Want to end itI can't even do this anymore. I had a band that didn't work out, everyone left on bad terms and insulted my instrumental skills, I barely have any friends, I lost my religion, my parents don't approve of my political beliefs, I make dumb jokes and am in fear of people telling my parents about things I've done for fear of them looking down on me. I'm uncomfortable in my body and can't get fit because my parents won't drive me to the gym. I'm just barely too young to drive and it's too cold right now to walk. My sister is a druggie and hates me and my parents, she's always fucking with us and trying to manipulate us, her boyfriend is a psycho. Im falling at talking to girls, even as friends. I feel like a pushover and just want it to end. Fuck my life.
