I don't want to get helpI don't want quick fixes. I don't want to distract myself from the inevitable which is my death. I don't want "someone to talk to" to sort out problems that are situational and existential in nature. I want to be done.

I've reached out to the hotlines, I've gone to therapy...but it's all so useless! I can't even hold a job, let alone get one now, because of my debilitating depression and low self-esteem.

I want to feel the cold embrace of death. I want to experience the last dying gasp before I cross over to the emptiness of nature and become one with the firmament. I am a waste of space--a machine that can no longer function, not because it's lost it's ability, but because it's lost its will to survive.

After all, we are all but machines anyway in a soulless world.

But I now have a method of conducting my suicide. My finger is on the buy button on Amazon as we speak. At least I can say I used my money for something positive. Oh yeah, and student loans, you can *shove it*. :)
