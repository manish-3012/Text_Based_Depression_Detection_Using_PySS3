Gave up on LifeIt all started when my mom and her fiance broke up and I quit the cello. Later I developed a bad picking habit and ruined my skin. Now I'm a 30 year old loser and want to kill myself. I'm thinking about trying again. As far as I'm concerned my life is over. No therapy or medication is helping. I feel like its my fault my parents arent doing well. Just wish id die already nothing helps me anymore. My life has been over because of my scarring.
