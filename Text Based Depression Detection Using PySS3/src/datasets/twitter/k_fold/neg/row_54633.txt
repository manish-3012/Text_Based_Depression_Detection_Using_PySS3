Things aren't going well.Everything in my life is starting to pile up.  I want to get help but I don't know if anyone will listen.  I want to remain positive but things are getting worse everyday.  I just don't want to do anything too drastic.  I've seen what suicide does to people close to the victim, but I'm starting to think everyone would be better off without me.
