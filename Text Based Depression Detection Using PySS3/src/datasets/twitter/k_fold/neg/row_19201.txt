I wish someone would kill meI'm a 16 y/o male, been suicidal for years but too cowardly to do it. I recently thought about having someone like a professional hit man kill me instead. I was thinking, as a birthday present. Sniper on the grassy knoll type of thing.  Anyway, does anyone have any experience with this, or any suggestions.  I'm broke so i cant really afford alot.
Edit: I also have several mental illnesses, including depression, am failing high school, and have been disowned by my father.  My best friend and neighbor is also suicidal, and we've been thinking of forming some kind of suicide pact.
