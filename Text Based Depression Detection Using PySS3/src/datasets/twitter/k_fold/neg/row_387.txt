I canâ€™t live with myself anymoreIâ€™m a truly awful human being, I just canâ€™t stand to be me anymore. 

Iâ€™ve had depression for so fucking long. No matter what I do, no matter what meds I take, no matter what therapist I see, it doesnâ€™t go away. It makes my life unbearable. It has become so exhausting to even breathe. 

Iâ€™m unbearable in of itself. My appearance is disgusting, my personality annoys everyone. Iâ€™m bi in a town full of homophobic people. Iâ€™m dumb and canâ€™t do anything right.

I donâ€™t know if anything exists after death but if something does, I hope the next life is better than this one.
