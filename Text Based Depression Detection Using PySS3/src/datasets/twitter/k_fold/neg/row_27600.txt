Iâ€™ve stopped taking my meds and I want to ruin my lifeIâ€™ve been on Fluoxetine and Risperidone on and off for about 4 years now, I flushed them all because I always somehow end up back on them after a day or two off, this time itâ€™s been 5 or 6 days and Iâ€™ve quit my job, gambled my entire life savings account which was gonna take me to Sweden (the only thing on my bucket list). Iâ€™ve stopped going to classes which Iâ€™ve paid for, so I wonâ€™t get the qualification, Iâ€™m in a band which I feel like sabotaging and a long term relationship which I feel like killing and embracing the consequential homelessness. I donâ€™t want to damage anyone else, but fuck it would feel so good. Ultimatum: ruin life, become bum OR fill the car with carbon monoxide
