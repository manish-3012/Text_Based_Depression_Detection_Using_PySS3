Tonight seems rightI don't have that fear I usually have before an attempt. That niggling doubt that this is the wrong decision and I'll regret it as I'm dying. Instead, I feel only peace. 

I'm a psychotic 28 year old with nothing going for me. I'm too sick to hold a job, even with therapy and meds. My husband left me after cheating on me with a random dude on Craigslist. I know my family will mourn me, but they will understand too. They've told me as much.

I've had a good evening, and it would be bliss to go tonight.
