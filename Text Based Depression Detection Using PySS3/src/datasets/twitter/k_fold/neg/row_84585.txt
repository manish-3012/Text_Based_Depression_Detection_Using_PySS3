Something I wonderedI sometimes get extremely depressed over something that later turns out to be nothing or o had misinterpreted it. At the time though it's really painful both mentally and even physically but I just ride it through and usually later find out it was not that big a deal. Sure there's some days I think there's more shit in my life than good but so far I've been sticking it through. This too shall pass is a good mantra... hope everyone here can ride it through and get to a better place. Does anyone else get super depressed about small things or things they exaggerated in their heads?
