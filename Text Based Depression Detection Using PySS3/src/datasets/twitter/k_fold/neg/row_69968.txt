Had a much better day today.For those who read my post last night, I realized that I don't actually want to die, I just couldn't see any light at the time and had a massive wave of depression that I had never felt before. I'm working through my problems and keeping faith for a brighter tomorrow. I'll be deleting that post here shortly. Thank you so much to the people who said I will come out of this stronger, it means so much and is very motivating. If anyone on here needs someone to talk to, feel free to message me.
