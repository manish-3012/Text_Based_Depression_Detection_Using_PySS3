Do you think about killing yourself even though you don't have real issue? Just because you lack the capacity for happiness that makes life worth living?Hello

tl;dr: I think that different people have a different capacity for happiness, that I don't have much of this capacity, and that life is not really worth it without it. Anybody relate to this?

Here is my problem. I think about killing myself quite often. I used to write down every time I think about it. It can be several times a day in some periods, down to once a week in other. But the thought never really goes away.

When I read about suicide on the internet, people talk about having a lot of pain, about having huge issues, etc. But I have a pretty normal life, a few friends, some money, good health. I don't have any serious issue, I don't have symptoms of depression. I have no pain, I don't despise myself, I am not worse or better than most people. But I think I am different because I lack the capacity for happiness.

I think different people have different abilities to be happy, to be satisfied with their lives, to think positively. And that I mostly lack this ability. I will have good moments occasionally, sometimes I will have fun with my friends and laugh etc. But my 'default' state of mind is to think that there is not much point in going on. I don't feel like these few happy moments are worth living for. And I believe that in the future, outside of these rare moments, I will always keep thinking about killing myself.

I apologize to the people who have real problems, illness, death of loved ones, no money etc. These people would probably slap me in the face if I told them I am not happy despite having no real issue. But knowing that doesn't change anything, because I am still me and not them.

In the last year I have had two occasions to kill myself and make it seem like an accident. I didn't go through with it because I still have some hope that it actually can get better, but it's been years now and my hope is getting smaller and smaller. I set a date for it, but I have already set dates in the past twice and didn't go through with it. But the more I don't go through with it, the more I see a future where I just think about it constantly without doing it, and the more I think I should just be done with it.

Does anybody else feel like this? Thinking about killing yourself not because you have huge problems, just because deep down you are convinced that you lack the capacity for happiness? 

Has anybody felt like this for several years, and then acquired this ability for happiness? 

Please don't say yes just to make me feel better. I think more and more that it is something that you either have or don't have, but I still kinda hope someone will prove me wrong.
