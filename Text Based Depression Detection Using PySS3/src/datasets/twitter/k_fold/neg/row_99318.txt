I'm supposed to be "objectively" happy, but I'm not and I just need something. To explain a little of my backstory, I'll try and give as much details about my life without being too specific. I used to go to a really good high school that you had to test to get in to. I was projected to do very well and a lot of people, i.e. friends and family thought i would succeed and use this high school as a launching point. I crumbled under the pressure, and i felt so insecure about my place in life that all i could do was basically sit at home and play league and contemplate the meaning of self-harm. I eventually transferred out of that high school and into another one where i skimped by. I had many many many therapy sessions before i graduated high school, a majority of them focused on the societal and familial pressures that i felt were placed on me because i was not living up to the expectations that they nor I had. I graduated high school with a sub par gpa and eventually went to a college, following another one of my closest friends. My first year of college consisted of one of my first friends committing suicide, this hurt me so deep because it really altered what i had personally preconceived people with depression as. See, this particular friend was always the highlight of the group, the leader, the percy jackson main character that seemed to have everyone else follow. I was in and out of college at that point, withdrawing and dropping out basically. I eventually moved away and then got a job. I had many more therapy sessions, dealing with my deeper psychological problems ranging from self-hatred to a constant need for approval from others. I eventually stopped counseling, i had thought i got better. I started dating a girl i had met online. I decided to go back to school, because I have support systems, a drive to finish college, to provide for myself and my future significant other. However, I'm not happy. I'm not happy right now, regardless of how well I'm doing in college, how good my relationship is going, my family's health are all standard. I'm simply not happy, and i've been disassociating to the point where sometimes i can see myself from a third point of view and I don't know how to explain it to the people around me, to the girlfriend that loves and supports me. I can honestly say that for the first time in a while, I want to die, for no particular reason. I simply wish to... cease existence. But i know i can't just do that. I know how much it would hurt the people i care about. But i don't know how to stop this downward spiral that is slowly eating away at my psyche like a worm inside of an apple. Please help me, I beg you.
