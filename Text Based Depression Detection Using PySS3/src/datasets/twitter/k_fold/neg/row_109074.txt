I don't know what to do anymore(21/f) I've got a history of self-harm and have been hospitalized 3 times due to it. I'm at the point where I'm in a massive credit card debt, struggling to pay my bills and have missed about a month or so of work. Luckily, my work have been extremely understanding of me taking lots of time off and changed my shifts to suit me, but every morning I get up for work, take a shower and end up crying in a ball at the bottom of it unable to get out and miss my shift.

I feel like I've got no-one to talk to and it's all balled up inside and is about to explode. I've been taking medication for months now and it still hasn't helped and I feel so useless, I just can't see myself ever getting better and being okay and I just want it to be over. I feel guilty about this because I do have people that care about me but I don't want them to know and worry about me.
