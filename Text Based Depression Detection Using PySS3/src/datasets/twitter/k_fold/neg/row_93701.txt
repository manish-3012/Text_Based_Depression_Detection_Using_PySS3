I'm slowly giving up.I can't remember the last time I actually enjoyed being alive. Living is making me sad and tired, I see no point in trying anymore yet here I am doing whatever I can to make the people in my life happy, doing my best to get an A in every test I take, pretending to be somone I'm not. 
It's geting harder and harder for everyday, I can't even make myself smile anymore. I'm slowly giving up.
