Dying be defaultFound out today that I most likely have 2 different versions of cancer. My Doctor started talking to me about follow up and possible options. I stopped him there and said no further action will be taken. He knows I have episodes of severe depression, but today all I could muster was pure apathy. I honestly don't care about the diagnosis. If it is cancer it can do what it will. I will hide it for as long as I can and I've forbidden my doctor to speak to my husband, Hippa can be helpful at times. Can't even be called suicide, just a sudden onset of cancer that progressed rapidly. Maybe I'll even get lucky and have tumor lysis syndrome. The cancer cells burst open, intracellur electrolytes flood my blood stream and cause a massive arrhythmia and I die in my sleep.
