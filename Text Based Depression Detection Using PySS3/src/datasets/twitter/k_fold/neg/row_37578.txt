Most likely going to try tonight.The past three days seem like they have been the worst Iâ€™ve had in a long time. I donâ€™t want to get into specifics right now but I have never felt more determined to end my life. 

I feel so spiteful. I want to die because Iâ€™m tired of feeling subhuman. I want to die to get back at those who have wronged me. Make them regret and make them wish they had been better. I want to die for all the right reasons and all the wrong reasons.  

Itâ€™s been so hard. Itâ€™s been so fucking hard. I feel like Iâ€™m never gonna get out. At this point I donâ€™t give a fuck about the concern of loved ones. I donâ€™t care if theyâ€™ll miss me. Theyâ€™ll get over it in a year, I guarantee it.  

I want to take NyQuil and a bunch of pills and write a note on my door for my dad to see. I hate him. All I wanted was a close relationship with my dad but fuck me I guess right? Maybe heâ€™ll miss me when Iâ€™m gone. Maybe heâ€™ll regret how heâ€™s treated me and my brother and my mother. Maybe heâ€™ll wish he was a better dad to me. Maybe heâ€™ll wish he could turn back time and make things right with me so that I wouldnâ€™t hate living with him and being around him. 

Maybe.
