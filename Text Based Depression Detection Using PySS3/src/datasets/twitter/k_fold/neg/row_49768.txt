I'm ready.I've decided that if things aren't at least marginally better by next month, January 8, 2017, then I will kill myself.

The person I love more than the whole world no longer likes me and is threatening to break up with me because of my depression. He says I'm "not even trying" but he doesn't see the little improvements I've been making. He doesn't know I started flossing again. He doesn't know I cleaned the whole bathroom and scrubbed the bathtub. He doesn't know I've made good grades on my finals so far because I actually studied for them. But my progress isn't good enough I guess.

If he leaves, then I'll really want to kill myself. I'm just so done. I'm done with the world, I'm done with living. I'm a burden on the people I love the most and they will hurt at first but they will move on. 

I have a sliver of hope that things will be slightly more ok in the next month. But if things don't improve or get worse, then I want to go. I've been depressed since childhood. 19 years of this shit would make anyone want to end it.

My spirit is broken, my heart is broken, I'm done. I'm ready to go.
