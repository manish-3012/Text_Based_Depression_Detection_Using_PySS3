I really want to end it but I'm afraid of what's after life.Hi everyone,

Sorry English is not my first language. I'll try to be brief, I suffered of depression from a very young age. I was fat and I was bullied at school never had many friends and never really have any support from my family. I left my family at 19,now I'm 26,so it has been 7 years without even seen them on skype. Sometimes we talked on whatsapp but thats it . I dont open up about my feelings with them cause they wont understand.
I live with my bf in a different country. Everything started to go downhill this last 5/6 months. I left my job because I couldn't handle it anymore, it was a call center job, and I started to have health issues not just depression but health problems that a person my age shouldn't have. I already live with a rare disease which is precancerous and I was diagnosed at age 23, and all this new problems that I'm experiencing are unbearable for me to handle.  So I go straight to the point. I want to kill myself. I don't know how and when but I have to do it cause I'm tired of knowing what a disgusting failure and horrible unhealthy monster I am. The only thing that it is stopping me from doing it is that I don't want to endure the consequences,the aftermath of my actions. I don't want to have to go to hell or experience another crappy life again. This world is disgusting and I had enough of it . I just want silence for the eternity.
