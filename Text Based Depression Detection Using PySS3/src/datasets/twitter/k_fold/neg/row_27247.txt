Is it news to some people I'm off my bloody rocker? lol.. just read it.This probably won't even make sense... But hey if I feel better after posting then that's what must count right? yeah..  I'm getting a lot better at regulating my emotions.. invested in journals, art work projections I'm doing for some people.. I'm laid back once you get to know me. I also had invested in my education, trying to be productive with my time. And the mentioned above is actually helping a great deal. I love being busy and doing good for other people.. I'm doing free artwork for some of my FB friends and it feels good to be productive in my community.. I have my Sub clinic group meeting tomorrow and I'm looking forward to it.. I need to be more thankful for what I have. I also have a therapist and that woman is kick ass... anyway thanks for listening. edit- I have some pretty rough days but I'll do my best.
