i have never contemplated this as much as i have been lately.not sure if itâ€™s the meds they are trying or the fact that this has been the most devastating loss relationship wise i have ever experienced.

either way, thoughts of ending it all flood my head constantly. and itâ€™s a calm contemplation. not frantic or scared. just a â€œmight be niceâ€ type feeling.

not sure how to feel or what to do.
