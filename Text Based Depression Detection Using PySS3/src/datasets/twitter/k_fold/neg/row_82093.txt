I really canâ€™t see a future for myself at this point.Every future that I try to imagine for myself seems so bleak and hopeless. I tried to hang myself yesterday but I didnâ€™t really have the courage to go through with it. Iâ€™m currently in pharmacy school watching the pharmacy job market go to shit with each passing year. My school debt burden is growing by about $30,000 each year and I know thereâ€™s a very good chance Iâ€™ll just join the growing number of unemployed pharmacists after all this work Iâ€™ve put in to getting somewhere. Iâ€™m not really sure where Iâ€™m going with this post. I guess I just wanted to type it out and vent. The place that Iâ€™m at in my life seems so goddamn inevitable. Some part of me has known for a while that I wonâ€™t be around for much longer.
