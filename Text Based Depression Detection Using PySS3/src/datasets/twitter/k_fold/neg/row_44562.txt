I tried talking to my school counselor, but that didn't work out at allI've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and I decided to talk to my parents about it, and it just made everything worse(check my post on that for more info). I've already given up on trying, but my friend told me it'd be the best if I talked to the school counselor. I thought I'd give it a shot, cuz I have nothing to lose anyway, but when she started introducing herself and explaining her role to us, she said something like "but if you're thinking of jumping out of the window now for example, I will need to get other people involved, but everything else stays confidential" and in that moment, I started making up another story lol. I said I had trouble with homework or something, and it was pretty believable, which is exactly what I wanted. My friend said it was stupid of me to say that, and I agree, but it's fine, since I don't really want the help anyway. I also feel unsafe around my mum now, because stuff I don't wanna talk about, and I'm feeling worse every second. I'm pretty sick too, and can't go to school because of that, so my mum is really mad, and scarier than usual, so I also feel more unsafe now than usual lol. I just felt like posting this.
