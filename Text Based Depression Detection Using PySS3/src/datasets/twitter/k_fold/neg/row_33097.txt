Rehoming pets and ways to end itIâ€™m wanting to kill myself, but am so afraid of what will happen to my pets. I want to rehome them before I go, but Iâ€™m not sure how to go about it. Iâ€™m 24, have been struggling with MH issues half my life, have narcissistic parents that abused me as a child, was severely bullied in school, became a drug addict, and have PTSD from multiple sources (being kidnapped and a few car crashes). I have no friends, no close family. Every day my subconscious is terrified that Iâ€™m  going to get kidnapped, murdered, or that Iâ€™m just going to live in poverty forever and die alone. MH is stigmatized, so no guy wants to be with me when they find out I have Borderline and PTSD, along with severe anxiety and depression. There is no way Iâ€™m going to improve my life. I canâ€™t work because Iâ€™m literally terrified of people, and I wonâ€™t be able to get SSI for 2 years, and itâ€™s not enough to even pay my rent, let alone put gas in my car and buy food for my animals. Iâ€™m stuck in this cycle of poverty and mental health issues. Thereâ€™s no escaping it. How can I rehome my pets, and what are some good options to ending it all? I donâ€™t have access to a fire arm, unfortunately.
