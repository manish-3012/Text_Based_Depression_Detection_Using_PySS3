All I can think about is what it would be like if I had taken chances... What if I took sports when I was younger instead of reading all day? I sure as hell wanted to. What if I actually practiced guitar instead of sitting around listening to music? Would I be able to play my favorite songs? What if I wasn't so weird when I was a kid? Would I not be alone right now if I were a normal kid? What if I talked to that one girl? Would I have found a friend? What if I wasn't raised in this crappy town? What if the gun went off during the early morning hours of 6-20-17? Where would I be? Now all I can think about is trying again. I'm sorry for rambling I just need someone to talk to, who will understand.
