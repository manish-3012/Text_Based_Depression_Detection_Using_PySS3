I think I'm Ready To GoI've had enough already. I am genuinely unhappy with my life. I fucking  hate my family, my future doesn't look good for me either. I think I'm ready to go, but I don't know how. I don't want my sisters to grow up to be just like me. I want to protect them. This is the only way.
