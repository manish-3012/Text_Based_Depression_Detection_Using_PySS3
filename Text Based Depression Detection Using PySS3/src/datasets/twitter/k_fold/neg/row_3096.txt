I Think I'm ReadyI am so tired, stressed, and just done. How is it possible that everything can go wrong at once? It seems that everything in my life that could go wrong, went wrong and things that offer me solace don't anymore. 

I promised my girlfriend that I wouldn't kill myself because I didn't want to hurt her and I always tried to hold on to the idea of my mother walking in to find my dead body and breaking down in tears but....neither of those things seem to hold me back anymore.

I want to die.

And every single day it becomes a little harder to hold myself back from it. It's like I'm an asteroid crashing down to earth, burdened by the gravitational pull.

I feel so alone. I feel as if I'm not needed, or loved. By anyone. And even though I know that's irrational, that I have my girlfriend and mom and two friends, I just feel so alone. 

I hate myself. The way I look, how fat I am. I'm unemployed and I want to finish school, but my school deemed me unworthy to get my financial aid. I can't pay $2.5 k out of pocket with no job.

Everything is against me. And the only thing that does offer me comfort is the idea of slipping into a permanent, dark void. Everyone would just forget me in the end. I'm meant to be forgotten.
Maybe I'm meant to do this. 

I never saw myself growing old anyway. I'm a failure. A disgusting, utter failure.
I'm not meant to be here anymore.
