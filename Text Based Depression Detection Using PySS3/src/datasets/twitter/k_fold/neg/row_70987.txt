I decided today that I wanted to die and have a means so. Life seems outplayed.I'm debating on taking my life this morning. I've been mostly laying down staring at the ceiling after failing to distract myself with things I normally do. I never felt this ready for anything. I'm famished for shit, no regerts, I gotta die, wish me luck, please don't be an afterlife.
