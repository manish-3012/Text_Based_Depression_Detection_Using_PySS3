I don't want to die but I don't want to liveAnyone else feel this way? I'm almost 40 and about to be homeless and jobless which wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have a dog. Shes the only reason I haven't been at the end of a shotgun barrel. She's keeping me alive for now. Every day I wake up wishing I wouldn't. Im curious why people have an issue with others choosing to commit suicide? I mean, I have no real career, no education, no home of my own. Sure I can stay living until Im in my 80s but why keep living through the misery? My life has gone to shit these last few years and just keep getting worse. Stay alive so I can live another shitty day until I eventually die anyways. Doesn't make sense. End of rant.
