What would you say to your loved one before it happened if you had the chance to do so?Hello everyone, I'm new both to Reddit and this sub. I'm a false subscriber, I haven't lost that person just yet but it feels inevitable, and I was hoping for help. My little brother is a kind, smart person and there is nobody I love more than him. He's been blighted by self-conscious issues throughout his life (and as a stupid, naive child I've added to that) but we've grown together over time. He's had some promising jobs over the last 6 years but he's since retreated to unemployment, using video games as a form of escapism for the last few years, but of which he seems to be becoming increasingly bored of. His girlfriend and I don't always see eye to eye but I acknowledge that she grounds him to the earth. My issue is that their break up seems inevitable as she's fairly ambitious while he's content playing games forever. He's expressed serious suicidal thoughts before (and I reacted badly by saying I'd follow down the same path if he did because life wouldn't be worth it without him, which ended up sounding more like a suicide pact than a reaffirmation of his worth to me). He's also suffering from PTSD as a result of serving as a police officer, which doesn't help if you've seen a victim of suicide every week. I was hoping you guys might know what to say, because I feel disconnected from reality about it. I don't what to say because it feels like it's already happened, I'm just going through the motions. Even if you can't help me, it may help you to vent your own feelings. Thanks and I love you all.
