I need to make it to Tuesday but I donâ€™t know if I canBasically I have to wait until my next therapy session on Tuesday where I can tell my therapist I need to go to a psych ward and I canâ€™t go there on my own because Iâ€™m 14 and I canâ€™t tell my parents for a reason I donâ€™t know thereâ€™s just something that isnâ€™t letting me tell them

My parents have taken things like knives and pills and locked them away but I think I can hang myself with some bedsheets or a shirt or something and thatâ€™s my best plan at the moment 

I donâ€™t know what to do
