My life is meaningless, there is no point in living if i dont look like prime chicoIm balding, short ugly on top of that all combined at age of 18. I have no purpose nor place. nobody likes me, i have never had friends let alone girlfriend. nobody  understands my pain at best they laugh at me . my parent would probably just laugh it off if i offed myself. society will never understand they will go through their day coping about stupid fucking videogames or muh netflix movie. there is really no point in living if i dont look like prime francisco lachowski. getting pussy there and that. nobody even acknowledges me. i get happy when people on sidewalk change their way when they se me because that meamns they acknowledge me. im stnading near a fucking cliff right now leading to ocean, i couldnt text anyone bcuz i have no friends nor family just sharing this rn. its beyond over for my bald subhuman head and my height of 155cm. LMAO im a fucking complete pack of a subhuman. im just going to end it all ngl.
