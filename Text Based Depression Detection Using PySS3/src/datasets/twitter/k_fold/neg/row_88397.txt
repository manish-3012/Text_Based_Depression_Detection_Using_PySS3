Told my doctor I was "a little depressed" but I can't afford treatment anywayI have a pretty concrete plan to kill myself. I haven't started yet, but I'm close. I went to my doctor to get a sick note recently, and the nurse asked me if I was depressed, to which I answered "a little". My doctor stared playing 20 questions with me about depression, but even if I had been honest, I can't afford therapy or anti-depressants anyway.  I have a $7000 insurance deductible. A local group offers 5 free therapy sessions, but I used all of those already. I have no friends to talk to, and I'd rather die than beg my family for money. I can't say I really want help, but I don't not want it either. It doesn't matter what I want anyway because I'm not going to get it. I don't want to beg for free healthcare, and suffer through trying to "get better" however long that takes. I just want it to end. If a handgun didn't cost $200 I would have shot myself already
