Eyes deep in student loan debt, underemployed since graduation, out of work since February, taking more anxiety medication than I ever have, and Iâ€™m stuck in the United Statesâ€”â€” so basically all I thought about last night was how I might kill myself. And it made me feel better? 





I think Iâ€™m beyond the point that I can call exhaustion. Hospital bills I canâ€™t pay, off my parentsâ€™ health insurance in four months, heading back to school because thereâ€™s no hope for me in the job market with my current degree.

No friends in town, no lover, not allowed pets, and I think Iâ€™m just dying inside. Tried to get a job in July and suffered from such severe panic attacks every day for the first two weeks that I had to resign. Now Iâ€™m basically on elephant tranquilizers because otherwise Iâ€™m so scared I canâ€™t eat. 

Iâ€™ve been trying to climb my way out of this hole using my fingernails for three years and counting. I live in a family of, at best , people so without the emotional capacity for empathy that they only get stressed out and shut down when I try to reach for emotional support, and at worst, narcissists. (But I think thatâ€™s actually the same thing) 

Iâ€™ve come to the heartbreaking realization that control is an illusion and that we are all the result of our genetic disposition triggered by our environmental circumstances and I was dealt a bad hand. The only thing that makes me feel momentarily better is detachment at monk levels of asceticismâ€”- but in the end if I want to live in this world I need to be able to eat, which means I canâ€™t detach from society completely. 


I keep thinking that if I were somehow better, smarter, had more energy, then maybe I could get myself out of this. Iâ€™ve been thinking that way for a while, and that is probably why I feel like such a failure. 

Iâ€™ve realized I wonâ€™t be able to afford new shoes or clothes, let alone a new car, house, or children, at any time soon, if things donâ€™t change. 


Iâ€™ve been stricken with grief for three years and counting, and Iâ€™m so. 

      So




              So


                          Exhausted.
