Suicide NoteI have been thinking about this for the past few days now. I'm 17, and I know that is a young age but life right now is feeling so horrible. I don't want to grow up with more problems, or grow up with more pain. I just know this is going to get worse. My parents have done an amazing job raising me and I'm so grateful to have had parents like them. But this is my personal decision. A decision that I am making for myself. A decision I have thought out carefully. I just want peace. This world is so scary and dark. Everything is so difficult. Childhood was one of my best memories, but now growing up, life is getting so hard. Fun and meaning is being taken away from every aspect of life.
