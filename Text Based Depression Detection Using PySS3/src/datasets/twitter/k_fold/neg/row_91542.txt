Whelp, after almost three decades on this planet who'da thunk this would be my final resting place?I fled my family after one too many falling outs over my mental health, unemployment, etc. The issue was while I was away for a week they removed my weed vape. Now, for the last 12 months they've known about my habit and haven't interfered in any way as long as I'm discreet, so this was a huge betrayal of my trust and not to mention total violation of my privacy - because who knows what else they've trawled through?

So I booked it, spent a few nights at my best friend's place to see him and his wife and baby son one last time. Now I'm in the scummy part of town in a cheap motel and sit here contemplating whether to just get it over with - at least my family won't have to clean up. Or, just get wasted enough to forget for a few days then return home, take my valued possessions and store them with a friend, then present myself to hospital and tell them if they don't take me away someone is gonna die, and hope for the best.

Edit: It just struck me that this may seem like an extremely petty reason to want to die, but I should clarify: when I say this was one too many I'm talking about the final straw on a MASSIVE stack. It's not just this, but this tipped the scale.
