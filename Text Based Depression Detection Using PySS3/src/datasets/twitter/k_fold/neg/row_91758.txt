Have to be strongWe're going together for the last time ever to boat as a family. My father is dying of cancer and I'm so scared I will never get this memory again. I know how hard it's going to be and how strong I'll have to be. Everyone else in my family has someone with them that day to keep them strong. I'll be on my own. I don't know what I'll do when this all goes away. I feel so helpless.
