VoidEverything in my life just keeps getting worse and worse and worse. My husband just makes me want to die, but his family is the only help I can get. Constantly upset about not having money but refuses to work, forces me to get a job at 21 weeks pregnant and he is basically an absentee parent to our son. I just donâ€™t have the money to divorce. So I just fantasize about killing myself everyday. I feel like death is the only option to give me any peace
