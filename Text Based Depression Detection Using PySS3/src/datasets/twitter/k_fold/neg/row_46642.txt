I'm not gonna ruin her birthday
I have a twin sister and our birthday is tomorrow. She wont stop saying that I'm ruining her birthday and I totally agree. My parents are afraid that I'm going to ruin MY day because the last few days I've been thinking about nothing but ending it finally. If I end it tonight my sister wont have to suffer a drag like me on her special day. They all think its selfish that I'm gonna ruin this day for all of them so I wont.
