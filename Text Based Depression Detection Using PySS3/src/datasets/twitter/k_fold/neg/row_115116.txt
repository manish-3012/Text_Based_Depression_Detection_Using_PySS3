Dumped. Can't stop drinking/medicating/freaking out.My first and only girlfriend since I was 16 wants nothing to do with me. She just moved to my city a month ago, we live 10 minutes apart, last year we were 1000 miles apart. She just wants to "be alone". I cannot deal with it. I've been drinking daily and want to die, have wanted to for weeks. I just started seeing a counselor but it's only once a week. Life without her seems impossible. She won't even be my friend. My apartment is dirty and full of beer bottles, I hate school, I'm getting terrible grades, I'm sobbing most of the time.

I would write something more coherent or detailed but honestly I'm just happy to get this out here.

EDIT: I'm 24.

EDIT 2: I have been thinking for the last couple weeks (not daily, but every once in a while) that killing myself would be better than this. Just to clarify that. I don't think I will kill myself but my destructive behavior is frightening me.
