Is it ever going to get better?Medication after medication, doctor after doctor, and I'm still crazy. My mind is driving me to insanity. I hear voices all the time and I'm getting to exhausted to keep going, keep fighting. There's only so much one person can take before it's to much.
I'm holding back because of my mother and my husband. I've been married 12 years to the best understanding man I could have ever asked for and I don't want to do anything to hurt him. My mom has had a hard way to go and I don't want to make it harder but I don't know how much longer I can stand this. I don't know how much more I have left in me. Nothing is the same. I'm slow, and exhausted all the time. I can't think straight half the time, and the other half I'm scared of all my hallucinations that haunt my every waking minute. 
I know how I would do it. And I would never be home for it. Although I almost did take all my medications a couple of days ago while I was at home, but I couldn't bring myself to let my husband find me. 
I'm losing hope. I'm losing hope in medication, in life and in myself. I can't handle anything stressful anymore and I'm nothing but a burden. I can't work, I can't drive, I can't even think. When will it be over? I make make that happen. The question is, when and where. I'm starting to plan, and I'm starting to scare myself at the same time. There's like two of me, one that wants desperately to live and be happy and the other half who's given up. What self will win this battle?
