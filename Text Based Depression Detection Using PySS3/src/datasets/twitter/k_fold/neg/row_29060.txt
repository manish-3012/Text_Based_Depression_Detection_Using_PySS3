What can I do with the ressources I have to make my suicide as â€œconvenientâ€ as possible for my wife? I know how absurd and macabre that sounds, but please read the post before you judge me.Iâ€™ve been battling with cancer since I was 23. It gets better, itâ€™s in remission, then suddenly Iâ€™m told I have metastasis again. Another Chemo, another positive feedback, another check up, another metastasis, hopes crushed again. 

Iâ€™ve lived like this for almost half my life, but it feels a lot longer like that. It feels like two lives. A first one full of joy and a second one in constant agony, fear, hopelessness and pain, interrupted by short intervals of hope. 

Iâ€™m broke, Iâ€™m jobless, Iâ€™m in hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt and I know that my wife, whom I love more than anything else, suffers from this. Sheâ€™s been with me since I was 16 (!) and stood with me all these years. I only call her my wife, though, we didnâ€™t actually marry due to financial reasons. If we legally marry sheâ€™s liable for my immense amount of debt, even after my death and I donâ€™t want that. 

After 16 years of on-and-off chemo I know that it wonâ€™t get better and that at one point in the near future, maybe 3 years, maybe in 10, Iâ€™ll be going the way of anything earthly anyways. Iâ€™ve accepted that. 

But I want my wife to have a life. Iâ€™ve talked with her about going to Switzerland where assisted suicide is a possibility for foreigners but she refuses to even talk about that. Iâ€™ve burst out in tears in the middle of the night telling her that I want to end it, to which she usually bursts out in tears and tells me that she wants to stay with me until the bitter end. 

In other words: Sheâ€™ll never agree to this, but I just refuse to rob her of the opportunity to have kids and raise a family, which I know she wants. 

I know Iâ€™ll hurt her, deeply, which shakes me to my core, but I know sheâ€™ll get over it. Eventually.

And I know deep down that sheâ€˜ll be thankful at one point. Or at least understand it. 

**This is my reasoning. Please try to understand it and please accept it. Please donâ€™t question it.** This isnâ€™t something I decided out of the blue. 

To my question: 

What can I do, given my circumstances, my financial situation, to make this as â€œconvenientâ€ (lack of a better word) as possible for my wife? 

Thank you for being respectful.
