Give me reasons to liveI fucking hate my life. I always mess up. I say something bad to someone and Iâ€™m too afraid to apologize bc I have social anxiety when Ik they are right. I always fail at school. My dad is always mad at me. I feel like Iâ€™m faking going to my therapist. I want someone to listen to me but Iâ€™m too scared to tell them.
