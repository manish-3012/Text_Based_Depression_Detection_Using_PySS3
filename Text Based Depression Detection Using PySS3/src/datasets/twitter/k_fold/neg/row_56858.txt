I'm gonna fail then probably kill myselfYeah I know I posted here last night but I'm back. I'm probably just looking for attention. 
I tried so hard last night. I stayed up late just looking at my notes and I just couldn't do it. I just couldn't even focus on it for a second. I have a math midterm in one hour. I know I'm gonna fail. I know I'm gonna run home and I know I'm gonna fucking cry like a loser. Cause I am a loser. I'm a stupid pathetic loser. I say I'm gonna kill myself but I know that I probably wont. I never do. The closest I've ever gotten was almost dropping that toaster in the tub. God I wish I did it so badly. I was so close. I'm sure that today I'm gonna fucking set it all up and then I'm gonna cry and then I'll feel really guilty about my friend feeling bad so then I'll pussy out cause I'm a pussy. Then I'm gonna sleep, wake up, fail another midterm, repeat. Then I'm just gonna fucking think about it for all of christmas break. It hurts so god damn much just to be alive. I have no energy. I have no will to keep going, but I will and I'll just be a lifeless corpse just kind of coasting through life. 
I dont know why I even bother posting here. I'm not gonna end myself and I know it. I'm just a failure in every way. I wish it would all just stop. 
I'm a failure in school and I'm disgusting. It just hurts. Just a waste of time. Just a waste of flesh. I'm sorry for wasting anybodys time with my shit.
