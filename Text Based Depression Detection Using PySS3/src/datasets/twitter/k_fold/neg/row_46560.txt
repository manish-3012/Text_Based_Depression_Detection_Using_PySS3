Advice for someone who needs all they can get right nowI just need to reach out, I think, for the 'last time', and I've desperately ran out of things to try. I'm sorry if this violates any of the rules, I'll delete if it does, let me know! 

I don't know if any of you have been at that point where you're no longer upset - or you are, it just feels like this tight band at the core of you ready to snap, and it's just calmness. I know, for reasons I don't want to go into very heavily, that I'm not going to make it to 60, and I want to make it to 30, but I don't think I'm going to make it to 21, and my birthday for that is on the 6th of May. 

I'm try really hard, with everything I have, and it just doesn't feel like enough anymore. For background, my best friend killed himself in January, after a long struggle with depression (he also posted on here that he'd stopped taking his meds, the day before) and I've had a long struggle with OCD and depression and panic attacks, as well as seizures - I've taken a medical leave of absence from uni, the one thing I loved to do, and I'm in the system for mental health as well as constant grief therapy, and I'm just completely lost. I just don't think I can do this anymore, and I'm on the verge of just silently leaving and doing it.

Is there anyway I could lessen this feeling, or is there anything I can do? Or is this just utterly pathetic
