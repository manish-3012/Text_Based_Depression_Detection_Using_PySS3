Friend says he wants to commit suicide by standing out in heavy rain until he gets pneumonia. Should I take this seriously?I've known my friend has had depression for a while but I was chatting to him last night and he said he wants to commit suicide by standing out in really heavy downpour until the water in the air gets in his lungs and he 'dry drowns' on it/gets pneumonia. (He linked me to a wikipedia article on dry drowning during this conversation) 

Should I take it seriously? When I asked why he wanted to kill himself that way he said it's because he's afraid of taking an OD or cutting himself because he's afraid of the pain/symptoms.
