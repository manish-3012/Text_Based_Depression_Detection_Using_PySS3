Cannot feel joy, everything stresses me out or makes me anxious. Feeling very calm, my brain is determined to convince me I should take my own life.I've been on/off meds my whole life, recently I'm on mirtazipine and quetiapine (self-medicated with leftover meds because there is a 3 weekw aiting list to see a doctor here minimum, so I can't get a new script right now without calling an ambulance, but I break out in a cold sweat and my jaw physically won't open if I try to tell anyone about how I am feeling)

I am home by yself while everyone else is out partying, for weeks now I've been in a state of near constant high anxiety, its unrelenting, and for months and months I've been completely unable to feel anything approaching enjoyment in anything I do. My vision is blurred, I have physical pains that have no root cause all over, my skin hurts for no reason whatsoever and my muscles are very stiff and click/creak a lot.

Past month of so Iv'e had very strong very convincing thoughts of suicide (its more like my brain is not under my control and is telling me to do this, over and over again, forces me to listen to it i cant block it out), with a very specific method in mind. I have a very long length of Cat-5 cable I plan to double up for strength, tie around my neck and jump off my balcony.

I don't know how to get help, ask for it or accept it, things are getting much much worse, every positive thing I do now takes extreme effort and is extremely forced, and being copletely unable to derive any joy from doing the things I supposedly love makes it feel like it just isn't worth continuing. I don't mind doing things I hate, but that's the fucking point if my brain makes me hate the things I love?

I feel very calm right now and that scares me a lot. How do I get through this?
