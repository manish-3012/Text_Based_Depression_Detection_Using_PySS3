I don't even know anymoreI just want to die. I'm a worthless human being who can't get a job, has no talents (and I don't even mean than in a has-talent-but-doesnt-realize way. I literally have nothing), and can't even handle basic, day to day interactions with people because my social anxiety is so bad. I'm such a good for nothing that I don't even feel right calling myself human anymore, because to me that would diminish the value of the term by, like, 40%. I just hate myself so much that I don't even know what to do anymore. Death seems like the only option...    
    
Sorry, just needed to get that off my chest.
