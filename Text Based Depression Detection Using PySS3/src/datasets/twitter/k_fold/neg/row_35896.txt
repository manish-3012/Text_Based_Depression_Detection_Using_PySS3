WeLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLPYo! My names Josh. I am suicidal as fuck. I dunno. Maybe I just need to say it or something? I think about it daily. Hourly. Like jesus I need help haha. I won't get it though. I dunno maybe I'm lazy or something. I just fucking hate myself. I enjoy life, i love my friends, family, everything. I just fucking hate me. I don't think I'm a bad person. I just don't like me. I hate this world. I enjoy everything that's in it. But it's not interesting, i'm not interesting. Blah blah blah whiney stuff whiney stuff about depression. I hate it here. I love living where I am i just hate it HERE. This planet. Universe. These people. I love everyone around me and I love to make friends. But I fucking hate people. No one wants the same thing anymore. All we want is this and that but we never work towards it. I don't work towards it. I guess you could say that's why I hate me. I've bunched myself in with...well everyone. I sit everyday and it's hard for me to wake up, leave the bed, do anything with my life. I get a job, love it, but then never fucking go to it the next day because I fucking hate me and I can't help anyone if I tried. I wasn't always like this and I don't know when it started. I don't have that bad of a background...I just...fucking suck. I wanna just sit in the car in the garage and let it ride y'know? Fall asleep to some tunes. But I promised my best friends I wouldn't kill myself. I can't because I promised them. It's literally the only thing stopping me. Even then the promise was if it was time then all three of us would kill ourselves. I literally had to jolt myself awake because I sat in the car too long. I wanted to. I don't know why but I just wanted to die that day. It's hard. I don't know why it is but it is. I don't know what I'm fucking talking about anymore. Why am I telling you this? What's the fucking point?? I'm not going to fucking read these anyways. Pointless.
