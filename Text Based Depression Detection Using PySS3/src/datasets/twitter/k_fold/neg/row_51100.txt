X Post from /r/TogetherAlone, I'm thinking about shooting myself in the headI've been thinking about finally shooting myself in the head or just taking a fistful of pills and going to sleep. The only thing that's stopping me right now is that I don't want to leave my cat behind because to be honest, she is all I got. The only other human companionship I've ever been able to count on either lives too far away or stabbed me in the back more times than I can count. Other than being alone I'm financially fucked, about to be homeless. I've been frantically looking for work for the past 3 months but haven't gotten any bites and I'm amazed it took this long for things to completely fall apart, not to mention that I don't have the drive to want to work as when I did have a job I wanted to smash my car into a wall every day I wasnt sleeping or eating either so I was essentially a walking corpse that just happened to get overrun by stress on a day to day basis with shitty pay. So if you guys dont hear back from me, you know what happened. All I've had my whole life is to be kicked repeatedly while I'm down and I can't endure it anymore. Life isnt worth going through if you dont have anything to keep you here.
