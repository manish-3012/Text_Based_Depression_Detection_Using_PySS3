Hungover and hopeless.I'm 35, live with my parents, make next to nothing walking dogs for a job. I've been a slave to alcohol, get drunk and say the stupidest shit (either sexual or suicidal) to people to the point that no one wants to talk to me anymore. Last night I facebook messaged a mutual aquaintence of my ex-girlfriend that i loved her still and wanted to be together or die otherwise. She told my ex. Now I'm sure she will never want me back. I've lost everyone because I'm a bad, perverted, suicidal drunk. And never did anything educationally or worked myself up in any job. I am 35, and I wasted everything because I am waste.
