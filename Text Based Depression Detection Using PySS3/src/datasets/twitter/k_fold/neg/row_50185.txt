i'm just done with everythingPretty much just done' i'm 26,, can't even make a friend, or anything, someone told me, they would  be there for me, but instead, they  block me, it's like wtf... if you're gonna say that, don't block the next day, I wanted some friends i can get a long with, i don't care if i get down voted, i wanted a pure friendship, getting to know someone, despite the age difference, but mostly i'm just done that i'm feeling alone, even when i tried to change, then I just get back to my corner, and think about what to do with my life, I work, go home, to nothing, besides to my dogs, but they can only do so much, to comfort someone, and not receive that kindness back, do  i have to be mean to people, just to get some attention, i planned my suicide date, in a few months, because i am damn tired of this world, i try to get things i want, just to get pushed down, i try to stand back up, it just makes me very depressed, which i didn't want to go through that feeling again, I tried changing, and being happier, I just see no point anymore, I can only try so much to try to comfort myself, telling myself it's gonna be okay, that i'm gonna find a friend the next day, so i'm just done with it all.

peace out
