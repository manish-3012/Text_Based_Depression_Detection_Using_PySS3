I feel like severe loneliness is one of the worst feelings in the world. How are you supposed to get better when you have no one to talk to?I'm Austin, I'm 19, and I am medically diagnosed with both autism and avoidant personality disorder. I have a few acquaintances but I have no true friends anymore, aside from my little brother and little sister. College was supposed to be my golden years, and the years in which I made my best friends. It's proven to be the most grueling and life-ruining event in my life, and I can say with certainty that I plan to end my life in January. My brain is configured in a way where I crave friendship, connections, and attention, but I cannot achieve it due to my absolute lack of social skills and my unlikeable personality. Those who have chosen to get to know me eventually feel bad for me, and they choose to pity me rather than befriend me. I wake up, go on the internet, eat, and go to sleep, and class is somewhere in the mix during the semester. It's absolutely horrendous. I do not want to live this life anymore. I do not want to immediately crush my siblings, so I plan to do it in a way where I will go "missing" for a while rather than be immediately pronounced dead due to suicide. It will still worry them, but it will be slow rather than instant betrayal. I am so tired of existing. I have been planning this for years. Life is not made for people like me. I was created with a severe disadvantage; one that makes it impossible to live happily. If reincarnation is real, I hope that I will be reborn into a likeable and sociable person. I do not want to live a life of loneliness.
