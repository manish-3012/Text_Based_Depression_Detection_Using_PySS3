Broke my foot and many other downfallsBroke my foot this evening. Incredible pain but I refuse to take pain pills because of a former addiction. On crutches for 4-6 weeks. Riding my bike is out. General moving around my own fucking house is out. My only friend and I had a fight last week(over my poor attempt at a date) and she still is mostly avoiding me. I could hit the character limit on what other long lasting medical issues I have. My job has utterly shut me down for trying to do more for the company instead telling me to focus on smaller stuff. Then promptly shut down my smaller stuff ideas.

I have a word document on my computer called reasons to live that talks about how our life is not ours but for those around us. In my case, this is my mom but its becoming really hard to look at that and keep going
