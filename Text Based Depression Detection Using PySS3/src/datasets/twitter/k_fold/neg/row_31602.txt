Back to square oneI've posted here quite a few times and I just want to say that I really appreciate all the kind replies and upvotes I've received.  It may just be on reddit, but it means a lot to me to have support/people to talk to.
Over the last few weeks I'd been able to get my life somewhat in order.  My grades are up, my relationship with my parents improved for a bit, I was happy...
But then I keep having all this drama with my best friend and I'm afraid I'm going to lose him.  It isn't anything he's doing wrong; it's more like I keep expecting too much from him because I like him romantically and he can't deliver on those feelings, and so when I'm hurt by these unfair expectations he can't do anything to help and we both end up feeling crappy.
Now my relationship with my parents has deteriorated once again, and I've stopped doing my homework.  I'm in 4 AP classes and no longer seem to give a shit about any of them.  All I do amongst my friends is cause drama, make them uncomfortable, or isolate myself from them.  They'd be so much better off without me causing them so much trouble.
I've attempted suicide 4 times before and they've all hurt like a bitch (never fully went through with any of them; I chickened out and stopped myself).  But at this point I can't see any other way to get out of this constant cycle of feeling hopeful only to crash down 10x harder the next time.
Thank you for reading.
