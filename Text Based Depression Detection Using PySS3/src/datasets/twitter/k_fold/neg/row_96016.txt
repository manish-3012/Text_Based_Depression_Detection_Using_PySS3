I don't know why I'm posting here, I feel like I shouldAs the title describes I honestly don't know why I'm here, I already downed a shit ton of Lamotrigine and I can already feel myself getting weaker. I guess I just want someone to talk to until the end. I'm a clinically diagnosed borderline and honestly I just wanted to die not because my life is hellish, but because I can see how much hell I put everyone around me through. My therapist always tells me how impressed she is with my progress, but I can't see any progress. I try, or rather tried, so hard to get better and I always tried to keep up the boundaries and be the person I know I could be, but I'm such a fuck up. I wish that I were a hermit or something, I never wanted to hurt the people around me. 

If anyone here reads this and has BPD please go seek help, it was too late for me but it's not too late for you
