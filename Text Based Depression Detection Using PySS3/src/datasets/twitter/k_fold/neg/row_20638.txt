My Girlfriend is in the edgeOkay I'll start with something might appear funny but It isn't. She is 20 if it helps. 

Today she finished 13 reasons why season 2 and she spoke to me about how meaningless was to die and that didn't changed anything, every person just kept doing whatever, and no repercussions. Time just made it and nobody actually gets what they "deserve". In some of her words and some of my own reasoning of what she told. 

By the end of the day, after a long time afk and while I was away and within reach she texts : " I almost fell of my stairs, wish I was dead". Which it really surprised me, you now we joke about dying, we both know we are somewhat depressive and we cope with dark humor, but she never actually expressed like that. 

I try to keep it at bay, and even in my darkest moments I just avoid bringing it, sometimes heavier jokes and maybe a bit down. But I try as much as I can to hide it. I know it is different for every person but at this point I don't know what to say 

I've tried been helpful, to be supportive, to be caring, to show her how much important she is for me but I'm not reaching. And I don't know how to, anyone knows how?, what to say, to make her feel better?. Am I pushing too much?. 
Need advice. Thanks
