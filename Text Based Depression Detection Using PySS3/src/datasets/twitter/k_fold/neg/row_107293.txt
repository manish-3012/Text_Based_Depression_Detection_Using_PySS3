My death will be my only accomplishmentI remember being seven years old and eating silica gel beads because I thought they were poison hoping to die. I remember trying to drink cleaning fluid at ten but not being able to because of the smell. I have always been suicidal and I now know why: because am simply a mistake and have known since I was born.

They say I just need to stop fucking things up. Stop causing situations that cause them stress.

 I try so hard to pay attention more, to understand, to be aware of my surroundings, but I'm just too stupid. They say they don't want me to die, just to stop being so stupid. I've been trying so hard to better my thinking. I've written post it notes of reminders. I've used timers and scheduling apps. I still make so many burdensome mistakes that the person I love ends up being responsible for.

I'm very stupid yet so selfish, pretentious and arrogant. I am an artist by nature. I strive only to create. I dedicated my life to creation yet all I do is fail and destroy. For me to tell anyone these thoughts is selfish as well. Who am I to demand emotional labor from people? The energy that others exhaust to correct me could be used on so many more important things. Imagine the amount of things people would be able to accomplish if I didn't exist? 

Maybe dying would be my only accomplishment of creating something. With me out of the way, everyone would be uninhibited by me and be able to create all that I couldn't.
