Hello, Yes I've thought about itI know I'm a little bitch, crying over a girl. But I just got dumped, no contact and I'm still madly in love with her. I know the only thing keeping me going is the fact that I tell myself maybe we'll be back together again in the future. So now it seems I wait until it is definitely over. Luckily I'll never stop trying for her, so I don't think it's quite that bad. I just think if I die now, then how do I know it couldn't work out in the future.
