Do you ever plan out how you would do it?Every night before I fall asleep I think about how I would kill myself.  I'm not going to be one of those people that threaten to kill myself for attention.  If I do it I'm going to make sure it works.  Right now I'm planning on buying shotgun.  I would then ditch my car somewhere people would expect to find it.  Then I would run to the local state park that has tons of woods.  I'd run until I was in the most secluded place of the park and sit down.  I imagine I would take one last look of the forest before I blow my brains out.  The only reason I haven't done this is because I don't want to hurt my family.  I don't care about my life.  If I owned a gun I doubt I would be alive today.  I think I'm going to go shopping tomorrow.
