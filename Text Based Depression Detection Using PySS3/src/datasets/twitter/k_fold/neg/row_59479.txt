Almost gave up on me todayI've felt miserable all day and kept on having suicidal thoughts. Just before bed time I just had that feeling and wanted to do it. I can't find any reason to carry on. I have been continuously surviving day by day for about 10 years so thought today would be the day to stop and give up. 

I'd thought about how I'd do it but googled what I would need. Found out of many failed attempts/other effects and gave up (at least for now)... :/
