I'm so done.Throughout my life, I've never had it "easy" but also not "hard" either. I'm one of those people that are in-between (which to be honest, makes things worse). School was bad, college was bad, life is bad. I cannot seem to get a break in anything I do even though I'm apparently talented, that doesn't matter at all. 

A while back, depression hit me like a truck and I tried to run away from everything. It all happened very suddenly. I've been on pills ever since but really to be honest all they do is numb the pain. I have been off my pills for about a week just to say. But really I'm sorry, they do just numb everything. This is what I'm actually like. 

My parents are awesome and so is my family. My mother is the most supportive person ever. People think that changes things, but it doesn't. My father on the other hand has always resented me for some reason, I guess I'm not the son he fucking wanted me to be or some shit. From problems I have with maths (discalculia) and generally being someone that doesn't care about anything he punishes me for it. Even with the depression thing, he thinks it's an excuse. Which obviously it isn't. Whatever.

So yeah, I'm done now. So done. I'm just gonna run away, leave my phone at home and let them fucking worry. I don't care.

If my friends are smart, they'll know where I am. If they don't hurry up though, they'll be disappointed.
