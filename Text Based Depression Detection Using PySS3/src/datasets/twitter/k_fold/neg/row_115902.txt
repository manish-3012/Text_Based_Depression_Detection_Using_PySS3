Struggling on a psych wardWell, I'm posting this so I failed my suicide. Long story short, I'm on a section and I have never wanted to die more. I'm so on edge and anxious from things kicking off. My situation hasn't changed in the slightest and I'm getting no treatment. I'm trying to get off my section to go home and finish what I started. It's getting worse in here.
