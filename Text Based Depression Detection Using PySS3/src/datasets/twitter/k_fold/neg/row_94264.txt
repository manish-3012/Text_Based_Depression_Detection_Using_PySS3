iâ€™m 13, going nowhere in life, iâ€™m stupid, i have already tried to kill myself but was stopped by my mum.guys... i feel like shit right now... the comments will be stuff like â€œyouâ€™re too youngâ€ and stuff... i get it, but iâ€™m relentlessly bullied, iâ€™ve got autism and iâ€™m just fucked in the head. tried liking myself once last year, my mum walked in when i was tightening rope around my neck. iâ€™m stupid for it but i canâ€™t seem to shake the desire. 

guys i really just need some motivation.. anything positive please...
