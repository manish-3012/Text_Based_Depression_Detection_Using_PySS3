Ups and downsI have nothing to whine about, since I'm not going through anything hard. I just have this 'dark' feeling that's always present and that is slowly taking over.. I have no energy, I have a hard time going outside, I sleep alot more...I feel like I always need to be surrounded by people to be happy. When I find myself alone, that's when 'the thoughts' take over. And when I find myself alone, all I want to do is remain alone.I thought that with more time on my hands now that I'm done school for the rest of my life, I would make time to do activities. However, I'm doing the opposite..and I feel horrible about it.The other day I had a pretty bad breakdown and the result is that I tried findings opioids to do an overdose. The poison that I hid a couple years back thinking I would'nt need it anymore came out again. I feel lost and I don't feel like telling the people I usually tell that I'm not doing good...
