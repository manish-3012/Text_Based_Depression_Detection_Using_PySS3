This could be prevented if anyone would have helped me, all I wanted just advice and kind words. I hope the death of me and my family will change the future of other hopless people whos flat was taken away. But our lives and flat will be taken by fire. I will go and unplug gasoline canisters. Farevell forever this is the last post in my life
