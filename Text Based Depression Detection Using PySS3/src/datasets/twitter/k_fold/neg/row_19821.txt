i hate this placeim 14 and im already sick of it

i feel so unloved by everyone

i talk to so many people and everything feels so empty

i feel like i try my best to show my love and get nothing back

i know its selfish but im sad about it

i just wanna be anywhere but here
i dont wanna be in my room or my house or at school or with anyone at all

i wanna be gone forever

and maybe when i finally get to die ill wake up somewhere way way way better than here
