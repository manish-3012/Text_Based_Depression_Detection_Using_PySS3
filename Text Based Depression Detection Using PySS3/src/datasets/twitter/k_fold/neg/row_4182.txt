Guys please help me friend is just took pills and says his intentions is to kill himself.He lives 45 minutes away and he said he is ODing. What do I do. I don't know if he's serious because he's claimed to want to die but never has. I'm so scarred. Here a piece from fb chat....This is not a joke. I'm shaking.

I popped 10 dros 5 minutes ago and I'm drinking a bottle of jack.

Alright. So what's that mean?

3 500 mg hydrocodone can send someone into shock resulting in death. But I'm so use to popping them i usually just take 5 to get a trip going.
Do the math.

I'm not sure why you're over reacting to someone you dating for 10 days? 

LOL
That doesn't really have anything to do with it.
I've told you multiple times I fucking hate life. It's unbareble. 
unbearable 

So your telling me that your really just took that many and are trying to kill yourself?

Basically In about an two hours i'll be dead if i dont puke these up which I almost always do.
I would go into cardiac arrest and have a heart attack.
haha i cant help but smile right now

So your ODing?
Tell me the truth.

9:30pm
doing this would be a result
so yes
but my ententions are to see how much of this abuse i can take before my body gives in and collapses.

He keeps wanting me to give him reasons not to. I don't know if he's done it or just wants me to think her has. He is my bestfriend.
