I'm in a bad place.I'm stuck in a real hard place and I don't know how to proceed. 

The more I learn about life on the outside of school and about the people around me the less I want to be here.

In essence it comes down to the fact that I am ugly and I really don't see my life getting better. I'm not unattractive in that I am overweight or some easy fix like that, I am seriously disfigured and I have been since birth. 

I know that you're thinking that this is some stupid immature phase for a 20 something, but I really can't see myself finding anybody to love me. And I know I will be discriminated against future jobs because of my looks. I just don't know what to do. 

I've thought I could run away from this shit. From the hatred and ostracism that people display. Thought maybe if I moved to a different country things would be different. But that is a silly thought to begin with. People are the same deep down through all the culture and social conditioning we all have our instincts. We avoid things that repulse us. I repulse myself.

I've got so much love for the world and its beauty, but people just don't want to hear it from me. They would rather shove me in the corner and pretend i don't exist. Hell sometimes even I'm not sure if any of this is real or a really bad dream.

Most days I wake up and go past a street on my way to class. Everyday I think about just jumping in front of a car and letting it do away with me. 

Look I know it's stupid to value my life based on my looks but that's what people do every day, they have always done it. 

I'm not going to kill myself. At least not tonight. But I really want to stop this isolation, stop this self hate. I want to love the world but it doesn't want to love me back.
