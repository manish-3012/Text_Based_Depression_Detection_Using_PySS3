I lost all my friends due long illness 
should I try to win them back or make 
new one Not suicidal but find this probably better place then ask reddit

Back story: Had only few good friends and was in small closed circle of people i like so i don't know many people outside that circle. 2 years ago i had case of terrible vertigo witch made me almost completely immobile for a year and half friends was so  good stayed with me instead going clubbing staying on new years eve instead going in ski resort but after year they stop (don't blame them). I got better half year after but lost my job. I find new better job but working weekends and cant be hangover or tired so no clubbing most of time when I thought it cant get worse all my friends left for student exchange program for 6 months when they came back they just forget me. Last chance was going to Wienna on Justice concert and day before trip i lost my passport... From there point of view I am guy that disappeared last 2 years 
TLDR my life just spiraling to shit

Should i try to get them back or start life from zero
