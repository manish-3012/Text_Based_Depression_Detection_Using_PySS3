How to liveI attempted suicide in 2015 after a horrible breakup. It didnâ€™t work and Iâ€™ve been living in limbo since then. Nothing feels the same anymore. Music doesnâ€™t sound the same, food doesnâ€™t taste the same etc. I donâ€™t like hanging out with people or doing the same activities I used to love. I am a nervous wreck/shell of myself. I donâ€™t care if I die because I donâ€™t fear death. I only fear living in this cruel world. Thank you and be safe.
