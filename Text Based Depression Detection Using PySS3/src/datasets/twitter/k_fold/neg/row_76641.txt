The start of an ending.The start of an ending.

It started with crying random at nights, because u felt left out always, insecurity, feeling unwanted, heartbroken, staying home a lot. Than losing your appetite, still nobody noticing anything.

U start a lil bit to do the things again u did before all this, u giving urself hope to be better u try everthing but nothing works. U still think about how u r always there for others but they r never for u. U r joggin outside and stop to cry and sit on the ground in the dark. 

U dont feel like yourself anymore, the anxiety keeps kickinâ€™ in u r in a battle with yourself. People thinking u r lying about it and making fun of it or are tryna hurt u with the things u told them in trust. 

U realise.. u have nobody. U are nobody. Nobody needs u, nobody wants u. Nobody cares for u. Nobody sees u. Nobody ever asked u how u feeling, never nothing. U r just nobody. Yet u still be that good person to everybody u love and care for. 

Now i am here with scissors in my hand, iâ€™d never ever cut my hair short. Itâ€™s a big first step. How i look is everything for me. Im bout to cut my hair, and everyday every thought every feeling every other breakdown will bring me closer to the death from now on.

* Im not seeking for attention or wanting any help. It feels good to share with people who understands me or go thru the same thing as me.

PS. Never trust an; iâ€™ll be there always for u, im here for you, love u forever. They lie, they dont mean it. They were never there to listen, never there to make time to talk, they were never there to show their true love. They always were there when they felt they need it for their own. They dont give a fuck about u.
