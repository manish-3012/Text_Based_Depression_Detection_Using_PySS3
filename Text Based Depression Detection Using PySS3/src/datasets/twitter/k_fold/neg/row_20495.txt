I've made my decision, and I'm going to end it before the end of the yearI can't take life anymore. This coronavirus infected shit world is more than I can take. I know my mum will be really upset but I don't fucking care anymore. I put on a mask every day and no one knows my actual struggle, not that they'd give a fuck. 

I have fucked up my life so bad. I found love but foolishly thought she loved me too. How can someone love you and want other people's bodies more than your entire being? I feel less than worthless. I feel actively like a walking cancer. I am this block to a person who actually wants to live. All I wanted was to live with my ex and have a life together, and now it will never, ever happen. Life will never, ever get *better* than this, and this is fucking UNBEARABLE. 

I'm done. People will learn to fucking live with it. I have a plan, and I've fucking decided. Now everyone else can fuck off.
