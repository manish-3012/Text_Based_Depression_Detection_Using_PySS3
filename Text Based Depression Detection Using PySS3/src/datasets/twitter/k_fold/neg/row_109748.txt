There is no futureI just can't see one for me. I can't see where it might come from. I can't see how I can live for any longer.

For the first time in over a decade, I'd stopped seeing suicide as an option. I've still been depressed, but the daily thoughts of killing myself had gone. I kind of missed them, even.

Now... It's not that I enjoy the thought of killing myself, but I really just don't see any way forwards. I feel stagnant, stuck, struggling with no end in sight.
