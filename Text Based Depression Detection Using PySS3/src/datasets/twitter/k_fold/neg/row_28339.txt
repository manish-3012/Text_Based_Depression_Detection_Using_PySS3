How long do you wait until you decide itâ€™s finally time to just give up?Seriously. Iâ€™ve been on more psych meds than I can remember at this point. Finally started self medicating with opiates and they were WONDERFUL. Helped me make it two more years deeper into this life than I probably otherwise would have.
















Now Iâ€™m off them but back on a new cocktail of psych meds as well as Suboxone for my opiate addiction. I go to a psychiatrist twice a week, every week to try and help. Iâ€™ve never been more unhappy than I am now and this is me giving everything I have to try and...live. But at what point am I allowed to give up? At what point can I finally rest? Can I finally say I did everything I could. I tried. I tried everything I could think of and my mind still betrays me every, single, day. 















I am fighting. I am tired. When do I get to rest? I canâ€™t go many more rounds. Iâ€™m used up. So tired.
