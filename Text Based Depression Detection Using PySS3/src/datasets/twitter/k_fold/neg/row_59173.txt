Nothing is real.I can't sleep anymore. My nights, or days, are nothing but half asleep in and out of reality hallucinations interspersed with nightmares and glitches in my head. Nothing is real, everything is real. Everything is a ghost image of a phantom conjuration inside of a 27 sided hallucination, combined with burnt out synapses and serotonin receptors crying out for replenishment.

I am losing my grip on reality, which is slowly melting away like the molecules that make up the skin of an onion, wasting away in the oil of the pan. I don't even know what is real and what isn't. Shadows can't talk, but I hear them. I hear my name called in the darkness, footsteps, I live alone. Whispers, all around me. Who the hell are you people? What do you want? The shadows want me.
At least shadows want me, even if they aren't there in a brightly lit room. No one else does. My so called friends ignore me completely, like i'm nothing. A book on a shelf, merely for show, dust covered and forgotten. Their eyes sweep over me, I've been here for so long without being touched i'm not even noticed anymore. From one side to the other, right over me. I'm a bother. I don't even reach out to them anymore. All I get are terse one word responses, if I get one at all. I just need to interact with someone, I need a fucking friend.

The shadows are the only friends left. The hallucinations. The flashes of a burnt out nerve interacting with what isn't even there.

Fuck. Did I just type all that? I'm at the bottom of a well. Someone throw me a fucking rope and get me out.
