I hate my life .I hate my life, it is so fucked.  I don't even know how to fix it.  I think about dying all the time and the peace it would bring.  I am so tired of being sick and being alone, no one knows me.  I am too sick to work and I'm tired of going to the bathroom every five minutes.  I have mdd, PTSD, I can't get in to see a counselor because of the stupid VA.  I'm stuck in some pointless group therapy.  I tell people at the VA I am suicidal and they do nothing to help me.  

I am so tired if all this living this fake ass life because people would never understand the real me.
