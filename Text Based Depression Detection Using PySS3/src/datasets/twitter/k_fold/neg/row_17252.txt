Inching closer to suicide.Everyday I wake up and my life grows more pathetic as the days go on. Lack of sex and relationships are one reason. Other reasons include mental health issues, lack of friendships. Not being an extrovert and the lack of attractiveness. Every person I seem to always be around, whether itâ€™s work or family always seem to have a better appearance and personality than me. Itâ€™s come to a point where I honestly donâ€™t care about my well being. I donâ€™t eat as much. Iâ€™m not happy. Iâ€™m tired. Thereâ€™s really nothing much I can do tbh. just live til Iâ€™m ready to leave this world.

Nobody would be hurt if I leave, I already know it.
