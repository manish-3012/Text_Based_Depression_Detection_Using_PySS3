I really just need a reason to continueIâ€™ve been unemployed for one year
Iâ€™m a 21 year old transgender woman who has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD. I had to quit my last job at a convenience store as I had stop taking my medication and was having panic attacks constantly, as well as being made fun of by the staff and called useless.
I have since gotten treatment and returned to my medication. 
But now nobody will hire me. Nobody accepts chronic mental illness as a real medical issue, so Iâ€™m just seen as a lazy and useless employee who quit their job after they couldnâ€™t hack it.
My home life is not well either. My parents constantly insult me, calling me things like â€œYetiâ€ (because my hair is long and curly no matter what I do to it), or just saying Iâ€™m lazy.
They wonâ€™t do anything to help me get an education to improve my chances of getting a job. I used my last bit of cash trying to get a bartender license and failed at that. I went to an employment agency who accomplished nothing but getting me one late night shift at a factory where they had me work three peoples jobs with no training then they said they never wanted to see me again with how badly I butchered it. I canâ€™t get or hold any job
Making things worse, my parents canceled the internet. For those who donâ€™t know, most jobs require you to apply online, and will simply tell you to do so when you show up in person. They also will be taking my phone in two weeks, as I canâ€™t pay for it, meaning Iâ€™ll lose any means to go online at all or to receive calls from jobs. I also will not be able to drive as I cannot afford to renew my liscence. This means I will not be able to drive to get to a job or to find one, nor would I be able to get to therapy. Without a phone or internet, I also cannot coordinate with my friends to drive me to do such things
Iâ€™m afraid I have no options left, and that all I can do is end it.
