What I would like...I would like to get out of bed, dress myself well, put in my earbuds, and stroll out to my car while queuing up some of my favorite music. There I can grab my weed and some rope and head to the backyard. 

Once in the backyard, I would like to smoke a bowl or two, really however many Iâ€™m feeling, and fade out while my lifeâ€™s soundtrack runs in the background. When Iâ€™m high, and I mean really high, Iâ€™ll head back inside with my things. 

Inside is where I would like to die. I would like to go into the storage room and string my rope from the support beam. Itâ€™s strong enough to hold. Iâ€™ll step up, slip the rope around my neck, and kick. 

How quiet it could be
