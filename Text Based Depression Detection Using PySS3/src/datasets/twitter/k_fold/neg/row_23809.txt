So scared of being aloneIâ€™m sure this isnâ€™t uncommon for people who are following this sub, but I have felt alone for basically my entire life. Iâ€™ve had probably three people that I have been genuinely close to my entire life except for my mother, and they have all left or are going to leave within the next two months. And that thought terrifies me. I donâ€™t want to be fully alone again. I donâ€™t know if I can handle it. The constant wake up, go to classes, go home, be alone, wake up, repeat cycle. Iâ€™m in college right now, studying to be a nurse and I keep trying to find meaning in it but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve been dealing with anorexia, anxiety &amp; panic, depression, and I donâ€™t know how long I can keep going with what I have been doing. I feel myself coming closer with each day and that terrifies me. I used to self harm daily and Iâ€™m almost a month clean and Iâ€™m proud but at the same time I know itâ€™s not going to last. Iâ€™ve had everything written out for a while now, and it terrifies me that it is just a matter of when.
