Yesterday I almost did itI entered a trance like state...

Finished online classes, printed my last words letter, put it inside of an envelope, went to pray into our family's altar for a while...

Then I went to the kitchen, disinfected my arm and tried to slit my left wrist using a box cutter...

It wasn't sharp enough, so it didn't work at all...

After that I went numb... I didn't cry, I didn't feel anything at all. Just pure emptiness.

My mom found me and tried to calm me down... 

I reached my limit, I was tired of everything, of living a life filled with indifference and isolation, of spending nights being unable to sleep, having cold feet, stomach churns, not being able to focus on school work and so on...

Some hours before, my mom asked me if I could go with her to check out a business transaction of hers... But the place is in a 26-27th floor, which huge windows. You get the point.

I said I didn't want to go, because it was far too tempting...

I think I'm already far below rock bottom... I just can't keep going on like this...
