What more can I do?I have always tried to be okay. I do everything Iâ€™m meant to but Iâ€™m still not okay. I get out of bed no matter what, I exercise, I eat healthy, I meditate, I stay social, Iâ€™ve seen counsellors, Iâ€™ve tried dozens of medications, I try to see the positive in everything. But itâ€™s not enough. Iâ€™m still not okay and Iâ€™m so tired. What more can I do? Iâ€™m so tired, I canâ€™t bare this feeling anymore.
