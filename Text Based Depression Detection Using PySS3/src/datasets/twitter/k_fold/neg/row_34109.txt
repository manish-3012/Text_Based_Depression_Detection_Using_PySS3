11th grade has barely started yet and I cant even do itI cant do it anymore. Everyday is a struggle with my anxiety, OCD and shit. I cant even fucking finish 11th grade without wanting to kill myself. How can I ever survive the real world? And everyone around me is tired of me and my sad shit, no doubt. I've tried before and it didnt work. I'm just gonna drink my brothers wine and swallow a shit ton of pills. Either one of them has to get me. If it works, great. If it doesnt? Thats fucking humiliating and I've felt that humiliation before. I dont wanna feel it again. Im not gonna be stupid and tell anyone about it this time either. If I do that I get caught and get the police called on me before I can actually die. Im so tired. Im so fucking tired of this constant anxiety.
