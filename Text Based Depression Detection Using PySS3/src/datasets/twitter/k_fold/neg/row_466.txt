Is it weird to fantasize about your own death everydayI've been haunted by the feeling that I'm only wasting my life and contribute nothing good for society. maybe i think too much and i tend to overanalyze things but its just one thing that i cant help. im so tired of disappointing people and getting myself disappointed. my only escape is fantasizing my own death frequently each day, imagining how great it must be if i could just suddenly vanish and leave this world in an instant because here, it never gets better.
