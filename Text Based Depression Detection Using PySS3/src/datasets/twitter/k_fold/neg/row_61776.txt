I don't want to live forever aloneI have a bad habbit of accusing my friends and girls I get close with for having an alternative motive. I have extremly low self esteem from being a nerd all throughout school. I didn't actually become "un-nerdy" until mid high school. So due to being constantly ridiculed throughout most of my child-hood, I have real low self esteem.

Anyways, fast foward to a few years later, I started making lots and lots of money internet marketing and freelance web developing for a firm I owned. I went bankrupted late last year. I found out who my real friends are, a few of them left, and a good portion of them stayed. Although now whenever my friends (that I still have from my broke ages) don't answer my phone call, or forget to tell me about some plans, I IMMEDIATLY go off on them accusing me of not wanting around for my money. This happens a lot, but I did it two weeks in a row. Both times I apologized and did it again. I also lost my ex-girlfriend for also accusing her. 

I feel that deep down, because I'm so used throughout my whole childhood of having no friends, now that I finally got friends its "too good to be true" and I immediately think that everyone has an alternative motive for being friends with me. I accuse them, and then they don't want to be friends with me. I fucked it up, and I've accused people too many times, that now I'm afraid that because I was such a douche to them today, and wrongly accused them, they will not want to talk to me.

I feel that I've lost a good 85% of my friends. I can't stand being forever alone. I'd rather be dead. I wish there was some way I can fix my old friendships, and get a nice girl or better yet, get the old one back.
