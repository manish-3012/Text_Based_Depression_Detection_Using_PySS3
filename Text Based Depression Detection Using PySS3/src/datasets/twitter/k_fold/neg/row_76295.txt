Someone I met recently in the hospital killed themselvesI've posted here before in suicidal states. I try my best to listen to logic and reason instead of just acting impulsively. One of those actions was going to a hospital. The last few times I was there, I made some friendly connections with some people. One of them was Bryce.

Just a few days ago Bryce was walking along the train tracks with the intention to get hit. And he did. Another friend who is still in the hospital called me to tell me the news.

I am glad he isn't suffering anymore but ever since I heard the news I feel sick to my stomach. I can't shake this feeling off. I guess I just want to talk about it a little?

In all honesty I am also a little jealous. He got what he wanted. He was suffering for a long time. I've wanted to do what he did for a long time too, in my own way. But most of all, I am happy that he got his wish.

R.I.Paradise Bryce, I'll see you on the other side.
