I've wasted too much timeIt's been 2 years of darkness and stifling of my mind

I've pursued no interests, expanded my mind in no way, hiding from my life 

Muscles atrophied, weight gained  

I cannot see anymore

I don't know what to focus on when I open my eyes because I've abstracted the world of so much meaning, I literally see a blur

I think I am going to cut my wrists out tonight.

It's become as causal a thought as "I should do laundry today, no wait today would be a good day to off myself-- I really should get on that"

Why was I made? An entity incapable of sufficiency, but also feels pain

fuck I cannot believe how detached I am from the world. I'm truly afraid. I cannot make any meaning of anything.

Only I can decide what it means and I just don't want to decide
