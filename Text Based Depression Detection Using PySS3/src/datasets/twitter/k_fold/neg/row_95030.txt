This was meant to go in nofap but idk where else to go This was meant to be a throwaway but i dont have much to lose. i failed no fap multiple times and now ive lost my gf of many years over it. Im devastated because the porn addiction took it to these limits, i was always talking about sex and being sexual because i had these false expectations. Now im devastated because all my plans and dreams are gone. Not gonna lie the suicidal thoughts are keeping me away from the porn rn ( dont give me the â€œitll get betterâ€ story because it wont, being 25 w no college degree and being an illegal alien makes it more difficult) on the bright side of all this ive been clean of porn for about a week my biggest streak yet. 

For the love of god dont be like me and ruin something prescious that you have or may have because of false expectations set by the porn industry. Ty for taking your time to read this
