Why ?Seriously why should anyone stay alive ? There is no after life, why should there be anything ? No religion ever managed to prove about anything. And there is absolutely no logical reason for something like this to exist. There is no soul, there is no god, there is no happiness, there are just chemical reactions in our brains. We're just an insignificant species on an insignificant planet in an insignificant universe. Nothing matters, nothing has consequences so why should I stay alive ?
