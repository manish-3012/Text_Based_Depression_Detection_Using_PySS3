I just want to stop being ghosted...I get it i'm just some pathetic annoying piece of shit but please at least tell me so i'm not as sad. I get left on read or see that i can't message the person anymore and it fucking defeats me. It puts me in such a sad, depressed, suicidal mood. I just want to end it all when it happens. Even worse when you see the person talking in a group chat and doesn't even bother to message you back. I understand that i sound like a selfish person but please i'm begging you if you no longer want to talk TELL ME. It will makes things so much easier but instead you leave me on read and make me want to die even more than i usually do.
