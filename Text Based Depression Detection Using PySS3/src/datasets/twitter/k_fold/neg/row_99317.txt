i think itâ€™s timei have been self harming since I was 11, i have tried to kill myself in the past and i didnâ€™t think I would live past 12. im on antidepressants, the max dosage of the only kinds that work, yet I feel the same way without them. it was gradual but my tolerance kept building up. i am in the same situation i was in during the worst point in my life, i could easily just take one of my dads guns and blow my brains out, or simply overdose or bleed out. I was doing so much better before quarentine, but now i think its time for me to actually take my own life, its not exactly worth it for me if the only reason im staying alive is for other peopleâ€™s sake. itâ€™s selfish of them to have me suffer knowingly just because theyâ€™re attached to me. i donâ€™t really have anyone to talk to about this because i donâ€™t want to scare them. i donâ€™t want them to try and stop me, i donâ€™t think i can get help anymore, Iâ€™ve already done that and im still in this same pit of undiagnosed illnesses because i was raised to be a liar. i was raised to lie to doctors and authority to protect my family, and i was too scared to break that. i just needed a platform to say all of this because thereâ€™s no need for me to leave a note, my parents have already read a few from failures.
