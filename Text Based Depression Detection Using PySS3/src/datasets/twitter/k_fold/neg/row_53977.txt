Iâ€™m so pathetic.I wonâ€™t die. Iâ€™ll just take all my fucking meds again for the second time this week to give myself that nice 0.00001 percent chance of fucking death. That is, if I can find the motivation to move. Looking at my current state of affairs, I think Iâ€™ll live another day. I guess Iâ€™ll see you next week for more pathetic, insincere suicidal ramblings.
