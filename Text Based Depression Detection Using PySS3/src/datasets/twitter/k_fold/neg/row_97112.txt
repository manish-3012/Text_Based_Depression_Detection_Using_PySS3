I'm done I'm ending myself tonightI hate my life 
I hate everything I do 
It's just sometimes 
I feel like I'm pooh,
I want to leave now
But how?
All my life I have suffered 
All I have been was kind and nice
I know things aren't easy
But I've been called names like useless, pathetic by the ones close to me, it's not nice
I'm suicidal and there's no stopping. If I don't die 
today I'll eventually die in 60 years ti. 
No difference. Memories are irrelevant.
