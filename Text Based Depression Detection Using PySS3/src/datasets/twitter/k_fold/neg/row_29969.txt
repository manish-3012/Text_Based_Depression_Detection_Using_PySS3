What's the pointFriends hate me because I push them away. 

No shot at a romantic relationship because I'm an emotional handful and like my friends I push them all away

Wasted my life in school by my own laziness and lack of effort despite my teachers all trying to help me 

I'm alone at a bar right now staring at a half drunk Stella glass and I'm not inebriated in the slightest. 

What's stopping me from drowning and ending my pain and problems once and for all?
