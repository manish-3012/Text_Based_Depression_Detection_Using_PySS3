I'm tired.Well, I'm tired.

I'm tired of constantly disappointing my parents, I'm tired of getting shitty marks in school. I'm tired of being downstairs holed in the basement because I'm afraid of my parents. I'm afraid of what I'm going to grow up into, I'm afraid of what I'm going to become. My mother was in tears today because she doesn't know what I will grow up into. I'm a fat, lazy, lethargic procrastinator and I can't seem to fix myself. I have disappointed my parents so much, and every day I keep crying a little inside.  I have no sense of responsibility at all. I love my family, but I just keep disappointing them.  I'm 19 and my father and mother don't know what to do with me.  I feel like I'm a waste of space, a waste of life. And I'm not contributing anything to this family. I'm not suicidal, but I'm pretty damn fucking close.
