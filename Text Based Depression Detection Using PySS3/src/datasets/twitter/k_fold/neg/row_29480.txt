I suck at life and I suck at dying.Itâ€™s just so frustrating. I donâ€™t want to be alive. Everything is so difficult and I donâ€™t find any happiness in my life. Medication doesnâ€™t work, nothing works. But Iâ€™m so bad at killing myself itâ€™s just so shitty how Iâ€™m still here. 
Itâ€™s like the world establishing how Iâ€™m SO BAD at everything they canâ€™t even let me do the one thing I want to do right. 

Ah fuck.
