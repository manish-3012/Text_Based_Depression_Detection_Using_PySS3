I can't do anything right.To whoever is reading this, I Just want to talk. 
I can't seem to do anything right. 
I'm 24yo, barely ever had a job, still trying to get my degree at university. 
I can't do shit right, I can't speak with other people the way I would like to, I can't help others let alone myself. 
I can't even help my own family, and I see the way they look at me. 
I don't judge them, it's ok, I Just wish I could tell them I am so, so sorry.
I can't do this anymore, I can't keep playing pretend forever.
