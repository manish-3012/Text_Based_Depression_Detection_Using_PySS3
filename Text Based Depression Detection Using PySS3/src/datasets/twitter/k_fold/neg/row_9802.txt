I'm starting crack. My sanity is slippingEach day gets more difficult to keep it together. My facade is my only hope, I hope it can hold. I can't talk to anyone about the shit that goes through my mind. No one listens. They ignore me if I do try to. They only want to use me. No one gives two fucks about me. My demons gnaw away at my subconscious, I don't know what they want. I wander from one thing to another, excessive exercise, excessive sex, cutting, psychedelics, amphetamines, starving myself it doesn't fill that fucking gap. I have try to find a clique but I dont belong. I drift around groups but I can't find my place. Derealization was a crutch till i got my sleep back a bit. Im scared i hear shit that other people dont, i seldom see a flash of light or a black being run past me. People think im crazy if i mention my haulicinations. I just want to clean out my room and end it all.
