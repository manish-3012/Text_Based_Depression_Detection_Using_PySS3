Nobody caresI am 14 and have been suicidal for years. I have tried to kill myself multiple times my family hasn't even noticed I have no friends I live with a hoarder I have to use a crappy projector instead of a tv i got stabbed by my mentally disabled sister and it wasn't an accident I called 911 and was at the hospital for 3 hours before anybody even noticed (I was home alone with my sister) I tried calling my mom multiple times and my other sister was the only one that responded I have more scars than my entire family and I'm the youngest so what's the point of being here if nobody cares enough to even keep me safe when I was little. I remember I was sick at school and my dad came and got me and brought me to his work and my grandma was supposed to come bring me home but she went and washed her car first and she's the only grandparent I have in my entire family I'm about to hang myself
