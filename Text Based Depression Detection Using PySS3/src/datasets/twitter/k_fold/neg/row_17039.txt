I am a mental health care provider, but I constantly think about suicideFor context, I work as an occupational therapist in mental health. I feel shame for my suicidal thoughts. I've tried treating myself, getting counseling, and I've been on prescription medication. I've worsened over the last year. 

I always feel like a fraud with my clients, with my family, boyfriend, friends... I constantly feel like a lie. I'm thinking so much about ending it all but I know the signs far too well. It's gotten to a point where I don't want to work anymore, but helping my clients is really my only anchor left. I know they would be devastated and really lost. I also don't want them to confirm that them committing suicide is justified because I did it. 

I need so much help but I can't seem to get the relief.
