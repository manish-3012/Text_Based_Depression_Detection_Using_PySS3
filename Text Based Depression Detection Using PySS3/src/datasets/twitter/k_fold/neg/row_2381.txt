I'm very sure I'm just a waste of space in my household.I hope one day I'll actually push through with it, because my Dad doesn't need an extra burden on his wallet. And my friends don't need someone who probably doesn't take up much space in their lives. They'll move on and so will the world, because that's how it usually works.
