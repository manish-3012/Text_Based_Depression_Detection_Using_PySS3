My mom hung herself yesterday. She's currently in a coma, being treated with induced hypothermia.I just don't know how to handle this, at all. Being away in Korea, I just never knew how bad her depression had gotten, and she seemed to be having good days right up until she did this. My dad and my brother went on a quick trip to the gas station when she made the decision, knowing they'd be back fairly shortly. It was just such a spontaneous act, with such a small window of opportunity, that I truly can't comprehend any aspect of it. The doctor's think she was hanging for possibly ten minutes or longer, but it's too hard to tell. There's no structural damage or organ damage aside from the brain. She initially responded to no stimuli. They're going to warm her up slowly later tonight and I don't know what to do. The whole reason her depression began is due to my brother becoming Bipolar 1 with extremely psychotic tendencies years ago, seemingly out of nowhere, and it has only gotten worse. The thought of my dad bearing this burden all alone is killing me inside, and I'm scared I could lose him too.

Does anyone have experience with this and should I be holding out any hope for her regaining consciousness. I'm an objective person and I can't help but feel like my mommy is gone, but medical literature seems to suggest this could turn around. I'm dying inside.
