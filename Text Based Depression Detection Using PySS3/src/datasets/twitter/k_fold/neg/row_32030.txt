Can I go back to 2017?Where I actually had a life and woke up at 9 am to go to class and actually studied and paid attention to the professor. And was actually somewhat motivated to do my best academically. And I actually talked to people? And tried to make friends? What a concept I canâ€™t even fathom now. With quarantine and all. Before depression and suicidal thoughts hit. Damn. It seems so far ago, like centuries ago. I wish I could return to those easier times.
