What is the point of continuing on?it's not like i have anything going for me i try to help people and be nice and be someone fun to be around but im always so lonely and sad and nobody notices. i've only ever opened up to one person and it turns out they were just using me to get into a friend group and never cared about me. the only thing i wanted to do when i grew up was start a family but that's not going to happene because everybody seems to hate me before they meet me + it's not like i can even have kids due to the fact that i'm sterile. my options for the future are really slim and it seems more and more likely that i'll just end up being as much of a loser as my parents think i am. i tried hanging myself twice before, but got out the first time when i heard some people coming by ( i was doing it off in the woods where i thought nobody would be), and the second time i couldn't tie the damn thing correctly. i've even mentioned this to my friends before and they just laughed it off, i just want someone to care
