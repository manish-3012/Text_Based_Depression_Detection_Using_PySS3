Friend thinking about stuff rn.. need adviceHeâ€™s freaking 12 years old and my best friend, his parents make him work all day then just go to sleep, took away all his devices so he canâ€™t even socialize, he snuck down to his momâ€™s computer to tell me and a few friends this.... he really seems like he needs help. Any advice? This probably isnâ€™t as bad as most of you guys out there but Iâ€™d really appreciate something to cheer him up.
