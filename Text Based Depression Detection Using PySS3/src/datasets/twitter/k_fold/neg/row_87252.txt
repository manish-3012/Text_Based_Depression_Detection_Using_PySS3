Iâ€™m thinking of dying because I feel like a burdenHi, I wanted to get this off my chest.

I am 19, I wasnâ€™t suicidal some months ago, I was just depressed. But after trying different medications, some completely disturbed my mind. They made me more depressed and anxious. I keep thinking that no one cares about me. If I donâ€™t look okay, they just avoid me. My parents are depressed because of me. Most of my friends donâ€™t talk to me anymore. Iâ€™m a burden for everyone. Even society. 

I cannot focus on my study, so I fail. I donâ€™t know what I want to be later, so Iâ€™ll probably keep changing my studies, which is not nice for my parents who pay my studies. I probably wonâ€™t be a useful member of society since I canâ€™t be productive. I stopped liking everything that used to be a part of me : working out, hiking, playing the violin, drawing. Iâ€™m doing nothing all day. I just binge watch Netflix to avoid my own thoughts. Iâ€™m boring now. Thatâ€™s not nice for my friends not my boyfriend. 

Thatâ€™s why I think about dying. I feel like Iâ€™d relieve everyone. I donâ€™t want to die. But I feel like it would be the right thing to do. Iâ€™m really sad that it is the way I think. And sometimes I wish something would happen that would make me die, so I wouldnâ€™t have to do it myself. I donâ€™t cry when I think of that, Iâ€™m just trying to see the pros and cons. I know that it would hurt my family. But I feel like theyâ€™d be better in the long run, once they grieved.

I wish I could go back to who I was some years ago. I used to be fun, good at school and good at art. Now Iâ€™m just bad at everything, because I donâ€™t do anything, and my brain just seems slower. I want to do so many things but Iâ€™m unable to do them. I donâ€™t like anything. Im just empty and sad. 

Thank you for reading. Iâ€™d appreciate any advices on how to feel better from people who experienced the same thing.
