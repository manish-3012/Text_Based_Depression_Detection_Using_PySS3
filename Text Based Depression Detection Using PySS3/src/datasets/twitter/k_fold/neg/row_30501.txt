my thoughts scare meiâ€™ve been very suicidal lately and I canâ€™t make it stop. I want my brain to stop torturing me with thoughts of suicide. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I donâ€™t want to do it because I love my mom so much. I love my family and friends and I know theyâ€™d be in so much pain just knowing how much Iâ€™m suffering. I want it to end but I know I canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™m too scared. Iâ€™m scared for my mom to see my lifeless body. Iâ€™m scared for my friends to feel like they didnâ€™t help me. they have helped me. I just canâ€™t do it anymore. I want to feel relief. I want to feel freedom and I want to feel release. I feel trapped and I have no options. I just have to wallow in it or just end it.
