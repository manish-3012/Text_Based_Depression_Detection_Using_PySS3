I stepped away from the train tracks today......but only because I thought of the people that'd have to clean up the mess, my parents who would be devesatated, and the fact it happens to be my brother's birthday today and that would haunt him for a long time.

Why do I care so much while my life is fucking horrible? Everything grinds away at me to the point of breaking down in the middle of work, in public; yet here I am holding on a thread because I don't want to hurt anyone else.
