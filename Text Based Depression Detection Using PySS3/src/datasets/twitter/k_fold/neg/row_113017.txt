Is a legacy will valid in case of suicide ?I live in France and I want to leave everything to my sister living in the US. But I wonder if my - international - will is considered valid if it is followed by a suicide a few days after. Can they consider me Â«Â insaneÂ Â» and confiscate my finances, since there is also the international aspect ?
