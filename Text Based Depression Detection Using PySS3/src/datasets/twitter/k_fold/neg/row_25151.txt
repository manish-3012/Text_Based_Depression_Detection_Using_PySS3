Been suicidal for 1 month now, cant talk to anyoneHardest 6-8 months in my life, been drinking seriously for 2 months now, was on 5-HTP for 1 month until a 800mg overdose and I puked. Nothing works out wellz everything collapses around me and no friend of mine can help me, and I dont want to put such a weight on my parents' shoulders.

Been thinking about death and how life would be afterwise for some time, and Im losing performance at my job, gym, writing, even dating. I became completely introverted, whereas im super extroverted and I need to be around ppl to be fulfiled. I just dont want anyone around me. I texted the person who got me to this stage (amongst other things), read but no response, its like absolutely no care. I wrote an official last wish, in which I name the things relevant to name to whom Id pass them.

For the past few weeks I found that literally NOTHING brings happiness anymore, from hitting the gym, or the boxing bag, through playing video games to even jerkin it off. A salary raise didnt bring any either. Nothing. I just cant. Also im facing minor insomnia so sometimes I cant even fall asleep to find peace at the end of a day.

With 5-HTP I failed so i'll def. make sure it works next time, I just havent done it.

For the survivors, why did you not end it after? I cant see any other way out...

I appreciate any form of help! ðŸ˜Š
