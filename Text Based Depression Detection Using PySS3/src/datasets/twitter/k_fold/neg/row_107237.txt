What am I going to do?So Iâ€™m 27, Iâ€™ve had exactly two non-family-related jobs in my life and I just lost the second after 2 months. Iâ€™m also dealing with who knows what in mental illness, Aspergerâ€™s syndrome and anxiety definitely amongst them - Iâ€™d know more, but my GP has referred me to mental health 3 times and Iâ€™ve never heard back. I drink way, way too much. Iâ€™m about to be evicted after my most recent bender. This all would be fine by me, Iâ€™d just opt out, but my partner of 11 years wonâ€™t allow it. He couldnâ€™t stop me, of course, and heâ€™s not abusive... but Iâ€™m just so sick and fucking tired of everything. I have no desire to keep going when I know it wonâ€™t get better. No one knows how fucked our lives are, and Iâ€™d rather die than admit it. I canâ€™t reach out, and even if I did, then what? Homelessness will either separate us or put us under my mom and abusive stepfatherâ€™s roof. I canâ€™t deal with either. I want help, and Iâ€™ve begged for it... but itâ€™s not coming, and Iâ€™m done. I really donâ€™t think I can do this anymore.

Apologies for the babble, and thanks for listening.
