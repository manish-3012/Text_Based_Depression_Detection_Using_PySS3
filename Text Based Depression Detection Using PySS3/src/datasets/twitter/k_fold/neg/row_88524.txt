I feel detached from this wolrdI don't feel worthy of a human being. I can cry, but I can't feel sadness. I can laugh, but I can't really feel that joy, I feel very "neutral". I don't think I could ever get close to anyone on a more intimate level, it really scares me. There's this guy that's really into me, he's nice, I do like him, but I just can't do or feel anything beyond that, so I just push away. It's hard to loosen up in social situations (unless I drink making it easier), I feel so awkward. This is how it's been for as long as I can remember (high school age). I feel like a rock. Yes, I've been through shit (childhood domestic violence &amp; sexual abuse), but I don't feel anything for my past anymore, no anger, no resentment, no sadness, no anything. What is wrong with me? It's making me increasingly suicidal, this inability to feel anything.
