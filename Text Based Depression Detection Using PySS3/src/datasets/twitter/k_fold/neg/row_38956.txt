What procedures are carried out after you commit suicide?I really would like to know but canâ€™t find any information on what procedures take place after you commit suicide, regarding you and your belongings. Are your devices like PC, mobile devices and others confiscated by the police and searched through as some sort of an investigation. If the reason for your suicide is determined by such an investigation, is the reason told to your family, etc.
