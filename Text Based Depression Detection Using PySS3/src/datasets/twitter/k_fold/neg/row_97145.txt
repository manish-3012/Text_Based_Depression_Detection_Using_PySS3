I wish I knew no one so I could kill myself.Outside of my three family members who live with me I know one person. Iâ€™m extremely lonely but not lonely enough so that I can kill myself without hurting anyone. I feel bad because I appreciate that person a lot but it would be easier if I could just kill myself. Iâ€™m so selfish. I need time to distance myself from everyone so I can die without hurting them but I donâ€™t want to be alive for all that time. Perhaps Iâ€™ll be back soon here when I am finally completely alone.
