I donâ€™t want to be alive anymoreIâ€™m a Christian and I know the sin. But if you knew the shit Iâ€™ve been through. The pain physically and emotionally even youâ€™d say â€œwhy does God hate you?â€... I just canâ€™t do this anymore.. I donâ€™t want to live anymore. And I have no friends. No person to be here for me. No family because one talk of my depressing feelings and they donâ€™t want to hear it. I donâ€™t want to live.
