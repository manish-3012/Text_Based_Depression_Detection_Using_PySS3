I donâ€™t feel like I belong hereI just donâ€™t feel like I belong here anymore, my boyfriend of 4 years and I broke up and heâ€™s moved on and made new friends. I felt like this before that, I just always knew that I couldnâ€™t do that to him. But thatâ€™s over now. I donâ€™t have very many friends, so when Iâ€™m gone it wonâ€™t affect very many people. Everythingâ€™s always just been so hard, even typing this post now is exhausting because I just have so many things to say running together in my head. I didnâ€™t think life would be this hard, I donâ€™t want to be tired anymore. I donâ€™t want my only emotions to be emptiness or panic. I tried to love myself, or to convince myself that maybe I could learn to be better, but Iâ€™m just so tired of feeling this way and being so confused all the time.
