I don't want to end my life but my brain just keeps thinking about thatI really don't want to kill myself but I think about this quite often and quite serious. I even promised to one of my few (3) friends that we will live past 21 but I did that just because I was affraid that she'll leave me behind and that I'll just blindly kill myself if that would happen, without any hesitation. I told her that I wont do anything stupid and I really don't want to die but my brain just thinks about how I will never be loved and I feel like that friend started to avoid me. It's just my brain that overthink everything and I know that she'd not push me away but I cannot focus on the good things. I sometimes think very seriously about ending my life and this just makes me more depressive. I hope that she will not read this post and if she does that I hope she'll forgive me. How to stop the suicidal thoughts? Most of the people find it hard to end their lives but I find it hard to keep going. I still have a family that loves me and some friends that would be very sorry if I'd leave. I googled some anti suicide advices but none of the suggestios seem to help. Maybe there is someone that went through the same situation and can tell me how he/she made it out of it
