I don't want to hurt my family and friendsI often think that the only thing that stops me from shuffling off is the pain that I would cause in doing so.

Is this something that anyone can relate to?

I'm not bothered about existing, I just fear for my parents and friends thinking it's their fault if I go of my own accord.
