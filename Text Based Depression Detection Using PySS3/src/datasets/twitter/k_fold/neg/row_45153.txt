I should have jumped when I lived on the seventh floor.Then we moved to the fourth, and now we live on the second. 

Bathrooms are always where I imagined it or falling. It was on the fourth floor apartment when I contemplated for my room. At the corner of my room on the right at the top where there's a large metal pipe that can hold something heavy. 

It still makes sense to do it now even if I live in a nicer-looking place. Money problems are big but i'm still the problem. I just hate that we have sliding doors now. The bathrooms has sliding doors. 

I'm slow at everything I do. I didn't expect to live past my eighteenth birthday and now I just don't know what the fuck to do. I'm selfish and slow at everything. I take up money, space, time. I'm failing school not because I cant understand the material but because i wont do it. I'm a waste. i just plan and plan and tell things to myself but never do it. 

I'm living pass expiration, but I'm still rotten. I should've jumped.
