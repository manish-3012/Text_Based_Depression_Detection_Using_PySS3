I'm happy and satisfied with my life but still want to end it. Does this make me weak?I can't talk to anyone about this because I don't want them to think this is a cry for help, it's not - it couldn't be further than that. This is more for myself to get off of my own chest, I am very content with my life - I just feel like my best living is behind me. I'm turning 30 this year and I never thought I'd make it here. Turning 30 is young, I know, I just always believed I was destined to die young.

I often think of killing myself, and not in a "I feel sorry for myself" kind of way. I just believe that my best days are behind me and I don't want to die old. I want people to remember me as I am now or was in my early-20's, when this version of me isn't a distant memory.

I used to be a semi-successful musician, I signed with a record label that people line up for hours to get a shot at on TV. While I didn't hit it big, all I wanted while growing up was to sign with this particular label and I did it. After music I went on to have a successful career in Marketingâ€¦ and I love my job which most people don't get to say. I make a good living and I have all the things that I need in life.

I loved a girl for years before things ended. It's been years and I've dated a lot of girls since, but everything has been really shallow and unfulfilling. I believe that our society has crafted an attitude of not loving the person, but loving what they can offer youâ€¦ cynical, I know. I honestly believe that the girl I consider to be the love of my life is really a pinnacle for me. So again it comes down to, the best days are behind me and I'm not sad by itâ€¦ I've just come to accept that this is how life goes.

Most people look at me and they see me for face value, I laugh and smile a lot. By reading this you probably built up this image in your head of me, but I probably don't look like you'd imagine. I don't wear all black, quiet the opposite actually - at risk of sounding like a total dick I'm actually a good looking guy. It's just I have very dark and cynical thoughts I bury in my head because I don't want the attention. I like people knowing me as a good guy who smiles a lot and it's how I want to leave this earth.

I have to admit that the only thing that keeps me alive is the fact that if I took my own life I would devastate my family. I had a great upbringing and my family is amazing, I can't help but think that they would blame themselves if I took my life. I can't leave here knowing that my death would hurt them so much. It has made my life so conflicted, I know friends would get over itâ€¦ but my family never would. But knowing this still doesn't stop the thoughtâ€¦ it's tough.

When I walk over any bridge I think: "I wish I could jump." I wouldn't stand on the bridge and disrupt traffic, allowing someone to save my life. I love heights and I am always so close to just hopping over the railing to a free fall, breathing inâ€¦ breathing outâ€¦Â and splash. Relief.

They say suicide is weak, an easy way out for cowards. But I can't say that is always the case, for me it's a way to end things on my terms. One thing they do have right is that it's selfish and that is the only thing that is keeping me around.
