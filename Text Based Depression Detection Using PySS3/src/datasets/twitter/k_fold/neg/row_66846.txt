Thank you everyone!Iâ€™ve posted here a few times when I got really low. Some people responded. And it really helped. Iâ€™ve been feeling much better recently. I still have crippling depression and anxiety but my hope for death has been subdued. Iâ€™ve started a new job and although I anticipated some negative ramifications, things are going a thousand times better than I thought. 

So thank you for chatting with me. Thank you for posting so I knew I wasnâ€™t alone with my suicidal ideations.
