It's selfish to leave but it's also selfish to ask me to stayIt's it, I'm tired of hearing always the same response. When I think about my life's decisions, I think about all potential damage that could be made. I know that, if I do it I will hurt others, but if I stay not only it will be having to stay here until I die for "natural reasons" but also I will hurt people the same way because of the negativity I throw to others.
I'm tired of how "everyone" uses excuses as what would happen to others, you still have lots of things to do, you just need to work about it... Which, at the end of the day, they're all true, but it looks like the only reasons I'm given is either staying unrealistically optimistic or a straight guilt trip.
