in desperate need of helpI am 16 years old. I have attempted Suicide countless times, failing each time. I was put into a mental hospital for a week but i had hid my depression from the doctors to get an early discharge. I got out and felt better sometimes but i still thought about suicide. That was in August. I am still suicidal. I used to use drugs like xanax to numb the pain, but after each of life's obstacles i tried something new. I don't have drugs anymore. I have no comfort except for my best friend, but sometimes even she can't help. I need someone to help me. What do I do?
