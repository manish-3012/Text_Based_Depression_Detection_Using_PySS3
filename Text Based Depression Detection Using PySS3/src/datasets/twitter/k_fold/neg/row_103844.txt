Keep going.... For what?Why should I keep being miserable? Why should I have to suffer yet no one wants to help? I can't work because I can't afford daycare because I can't find a better job because I can't afford school,  because I can't find a job is a fucking cycle! I want it to end.  Day in and day out I think about just being DONE.

I have no family,  I was adopted and my mom died when I was 14 leaving me with someone who only took me in for the money. Kicked out at 18 and it's been shitty ever since! I started a fundraiser but no one gives a shit. I have bipolar depression and can't afford health insurance and I can't afford services or meds without it. I don't have dental insurance but the left side of my mouth hurts,  a filling came out.  I need new glasses,  but I can't afford them without insurance. I go without.  I'm underweight. I eat maybe 500 calories a day but I'm so stressed out about money and I don't feel like eating. I'm having gall bladder issues too which cause pain but I can't afford surgery to have it removed.  I also have complications from child birth that are just now starting to cause problems with daily life. 

I'm scared,  my bones are starting to jut out,  and I know I can't gain weight because of the mental issues in having. It's been 3 years of trying to cope. If I don't stay with my child's father,  I am homeless,  I don't have any friends, no car,  not a penny to my name.  My son is taken care of financially by his father but nothing is left over really since rent has gone up. We don't qualify for any assistance with his small income because by our states standards,  we aren't poor enough. 

It's not going to get better for me. 7 years of suffering,  of no one giving a fuck,  of never being able to dig myself out of the darkness.  I can't even get a hand. 

None of the clinics accepting no insurance are accepting new patients.  I can't afford a stay at the hospital.  I can't afford to get strep. I can't afford to survive a botched suicide attempt. 

I think I'm starting to finally sink after trying to keep my head above water for so long.
