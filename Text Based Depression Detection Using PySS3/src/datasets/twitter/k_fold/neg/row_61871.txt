Iâ€™m having thoughts of just running awayI just wanna run away and just die alone. Nobody in my family seems to give a shit, not my brother nor anyone else, our highschool just had a winter formal and everyoneâ€™s bragging about how theyâ€™ve gotten laid and shit like that with really pretty girls, while I just was there. Nobody cared I was there, nobody took notice of my existence, not even my friends did, who knew I was gonna go. Been self harming for a little bit, (like a week maybe) and nobody seems to have noticed, even though I sometimes go out of my way to make people notice them, because ya know, WHOâ€™D GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ME RIGHT? 

I just wanna run away and die, where no one will know, and where no one will care. And if my predictions are correct, no one will see or care about this post. Kind of like my life
