Tomorrow starts the endIâ€™ve finally grown the balls needed to finally say enough is enough. Tomorrow Iâ€™ll get on a train and live however I want for a while, going from place to place, city to city . Maybe Iâ€™ll find what Iâ€™m looking for in life or some meaning to it all. Or maybe i wonâ€™t and then it will be perfectly clear that I should just end it. Either way tomorrow starts the beginning of the end, either I will find what i dont know im looking for or I will find the truth that I will never be healed of my mental illnesses. Either way, I will find something.
