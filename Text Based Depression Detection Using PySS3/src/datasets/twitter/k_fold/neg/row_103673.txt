Fucking smart assI just can't stop obsessing about this exchange of comments from today. It's just making me madder and madder and I can't stop thinking about it. I just want to put my forehead through a wall, I just feel really fucking fidgety. I want to meet the person in real life and kill them then myself. Only thing I can think about.

I get really mad when I think someone is being sarcastic and condescending and I don't know how else to respond but out of anger. I'll threaten them and their families because of some internet comment. IDK why I'm like this but it just happens, I just snap and start harassing those who I think are mocking me. It's the same thing in real life just it's all intrusive thoughts, I'm too much of a fucking coward to do anything.

I just keep snapping out of anger over the last day and its gotten more scarier then usual. On the way home I was obsessing about just ramming my car into a tree. I found myself just accelerating, doing about 70mph down a country road. Idk anymore. I just hate this fucking time of year and the only person who could help me died in front of me. So I feel alone as fuck and I just want to end everything and be with my mom.

I'm so fucking pathetic. Such a fucking momma's boy, no wonder I'm so fucked in the head. Plus I'm a huge fucking coward. Couldn't do it once, can't do it now. I'm a huge insensitive asshole in real life and everyone who tries to help me just gets mad because I don't respond to the tough love bullshit they spew. No one fucking knows how to help.
