Im back in that place and i just need to ventIt seems every couple of months i end up in this place where it feels like im inside a deep hole ive dug for myself and im looking up at where i wish i was. I feel alone, like ive distanced myself from the world. Ive felt this way for about 10 years. I felt like a failure and a dissapointment to my parents  and i have a very strained relationship with my sister. Im constantly arguing with my wife and she wants to leave me. Whenever im down i tell myself to wait a week and see how i feel. It works most of the time but now it feels like its rinse and repeat. Im stuck in an endless cycle and i dont want to be like this the rest of my life. I  used to think i was just a dramatic little kid but as ive grown older ive come to terms with the reality of my life and i dont see a better solution. When it comes down to it and im about to pull the trigger i cant do it. I want to die but im scared to kill myself. I wish i would just have an accident or someone would kill me. It makes me feel like a bigger failure that i cant even do this. Ive never actually said all this to anyone and it feels good to let it out. I just stumbled across this subreddit and im glad i did. It actually makes me feel like im not alone.
