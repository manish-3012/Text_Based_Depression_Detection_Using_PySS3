I can't do anything anymore and everything is just getting worseSo obligatory "blah blah bah" sob story that makes me sound like a martyr.

So a few years ago I got diagnosed with a medical condition that makes doing things a pain. So of course I have it extremely severe, only one doctor I went to believed how bad it was but of course my parents find a new doctor because obviously I'm just trying to get out of school.

I spent 2 years of my life in the worst pain I've ever felt and had to constantly leave my classes. It was degrading and embarrassing. After failing school because of it I convince my parents to let me take online school(Only after they emphasize how much of a disgrace and worthless I am). I get far behind in my online schooling because deep down I really believe I wouldn't make it a few more years. I have absolutely nothing going for me right now. I can't even go in public anymore without being in pain.

Not to be even more of a martyr, but that's not really it. Of course there's a token grandma dying of cancer I have to take care of. And she was really the only person I was convinced that cared about me. There's some more, but I don't feel like being a martyr.

So yeah, here I am now. Fucking over my future because I didn't think I'd make it this far, and now having second thoughts because of that fuck up.
