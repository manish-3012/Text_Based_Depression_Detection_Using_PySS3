If the USA is the best humans can make or ever made , I want out soon. ( healthcare , suburbs , violent crime , education , housing , cities , cars etc)I abhor the USA and almost everything about it . Above all I hate the healthcare system and itâ€™s greedy , smug looking , arrogant doctors who smile, who ruin peopleâ€™s lives with sky high medical bills and are all rude . I hate the cities in the USA which are full of minorities who hate whites and shoot each other every weekend by the hundreds, no , thousands. I hate cars and abhor having to drive everywhere and never be able to take a train or walk . My white ancestors left Europe and left behind beautiful walkable cities with public transit and governments that gave healthcare to their citizens as a right 100 plus years ago . I hate the education system and how itâ€™s exploits young people to go to school . I hate the working conditions which exploit workers to the max and the people here call it â€œ moralâ€ to do so because muh capitalism . I wish my ancestors stayed in Germany
