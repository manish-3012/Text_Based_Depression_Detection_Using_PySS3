:/I don't know what to say. I guess I'll introduce myself. I'm FoolofaTook, I'm 15, and female. School is stressing me out a ton. And it's only math that makes me feel this way. Algebra, to be exact. I can't understand it for anything. I'm fine with the other subjects, but not algebra. I attended a geometry class (which I wasn't supposed to) and that was easier. I didn't even feel bad while doing geometry. I am easily upset by bad situations, so I think about suicide quite a bit at moments. However, tonight was different. It was worse. I was doing algebra homework and horribly failed, which is no surprise, tbh. Suicide was running through my mind while doing the homework, and was worse when I finished. It got to the point that I was mentally planning my entire funeral. Just about every aspect of it that I could think about. I've never done that before. It was both painful and frightening. I honestly just wish that I was a normal person with normal thoughts. I will have to tell my mum, but I'm afraid to. I've spoken with her before, but I always find it hard to open up to people. I'm homeschooled, btw. Don't know if that was relevant or not. Now here I am, just recovering from crying a bunch, exhausted, and hopeless. I can't get suicide out of my mind and just need someone to talk to. Someone who understands, y'know?
