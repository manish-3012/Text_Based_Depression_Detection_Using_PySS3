Iâ€™m only 13, how do I tell my sisterThis is on a throwaway because Iâ€™m afraid,

So basically my parents are foster parents, and they have adopted 4 kids, I love them all, but the oldest has trauma from their bio parent, we live in the same room and heâ€™s constantly threatening me. A few weeks ago I thought he was gonna kill me. One of them has a sister who has been in someone elseâ€™s custody, but their Gaurdian died, so my parents are being heavily considered to get her. My parents promised after the last one no more kids, and I believed that, and was relieved. But everyone else is on board for getting the kid, but I donâ€™t want too because I can barely handle all of them as it is. Yesterday my sister came in my room and tried to convince me, but I still said no, I can tell she hates me for it, and I hate me for it too. I feel so selfish saying no, but I have to.

So I was going to try to kill myself tonight, but I wanted to try to tell my sister, the one that tried to convince me, because were still good friends. But I have absolutely no idea how to tell her, Iâ€™m scared sheâ€™ll tell everyone else, and Iâ€™m scared if Iâ€™m kill myself that everyone will hate me for it, theyâ€™re all really nice people but I hate living here. I donâ€™t want to hurt them but i feel like itâ€™s the only option. I have nothing to look forward to in life.
