My life in over.Well. I about a week ago my ex started cheating on me with her ex that just got outta jail. I started getting suspious as to why she always went to see his mom and took her to see him jail. It made sense why she dressed so beautifully.  Well I was gonna propose to her Friday but I saw her ex asking her to come over at 3 in the morning. So I flipped out and walked to get ciggs. She left me Monday and moved intobhis house taking our child with her into a home eith a convicted child abuser and woman beater. Now she is refusing me to my kid and I honestly can not handle this. I love her deeply and him.but she broke everything. She left her family and home where she was taken care of for this.. A home with no electricty and him.
I honestly give up. I dont know ehat tondo in this situation.
I am considering buying a shot gun this thursday and shooting myself.
