I will not do it.I won't be doing it now.  I don't want to die.  But for the first time, I'm scared about it.  To those who are suicidal, is the whole thing degenerative?  Does it start with only some little thoughts, to become more serious after?  Am I at this point where there I will slowly become more and more depressed and hopeless and end up doing it?

Sorry if this is chaotic, I'm in mental pain right now.
