Tried hanging myself and taking 8000mg acetaminophen in one dayThat was two days ago. I havenâ€™t showered since.

My bodyâ€™s survival response freaked out and I couldnâ€™t get myself to be suspended for more than two seconds- although it would have been short and painless.

As for the pills I swallowed in a fit, I didnâ€™t even throw them back up. Iâ€™ve been feeling a dull ache in my right side, but it could be my imagination or placebo effect. 

Iâ€™ve been sleeping an obscene amount and every time I wake up, Iâ€™m disappointed that Iâ€™m not dead.

My first college semester after a delay of two years just ended with a grand finale of a mental breakdown and missed exam which counted for 40% of the course grade. I am officially ready to end my life. 

I went to another university two years ago and I had to leave for much the same reason. My body just stopped moving and I stopped caring. Itâ€™s happening again. And itâ€™s all my fault.
