Don't feel like surviving the covid era is worth itI honestly don't feel like surviving the covid era is worth it. The usa continues to descend into chaos. I might end up losing my health insurance if the supreme court strikes down Obamacare. I've already been 51/50ed for telling my doctor I'm planning on jumping off the bridge. And they did nothing for me, and they even tried to stop me from taking my medicine. And also forced me to take a blood test which was traumatizing. So essentially no one can help me. My coping mechanisms like hanging out with friends, cuddle therapy, weed gummies, etc are no longer effective. I'm financially ruined from the GOP blocking another stimulus bill. There's no hope for me, nothing can make me feel happy anymore
