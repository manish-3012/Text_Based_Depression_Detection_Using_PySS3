So..I'm thinking about suicide. I've acctually been thinking about it for a couple of years now. I think its time to commit. My life is a bit of a downward spirial and I'm honestly afriad of whats next. I've hit many points in my life where I was convinced that it couldnt get any worse. That this was rock bottom. 
I think suffication via helium is going to be the best bet for me.  Its kind of odd that im even bothering to post this.  I want so desperately for someone to care about my situation. im so starved for social interactions that i'm pleading for help from unkown strangers.
I acctually learned about reddit through my x-girlfriend.  I only started viewing reddit after a couple of months of our break up. I wanted so secretly to somehow see her post. its been more then a year. this is so pointless, but i want you so desperately to prove otherwise.
a bag full of helium seems so inviting.
