The closer I get to position 0 in the lifeline chat, the slower the number goes down, until it gets stuck at 1Happens every time. I don't have any minutes on my phone anymore. I have been in severe mental pain for 3 hours with no one to talk to, desperately waiting for a train to come to run me over. I tried hanging myself with a belt by my doorknob but it hurt too much and I didn't feel myself passing out. I'm close to jumping off a nearby parking garage. I can't keep going. My last friend has left me today. I have no one anymore. I don't have anything to live for.
