I think my friend in England killed herself but I don't know for sure.  Can anyone on here help confirm or deny?  Her first and middle names are Hayley Lelia.Her Tumblr is http://-suicidaltendencies.tumblr.com/.

On the 18th she posted that she was going to kill herself and she sent me a message saying good bye.  She is a very close friend of mine and we talked often but we only talked within Tumblr so I don't have any other way to contact her.  All I know is that she is 18, she lives in England, and she is the equivalent of a senior in high school.

She and I had a promise to each other that if we ever were over the edge we would message the other and wait for a response before going through with it.  She didn't wait and now I think she is gone.

If anyone knows her and/or knows a way to get in touch with her, please ask her to check her Tumblr and/or get in touch with me.  Please let her know that David is worried about her.
