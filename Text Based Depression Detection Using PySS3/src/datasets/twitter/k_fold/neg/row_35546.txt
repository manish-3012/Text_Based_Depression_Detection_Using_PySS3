What is the point anymore?please please please please let me die. 

All day my brain says â€œI want to dieâ€. I canâ€™t shut it up. I see no future for myself. Everyday i go through these intense mood swings where everything seems great and then all the sudden there is no hope. It is exhausting. I want to end the cycle so bad. I have tried to kill myself before with pills. Obviously, it didnâ€™t work. But I wish so badly it did.

how do people have energy to do things everyday? i feel so worthless and dumb and mediocre at everything i do
