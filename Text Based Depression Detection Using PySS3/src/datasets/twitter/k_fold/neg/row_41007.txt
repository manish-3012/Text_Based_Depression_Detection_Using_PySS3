Im not wantedHello

i have come to conclusion im just not wanted anymore. Not intresting. Im at the age of 22. I feel people or my friends im surrounded would be much better if im gone. Most people i meet like to get into fight with me. The blame is place on me then. So its better for them not me. My love life doesnt exist. My life is falling down and no one would be there for me. I barely have fun and everything. i wish i was better. They say the will be there. But after i fall down they say its your fault. No support at all. I have no best friends. Because i suck at life. I am not much of a talker. Because i always get " you dont know about it" and if i know about it i will be accused of not.  Like im hating mylife and myself i could only beat the shit out of it without getting hurt. I would do it
