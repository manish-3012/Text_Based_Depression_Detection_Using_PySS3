I desperately want to jump off a bridge or hang myself but I'm too much of a coward and I'm afraid of the possibility of being "punished" in the afterlife. I hate myself.I want to die but I'm coward... apparently I'm just going to be miserable for more pointless years. I'm considering taking up "death wish" hobbies to speed up the process and loophole the whole suicide maybe a sin situation... I quite but cigarettes are back on the table for sure, skydiving, drugs, might take out a loan for a fast and flimsy car... open to suggestions. If there's a way I could save someone else's life while sacrificing my own, I'm down for that. 

I just wish I didn't exist and I was never born. I cant deal with the though that my "spirit" may be stuck in perpetual torment. I didn't ask for this life and if given the option or the foresight I'm pretty sure I would have refused it.

This sucks.
