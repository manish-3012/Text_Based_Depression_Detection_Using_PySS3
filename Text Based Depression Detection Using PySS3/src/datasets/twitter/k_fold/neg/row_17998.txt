Could this help me or am I a lost cause?I'm an almost 18 y/o female and I'm still in high School. My depression and anxiety has skyrocketed since new years and it's gotten to a lower point than ever. I can't get up to go to school at all, all I can do is lay in bed until I ache everywhere and most days all that's on my mind is what it would be like if I was dead.
My parents have always been very clear that they did not want me getting on medication for it. I have family members that take medication, but they never wanted that for me. Now, they're actually making me an appointment for it because it's been so bad and now that it's here I'm scared.

I know this probably sounds ridiculous coming from someone who wants to die, but I'm scared about having that on my record and I'm scared about what medication would do to me.
The job that I've always wanted requires good mental health, and having depression and anxiety on my record would put me at the bottom of the list.
I don't even understand my thinking, honestly. I don't think I'll ever make it to the job if I don't get help, but if I get help there's a chance I'll never get the job. I've had the mindset that 'if I don't get this job, there's no point in living' and I'm aware that's bad. 
Does that even make sense?
I'm mostly looking for advice, maybe some words of comfort. What do antidepressants do? Will they make me not myself? I'm scared to lose this part of myself, as sicm as it sounds. I've been like this since I was 11.
