How do I live with the guiltOk. So I made a stupid random choice when I was about 16 and it;s getting to me.

I was basically being molested by a relative and I did a super erratic thing which haunting me right now. 

on a random walk from home, I randomly assaulted a classmate and screamed his name out loud pretty much being an annoying asshole. I did everything I could to torment him and he later on was excluded because of what he did to me (i was excluded as well so none of it mattered)

He later on went to do a bunch of horrible things to people because he was already a loner and had a death wish. It gets to me everyday and I am living with the guilt I possibly created a mass shooter because I hear he's been basically at the end of his life and ready to die.
