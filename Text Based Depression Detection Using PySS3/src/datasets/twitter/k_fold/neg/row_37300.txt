I miss my 4 month old son and without him there's no point in life at all.So a year ago I gave up everything for a woman i loved. Moved from the UK to Arkansas, she was pregnant at the time and wanted to be around her family.

On June 26th he was born, Rayne Andrew Brady Stephen. He had my name, looked so much like me yet had his mothers eyes and smile and he is perfect in every way.

For the first 6 weeks I was there and then one day I found out she had a registered sex offender around my child and lost my cool and fought said offender; for that outburst she left me and I haven't seen my son in around 2 months now as she won't let me.

She's destroyed my character, lost me my friends, has convinced everyone I'm a meth and heroin addict while still letting this sex offender around my child and the police don't care when I tell them this as her small town police are friends with the family and corrupt.

I can't afford the 5000 dollars needed for an attorney to fight for him, so she's already won unfortunately and without him in my life and with no friends or family here I don't see any point in living at all.

My life, my family, has already been taken from me. So I'm already dead as far as I'm concerned and with nobody left to care I'm gone and him at an age where it won't hurt him I just feel like this is the time for me to do this.

After all he'll be raised on her lies and thinking I abandoned him anyway.
