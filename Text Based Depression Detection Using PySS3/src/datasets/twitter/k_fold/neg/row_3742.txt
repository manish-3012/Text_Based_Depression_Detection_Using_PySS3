A realizationOver the past months, Iâ€™ve been feeling pretty awful, but never suicidal, or so I thought. I thought it was just frustration at how Iâ€™m kind of spinning the tires at school. But then I made the exceedingly stupid decision to come to this sub and lurk, and I realized that, holy shit, I feel exactly the same as everyone here, outside of circumstances.
