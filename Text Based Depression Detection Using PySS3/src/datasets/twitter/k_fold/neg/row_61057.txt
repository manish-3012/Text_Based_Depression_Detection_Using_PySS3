Feeling numb and stupid. Very alone. I could really use someone to talk to.I don't mind if this looks like a cry for attention, because really I do just want someone to pay attention to me. I don't expect to get much of a response, but I just need to feel like someone gives a shit. The sad thing is, I have friends who care about me, but it's like it doesn't mean anything. It feels so empty. And in this moment, I am alone. I don't want to be a burden on anyone. I'm sorry to even be a burden here. Surely other posters are more worthy of help than I am.

Things have just been getting worse and worse. I'm so tired of failing over and over again. I'm so tired of doing this, living this life day in and day out. I'm not sure how much more I can take. Ask me any questions you like. Ask me about my plan or my trauma or my failures and fuckups. I'll tell you anything. Anything to just feel like someone notices me.
