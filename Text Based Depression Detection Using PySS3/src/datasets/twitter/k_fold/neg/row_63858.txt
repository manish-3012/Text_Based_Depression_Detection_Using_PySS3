I keep telling people they are pushing me to the edge and of course they wonâ€™t believe me.I keep telling people I donâ€™t feel good, I donâ€™t have the energy, i donâ€™t feel okay, nothings helping me, etc.. and itâ€™s always met with â€œyou just need to keep yourself busyâ€ â€œit gets betterâ€ â€œyour family should motivate youâ€. And you know what? Iâ€™m gonna be honest. My family *doesnâ€™t* motivate me. *nothing* motivates me. And thatâ€™s why *iâ€™m not okay*. Iâ€™ve been through an attempt before and this is how it started. Everyone on my fucking back for everything in the world. But nobody will listen until itâ€™s done and then theyâ€™ll ask â€œwhy didnâ€™t you tell anybody?â€ Whatever. I just canâ€™t wait to die
