Returning to work after failed suicide attempt and extended leave.About 3 weeks ago I attempted suicide, failed, was in the psych unit 2.5 days and returned home to the care of my therapist and psychiatrist. Work doesn't know why I was in the hospital, just that I was and am on fmla. They will know why today bc i had to submit paperwork to HR to cover my leave. I was supposed to go back today but my anxiety has been horrible since I have been out of the hospital and it was even worse this weekend w the anticipation of going back to work. 

The backstory to this is I already have a history of anxiety and depression which work is aware of bc I've taken leave before, this time it got to the point where I would have rather killed myself than return to work. I work w an adult w autism who's aggressive and it's triggered a lot of anxiety/ptsd crap and whatever. I got injured by him more than once and I was blamed for it and I'm also in the middle of some workers comp case for the injury, had to get a lawyer etc. so that's still in limbo and I'm not sure if work is aware I got a lawyer yet either. So it's all kind of a mess.

I guess this is me just venting but I am just terrified and have been a wreck since after my attempt.

And yeah I've been looking for a new job and actively engaged in treatment. Just feel overwhelmed.
