I feel like an alien everywhere I goEverytime I go out anywhere in public I want to cry. When I go to a restaurant I feel like I'm about to cry because I feel like I'm being watched by everyone. Yesterday a gas station wanted to interview me, but I called them and said I couldn't come, I didn't tell them I was too terrified to show up. I'm just so angry at myself and I want to curl up and die. I applied to more jobs and I'm going to volunteer at a clinic starting in May, but I don't know if I can even show up. I used to love going to a makerspace and a writing club in my area but now I'm too terrified to go to any of them and I'm so angry at myself because I can't enjoy any of it anymore. I'm so terrified of seeing people and I just want to close my eyes and disappear. Everyone else just looks so confident, I can't stop thinking about all the confident artists/musicians/writers I keep seeing on Twitter and yet I can't even go to a gas station and I just want to disappear and die.
