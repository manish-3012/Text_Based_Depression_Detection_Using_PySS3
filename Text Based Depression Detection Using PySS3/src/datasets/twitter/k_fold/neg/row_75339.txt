I just can't take it much longer I'm almost half the age of my coworkers, the only female and nobody respects me even though I give them my best effort. My boss talks down to me like I'm stupid, and that's probably because I don't know anything about this field. I ask questions and I retain information really well. I commute to work by public transit because I can't afford a car, which means I'm gone at least 12 hours a day, and even then sometimes I'll put in extra unpaid overtime hours just because I really want to make sure I'm keeping up (which I barely am).

School is going okay, but I'm putting in too many all-nighters. I don't have any friends. Not at work, not at school. I know I need therapy but I can't afford it, especially not since my parents depend on me as a backup source of income. I'm 20 years old and my mom visits whenever she needs me to write her a check for $700 or so. 

My boyfriend and I moved into his mom's house rent free to take care of it while it was being foreclosed and she lives elsewhere. My boyfriend barely cleans and I can't keep it clean, either, so when his mom came over today, she said she was so disappointed that the place was messy and I feel like shit. I really want to move out but my boyfriend really likes not paying rent and won't give up such an "opportunity". 

I feel a little better posting this. I'll just submit it anyways
