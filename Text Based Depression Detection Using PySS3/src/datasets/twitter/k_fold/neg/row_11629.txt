i cant take this anymorei really cant everything in my life is so toxic i have never felt a little bit of true love or actual concern with me
all my life i tried hard to be a good person, all my life i helped people who didnt even deserved to be helped, my father left me twice, same as my mom, rest of family didnt care enough i loved 1 person with all my heart during my time on this planet i think that person loves me too but i cant feel it or maybe i dont even know what it feels like
what is the point of living a life where no1 cares about you not a single phone call just to talk, i am an ugly sadistic bastard i have never harmed myself in any way but i have thought about it many times
i dunno if im crazy but i do got a friend , at least i think anyway
heÂ´s been following me for the past 5 or 6 months always looking at me from the rooftop
black in all its feathers eyes are red as my blood such a beatifull creature the raven
i talk to him sometimes, but he never answears back, guess it just feels good to heard
i dont even know how to explain my pain cause in all honesty i cant even feel that i just became numb 
but i guess this little raven gets me, heÂ´s lonely too i have never seen him with anyother raven or crow
maybe this one is supposed to just be there for, anyway i have made it trough 23 years of pure hell, never enough food, never any good at having friends, always been awkward, i only feel close to animals whats wrong with me
i will end this all there is nothing anyone can do for me
the things i saw growing up made me numb i do not cry i do not laugh i do not get mad nor happy im just here sitting emotioneless all by myself as usual 
should it be painfull or quick? ill figure that out soon
