Received a call from my mom telling me my little cousin misses meMy mom wanted to take me out to a local event tonight, and I didn't want to go. I feel particularly tired, and I just felt like dying and happened to be thinking about when I might want to go through with it, but then she told me that my little cousin, who's currently 6, asked her if I was going and that she wanted to see me. Hearing that made me cry, because I feel so guilty and ashamed for feeling the way I do and how I thought about having kids of my own in the future, but I feel so broken and fragmented that I wonder if I'll ever be able to live long enough and be healthy enough to do so.
