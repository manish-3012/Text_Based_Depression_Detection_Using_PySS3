Ran out of time.I have unfightable mental illnesses that will get worse and continue to hinder me throughout life. They currently make college and work impossible, relationships a fantasy and friendships extremely difficult. I have tried hotlines. I have tried therapy. I don't care anymore, I just want to die. Just wondering which method to use out of 3 or 4. Fuck this shitty, worthless, tormenting existence. I'll be dead in a day.
