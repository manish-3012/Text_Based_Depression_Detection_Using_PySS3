Drug addict. Im stuck.Ive been very sad and generally fucked up for years and have been doing the typical routine of drowning myself in drugs to hide from my feelings and emotions. Last week I took an extremely large dose of xanax and then drank and drank on top of it with the basic intention of not waking up. I really shouldn't have survived seeing as people have done less than I did and had passed. Since then Ive been exhausted and felt like a failure because of it and was too distracted to try it again or anything worse. Now Im coming back around on the same path as before. 
I'd really just love to talk to someone.

Thanks guys
