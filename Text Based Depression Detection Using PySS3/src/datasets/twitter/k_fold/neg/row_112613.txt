My suicide is reasonableI would like to get a piece of mind out there, and off my chest. I don't want people to help me, all I need for now is to assemble my thoughts.
If I were to commit suicide, then I'd consider it reasonable for a simple, but effective reason. 
I am weak - physically, but rather mentally.
You look at me, and see a bitter, arrogant child, and you are right. 
I seem to be very self entitled, and thin skinned. While that does not show on the outside, it is true in the core - too many memories prove, and humiliate me on this simple fact, and they repeatedly grow in amount. 
I am not a good, or to be pitied person in any way. 
I haven't lived through noteable hardships, am not of any mentionable intelligence, talent or wisdom.
But, I assure you, I am very flawed in the head. It's not a matter of illness, but character. I used to think I'd be strong, I could be successful or the like, but that is simply not true.
In my opinion, I'm simply unable to properly live out there, no matter what I tell myself. For that I am too weak, spoiled and selfish.

Suicide, for me, is not an escape, not an end to pain. It's a form of acceptance, and awareness.
I am too weak for this world, my mistakes are too severe, my apathy and hate too strong. 
Whether it'd mean for me to be a coward, selfish human or alike, does not matter to me anymore. 
There is no self esteem, trust in myself or honor left I have to protect. The person I am makes me mad, and what I have done even more. 
I've missed my chance, and catched the wrong train. Many times have I told myself there is no giving up, but now, that sounds very arrogant. To believe I have any ounce of wisdom, experience or suffering to make me be able to judge myself, and this world.
The day I'll go, I'll go a little angry, but happy. I'll be ready, and know that it happens for a reason.
