I have an abusive grandmother who likes to abuse me.  
She likes to ccontrol over the smallest things i do like where i go, what im doing in the toilet for a long time and what i do outside. It even escelated to the point on which i had to sent my location to her after school every single day. This morning, she verbally abused me in the car saying that im useless and all that not. I just kept quiet and played my phone. Lastly, i got out and closed the door behind me and just went to schhol as if nothing happened. It was a dread to go home tdy. I was feeling scared and when i finally reached home, i just ignored her. She kept scolding me over and over again. When i answered back, she went haywire. She waved her stick at me and threaten to kill me( like she always does) and comes swinging at me. I quickly ran into my room and closed the door. A few mins later, i went out and handed her a few things and asked her to hit me. She ignored. She then "cried" in the toilet as i held a knfe and tried to kill myself. As i wrote this post, i was encouraged by my friends on discord that tried their best to support me

But i wanna just die.  
Is there anywhere where i can just run and finally be happy?  


I have an aunt which always worked and have little time for us. She is paid alot and she treats me all sort of stuff. TBH, this havent happened before but something similar occured. My aunt went haywire one day caused i ordered the wrong meal. She hit me over and over but we apologised to each other afterwords. However, my grany just keeps adding fuel to the fire saying words like "thats how he has always been" " useless" " cannt even fight back" "MEN DONT CRY". Ever since then, my aunt tried her bast to distance me and my granny but failed misrably and i had to ssecretly deal with this. Im useless, ugly and stupid.   


THIS IS THE FINAL STRAW.  
where can i go to finally free myself from this horrible prison?
