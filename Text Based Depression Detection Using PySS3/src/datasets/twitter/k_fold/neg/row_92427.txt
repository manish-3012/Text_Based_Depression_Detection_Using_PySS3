"It's rude to say you're suicidal"My mÃ©mÃ© said that at dinner last year during Thanksgiving. I didn't know what to say, so I just said nothing. My mum was suicidal as a teenager and she'd just left the room when it was said. 

I'm seeing her first Thanksgiving again next week. Not thrilled but i know I'll get yelled at if I refuse to go. Just. Charcoal on a fire at this point.
