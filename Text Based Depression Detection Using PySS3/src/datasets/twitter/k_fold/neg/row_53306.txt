I can't take this life anymoreToday, 3 months ago, my girlfriend broke up with me and it's been very difficult because she was my only friend. The relationship ended because of my depression and also because I have bipolar disorder and am a very unstable person. She always tells me that the end of the relationship was all my fault, in fact it really was and I already feel very guilty about it. She says she can't handle it and does not want to live with someone like and that which makes me feel worse. She is everything to me, until then she was the only person who understood me and now I feel lost, I have had two suicide attempts recently and I want to try the third and the last one soon, because I know that I am going to die alone of Anyway, I can't stand being alone anymore and having no friends and no one, no one will want a destructive person like me. I'm tired of this whole fucking thing.
