i just canâ€™t handle it anymore.the anxiety, feeling empty inside all of the time. Iâ€™d give anything to have something happen to me so I didnâ€™t have to kill myself. I donâ€™t have any reason to stay alive, i donâ€™t even feel like iâ€™m actually living. just going through an endless cycle of waking up and not doing shit but feel hopeless. I canâ€™t do it anymore, iâ€™m not strong enough. Iâ€™ve tried and tried and tried but so canâ€™t stay afloat for much longer something has to happen.
