Absolutely ashamed with myselfI (M32) was in a FWB relationship with a girl from work (27) for about 9 months until April 24 the day before my birthday she called me crying and wanted to change the terms of our relationship. She loves me and we're best friends but she doesn't want to be romantic anymore. She doesn't want to lose me. Instead of being there for her and telling her it's all ok I deleted her and in a move of strength tried to use her anxiety against her and ignored her future texts and wasn't really listening to what she had to say. 

I knew I did irreparable damage after that incident. The next week, in a state of panic I called her and went over to apologize and that I can't believe I ghosted her and treated her like that. 

Now it's June. I haven't moved on from my manipulative, emotionally abusive behaviour that I exhibited when the best person in my life needed me the most. I let it all go, I chose the wrong path. Now, during quarantine and the loneliness and heat I have thought about suicide every single day. I cannot forgive myself for doing this and having made these kind of mistakes my entire life, emotional sabotage. I am ashamed and guilty of who I am and I cannot bear to look at her or any of our friends. 

I'm writing this from a psych ward in a hospital where at the same time I have made arrangements for firearms through street people I know. It's scary but my head is pounding everyday and I haven't slept in months. I feel like I've completely lost my mind and every part of my being. I have no idea who I am anymore other than a manipulative monster.

I'm not afraid to write suicide into the story of my life and that is the most terrifying part of it all. How did I get here.
