My life has been shit and I haven't been happy for 10 years now.Life is a constant struggle. Life is meaningless. I try to improve myself but can't. My parents live thousands of miles away and I had to leave them 10 years ago when I was barely a teenager due to reasons. Romantic relationships are extremely difficult. It's hard to trust people. I don't have direction or structure. The world is going to shit. Human population will be 11 billion by the end of the century. The stupid reproduce more than the smart. Consciousness was a mistake. End of rant.
