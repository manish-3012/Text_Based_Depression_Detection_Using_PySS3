42 year old virginIâ€™m a sad 42 year old virgin, I never kissed a woman and at this point I donâ€™t think I ever will. I guess I should get used to the fact that I will be alone for whatâ€™s left of my life. I am so ready to get off this ride, all I see are people having fun and being together. I donâ€™t even have anyone I can truly call a friend. I have nothing and have amounted to nothing. I think I was a mistake and the best thing to do is to put me down like an animal. I am on meds for my mental illness but nothing works long term and I donâ€™t have insurance to see someone regularly.
