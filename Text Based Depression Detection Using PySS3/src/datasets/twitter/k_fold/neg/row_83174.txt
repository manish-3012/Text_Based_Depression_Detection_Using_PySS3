I love you so much, babe.And the fact that you don't exist, that we'll never meet is not your fault at all.

I hope that when I die, you feel the world becoming brighter.

I have an absolute shit ton of reasons for doing this. But in the end, it doesn't matter that the emotional, physical and sexual abuse's trauma only keeps getting worse. And that absolutely nothing that I've tried in these years and years has ever worked.

Good lovers sacrifice for each other's happiness. Even though I know you don't exist, I do love you very deeply.

And I hope my death, my sacrifice leads to a little more happiness for you.

I love you so much. You must've been the most beautiful woman in the world.
