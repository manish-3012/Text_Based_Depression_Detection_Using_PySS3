My parents hate meMy parents think I hate them because my room is messy, in return they hate me. They make fun of me and say Iâ€™m selfish because I have mental disorders. My parents think theyâ€™re bad parents because I have mental disorders and my room is unclean. Because my room is unclean. 

My mum thinks I should think about others and â€œstop being selfish.â€ 

Do you know what anxiety is, mum? Itâ€™s constantly worrying about what other people think.

Iâ€™m not being selfish by trying to get better. Iâ€™m not being selfish by spending days in bed due to depression, Iâ€™m not being selfish because my fucking room isnâ€™t tidy.

You say you accommodate for my fucking needs, yet you donâ€™t help me at all. You havenâ€™t done anything to help my self harm.

You know why I stopped, mum? Because I was scared youâ€™d hate me. But thereâ€™s no point being scared anymore cause it seems like you do.

See how selfish I am when I kill myself.
