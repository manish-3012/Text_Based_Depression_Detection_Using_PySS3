If something happens to my cat, Iâ€™m killing myselfMy cat Kairi somehow got inside a hole in a wall and disappeared. She doesnâ€™t seem to have any way back. My family thinks sheâ€™ll somehow come out by herself, but she looked genuinely trapped last time I saw her and Iâ€™m freaking out.

I love her. I swear to all the gods in heaven, if she dies inside that wall, Iâ€™m killing myself. If she goes missing for over a day, Iâ€™m killing myself.

Thereâ€™s a very tall bridge near my house. It would be so easy. I donâ€™t want to live without her.

If she turns out to be ok, I will post a comment here. If I donâ€™t post anyhting...
