I really want to end it allI never thought I would be searching for reasons to live at 3 in the morning in google with my tears rolling down my face. Everything feels so heavy, I can't live any longer. Everyone who says that it gets better is lying, iâ€™ve been feeling this way for 4 years now and iâ€™m only a teenager, thereâ€™s nothing left for me to do here.
