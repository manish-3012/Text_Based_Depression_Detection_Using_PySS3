Traveling to Japan to comitt suicideI can't find much information on traveling to Japan to comitt suicide in the sea of trees. I know this is a thing.
I'm a 33yr old female from Canada with citizenship. I need some guidance on how to go about doing this. Or if someone can guide me to a thread or forum about this topic.
