no titleThe past 4 days of my life have been torture for me. They should've not been, but due to my issue it was a living hell. I don't know if it's the problem that's slowly eating up what's left of my sanity or the fact that I have no one to talk to about it. Too afraid to really go into it, I have once before on here, but still not fully. My mind is too clouded to make any rational decisions, I need help with it, but I can't. I can tell it's getting worse by comparing it to the same experience 3 years ago. It was still there but not nearly as bad or severe as this is now. 

I want to be happy, but it's either too late or it was never possible in the first place. It's not achievable, so suicide is really all I got.
