Grey AreaI'm pretty sure I'm going to live in this grey area of suicidality for a long time. I don't want to die but I really don't want to wake up tomorrow. I go on living just fine but I wish I didn't have to. There's things that keep me going, sure. But often times I find myself wondering if those things are really worth it.
