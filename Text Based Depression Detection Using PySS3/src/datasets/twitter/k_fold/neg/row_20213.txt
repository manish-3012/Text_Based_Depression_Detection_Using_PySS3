Looking for helpful articles for my loved onesSo I've posted here before, you all know more about me than anyone in my life besides my beautiful fiancÃ©. 

She is done with us, I'm not and I can't continue. 

I'm not looking for help for me, I'm looking for articles that will help the loved ones in my life cope with my death. I've already written out notes and what to do with my belongings and all that. Most notably my fiancÃ©, my mom, my sister and a couple of friends I've lost touch with.

If you have anything that can help them once I pass, I will be eternally grateful.

I love you all, thanks for listening.
