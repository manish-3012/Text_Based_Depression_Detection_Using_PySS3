So fucking tired of the solution to my problems being "Oh, just go out and serve somebody else!"I already feel like a selfish, worthless piece of shit for being so depressed I can barely bring myself to leave my room. When I tell people how badly it hurts my soul to not be able to ride horses again, the last fucking thing I need to hear is how I should volunteer to help children taking therapeutic riding. Has anyone considered that maybe *I* need therapeutic riding??? Does nobody care about ME and MY fucking needs? Believe me, I do care about other people, but it's so hard to want to do anything for anyone else when you're in such a bad place mentally yourself. I wish people understood how long I've had this pain inside me and how desperately I need help, but don't know how to find it.
