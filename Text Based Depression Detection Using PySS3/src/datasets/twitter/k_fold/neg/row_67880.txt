Things have got better but I havenâ€™tI mostly believe people when they say â€˜things will get better, just waitâ€™, they have. Iâ€™ve gotten out of homelessness, my debts are slowly going down, Iâ€™ve started doing something Iâ€™ve wanted to for years, and can afford to feed myself again. 

Yet Iâ€™m still not better. Iâ€™m overwhelmed by my mental illness. My depression just drowns me and my anxiety makes day to day tasks unbearable. On my repetitive everyday trip I thought, I canâ€™t do this. Iâ€™m in so much mental pain. 

Therapy doesnâ€™t help, Iâ€™ve tried it more than once. Iâ€™ve been prescribed medication, but my phobia of taking medication means I canâ€™t take them. My almost nightly panic attacks are unbearable and I just want to swallow every pill in my house and lay down to sleep.
