I believe the universe/god taunts me sometimesIf there is a god, or the universe is a good, I feel like its taunting me when I see couples kissing, showing off engagement on FB, hear love/sex songs on the radio. It's like it's saying "Haha! youre an ugly autistic manlet who will never experience any of that!"
