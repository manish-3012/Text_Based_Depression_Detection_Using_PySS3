hey, its me again. Since the last post i made my mental state only got worse. Like yeah, the same things that were bothering me are still present, and the new ones also arrived. I feel like im mocked by everyone in my class, that everyone hates me etc. it makes sense when i think about it. My stomach hurts everyday, my head too, my anxiety is getting worse and my will to live is even lower than it was in august, wow. I dont want to die cuz it would make family sad, but i dont want to live through this nightmare anymore, i want it to stop. im pretty much helpless
