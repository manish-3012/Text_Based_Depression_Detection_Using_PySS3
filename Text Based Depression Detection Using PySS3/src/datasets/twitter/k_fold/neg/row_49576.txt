Never seriously considered suicide until recentlyI always thought about suicide but I knew I'd never do it. Until these past few days. I'm just done. I can't get the right diagnosis for what's wrong with me. Citalopram took the edge off for a while, but then it stopped working. Tried cymbalta and it made me a zombie. Now the docs are going with lamotrigine which has been working for my mood swings but that's starting to fail too. It still leaves me depressed and crying anyway. Lamotrogine has also given me the worst acne of my life and I'm just not prepared to fuck around with anymore medications especially considering all of them could lead to weight gain. I just don't see myself ever feeling good or finding the right medications. My psychologist fucking sucks. I went to her to talk about the lamotrigine and within one minute she just wrote me a script for ability and sent me out. I was in and out of her office in four minutes. I don't have any friends, I never did. My sister who was my only friend got married and didn't even tell me (we still live in the same house). I do have a dog and my parents are trying to help but that's it. So what's the point? I don't feel good on earth, why not just not feel anything?
