Tonight is the night. I want to say goodbye.My name is Nicolas. I've been active here and in /r/depression for some time now. I have tried my best to help whomever I can. And I have look at last texts to a few people I've met here never get responded too after they said they were done. 

My life is not that bad. I have many people who love me even if they are far away. I have a great job and a fiancÃ© who, though may be in rehab right now, I'm sure loves me as much as ever.

Last year when I tried to end my life I was unsuccessful and had to experience the world of psychiatric in patient care. 

I will not be turning for help again. 

I am not angry. 

I am not sad

I am not anything anymore. And it's been this way too long. I can't take the constant highs and lows anymore. 

I am so sorry to those I will be leaving behind. I love them all so dearly. And I cherished ever smile we shared. But this disease has taken over and I simply can't fight anymore. The only way now to end the pain of this feeling is to truly end it. 

My only real regret is that I will hurt others in this process. I wish I could let them into the depths of my mind to understand why this has to happen. 

You all have been a wonderful group. I hope you don't hate me or have anger towards my decision and I beg you now for your forgiveness. Please, continue to fight as long as possible. To those who have left us. I'll see you soon.
