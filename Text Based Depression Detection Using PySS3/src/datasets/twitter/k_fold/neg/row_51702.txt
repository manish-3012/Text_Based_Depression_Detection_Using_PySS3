Contemplating contemplatingI had a heavy drug addiction about 3 years ago and I met a girl who helped me get out of that lifestyle and I was so happy with we got together and she knew me like the back of her hand well so on we were good and I fell back into drugs about 2-3 months ago due to being just upset and depressed and stressed with life and I made a big mistake some girl on fb messaged me long story short we chatted I would only talk to her when I was under the influence and I did some stupid things sure enough she told my girlfriend and now she left me and Iâ€™m just lost right now... is life even worth living before her I didnâ€™t want to live anymore she made me the man I am today and I fucked it all up I feel like such a fuck idk if I should just kill myself or not
