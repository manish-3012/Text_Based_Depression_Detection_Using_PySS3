I dont know who to believeIm a freshman college student, well thats not important. I have 3 parents, my real dad and my real mom (wich is his 2nd wives) divorcing when i was 11, i live with my dad and his 1st wife, amd now three of them always looking after me. well they all always treat me good, three of them. But they kinda hate each other, and everyday (literally) they always talk bad about each other but none of them i can confirm, every story is against each other, none of their story is connected. I dont have any other family member since im a disgrace (because my mom is my dad 2nd wife's). I don't know the truth, i don't care, i wanna die. Im not sure if any of them actually loves me, also i want to die but im afraid of dying
