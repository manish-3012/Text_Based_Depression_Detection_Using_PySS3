What are some things I can do to ease the pain of my suicide on my family?I am 22, male, canada. I am not wanting to talk about it or anything. It is the logical decision for me and what I need to do. Yes I have tried everything and considered many aspects. 

So I know this is basically going to destroy their lives. I am sorry but I didnt choose to exist, its not my fault that taking charge of my life means I have no way of avoiding this, its out of my control. There is little way to ease the pain, but is there anything? I got rid of the majority of my belongings and cleaned and organized my stuff. I sold my car, paid off my debts. I am leaving $18,000 behind which should cover funeral costs. I really dont want to write a note but I would if you think it would help them. What else can I do?

Is there a way I can frame this so that they are angry at me or they just think there was nothing they could have done or that it was a good decision. I dont want them thinking things like "I would have done anything" "I wish he told me" "Its my fault". So any tips for changing the perspective? I would want them to eventually be able to move on.

Thank you
