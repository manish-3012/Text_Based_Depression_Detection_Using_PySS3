conflict of intereststhe basics are this:

1. I am very ill; either schizoaffective disorder bipolar type or BP1 with psychotic features, depending on the doctor

2. I take a mood stabilizer, an antipsychotic, a benzo sedative, and a Parkinson's drug (I'm fucking 28) to control involuntary motion because of the antipsychotic. The medication mostly works but I feel intolerably like shit all of the time, to the point that I am deeply unhappy more often than I'm even OK.

3. Not taking my medication means I go crazy and am at the very least unstable and unpleasant and at the most actively dangerous to other people.

I can't go off medication but I can't live on it. Why isn't just removing myself from Being a Problem not the right answer?

It's so odd being suicidal as an adult. It's not the melodrama or despair of teenage ideation, just...very slowly psyching yourself into thinking it's not a huge deal really, it's an option, why not do it?
