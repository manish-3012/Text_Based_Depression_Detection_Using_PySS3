Is anyone else suicidal due to guilt?About three months ago, I was let go from my job due to poor performance, and I haven't been able to get over it since.  My boss was as nice as she could have been about it, and I know she only did what she had to do.  To make matters worse, I only recently got hired for a new job, and it's a low-paying position for which I'm overqualified (I have a Bachelor's degree). I'm experiencing so much guilt due to past (and continued) failure and letting people down, but I also think that killing myself will only repeat that cycle of failure.  What are appropriate ways to cope with such feelings?  It can be so overwhelming at times that I often feel the need to get rid of my gun for precautionary reasons.
