I don't see the point anymoreI've spent all day on benzos to numb the pain. My supervisor who made me trust her made things worse. My boyfriend is my only support and right now I'm plastered and he doesn't understand how badly I feel. Family is not supportive. I don't think I can kill myself but I've Drank a lot and taken a bit of benzos (like 6 1 mg kpin over a 16 hour span).  Life has become more and more worthless since 11 and I'm about to turn 24. I have maybe one or 2 friends and my boyfriend who I feel a burden on. Work absolutely sucks. I spend my very few days off sleeping. My apartment is a mess and my overpowering and judgmental mother is visiting ins few days. I haven't seen a purpose in living since 17. Plus I've been a drug addict secretly for 2 years and dealing with bipolar which my family is in denial about. I feel no purpose. I'm not going to do it tonight but I sure as hell am tempted in the future
