Ive given up.I don't know what to say. I'm done. I'm done with this world. I'm done with fighting. Nobody wants me to fight. I don't even know why I'm saying this. Nobody cares. People might say they do. But in the end if I kill myself will it effect you. No. It might effect some but in the end it doesn't matter.  Like I said in the title. I've given up. I've completely given up. I have people who care about me but I can't talk. My mind is always screaming. My throat is torn from screaming but my mouth hasn't opened. I'm exhausted. Getting out of bed in the morning hurts. Living everyday hurts. It's a strain to move. It hurts to smile. I just can't do it. I'm 16 years old. I am a softmore in high school. I have a nice car. Tonight before work I am going to run into a concrete wall holding up a bridge at 100 miles an hour. I just can't do this anymore. The people on this site are amazing. You all say you care so much and I think that this has been a way of relief for many. But I just can't. I can't get help at this point. I'm in too deep. I'm so sorry.
