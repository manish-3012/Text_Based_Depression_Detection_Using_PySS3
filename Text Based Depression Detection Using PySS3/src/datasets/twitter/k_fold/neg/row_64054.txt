I can't remember the last time I was intrinsically happy.Right now I'm incredibly burnt out, I don't want to talk to anyone and I especially don't want anyone to talk me. I have no motivation to do any of my goals that I have been trying to achieve for years. I will occasionally write down a riff or some lyrics, as I want to make music, but I have still never made a full song. I get halfway done, hit a roadblock, and realize that I am no longer proud of my work. And when I think about it, I'm not proud of anything that I have done. When I feel like this the familiar and melancholy suicidal thoughts plant themselves and all I can think is "I'll never feel any different so what's the point if I'm just going to keep disappointing myself?" it's gotten to the point where I can envision my dying by any other means except by my own hand. If I don't kill myself, I'll never die. I wish that was meant any other way, but unfortunately that's how I see my life. And I really think that one of these days I'm just going to do it on Impulse. I'll be fully well aware it's impulsive, but at least then I'll end it before any second guesses hold me back.
