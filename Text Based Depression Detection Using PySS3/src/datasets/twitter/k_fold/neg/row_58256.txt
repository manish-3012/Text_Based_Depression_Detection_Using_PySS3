My mom said that I talk like my life is overMy mom was putting me down with the excuse that she is trying to help.  I gave up on being ok. I told her honestly how I felt and she said I sound like an old person who is done with life instead of someone who has a whole life ahead. I guess she is choosing to pretend I'm not suicidal from the way she treats me.  She  might not have any idea that I'm closer to death than she is at 65. I can't shake the feeling of wanting it to be over. I guess  will kill myself soon
