"Insert Title Here"To whom it may concern,

I am a 27 year old male currently living at home with his parents. I have no money, no job, no girlfriend, no friends, no pets, and no social life. I used to be funny too...but not anymore.


Alkaline Trio sums it up nicely: 

"There are things that used to make me laugh
But now they're deeply buried in the past
I left them there so far away
Replaced my humor with my pain
I'll be happy on the day it dies"
