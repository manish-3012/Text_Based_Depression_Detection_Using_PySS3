back in the pitRock bottom has become too familiar. Going through the SuicideWatch page and reading all the posts from teenagers reminds me of when I was that age. I was so empty and really, already dead inside for most of my teen years. The whole neglect from parents, constantly being told I'm the reason for our family problems, never being able to connect with people because I moved every few years. Nothing was ever solid or permanent. I stopped caring about everything. The only reason I stayed alive was for my brother. He didnt deserve to deal with me committing suicide. Everyone else would be okay after a while. I was like an empty carcass walking around, I didn't even try to pretend that I was okay because thats how little I cared. I was ready to die whenever, I just couldn't do it myself. I finally had three unsuccessful attempts, the thought of my brother saving me every time. Life would get better at times, but right when I would get used to things being good, something bad would happen again. Now it seems like i'm a magnet for bed news. Despite the multiple losses, break up, and trauma I experienced in the last year, I forced myself to remain positive and hopeful for the future. Until now. I'm just done again, an empty carcass. Like tumbleweed with legs, I can almost feel the wind blowing through me. I want to die so bad, or go into a coma, just turn my brain off for a little while. Even the thought of moving and starting over doesn't motivate me. I just wanna drive to California or somewhere warm and happy and see if anything changes. I just want to be happy. So so bad. But I think I've given up. I hate how well I know rock bottom. Its more familiar than "normal" life. I'm not going to commit suicide, because every time I try, the thought of my brother stops me. I'm just t i r e d. And I'm ready to be done.
