Droopy eyelid ruins my face, tired of cosmetic surgery getting delayed. Donâ€™t see a reason to live being unattractive.Eyelids droopy, I wait patiently but everything keeps getting delayed and Iâ€™m tired of it. I donâ€™t want to live being unattractive. Iâ€™ll never get a girl friend or have a successful job interview. I put the effort in and wore nice clothing and got a haircut, still ignored. I want to minimise the pain for me, thought pills but remembered the cramps and embarrassment of sitting in the ward with a iv drip. Just donâ€™t know a good way to do it.
