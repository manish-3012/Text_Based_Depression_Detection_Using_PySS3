Virus is getting me to think about ending my life...first time I've had these thoughts in 8 yearsI'm really scared and I just can't concentrate or get anything done.

In my apartment by myself and the four walls are closing in, and I'm afraid to leave the house because I might catch the virus.

Was thinking of quitting my job so I could head back to my folks and just let myself get evicted from my apartment, so much awful stuff going on in my head right now.

I hate this, I really really hate this. Have no idea how I'm gonna cope.
