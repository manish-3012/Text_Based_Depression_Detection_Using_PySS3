Just need to talk. Would appreciate anyones consolation or anything.I feel like a failure man. Even writing this out admitting this i feel like a failure. I've dealt with social anxiety, depression and body dysmorphia for so long i dont even know who i am anymore. Watching my friends surpass me in every way while i do nothing for months on end but disappoint my family. I watch my parents get older and just think im wasting my time with them. I want them to be proud of me. I just can't do this anymore. I've tried. I've tried putting myself out there. I've tried exercising more, drinking more water, eating better. Nothing. I feel like shit day by day. I smoke weed almost every day to numb the pain but it's just temporary happiness.

I just want to die, but i don't as well. So sorry for posting here if i dont fit the bill - im just in a puddle of tears and needed to write this out somewhere. I don't tell my parents anything because i dont want them to worry about me. I've put them through enough stress over the years i'd rather they think im a failure than put them through more pain dealing with my mental health. Although i accidentally blurted out 'i might just kill myself' in front of my mother when crying recently and she told me if i killed myself she'd do the same. I have 2 younger sisters. I feel trapped. Literally everything is torture. Why the fuck am i here man. What is the point of all this pain and suffering. I don't know what to do. I'm 21, almost 22, and i've never even kissed a girl. Never had any form of relationship with a girl. I watch my friends get jobs, girlfriends, careers. While i had to drop out of high school before my social anxiety got too much. I've done nothing with my life. My parents have watched me do nothing but disappoint them for 22 years now. My mum thinks i'll never have kids, at least not when she's alive.

I don't know what to do. Occasionally i feel better but it's only temporary until i fall into overthinking and regret over my life. Thinking about all the friends, opportunities and goals i've lost because of my mental health. Thinking about how many relatives look at me like an alien at events. How many people don't even ask what im doing anymore, because they know it's nothing.

So that's it. I doubt i'll kill myself anytime soon, at least unless (god forbid) something drastic happens to my parents. I just couldnt live, i guess... with how people close to me would react to my death. My   
2 younger sisters, mother, father. Thinking about it makes me tear up. So i guess i'll keep withering away in my bedroom until i either hit breaking point or die alone at old age living off welfare checks.

Thanks for letting me rant.
