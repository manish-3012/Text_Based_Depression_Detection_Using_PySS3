Turn of events and state gun lawsHello,

Recently, I have discovered that my mother, without my consent, called the president of the university at my masters program I recently was kicked out of. Now that she has done that, I seem even more unprofessional than before, so I believe there is basically no hope of my repeal going through. I am so angry and disappointed. Once again my family does something to ruin things for me. I explicitly told her to stay out of it. She knew she was doing something wrong because she refused to tell me. I had to find out from somebody else. 

Last night, I looked up gun laws in this state. I do not need a gun license to buy a gun. It just takes like 3 days for my background check to go through. The cheapest one I can buy is like $170 so it's kind of an expensive ordeal. Also, even though I have written a note before, I will need to take some time and really develop the final draft. I will also probably donate a whole bunch of stuff before I do it. After my brother died (suddenly, unexpectedly in his sleep) we had all of his stuff to deal with and we still do even though t was 2 years ago. I think our posessions really drags the grieving out and I don't want my parents to be sad for such a long time again. Some of my stuff is super nice though so I may actually just give it to some other people that I know. Ugh who knew doing this would take so much preperation?
