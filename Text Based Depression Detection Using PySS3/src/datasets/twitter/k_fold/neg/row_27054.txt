Heâ€™s driving me to lose everythingIâ€™m being mentally and verbally abused almost everyday by my (newly) ex-husband. 

Iâ€™ve called the police, filed reports, sought help from detectives ...nobody can help me or make him stop.  He harasses me from different emails, phone numbers, etc that the police say they canâ€™t prove itâ€™s him.

I could hire a forensic tech but that is so expensive. The police detectives tell me â€œthere are a lot of other cases ahead of you that we need to get to firstâ€ 

I donâ€™t call them anymore because I just feel like a nuisance. 

I have completely isolated myself unintentionally since the divorce....absolutely no friends. I have a sister, but Iâ€™m sick of being the â€œdown and out emotionally fuckedâ€ sister

Iâ€™m ashamed of myself and the life I have created 

My dream was to be a mom. I had a baby over a year ago. He wonâ€™t just let me be a mom. He wonâ€™t just let me be okay. I would be alright if I didnâ€™t have someone constantly trying to destroy me. 

I just need silence from him. I need help. I want to go stay in a facility and get some serious help but I know he will go after me for custody.

Iâ€™m trapped.

I fantasize about buying a gun and ending it all. All the torture, shame and pain would be gone 

But my daughter and sister would feel a pain Iâ€™d never want for them 

I feel paralyzed and I want to fucking die
