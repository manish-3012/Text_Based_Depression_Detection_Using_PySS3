Sabotaging myself.Jesus Christ, what the fuck is wrong with me? I'm supposed to take a new treatment for my depression and anxiety and I keep going to therapy saying I'm taking it, but I haven't taken a single pill from it for a month.

I'm just so fucking stupid. I can't believe it. I'm sabotaging myself and realising it and *am still doing it.* I hate myself.

Been wanting to end it all at the end of June for a while now. I guess it's coming.
