Itâ€™s pointlessItâ€™s pointless if the relationship is one sided. I know it seems something dumb but still. Together for 3years with a kid. She isnâ€™t the same girl I fell in love with back in high school (M22/F21). Sheâ€™s changed from a loving kind hearted girlfriend to a cold and distant one. I donâ€™t know what else to do aside from ending it really. She doesnâ€™t even care if I want to spend time with her or anything . I canâ€™t go through with shared custody or anything. I wouldnâ€™t have the will in me to do so or the will to end my life. I just donâ€™t want to live in a place or world like that.
