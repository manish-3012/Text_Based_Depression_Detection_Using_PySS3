Please listenI just want to vent please, thanks for caring enough to read this. Things started getting worse 2 months back and I think I've tried to kill myself 3 times now, all 3 times going up to the 11th floor of a building where it's easy to jump off. I don't know why I never went through with it, but things are really bad now. 

My exams are on right now and I know I'll fail the shit outta all of them. I just zone out and imagine myself dying all the time, it's pretty much all that I think about now. I have only told 1 person about this, a close friend of mine (crush too perhaps) and she's been my rock for the past 2 months. She picked up on the fact that I was going to kill myself last Friday and told everything to my parents, who pretty much staged an intervention and talked me out of it, even though I downplayed all of it. 

There's been distance between her and I past couple weeks due to other circumstances, and it sucks because she was my rock and someone I really depended on. And I know she wants to help but I'm just insecure that she might be getting tired of me and also worried because of her anxiety issues.

Now with her seldom presence and my shit getting really worse I think this 4th time will be the final one, I just can't take it anymore, every second that I don't spend fantasising about my death is just shit. Part of me doesn't want to do this because of the effect it'll have on her and my parents (who do not get it at all), but I guess I won't have to stick around to watch that.

Thanks if you made it this far, it means a lot.
