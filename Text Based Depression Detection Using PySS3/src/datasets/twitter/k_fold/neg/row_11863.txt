I really donâ€™t feel like I deserve to be here anymoreIâ€™m sitting in my apartment and it looks like Iâ€™m a hoarder. Itâ€™s a mess but I got some reason wonâ€™t clean it. I just take up space and I have C-PTSD which makes it really hard to just function as a human and have a job. I just graduated but Iâ€™m terrified of finding a job I hate my major I did everything wrong. Iâ€™m sorry
