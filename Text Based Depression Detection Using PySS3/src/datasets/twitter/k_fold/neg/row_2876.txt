Being on lockdown is highlighting everything that is wrong in my life.I was able to ignore it before by going through a routine of going to work, cooking dinner, taking care of the dogs, AA meetings, and then whatever distraction my phone provided. But now work has figured out how little I have to do working from home and I wonder if they won't cut my hours or something. It's a very dull job I'm overqualified for. 

I have a couple of friends, but I haven't dated in two to three years and I think my chance at having a family of my own has passed me by. 

There are other, much deeper issues. 

I'm terrified the virus is going to take away everyone I love and leave me alive to suffer through it. I can't stop looking at the news. 

I think it would destroy my family if I ended it but it's so tempting right now, right before things really go to hell.
