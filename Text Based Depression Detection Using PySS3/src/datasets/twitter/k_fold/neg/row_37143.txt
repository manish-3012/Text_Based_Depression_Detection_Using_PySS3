limiting my suicides impactmy biggest dilemma when it comes to killing myself is that my only friend has told me many times that if i killed myself he would to. but i think ive found a solution, if i can pull it off. but i don't know if it will work.
first, i'm waiting. they go to school in a different state. because of the workload and his social life, if i don't text him or call him, he forgets about me and doesn't talk to me. even if i do try to contact him he doesn't respond most times. so i'll wait, i'll cut myself out if his life and let him forget. it'll be like we've drifted apart, not too uncommon for friends. and then i'll do it.
secondly, as precaution, i've written a note with some instructions for my family. in that note i have told them not to tell any friends or old classmates about this incident. i told them no obituary, no social media posts, keep it in the family. of course there is no guarantee that they'll listen, but considering my mother always wanted me to keep my mental health issues a secret anyways, i think it'll work out.
i don't know the news policies in my area towards reporting suicides, but i'm hoping that they need family permission to publish anything. at the very least i think as long as it's not in a public place, they wont bother reporting about it.
i wont post the whole of the note, but there are other requests in it as well, about the funeral and such.
hopefully i'll be gone in less then a year. finally
