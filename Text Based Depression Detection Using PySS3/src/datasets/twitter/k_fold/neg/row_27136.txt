"Suicide is transfering your suffering to someone else"I saw a Buddhist nun saying this (she tried to kill herself before she was a nun) in a talk and that idea is literally what made me stop wanting to kill myself. 

I know people around me couldn't care less about my existence now, but I know that when I'm gone my parents and my siblings will be devastated, asking themselves why they didn't realized, what if they did something to help me and all the "what if"s that comes after someone you care dies.

When we are suicidal people say we are selfish, but even though I disagree, I now know that we will literally transfer all this agonizing pain we are suffering from depression, to other people. It will hurt them in ways you don't even imagine.

What are the reasons you are feeling suicidal?
What is keeping you to live the life you truly want? What is keeping you to follow your dreams?
