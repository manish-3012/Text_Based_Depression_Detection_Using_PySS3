I feel like I'm floatingI don't know what I'm doing anymore. With the pandemic and everything that has happened because of it, I feel so lost. I don't want to do anything at all, ever. I go to therapy and it makes me feel better but one tiny thing will happen and I will go right back to this feeling. I feel like I want to die simply because I'm too lazy. I don't want to have to keep getting up every day. I don't want to have to keep doing school work. I don't want to go to work. I don't want to have to eat or even brush my hair. I don't want to exist. 

I feel so shitty about it. I know my boyfriend loves me. I know my friends would be sad. I just feel like they would be better off without the burden that is dealing with me. I am never going to amount to anything and it's because I don't want to. I don't want to exist anymore. I get so angry at my mother for deciding to not get an abortion. I wish I had never lived any of my life. I have been depressed since I was very young due to being molested as a child. I have been suicidal since I was ten. I haven't been able to tell anyone that I'm suicidal in recent years. Not even my therapist. I told some people a few years ago but nothing ever came of it. I'm scared to tell my therapist now because I'm scared she will put me in the hospital or something. 

I don't know when I want to die. I just keep hoping that it happens. I don't want to keep waking up every day. I really hate everything that is happening in the world and I don't want to be in it anymore. I'm tired of being tired.
