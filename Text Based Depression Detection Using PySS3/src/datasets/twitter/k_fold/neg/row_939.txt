I just wrote a suicide noteI don't really know why, I have been feeling ok for the past 2-3 weeks, and my mood has just gone to shit these past few days and I've been feeling pretty suicidal again this evening, and so I wrote a note for the first time. I've been on medication for almost 4 weeks now, and I thought that it was helping, but apparently not anymore.
