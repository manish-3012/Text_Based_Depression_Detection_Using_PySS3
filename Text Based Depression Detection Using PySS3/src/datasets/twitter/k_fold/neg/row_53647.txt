I'm just tired.. Of All Of ItI don't know what to do or say anymore... Nobody does. My life is going nowhere and it's never going to go anywhere. I'm crippled with a back injury that barely allows me to walk or do chores for more than 15 minutes. I cannot afford to have it looked at, I can't get on disability without having it looked at, and I cannot get a desk job to hire me. 

My fiancÃ© is all I have left and I just cause him extra stress... I can't help in any way. I spend everyday feeling like a worthless fuck up while looking at a bottle of pills. My fiancÃ© makes it better sometimes, but then we fight and I just realize how much of a burden I am. If he ever gets tired of me I'll be homeless, I have nowhere else to go. I only have my fiancÃ© and my dog..

My brain torments me everyday. Im scared that if I goto a therapist I'll be institutionalized which will just destroy me. I just want the pain to stop, I want my brain to stop yelling at me! I want to be myself again or I want to be dead and so far... I don't think I'll ever be me again.
