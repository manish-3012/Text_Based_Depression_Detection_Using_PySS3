In then endI think some of us just can't hack it. Not that that's anything against people like us. Well not directly, anyway. It's just that we aren't built the same. It's like we're missing parts, or rather our parts just don't work the way that they should. And yeah you could just say "chemical imbalance" and all that, but what about beyond that? It's like there's something else, something that pulls us toward this self-destructive behavior regardless of how well the treatment is going or how awesome our support network is. Like we'll always seek our own demise and we're just so good at finding. Well I guess I accept that. I may never choose suicide but I know my life won't be worth remembering, and that I may never have a legacy, that when my time comes I most likely won't be surrounded by loved ones. And when I'm dead and gone, people won't look back with happiness, they'll just forget and move on.
