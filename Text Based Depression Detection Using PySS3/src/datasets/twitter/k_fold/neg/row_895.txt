ive got nothing leftpast few years have been rough,had my dad ,uncle and grandad die then my fiance deported not long after
my depression all the while getting worse,
just absolutely miserable.
end up in a long distance relationship with fiance and was sopposed to get married in 1 month.
today she tells me she cheated on me last night and shes not ready for marriage,and that its over between us 3 days before she arrives in my country. i was sopposed to move countries to be with her.
ive worked years to finally get married and move countries,but its over now

i always said if this fucks up im going to kill myself,i feel as ive got no other option no future,im stuck and my head wont stop the urge to just end it all

ive got nobody 
ive made up my mind
i gave all i could give and ive got no more.
