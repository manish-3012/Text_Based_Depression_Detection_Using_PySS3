Gender DysphoriaI've posted here before to celebrate attempts that failed or plans that never materialised. Today I need the kind of help this sub was made for. 

I'm a trans woman and I feel I've had enough of living the life transgender. I can no longer delude myself into thinking that I can plaster over the cracks of my transness with this or that compensatory measure. Maybe the transphobes are right and I'm not really who and what I say I am. Maybe I'm just a not!Woman in a dress. (Congrats, TERF friends, you scored one!)

The circumstances of my personal life prevent me from transitioning much beyond continuing to take my hormones. I don't really have a social circle because I have managed to repulse the overwhelming majority of them away by my satanic philosophy of respecting people's understanding of their own gender.

I'm posting here in the hopes that someone can talk me out of my plans for tonight. I kind of don't want to *die* die, it's just that I don't think I deserve to live and I'm tired of my isolated and unintentionally controversial life.
