I am going to kill myself tonight. FinallyIt's been 18 years since my college gf dumped me out of the blue. Blindsided me completely. Every day I live in fear that I'll run into her and she'll see how much of a loser I've become and I'll see how great she is. I never found anyone before or since her. It was cosmic our short time together but it meant everything to me.

I lost my virginity to her and never have had sex since then. I'm such a loser and can no longer live with myself. I would turn 40 in a few days and can't stop obsessing about something which happened when I was 21. Why? This isn't normal. I should be over it.

I bought a shotgun this morning and tonight I'm going to go out and get my favorite food. Then come home to write my note and then blow my brains out. I can't live with this any longer.

Goodbye. Sorry to vent like this.
