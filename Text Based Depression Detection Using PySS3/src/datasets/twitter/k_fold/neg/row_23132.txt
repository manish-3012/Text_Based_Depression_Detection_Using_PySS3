My Friend DeathEver since I was young I feel like Iâ€™ve had a strange connection with death. My cat would mutilate and kill small animals and leave them in the yard. I would find them and would just look at it, I didnâ€™t really feel anything about it, and the more they would decay the more I wanted to watch it.
 
When I was in middle school my cat died, he was killed by a coyote. Heâ€™s death was the first I felt remorse for. I missed him. 
Then my grandma passed away as well, I didnâ€™t feel much until the day of the funeral. She was kind to me and we would often read together. 
Then we had to put down the family dog, it was horrible because I cared for her a lot. She grew up with me. 
Next was our old family cat, she died peacefully at home of old age. I was sad but happy too that she could pass on peacefully. 
Soon I got sick, an infection in my spine. If you think it sounds bad itâ€™s because it was. I didnâ€™t talk about it but I knew that I could die. That if something went wrong I could pass away in the hospital. I was 17 and I was already coming to terms with the fact that I might die. 
I recovered, but I wish I hadnâ€™t, we got a new cat and he died. Killed by a coyote or possibly a fisher, he was my emotional support and he just died. 
Next our new dog stella, got bone cancer, she suffered for months until we decided we had to put her down. I hated seeing her in so much pain, I could do nothing for her. I felt helpless.
Iâ€™m 21, and I still have people in my life I love but I often wish I would have died in that hospital. I wish that I closed my eyes and never opened them again. Iâ€™m not afraid of dying, Iâ€™m only afraid of the pain my death will cause. I have a feeling Iâ€™ll be seeing only more death ahead of me. This is how life is, whether I hate it or love it. Everyone I know and love will die one day. I just feel tired. I feel numb. I wish I died when I was 17.
