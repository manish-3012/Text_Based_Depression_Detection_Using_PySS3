My Mother Would be Happier if I was deadCollege senior. Female. Diagnosed with depression a few years back. Even if I became the most successful person on Earth, my mother wouldn't be happy with me. Whenever we are alone my mother takes the opportunity to gaslight me until I cry. She says me and my meds and therapy are too expensive and then gets mad at me for working my job so much. I come home to visit and she's mad at me for not coming sooner, so I leave her alone, and then she gets mad at me for leaving her alone. The one summer I stayed back at home I got so depressed that I became openly suicidal and my mother only cared that I didn't tell anyone in our family so she could keep up appearances. I wasn't taken to a doctor until several months had passed. When she asked why I feel she's always mad at me, I name off times she's emotionally scarred me and instead of acknowledging that she hurt me, she defends her actions as if she still thinks they were appropriate. I don't have a rope yet, but I've begun considering to hang myself. I know where I would do it. I just often think I would be happier myself if I was dead and didn't have to hurt anymore.
