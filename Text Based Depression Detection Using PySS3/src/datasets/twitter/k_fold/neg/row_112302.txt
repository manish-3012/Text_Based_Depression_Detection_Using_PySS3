Gonna kill myself sometime this week.im 20 years old, and ive decided im going to kill myself. believe me when i say im a horrible person and i truly deserve to die. you wouldnt know it if you met me, because i want people to like me so i act as nice as i can, but deep down im shit and twisted and bitter. i have prejudice and hatred in my heart that i just cant live with. im selfish and judgemental and i honestly dont think i feel empathy. i really am an irredeemable person. sometimes i want to blame my mental illness, but do i even have mental illness? i don't think so i think im just a bad person. i believe i really do deserve to die. i have nothing going for me. im constantly alone, ive never achieved anuthing. i sit around and do nothing all day. the lonliness is so crippling and i just wish i had one person in my life i felt like i had a real connection too, but i don't. im estranged from my family and what used to be my friends. i have no talents, no job, nothing. ive never even achieved anything. this combined with all the awful things about my personality make it pretty clear that im just a waste of space. killing myself is the only meaningful decision i'll ever make.
