A week ago, I posted here and got talked out of suicide. I'm having a horrible day. I don't want to feel like this anymore.I don't know if it's worth it if I'm just going to keep ending up feeling like this. I'm a fucking hideous unfuckable unloveable virgin waste of space. I have no social life, never had a girlfriend. 

I want to die today. Maybe I won't tomorrow or even the next few hours, but what is the fucking point if it all comes back to this? What's the fucking point?
