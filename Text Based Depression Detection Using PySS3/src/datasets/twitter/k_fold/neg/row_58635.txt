Preventing myself from committing suicideIt's getting increasingly difficult to prevent myself from committing suicide. I'm having trouble convincing my brain to hold on for a bit longer.

I'm going to therapy and taking medication. I believe it has helped me, but obviously not enough to get me through. I haven't seen my therapist in a while (for personal reasons on both sides) and that may be what caused this episode, although it feels more like a permanent state than an episode but that's just my mind playing tricks on me, I hope.

Any advice? Especially because I have duties regarding university I can't possibly do with this level of energy. I feel like I can barely move, let alone write a paper or do a presentation. Pretty sure my professors won't understand but I'm too scared to contact them either ways.
