Last resort. Please help. I dont know what to do or where to go.I am completely lost, completely alone, and I have nobody that can help me. I have spent 10 years working on a goal, and I am already there but I ran out of fuel. I built a company, lost my wife because of it, got a few clients and invested everything I had to build something they want. I am there already and got contracts. But they cant pay right now and I have nobody to help me anymore. I cant bear the shame of being one week away from making my 10 year suffering come true into a company that will be successful if I can just get through 2 weeks.

I cant pay my electric next Monday and I cant pay natural gas for heat. I donâ€™t have credit as I spent it all on my company and living expenses. I risked it all and it paid off, in a month I will have enough to pay. But what if my clients delay payments a few more weeks? Where can I get a few hundred dollars to eat and pay for heat and light?

I can show what I have but I canâ€™t bear not making it next week. I bet it all on making a life for myself and my family and failing when I got so close. My last resort is an internet believer in me when you hear my story and what Iâ€™ve built. Please help.
