Too afraid of the pain.Don't know if I should post this in CA, Anxiety, or Suicide Watch and no idea where to begin.

Lets start with the obligatory "long time lurker" status. I'm writing this because i want to die, simple as that. I am just too chicken shit scared to die that I won't ever pull a trigger. Took medication, spent a year off it recently, and I still hate myself and I realize that I literally suck at everything I do. 

You all have that one friend who doesn't really fit in and literally can't do anything right. Yeah, that's me. I want to say goodbye to everyone and everything and I am too scared of the "pain" I'll feel temporarily that i won't even do it. I'm ready to say goodbye to my anxiety disorder, this horrible life I'm living as a waste of space, and Im ready to apologize to everyone who I met this past year. Sorry that I was the buzzkill who cried at parties because she gained weight all of a sudden and was abused by her parents as a kid. Sorry that I got so drunk on a daily basis. Sorry that I just suck.
