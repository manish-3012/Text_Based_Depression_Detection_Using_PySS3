My teacher always Lies to my parents.Itâ€™s parent teacher conference time at my school and my teacher decided to lie about how I act in class. She said I talk too much (I donâ€™t talk, I have no friends. So I refuse to talk which is the complete opposite), she says I give almost no effort, and that I constantly miss deadlines. She says Iâ€™m not giving my best when I truly am. I have a B in the class which is pretty good considering I was out sick for 2 1/2 weeks with Mono and strep throat at the same time and she gave us a project that was due the day after I got back  with no extension. The projects was worked on for 2 1/2 weeks during class which I wasnâ€™t even there for!

Whenever I give my best, everyone says itâ€™s not my best and calls me a disappointment and a stupid bitch. 

Then they wonder why you want to kill yourself even though everyday you get called stupid, dumb, a disappointment, and a slut even though you arenâ€™t one.

Then she says she cares about me, then she tells my parents Iâ€™m a terrible student because I have a B.

Just let me die already, stop acting like you care when you couldnâ€™t care less.
