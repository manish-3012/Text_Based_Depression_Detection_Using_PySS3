Sitting in this ledge before I jump onto the freewayIâ€™m just sitting on this ledge feeling sorry for myself for missing out opportunities because my anxiety and depression have taken its toll on my life. Bullied relentlessly through high school, youâ€™d think bullies would get their ultimate karma, no, theyâ€™re having the time of their lives with girls and holidays while Iâ€™m struggling to cope for myself, to find a job, to find love, to be satisfied with life. Everyone my age have seen the world, go out to mingle with people. I donâ€™t. I sit and loathe at home thinking how unfair this world is and that once I die than it is the end so whatâ€™s the point living a joyous life anyone dreams of when itâ€™ll be nothingness when we die. But I want to achieve those things at the same time. I just hate myself in general, people around me. I fucking hate this planet, money, race, me being ugly. This whole â€œhustleâ€ mindset. Looks I get from people. STUCK IN THIS FUCKING BODY TILL THE DAY I DAY YOU GET IT NOW! IM STUCK.IM DEAD. IM FUCKING GONE.THIS WORLD IS SO FUCKING POINTLESS SO FUCKING USELESS ALL GOOD IT DOES IS FUCK ME UP I HAVE NO WHERE TO GO I FEAR MY PARENTS I FEAE MY FRIENDS FOR BEING FAKE I FEAR THIS WORLD IS NOTHING BUT AN ILLUSION TO FUCK UP SELECTED PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF TO KILL THEMSELVES. IM SICK OF SEEING FAKE HAPPINESS, TRYING TO FIT IN, TRYING TO BE SOMEONE


Iâ€™m done. I really am
