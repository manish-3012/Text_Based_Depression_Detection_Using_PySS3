My 16 year old sister had a mental breakdown earlier, need advice, please! [x-post Askreddit]Not sure if I posted this the right place before, so I'll seek for help here as well. 

tl;dr: Basically, my 16 year old sister just had a breakdown stating she wants nothing to do with my family, and is refusing help. We're afraid she's going to hurt herself, and don't know what actions to take to help her, and us.

**Background**: my sister has always had a hard time socially, however, more so lately since my parents are going through a divorce. She's taking it really hard, being the only sibling to see this (I'm off at college in a different state). She is constantly on the computer (not a bad thing), but doesn't interact/socalize and take anything else seriously. She also, recently, has come out to my mom and I that she is confused about her gender, but that's a completely different story. She is not in any form of relationship, other than having friends.

My whole family has suggested/made appt's with various counseling, however always says that "we're wasting money" and she'll just not say anything to them. I understand that one cannot be helped if they don't want help.

**Current**: But in this circumstance, she just had a terrible breakdown saying she wants to be disowned from this family, but doesn't have the skills/money to live on her own. My mom, who is already stressed from the divorce isn't taking this very well, with my sister grade's slipping and not taking life, essentially, seriously, and doesn't know what to do in this situation. She's offered to send &amp; pay for her to attend boarding schools, suggested foster homes, etc. because my sister really doesn't like anybody in the family anymore, I guess. My mom was debating whether or not to have her admitted to a psych ward.

I'm not really sure what to do right now. My mom is keeping her home tomorrow from school, because we fear for her mental sanity at this time, and don't want her to do anything harmful.

What I'm basically asking for is, has anyone had a similar experience? How to handle an adolescent that is refusing any form of help.
