Everytime there's a weather alert about an incoming snow storm I want to dieIk my title doesn't make very much sense, I'll try to explain it here. I've researched a lot of possible ways to commit suicide and make it look like an accident. One of the best methods I've come across is to wait for some significant amount of snow to fall, get into a car and back the car into a pile of snow so that the exhaust is completely covered. Then I just leave the car idling with the heat on to pull in the carbon monoxide. I've heard stories of tons of people dying acidently like this.

Apparently there's gonna be around 10cm of snow tomorrow. I don't want to waste this opportunity and I just want to get it over with. It's the 2nd major snowfall this winter and I wasn't able to do it for the first one because I didn't have access to my moms car. 

Wish me luck guys.
