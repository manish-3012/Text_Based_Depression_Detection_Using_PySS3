How do you stand your ground,When everyone wants to bury you beneath it?

I wish I was happy, the only time I've been truly happy in life is before my first attempt. Seriously it felt great. I went to the movies by myself, went traveling solo, really enjoyed life. Then after my failed attempt obviously which left me in the hospital for a week I started over. Got a job, moved across the country and things have only got worse.

Fast forward a few years, now I have depression, PTSD, heart problems, and will probably be a homeless vet early next year. 

Why should I continue on given my 20 year bout with depression.

I'm soon to be divorced because my wife cheated on me and got pregnant, I have mental health issues, health problems, and broke. 

There is no upside to this.
