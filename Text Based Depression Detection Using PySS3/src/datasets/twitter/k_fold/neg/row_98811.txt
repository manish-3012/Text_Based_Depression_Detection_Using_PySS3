Not for me, but the love of my life is scarily depressed right now, and this is an accurate username.I know, it's not me, but I'm really frightened and I feel awful. Here's what's going on.

I've been in a relationship for a little over six months with a woman from work who I had a serious crush on for about six months before that. When she's herself, she's wonderful. She's uproariously funny, kind, quick-witted, and amazing. And she loves me as much as I love her. I would like to marry her someday.

But she - like me, it should be noted - is a pretty serious depressive. I've been coping with it pretty well since the real onset about a decade ago (I'm almost 30, she's fresh out of college, yeah, I know), and I've never been anything close to suicidal, though I did have a spell of panic attacks a few years back that were pretty rotten.

She's been depressed since her early teens, and has tried to kill herself more than once. I don't know tons of the details about the attempts, but I believe her when she tells me.

Recently, she's really been struggling. We work at the same place, and although she's among the best in the office at what we do, she hates the place like poison and really, really wants to leave. I don't blame her - working conditions really aren't the best and management is kind of stupid and dishonest - and I've got no problem with that, despite the fact that one of the possible outcomes would be her moving home (4-5 hours away) and the possible end of our relationship. I'd be crushed, but at least she wouldn't be alone.

Sometimes she gets day-long spells of just being miserable lately. She's OK at work, but can't stop crying when she gets home. She just got off the phone with me - a call during which she said many times "I can't take it" - because she was going to start crying.

I don't believe she's going to kill herself. But I love her so much and the very idea makes me feel empty.

She seems so fragile, in these moods, though. I try to be kind and cheerful - while being careful to be respectful and not trying to solve her problems for her - but it doesn't seem to work. She usually just gets better on her own. She says I'm one of "the few bright spots" in her life right now.

What can I do? I'd do anything to help her, but I've been seriously depressed before and I know you don't just snap out of it. It takes hard work and time. Is there anything I can do to help? Or to stop myself from feeling this horrible when she gets like this?
