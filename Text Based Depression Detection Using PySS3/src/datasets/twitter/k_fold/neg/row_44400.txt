I can't see myself being alive this time next year.While I have no immediate plans to self harm, I can't see myself still being around in a years time nor do I want to be. I've gave myself the past year to get my mental state in check and its just gotten worse. I don't see much point in going on. And maybe this is a half hearted attempt at expressing myself since I dont want to go into detail, but its all I feel up to right now.
