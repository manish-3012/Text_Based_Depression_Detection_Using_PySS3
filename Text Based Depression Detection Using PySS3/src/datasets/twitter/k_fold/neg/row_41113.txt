The only reasonMy life was going so well but somehow i started feeling depressed, everything in my life was going fine but now its shit.. i dont know why... Depression has changed my life it makes me feel suicidal, because of it im failing my first year in high school. I stopped going to school and results are near my parents had a high hope on me but im shit, i just dont know what to tell them the only thing i can see in my eyes right now is to kill myself and end this
