I can'tI just can't handle life anymore. Call me a weakling I don't care. I can't live like this. I've internalized every shitty thing everyone has been saying to me since I was a kid. Friends, family, teachers, everyone. I hear it all in my head on repeat every fucking day and I can't take it. It's so loud and it won't stop. I just want to be at peace. I don't have any help or even an outlet of any kind. I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of having nightmares. I'm tired of the negative voices echoing in my head. I'm tired of pretending that I'm okay. I don't want to get high anymore and I don't want to self-harm. I feel like there's no way out. I fear one day I'll just fucking implode. Collapse in on myself because of the void building inside me. Kill me. I just want to fucking die.
