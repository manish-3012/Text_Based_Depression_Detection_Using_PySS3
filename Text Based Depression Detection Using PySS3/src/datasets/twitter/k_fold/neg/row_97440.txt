Why do we bother trying to stop people from committing suicide?Why is it illegal to commit suicide in the U.S.? If someone wants to end their excruciating suffering why does it bother complete strangers to the point that they want to keep that person alive? Don't they realize that by keeping someone who suffers that much alive longer it will only prolong their unnecessary suffering. I feel it's more about people's discomfort with someone wanting to die than their actual compassion for actually trying to help alleviate the person's suffering.
