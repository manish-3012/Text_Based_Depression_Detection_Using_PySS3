Friend is gone and I donâ€™t know how to continueIâ€™m 16, My old friend from Seattle has committed suicide recently, he was an all star soccer player and was incredibly funny. I moved away to DC when I was in 5th grade and I extremely regret not getting in touch with him more because I can no longer connect with by best childhood friend. I remember ever single day with him like it was a movie (Iâ€™m cursed with a photographic memory so all I see is his face) Iâ€™m having an extremely tough time coping with his death along side some other past trauma which is driving me to thoughts of how life would be if I had gone. Iâ€™ve never had these thoughts before and Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m developing a sort of depression. I canâ€™t tell if I subconsciously want pity from my peers or if my mind Is truest being driven to suicide. Someone help me understand what is happening to me please
