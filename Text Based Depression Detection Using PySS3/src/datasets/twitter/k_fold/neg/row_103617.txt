Really need to vent right nowSince 2 weeks ive started having thoughts about suicide again and im conflicted about myself i hope you understand

Im 19 and im in university right now. Before i joined highschool i already had a year where i had a depression and tried to kill myself (i guess my stupidity back then saved me) 

Im afraid of the depression and that it could be coming back... i dont know how to stop the feeling... at night its the worst 
I want the thought to go away but it doesnt and im making pressure because i cant be tired for university 

It feels like it started when we had to hand in exercices which were graded
We have to do a block of those in our first year and its possible to do them in all 4 areas of the swiss law and its the first one so actually it isnt so bad

And since my friends from highschool didnt join the uni with me i feel lonely
Ive found new friends here but it isnt the same 

I keep telling myself that the suicidal thoughts are dumb and it doesnt make any sense but i cant get rid of them i dont wanna go back to depression

I dont wanna speak with my family about it because theyre already under pressure and i dont want to strain them

Sometimes i feel like the only thing keeping me going is not wanting to hurt them
Im afraid of sobbing infront of them because that would alarm them or others 
It doesnt make any sense i always wanted to study law and its very interesting but since joining the uni its been going downhill
I know about suicide hotlines but i get up the courage to speak to them i just call and then hang up

At the same time it feels soothing to know that theres a way out... but i know that its wrong but i feel like pressuring me against the thoughts makes everything even worse
When i try to study i get into this downward spiral and the pressure makes everything worse... i try to keep it to myself but during the day its so hard to keep the emotions down so i keep feeling this pain in my stomach as if i was going to implode
I know that my brain is playing tricks on me but it feels so real i cant speak to anyone about this without breaking up into tears and making it obvious
This doesnt make any sense we dont have any financial issued, i like my studies but i havent been so sad for years
Theres this place next to the tracks in the woods
On the weekends theres a train even deep into the night so sometimes i just sit there to contemplate but im afraid of it hurting too much or not working and i dont wanna ruin the train drivers life just because im some depressive weird fuck 
Ive looked up on overdoses but we have very strict drug laws so i cant get any that would work apparently slashing the wrists takes too long 
It feels like my pressure to feel happy is making me sad 
Not having a valid reason to feel sad about makes the pressure even worse
I think im going to bed now
