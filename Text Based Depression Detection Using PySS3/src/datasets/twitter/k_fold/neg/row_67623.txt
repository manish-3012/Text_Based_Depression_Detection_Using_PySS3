I've had it.Simply put, online dating is so shallow and toxic. Sorry I'm not a 6'3 white male.  Meeting people in person, even friends, is impossible in my situation and can't be done. I'm finished. I'll probably end it by the end of the month. I can't even be assed to type everything, I'm just so tired.
