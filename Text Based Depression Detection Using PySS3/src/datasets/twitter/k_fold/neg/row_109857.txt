There's no one to talk to.I'm at this point in my life where I've fucked up everything I've ever worked hard for. I'm about to be kicked out of school because my bipolar/schizophrenic episodes have caused me to lose all self-motivation. My insecurities have caused me to lose self-confidence. And because my performance at school and in the things I do are where I put my self worth, I've lost all my self-worth. It's hard not to feel like absolute nothing. I've tried to call the suicide helpline but I can't bring myself to it. Partly because I live in a suite and the walls are very thin, mostly because I just don't know if I can bring myself to explain what it happening to me. I feel like I'm losing my mind and I'm just scared. I keep having panic attacks before sleeping because somehow my brain is convinced that I'm going to die in my sleep and, because all the people I love are not in the same country, I'm not going to be found for days. My friends are trying but I can't, or maybe I'm just unwilling to tell them, because saying it out loud makes it real. I don't know how I would do it but I just want to waste away into nothingness. I'm taking medication that doesn't do anything anymore and I'm just so done with living while I feel like I'm trapped in my body. Nothing besides the people I've had the fortune to call friends, is going well, but I feel like I'll end up resenting them for my guilt about leaving them behind if I do it, if I drag this life out longer than it needs to.
