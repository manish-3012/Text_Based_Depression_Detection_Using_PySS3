People will never see me as I see myselfOk, Iâ€™ll admit Iâ€™ve had a battle with gender related self hatred for my whole life. Iâ€™ve never gone to a doctor, my family are pastors and transphobic so Iâ€™ve never even been able to talk about it. Iâ€™m 21 Iâ€™m at the end of my wits here. Iâ€™m tired of people seeing me as a girl. Iâ€™m not one I never been one. I never felt like one. I know that no amount of treatment will make me what I am. Iâ€™ll just be a freak and a disappoint. I donâ€™t like having to tell people Iâ€™m a girl online so I donâ€™t be seen as 12. Iâ€™m tired of people treating me with disrespect. Iâ€™m tired of this shit. I donâ€™t have much options because I have to participate in life to be successful but no one will see me for me. Oh well huh
