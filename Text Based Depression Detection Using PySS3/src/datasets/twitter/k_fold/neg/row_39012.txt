Ambulance Bill for Suicidal Thoughts/Plan?I just want to know in case of emergency, I've reached out to hotlines quite a bit but struggling to get any further help. If I'm in crisis and call 911, would they send an ambulance if there is no injury at the time, or would I be transported to hospital in one even if not injured at the time? Would it be better to get a ride to the ER than to call 911 in that aspect? Because added stress of a possible huge bill while in crisis leaves me not wanting to reach out for help, want to be prepared and have an action plan if things get bad enough before I'm able to get more help than just the crisis line.
