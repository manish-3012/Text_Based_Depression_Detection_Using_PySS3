Have other people experienced suicidal longings so frequently that it affects their personality?I think so frequently about â€œchecking out earlyâ€ and donâ€™t tell any of my friends about it because it has been going on for years and Iâ€™ve been hospitalized five times for it already. I just end up feeling really alone, but Iâ€™m wondering if other people on here might understand.
