I don't think I can deal with this any longer.Sometimes, I just sob and sob because I know my life is over. I'll never be loved, I'll never be successful because I'm stupid and I'll never have an accepting family. 

I've tried and tried to self improve, but in reality it doesn't work for me. I accept responsibility for my misfortune, that's why I'll end it with my own hands. 

I'm sorry to anyone I was ever rude to, anybody I've upset. I'm sorry to my younger self for letting you down. I'm sorry to all my cousins and distant family I've ignored because of my anxiety and depression. I'm sorry to my boss and co-workers, I won't be able to make it to work tomorrow. 

To any of you below 20 years old, please don't make the same mistakes I've made. Study hard, without great marks or connections life is difficult. To those of us with narcissistic parents, try to make friends and try to save money to leave the house. To those of you who are feel lonely, try to self improve young, learn to socialize early, ignore your bullies and learn to love yourself. 

Thank you for your time, and good bye.
