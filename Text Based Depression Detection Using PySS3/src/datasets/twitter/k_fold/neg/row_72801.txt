What happened to meI have friends and people who love the hell out of me. Why do I feel like ending it all? Jesus. I have no reason to be sad, but yet I am. I posted a status earlier today about how lucky I wad to have the life I have. And now all I can think about is reasons why it should end. I think about how much stronger othets are than me for powering through so much more than I ever could. I thought maybe being a good persob would make me immune to these bad feelings. I was wrong. My phones battery is going to die. Maybe I just needed to type this out as a personal vent to nobody. I am so pathetic sometimes I swear.
