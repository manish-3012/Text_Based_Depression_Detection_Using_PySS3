it never really occurred to me that having intrusive thoughts of wanting to kill myself is not healthyI've had a good upbringing. Wealthy parents, a few friends that began from grade school and we still keep in contact during breaks. 

Never really suffered from any abuse. 

But, now that I've come to think about it, I've never been truly happy for over 6 years now. I'm 22. It's really difficult for me to motivate myself and once I do it lasts a very short while. 

I have a really hard time connecting with people, on an emotional level. I'm heavily introverted, I hate being alone but being around people is so exhausting. I've been single ever since puberty, never did anything with a girl. I'm not saying that all I need is a girlfriend to boost my confidence again, but not experiencing someone that cares for you for just even one week is depressing. I'm not even that ugly. I socialize easily at work (even if I'm faking it) and shit talk and joke around with other co workers. It seriously pisses me off when people just complain all about their ex's or constantly hoping to someone else like they never appreciate anything they have.

I have a passion for music production, but even when I finish a track I'm never truly satisfied as I was when I was eleven.

I'm afraid of going to a psychiatrist. I have no idea what he'll possibly diagnose me for or tell me I'm normal. I also don't want to rely on meds. 

life is just... dull. even when I travel to places its still, dull. however, I'm really good at faking my personalities to different kinds of people that no one realizes what I'm going through.
