Alcoholic Narcissist that's tired of hurting peopleI can't keep doing this. My girlfriend of four years deserves better. My friends deserve better. But I just can't change. 

I know I'm capable of a lot. I know that I'm better than a lot of people. And when I drink, I make sure other people know it too. And I drink a lot. I always have to do things in excess as well, including my drinking. Last night I left all my friends and my crying girlfriend because I felt they were wasting my time and my time is too important to waste. I left them and drank with other people. I punched a guy in the face and got thrown out of a bar. Why do I turn into this raging dick when I'm drunk? And why can't I admit that its a problem? Why can't I just be a normal person? 

I think my girlfriend wants me gone. I know she does because she said to make sure I take enough clothes to get through the work week when I leave. I think its over. Part of me is depressed as shit about it because I love her more than anything in the world. The other part, the asshole part, is happy because it means more time alone to hack at the projects I have on the go. Why can't I be a normal person who is adequately upset with the situation? Why do I have to focus more on the one upside than the numerous downsides?

As of right now, I have no girlfriend, I have no friends, I have no place to live, I don't have my cat anymore, I have ideas that could change industries but apparently no way to make them reality, I have no will to live. All I have is a knife.
