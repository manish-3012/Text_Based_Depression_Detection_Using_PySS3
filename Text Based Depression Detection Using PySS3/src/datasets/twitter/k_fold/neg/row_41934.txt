I want to jumpI'm embarrassed to be posting here again but I'd like to thank everyone for the support on my post a couple days ago but I need help again. I feel so unstable, everyone recognizes the fact that I'm unstable but no one cares enough to try and help. I've been thinking about suicide constantly for the last couple days, I haven't been able to sleep either. I hate being left alone with my brain, I truly believe its only goal is to destroy me and I fear that has become true. I'm so tired, I'm so alone, I think I'm going to jump this time.
