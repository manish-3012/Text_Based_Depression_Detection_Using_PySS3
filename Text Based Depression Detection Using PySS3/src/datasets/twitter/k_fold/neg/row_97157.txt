living to die, not dying to live!I've been depressed pretty much my whole life - since I was 12, and I'm a 28 y.o woman now and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna kill myself in the next year! I've tried once... this time I'm gonna go through with it.

I was bullied in school, pushed, shoved, spat on, called names.. bullied by both teachers and students. My homeroom teacher wouldn't let me in class because she hated me and that caused me to fail and I had to resit 8th grade. Then she threatened to leave the school if I didn't, causing the whole class to hate me for it .. a girl from my class had an entire speech in front of the class about how I should leave. an entire week after that incident I sat outside of the classroom, because my teacher refused to teach a class with me in it. When I went in, she stood there without saying a word.. and I left because I felt bad, everyone was staring at me. I dropped out after 10th grade because I couldn't handle school.

As a grownup I've never been able to hold a job, school bullying reflects heavily on my work relationships and personal relationships. Whenever I'm faced with a situation where someone tells me what to do, I automatically feel like they're bullying me or trying to get me to do something I'm not supposed to do. 

I've had numerous jobs, but I usually quit after 3-4 weeks.... I've given up on that now! 5 years ago I started designing and earning my living with that.. this year I lost that job because of the lack of clients. Now I'm living off my savings, my car keeps breaking down, I have constant problems with my girlfriend and family.. I just feel like I'm tired of life.

**PS! Life feels like an infinite loop. I wake up - do the same things I did yesterday, eat, watch tv, scroll through reddit - go to sleep and repeat the same cycle tomorrow!** 

I'm tired of life, I feel empty inside.. yes I've taken medication for depression, but it hasn't worked.. I want to be in peace, I want to die!
