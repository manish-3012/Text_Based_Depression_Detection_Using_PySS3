Completely helpless if my boyfriend leaves meMy boyfriend is a pinch away from breaking up with me. We had everything. Iâ€™ve tried everything to get him to reconsider, but itâ€™s not going in the right direction. I fear more than everything that heâ€™ll leave me. I would give anything to make him smile again but he wants nothing to do with me. I poured my heart and soul into him and heâ€™s still the love of my life. Without him I have nothing to live for. 
School starts again in less than a week, and Iâ€™m terrified of scaring him away further if I try to get him back. But Iâ€™m scared of losing him if I donâ€™t try. I have homework, family, anxiety and self doubt to juggle with all of this. It feels like my life is just crashing down. I wish I could go back in time and fix it. 
Iâ€™m thinking about killing myself if it doesnâ€™t work out. The pain of heartbreak is already immeasurable now, I canâ€™t imagine how horrible it will be afterwards. Iâ€™ll leave a note for him so he knows I loved him until the end. Iâ€™m worried, though. Ive tried to commit suicide twice before, both overdose, but I survived both. Iâ€™m too scared to drown or burn, too far from a highway to get run over. Iâ€™m too much of a baby to cut a vein or hang myself. My reflexes stopped me from suffocating myself, and I donâ€™t have a building high enough to jump off of. Iâ€™m going to try to get my gun license later this year, but even then Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll permanently mangle myself. Why isnâ€™t there an easy way out? Why do I have to keep living in this nightmare?
