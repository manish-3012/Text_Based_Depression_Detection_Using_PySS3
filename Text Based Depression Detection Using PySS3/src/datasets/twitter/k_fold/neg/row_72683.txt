sick of myselfAll 20 years of my life have taught me that I can't do anything without fucking it up. I make stupid mistakes in anything I do that I never see anyone else making, I can't concentrate on anything and I just end up feeling embarrassed to be alive all my waking life. I've been trying to go into science for a career but I'm realizing that I'm way too stupid. I never learned any other skills that would help me in life, so if I can't go through with that goal I'm just dead in the water. I have no social support besides my parents since I've never really made friends because I'm awkward and boring. I'm tired of being humiliated and disappointed in myself. I just hope I can finally work up the courage to take my own life soon.
