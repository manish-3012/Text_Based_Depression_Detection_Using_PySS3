I'm sorry for wanting to kill myselfI'm tired of all these selfish fucks who want me to apologize for having these feelings. They don't give a fuck because the moment I show that I still have hope and want to be helped they just call the fucking police. Nobody actually cares, they just say they do cause it's their job.

I'm sick of these people. I feel so sick I can't even breathe. I don't know why I even trusted professionals once. Everybody says to talk to a therapist but every one I had didn't give a shit about my feelings, they just wanted to get their next paycheck.

I feel so bad the only thing I have though about since November is how I will die. But all of you don't even give a fuck. So I'm sorry I want to kill myself. There. I said it. Are you fucking happy?
