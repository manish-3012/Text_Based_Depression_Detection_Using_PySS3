i don't know what to dolately i've just been lost. i feel like everyone's turned against me and the one person who i thought i could talk to hates me now. i feel like killing myself but i just don't know how to. nobody would be sad at my death and i don't deserve anything. it's all been bad ever since i had to break up with my ex girlfriend and when i told her i want to kill myself, i could tell she really didn't care.
what's the point of life?
