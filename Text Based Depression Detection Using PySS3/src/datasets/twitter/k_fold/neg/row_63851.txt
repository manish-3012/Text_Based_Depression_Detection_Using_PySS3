im a shitty personI came across this subreddit looking for a way out. 


A jist of what happened. Me[24m] got bored over break and talked to a trans girl online and ended up sexting. I had a gf [22f] who I want to marry while this happened. I have insecurities of attractiveness and this person made me feel like I was the best looking person ever and ,as a small guy, like an alpha male
 The person reverse searched my pics and is blackmailing me. They sent everything to my family and friends along with my gf and her family.


my girlfriend and I live(d) together and everything was great. The messages were sent around 1 or 2am and I was up. I paniced and blocked and deleted the blackmail message off her phone. This obviously was a stupid thing to do because it was sent to everyone.


I betrayed my girlfriend. She hates me now. My family thinks I am gay because it was a trans girl.


I can't live with the pain Ive brought to others because of my actions. I just want to kill myself for this. Im so ashamed of myself. ive tried talking to my gf but she is in the right to not talk to me. I just dont want to do this anymore. she unfortunately took her gun that she keeps under the bed so I cant use that.


 I just want to be gone and not cause so many problems
