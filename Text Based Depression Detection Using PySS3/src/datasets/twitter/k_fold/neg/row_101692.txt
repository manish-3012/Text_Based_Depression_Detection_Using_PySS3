I've been thinking about death a lot latelySometimes when I'm not even sad.

I've been severely depressed for the past year due to loneliness. I've always been more introverted and kept just a few close friends. This past year, all five of my friends have either moved away or died. My fiancÃ© and I broke up and ended on terrible terms. My family lives thousands of miles away. I've tried to make new connections but I feel too damaged to have any sort of real relationship with people. The few people I've been interested in being friends with have all seemed to be using me for something so I step away eventually. I live by myself. I asked for a cat/dog so I can have some sort of companionship but my landlord said no. I don't mind being alone but I hate being lonely. I keep myself busy and surrounded by people by working like 70 hours a week at the job I hate which makes me exhausted. I'm really just getting sick of it all and the more I think about it the more I was to just not exist anymore.

I keep thinking about how fucked up its going to be. If I quit my job then I'll have no where to be and no one will be expecting me. So if I kill myself I'll be one of those stories where they were found dead three months later because no one even noticed I was missing.
