No will to live.I'm at a point where I've hit rock bottom and I have no willpower left. I keep picking a date to kill myself by, and I set a few goals that I want finished before I die, and I put them off, because I'm just so tired all the time and then I don't kill myself because I didn't finish anything. I'm not delaying them because I'm avoiding suicide, I'm just sapped of all my will to live. 

Now I've been pushing my family away to brace them for my death. They keep asking, "Whats your next step?" And I just give a blank look like, "I'm ending it, be ready." 

I was seeing a therapist for a while, which was fucking useless. From all the collective things I've read, therapists/psychology are bullshit. At the very least, they don't know how to apply it. No advice other than, "just change how you think. You know how your thinking, well do the opposite, its difficult, but its easy." Fuck them, idiots all. 

I'm not going back to shitty minimum wage jobs, and I'm not going back to college. I'm a 30 year old, bald, white male. I don't fit in to college and the idea of putting myself in 10's of thousands of dollars in debt for a fuck all degree, I'd rather just kill myself and be honest about having no future. I'm not smart enough for a stem degree, which is the only thing worth getting now. So fuck it. 

I don't know how to find the will to live again. Its just gone forever. And no where that I turn offers even the slightest amount of help. Gods plan for me was to suffer and kill myself, and when I claw my way out of hell, I'm going to beat the shit out of him and his hippie son.
