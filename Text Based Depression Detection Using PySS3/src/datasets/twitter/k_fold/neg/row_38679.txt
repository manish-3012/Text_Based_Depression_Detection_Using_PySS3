Numb and frustratedWill try and keep this short. Iâ€™ve always struggled with depression - my mum would threaten me with suicide when I was a child. She was a good mum otherwise which gives me a complex about resenting her for this. My sister sisterâ€™s friend (8 years older) was sexual with me from the age of 4 to 10 and the berate me after leading to huge hang ups about my appearance. I met a great girl who I married, and then she said she wanted to leave me - I never got a reason why. We managed to stay together and in the process of trying to fix the relationship I have amounted debt (we moved, renovated, holidays). I then got diabetes type 1 which I have no motivation to manage. I am freelance and have no work coming to now pay off the debt. I canâ€™t go out and feel comfortable in my skin, I feel like everyone is looking at me and judging me. Iâ€™m unhappy, and honestly, donâ€™t want what the future offers. I just feel everyone would eventually be better if I wasnâ€™t here. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ll do anything tonight, or tomorrow, but the feeling is just gaining intensity, and I feel like something will give soon. I hope this wasnâ€™t the wrong place to post this, will delete if so.
