Gonna try killing myself soon again.I made a post last time I was going to do it, but I ended up getting caught and going through some shit. I'm going back home tomorrow though.

I can't decide if leaving suicide notes is worth it or not. I'll be dead, so it doesn't really matter how everyone i know feels/thinks of me.
