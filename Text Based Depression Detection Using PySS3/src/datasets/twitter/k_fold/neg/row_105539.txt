society just sees me as a terrorist so maybe I should just go kill myselfI'm just gonna be labeled a terrorist for supporting certain people so maybe I'll just go kill myself. We should be fighting to help people with thier psychological health not alienate them even more. But instead of helping people like mass shooters and shit like that we're just gonna alienate them even more which will just make the problem worse and make people more suicidal. But nothing is ever gonna change. So maybe I should just go die because guess what nobody wants to help someone who has homicidal thoughts. There's help for people who are suicidal. So why not homicidal thoughts then?
