I feel like thereâ€™s not much left.I know Iâ€™m in acute crisis mode. Iâ€™ve been in therapy and on meds for years. But tonight feels insurmountable. 


Today, I turned 30 years old. Itâ€™s the first birthday Iâ€™ve looked forward to since my 21st. And both were absolute disasters. 

Today, I started miscarrying my child. I have to have a d&amp;c on Thursday and Iâ€™m scared out of my mind.  My husband and I have been struggling with secondary infertility for over 18 months. Iâ€™m heartbroken and so so so scared. 


Years and years and years ago I had an affair. My husband found out and forgave me and we worked through it for a long time. Weâ€™ve been in such a good place for so long. Since before our first kid was born (3.5 years ago). Recently old fling reached out to me for advice with his new girlfriend. Husband found out today. And I feel like shit. Iâ€™m the worst wife ever imagined. I canâ€™t even imagine the pain Iâ€™ve caused my husband the second time around.  


I spent so long tonight hugging and kissing my so goodbye because Iâ€™m not sure I can live through the pain of miscarriage and hurting my husband and the trauma of my birthday (a whole nother story). I just feel like leaving tonight would be best. I said goodbye to my son. I hugged him and kissed him a million times. I know Iâ€™d use the garage and CO poison. Iâ€™ve been planning it for years. I just feel like itâ€™s time. I canâ€™t go through the d&amp;c on Thursday. Iâ€™m so scared. I canâ€™t stop reliving the trauma of my â€œsuper specialâ€ party at the concert. I canâ€™t forgive myself for hurting my husband again. 


My son is the only reason to stay. But heâ€™d be so much happier with just his daddy around. Iâ€™m lost and so sad and so hurt and so confused. Iâ€™m going to give myself a little while to calm down. Wish me luck.
