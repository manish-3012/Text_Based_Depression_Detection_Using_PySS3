I am going to be dead before she gets home.Today was the last straw, after a good day yesterday, asked my wife for a kiss before she left with her mom. She told me "Why do you always do that? I've told you I will come to you if I want to". But she never does! It's been months since she's even touched me.

I've had enough rejection. She can have my dead body bleeding out on the floor when she arrives back, going to cut my fucking throat open. No one fucking cares about me, not her, not anyone. ENOUGH.
