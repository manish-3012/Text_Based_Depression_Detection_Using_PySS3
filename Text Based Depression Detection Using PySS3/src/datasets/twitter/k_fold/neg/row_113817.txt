I didn't sleep all night. I kept staring at a razor blade.I could've killed myself. But, I didn't. I want the pain to end. It hurts I can't sleep, I don't want to wake. I just wish someone just end my misery. 

I have no guts. I am just a fuck up, everyone is right. Nobody deserves me. I tried hundreds of days and counting, maybe I will force happy in myself. It never works. I lost my mind. I want to die. It's like my heart is sinking. And I will never be happy.

Should I end it?
