Getting help in collegeLetâ€™s say hypothetically, Iâ€™m extremely suicidal (hypothetically) I just turned 18, in college, so when this happens my parents canâ€™t check me into an inpatient. Iâ€™m 2 hours away from home, an huge unfamiliar hospital is a 10 minute walk away, what could I do? I donâ€™t know where to start. What to do when I donâ€™t feel safe? I donâ€™t know they first step to getting help on my own. Iâ€™m not proud of that, itâ€™s kinda embarrassing that the people being the catalysts to help are abusive in the first place. Yeet.
