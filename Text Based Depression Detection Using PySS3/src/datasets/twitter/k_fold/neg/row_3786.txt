I have borderline personality disorder and my Favorite Person just abandoned me so now I wanna dieBPD stands for borderline personality disorder. In a nutshell, it's having unstable moods, emotions, self\-image, and behavior. There's an irrational fear of abandonment and frantic efforts to avoid it, unstable relationships, self\-harm, extreme emotional swings, suicidal ideation, chronic emptiness, explosive anger, and dissociation.

A lot of people with BPD have what you call a Favorite Person. A Favorite Person is the one we seek validation from the most, fear abandonment from the most, and want to spend time with the most. 

Anyway, my FP is a guy I met through Reddit so he lives oceans away. He stopped talking to me a few days ago and blocked me everywhere because I am such a piece of shit. I've tried everything to stop him from abandoning me but he did it anyway. So now I wanna die but not really. I mean, I just want to end the pain but I have so much to live for. I got into my dream university, I have two cute doggos who love me so much, I have loving friends and family, I'm going to be an actress and a musician, etc. When I think about it, I do have a really good life. But IDK, I just want to end the pain. It hurts so much. I've been trying to cope by flirting with a lot of people \(mostly boys who only want one thing, which reminds me of that meme\) and drinking heavily and dissociating and hurting myself, but I still feel like shit and I want to die. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to jump out of the window. Right now. Please help me. I don't know. I don't know.
