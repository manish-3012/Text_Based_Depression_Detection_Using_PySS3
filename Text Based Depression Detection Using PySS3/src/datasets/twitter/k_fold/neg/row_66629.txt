Why even tryI'm devoted  to my husband  over 12 years together (I'm 26 ) I'm like a god damn door mat . Cheated = oh i was drunk
Verbal  = oh i was mad 
Heart = oh I love you never leave me .blah blah blah!!!! 
I'm so over it . 

He told me he wasnt friends  with a girl on insta well bull shit .he is . I dont have any social  media (fb, insta, snap NOTHING  ) AND HE HAS IT ALL and when I did have it its ur cheating  , you are a liar.  But yet I've done nothing  , cook , clean kids. Ext. But when I did I could  have no guys on my fb . But yet you can have on urs ???!!! 

So I was on his computer  (cricut stuff ) and he had fb connected so it kept popping  up his messages NOTHING  BUT FEMALES oh but hey hey are just friends  (MY ASS) 

I really dont know how much more I can fake it.  
Oh leave it's easy.  No it's not.  I have not worked volunteering yes not work work . I just want to try! My kids keep pushing me but I'm getting  weaker idk how much longer I can take living  .
I had it well but I dont feel like I'm worth anything  anymore .
