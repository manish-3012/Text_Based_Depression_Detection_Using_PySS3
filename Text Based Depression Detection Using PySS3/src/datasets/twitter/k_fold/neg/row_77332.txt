Help?So Iâ€™m 20 with basically no friends, no job and absolutely no relationship. I suffer badly with anxiety and ocd thoughts along with depression. I kinda donâ€™t know what I expect from writing this other than perhaps a encouraging message. 

I have suicidal thoughts regularly,but I donâ€™t really think Iâ€™d do anything as I feel way too afraid of dying. 
Iâ€™m really just find it difficult at the moment and I feel like my whole life is just falling apart 

Thank you for taking time to read this
