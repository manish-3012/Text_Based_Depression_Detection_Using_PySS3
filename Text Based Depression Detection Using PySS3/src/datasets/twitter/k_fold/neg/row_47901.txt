Embalm or, not toI made an appt last Wed for a free counseling session, at a trauma and grief based place for this am. Last night, I had a meltdown and finally bought the formaldehyde that's been sitting in my cart... I wasn't going to go to the appt. I had planned to box things and leave notes etc till my package arrived in 8-10 biz days. But my CAT actually woke me- by standing on TOP of my aquarium peering in thru the plexi glass window top, and then looking at me. I kid you not, if you knew how old she was and her demeaner you'd know how out of sorts it really was. It was like she was saying, who's going so take care of us? (Not look ma I want a snack-she's a sweetie). Of course I didn't look at it like this at the time, she knocked something over and I was in mid lucid dream when she woke meðŸ˜‘.  I really love my pets though and they are all I really have. and they don't deserve to be abandoned. I myself know that feeling too well. So I do feel really guilty every time I want to give up. Either way, I made it to my appt bc I thought why the hell not. I'm awake and my pets rn are kinda irritating me. ðŸ¤·ðŸ¼â€â™€ï¸ No expectations of being helped even the slightest. After 4 long years of begging for guidance from anyone who will listen to me. To the point that I'm now honestly so much worse bc I've been so isolated and in so much pain. But today I finally got covered by a grant for therapy at this place. I showed up. And it was really hard to. but I'm really glad I did. Bc Someone finally saw my worth today and I have to say, I'm feeling a little better.
