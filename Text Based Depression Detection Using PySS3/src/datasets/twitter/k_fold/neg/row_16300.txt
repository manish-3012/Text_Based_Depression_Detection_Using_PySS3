I can't handle it anymoreI'm on the verge of ending it but something in my head keeps preventing me. Wouldn't be the first time I've ignored my brain before but this is really strong. I feel like reaching out for help but I don't know why. The urge to check into a hospital or reach out to people I know for protection is strong but I just haven't. Both options, ending it and getting help, I feel like I should do both now.
