Is often think all the time in killyourself (or wish die) but do not try it?(I don't speak english, sory about mistakes).

I don't remember since I think it, but is all the time of day. I wish die but, when I had the chance to die, searched help. The supervivence instinct, i gues... So, i hate have this thinks in my mind because they don't let do anything. I'd like ask you if is offten to have this contradictions. 

Thanks and escuse me for the language.
