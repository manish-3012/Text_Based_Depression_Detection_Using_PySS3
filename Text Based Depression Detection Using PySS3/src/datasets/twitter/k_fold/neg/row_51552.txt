I'm currently planning on jumping of from a bridge to a river(15m)So today my girlfriend went together with. Until she broke up with me again and went back to her new boyfriend. I'm currently waiting on my mom to go to sleep, and I'm planning on never coming back. I can't take the pain anymore.

It's not just the breakeup also. I've always been lonely, and sad and it feels this takes it to whole new extreme. I don't know if I should find a another way to kill myself, since there is always the chance that I survive the jump and wake up in a hospital.

I'm feel like I'm beyond any help and I just want to end it all. I can't get any help, because it'll only end up hurting me more.
