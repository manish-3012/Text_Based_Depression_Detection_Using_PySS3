How can i stop hating myself if all i do is keep hurting myself.I've been hating my self for 7 years and its been getting worse and worse, i'm the biggest loser possible and i regret nearly everything i do. I've moved house eight times over my life, i can never keep a friend, my social skills are terrible no matter how hard i try to improve them, my eye contact is poor or too intense i don't understand body language and i have so little confidence that i stutter sometimes and merge my words together. I avoid even looking at girls let alone talking to them because every time i do it makes me feel like shit. I've tried antidepressants they make me feel absolutely nothing it's horrible, I've tried various self harm, and i once stole from a boots pharmacy i was doing work experience for and overdosed alone (worst night of my life) 
I've been trying to be completely alone this past month so i stop doing stupid things i regret and trying to be more positive.
I've recently completely lost all my enthusiasm
I haven't told anyone this.
I feel that if i keep going on this route or if i start taking something then i will end up killing myself.

sorry if this heavy i just feel like i could do with someone to talk to you.
