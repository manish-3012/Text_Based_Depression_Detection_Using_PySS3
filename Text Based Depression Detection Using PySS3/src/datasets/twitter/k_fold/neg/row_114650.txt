A friend cut me off when I divulged to her I was having suicidal thoughtsOk Reddit things are spurning out of control. I  put up a post on r/relationships about how I revealed to my friend about my suicidal thoughts.

 My friend said she could not help me as she's not trained for that and asked me to go to a psychiatrist. ( She knew I have feelings for her, but we still remained friends). But what she did after that was, completely cut me off, saying she can't talk/help in any way. Her response threw me into a state of panic and we haven't talked since. I  really believed that she could have handled it better. And my psychiatrist held the same opinion. 

But as I wanted to know other's opinions, I decided to put up a post on r/relationships, and everyone on there started hating on me, calling me manipulative and exploitive. That I failed to understand boundaries. And she did what exactly a good friend would do. I don't know what to make of this, because I believed I was made to believe it was not my fault. My mind's running too fast again.
