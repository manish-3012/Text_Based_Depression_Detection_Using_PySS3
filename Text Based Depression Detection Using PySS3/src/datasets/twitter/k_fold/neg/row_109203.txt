I posted about a week ago saying that I was gonna do itAnd I didnâ€™t.. clearly.

I was sitting by the edge of the train tracks, and I figured the right moment would come. 

One train passed, and then another. And then another.

And then it started to rain. It was a very light, soft rain. It was warm, summer rain. As cliche as it is, it felt like the world felt my pain. It felt warm and beautiful and I couldnâ€™t go through with it.

I sat for a little while longer before walking home in the rain. When I got home, I couldnâ€™t answer anyone about where Iâ€™d been. I went to my room and laid down and cried for the first time in a very long time.

I donâ€™t feel peace like I felt that day. I donâ€™t feel resolve. I donâ€™t feel better and Iâ€™m still not sure I did the right thing walking away.

But I got an overwhelming response on my posts. You were all so kind and so warm. There was so much understanding and a desire to help. I wonâ€™t lie and say itâ€™s what stopped me, but itâ€™s definitely been helping me since that day.

I just wanted to say thank you for making my world a little warmer, and I wanted to let anyone who saw my post know that Iâ€™m still here. Life is a fucking bitch and dear god I hate her, but Iâ€™m still here.

Thanks.
