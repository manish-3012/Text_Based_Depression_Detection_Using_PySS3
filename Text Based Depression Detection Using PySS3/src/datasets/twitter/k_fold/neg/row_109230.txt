rant8pm and I'm already drunk. Fuck this. I can't stand her being around and I can't stand it even if I'm away from home. Fighting, literally on December 31 was not the way I wanted to start off the new year. It sickens me that you're still here, and even more so that I can't just break it up. All I can do now is chug iburprofen and drink whatever spirit I have left. Killing myself is not even enough for me anymore. I just want to stop existing period, have everything about me erased from existence, from my birth and up until now. FUCK LOVE. FUCK LIFE. FUCK EVERYTHING. I'm fucking tired of this shit. I fuck up everything I do and every relationship. 

Even if I don't kill myself, I am sure as fuck, sober or drunk, that I will guarantee myself a short life. I don't want to fucking grow old. I'm tired of being guilt tripped by you. Quitting smoking is hard, you forcing me to stop over this relationship does not fucking help. I can't even fucking sleep on the couch unless I get wasted first. To put the fucking cherry on top, the first thing I want to do is drink the moment I wake up. However, I FUCKING CAN'T because I gotta fucking pretend that everything is fine when I go to school.

You say you want to have a kid together within the next year or so. Do you know why I don't? It's because every fucking time we get into an argument, you threaten me with breaking up and finding a new guy. The way I see it, even IF we start a family together, despite me being in school and no job and that we could get a huge financial benefit from the government, whose to say you won't leave with our kid when we have another argument and I get fucked over with child support. I came back from walking my dog, and couldn't help but to think about ways to kill myself. I think I found my method. Even if we somehow get over this, guess what, the very next argument we have will be my fucking trigger. After breaking up with my ex, I fucking knew I should not date anymore. Despite all the fun times we had and how much I love you, I wish us never happened. Whenever we argue, you either threaten to kill yourself or break up with me and find another guy. I hate to sound like I'm a bitch, but you have no fucking clue what that does to my depression. 

To the reddit community:
I'm sorry but no one can help. While some of you may suggest therapy and antidepressants, my personality and the way I am as a person will not allow me to open up freely with people. I'd reach out to my friends about this, but it's pointless. No one can help me, and even I don't want to fucking help me.
