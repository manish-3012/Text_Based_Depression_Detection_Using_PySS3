[META] A plea for r/SuicideWatch subscribers to post more.I'm coming across a LOT of hours-old posts with no replies. I understand that we're not a hotline, but with 18,000 subscribers I feel like we could manage a quicker response time than that. 

As such, I'd like to encourage everyone reading this to try to make an effort to check /new, and to show your support to those who need it. If you're not posting here because you don't know what to say, that's alright. Just check out [r/SWResources](http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/) and leave a short message to let them know that you read their post and that your heart goes out to them. A lack of responses gives the impression that nobody cares. When someone is at their lowest, spilling their guts to strangers and then getting no replies can be very demoralizing, especially if they put a lot of effort into their post. It seems like the longer posts are much less likely to get a response - remember, it doesn't take nearly as long for you to read it as it took them to write it.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I get no karma from self posts, so please upvote for visibility.
