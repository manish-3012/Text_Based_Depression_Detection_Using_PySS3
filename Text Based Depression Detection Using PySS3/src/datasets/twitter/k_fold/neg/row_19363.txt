Kierkegarrd, Sartre, Kafka, Dovtoevsky, Camus, read them all and still can't find out why it's worth itI can't hold down a job, keep it together to form a relationship, dropped out of school, massively in debt, and can't get over my own self pity. In 2012 I tried to kill myself twice but failed. After that I started to get into existentialism. I got on medication and sought professional help. For awhile I wasn't happy but I wasn't hopeless. But now I feel I'm missing something. I've forgotten what happiness feels like, and now I have to ask the question does it exist at all or is it just a construct I made to help cope with the sheer pointlessness of it all. The me today doesn't want to end it til I'm sure but the me tomorrow may be different.  The idea of ending it all doesn't scare me, some days I wish something would kill me to save the trouble. 

I've tried to brush this all off as anecdotal and convince myself that as a whole existence is worth the experience. The experience has been hard to live with though because of the very fact it is my anecdote. How am I to pretend sisyphus was happy if I can't even pretend to know what happiness is I need help before the me of tomorrow decides to crush himself under the weight of his own burden.
