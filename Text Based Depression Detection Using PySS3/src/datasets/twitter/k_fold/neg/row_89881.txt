Can you please tell me how to keep going?I have no will left to keep pushing forward. Why is it that I donâ€™t feel motivated enough to do anything at all? I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve done anything to deserve anything in return. I honestly believe that thereâ€™s no such thing as karma like how everyone else seems to think that thereâ€™s some sort of obligation. Idk. Why do so many others suffer? More simply and concise, bad stuff just happens to people for no reason. I donâ€™t feel obligated to keep going, but everyone else thinks so. Why do I have to suffer for others? Is it not selfish to keep someone alive so you can feel better about yourself? 

Everything hurts and Iâ€™m so tired. I canâ€™t comprehend the fact that so many feel the same way. My family can get brutally murdered, I can win the lottery, or I can do something bad and get in trouble; and nothing will change about me. Iâ€™m scared underneath, but Iâ€™m wholly uncaring and prepared. 
I have no motivation at all and the void calls loudly lol.
