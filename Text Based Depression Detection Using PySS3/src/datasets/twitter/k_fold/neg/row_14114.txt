I don't think I will survive in this worldHey I'm 21M and have completed my education, all these years I've been dependent on my family and they have helped me with everything, I didn't have to worry about anything serious, but now as it is time to live by my own, I am terrified as to what I'm going to do. A little insight into me - I am manipulative, scared easily and when someone says anything bad about me, all I think about is ways of killing myself, I start researching on painless ways to die, it is mortifying to know the fact that if I don't kill myself there are at least 50 more years to live.
