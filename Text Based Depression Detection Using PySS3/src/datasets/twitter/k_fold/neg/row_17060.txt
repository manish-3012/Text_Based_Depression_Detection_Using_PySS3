i hate myselfi hate myself, im too skinny. 123.4 as of today... what the fuck is wrong with me? why can't i be a normal respectable weight. if i weighed more people would love me and take me seriously. but no, im a stick. no matter how hard i try i always lose weight. I hate myself im pathetic. I was 126.0 for a little bit but it all dropped. Best part is im a security guard hahaha im a joke.
