This sub is niceI'm sorry that you're reading this, nobody should have to feel suicidal. Yet this is the one sub that I can relate to the most. Not depression, since my problem is chronic pain. I'm 19 and have 24/7 muscle pain that's basically incurable on top of a bunch of other shit like fibromyalgia, ibs type stuff. Basically doomed from the moment I was born. So suicide just makes sense now. I've also had anxiety my whole life and depression mostly in the past two years though. That's been the soul sucking depression stage. It's insane how I'm still alive given how emotionally dead I am. Even considering the impact of it since I'm so sick with no real hope I look at suicide as a responsibility. As horrible as that is, for some that's their reality. I guess I'm reaching out on reddit since nothing else helps. Therapy, support, exercise and nothing solves chronic pain. My grades are slipping and I don't know what to do. A disease is eating me alive and I won't let it hurt my potential. So much so that I'll die for it. I'm just so so tired. Every day is faking it. Anyways, this is a stoned ramble sorry for the structure but I've been losing my mind and I feel suicide is my fate.
