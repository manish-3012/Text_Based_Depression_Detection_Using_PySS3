My ex keeps threatening to kill himself because of meMe and him have been together over a year. I have been wanting to leave for a long time, tried many times before only for the same thing to happen every time. He says anything and everything he can think of to make me feel like a horrible person, and that he is going to kill himself later, and blocks me on all social media. I find a way to get a hold of him because Iâ€™m so worried.

The first time I broke up with him we had been together maybe 3 months. He stop replying to my texts and I got worried so I went over to his house and he had taken a bottle of pills and could barely talk. I called the police and they came, his grandpa was yelling at me saying it was my fault, meanwhile Iâ€™m crying my eyes out the ENTIRE time. I called the cops a second time a few months ago because he kept saying he was going to hurt himself, and I had no reason not to believe him. He was so furious at me that I called the cops and his grandparents â€œgot mad at him because of meâ€. Was it my fault? Should i have not called the cops when I genuinely was scared he would try again?

Fast forward to now and its happening again, except this time he is just being so mean and manipulative. (He was manipulative the whole relationship) I want to ignore him all together but I am scared of what he will do if he finds out Iâ€™m ignoring him, even though he is not my responsibility and I need to take care of myself, what am I supposed to do..
