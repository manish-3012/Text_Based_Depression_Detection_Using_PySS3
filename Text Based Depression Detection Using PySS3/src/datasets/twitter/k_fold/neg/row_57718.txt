Extremely confused.Hi, i'm so confused to the point i cant think anymore( i just think about nothing). But its annoying since i know i can think. I'm trying to understand why i am feeling suicidal and i cant come up with the answer. The only thing that it maybe could be is that i'm lonely. but i am working on that with friends and dating, so that cant be it.

About a month ago i got sent to a crisis clinic and told them how i felt and they just talked to me about everything. Found out that I've been raised by an alcoholic, i left him three weeks ago. They told me that i cant blame him but that its possible i'm having these problems because of him. I'm now seeing a normal psychologist and she says i handle panic wrong. She also said i at least need to give it a couple months before i start to feel better. I cut and starve myself to the point of passing out. And it feels great. i think constantly about suicide, cant put it out of my head.
I cant keep going on this way
Don't know where to look anymore.

ill keep fighting but i'm afraid i will lose it.
Sorry for messy post.

Thanks for reading.
