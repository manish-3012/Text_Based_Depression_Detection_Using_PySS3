I feel like suffocatingMy boyfriend confessed that before years he broke with his ex and then he went to have 3 some sex to distract himself from the pain...
Today we were moving in together and I delayed payment about something for our wedding and he got pissed and said he will broke with me officially if it's not done. Please don't think he is bad person or cruel but I feel like suffocating because he isn't online now and all I think about is him having sex with other girls....
I don't know. Do you think he was serious or just very angry?
