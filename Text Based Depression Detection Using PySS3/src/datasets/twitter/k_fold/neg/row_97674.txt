SuicideI hate myself so much when I think back to my childhood I canâ€™t help but wonder how I got here. I donâ€™t talk to anyone anymore about how much I want to kill myself every day the thought is constantly invading my mind I learned to keep it to myself because in short people donâ€™t want to hear someone elseâ€™s problems when they got there own problems to deal with it started when I was 14 I was arrested for shooting someone and sent to prison for 4 years I did well in prison considering I got into my fair share of trouble constantly got into fights and even managed to get thrown into solitary for a year only coming out my room every other day for 2 hours yard time in a tiny cage I worked out got used to the daily routines and eventually went back to general population started working in the kitchen and got my ged when I got out at 18 I had a lot going for me got my own car and was going to school but drinking got the best of me I wasnâ€™t drinking everyday but when I did I would binge drink sometimes for 2 days and doing cocaine as well and after that I couldnâ€™t hold down a job or relationship and fell into major depression . I had hit rock bottom started to fall out with siblings I thought had unconditional love for me because I was told during arguments I had no life and I was a loser and that no one likes me after that I gained a lot of weight and would just stay in my room avoiding everyone and everything and my only escape was the weekend going out and drinking with friends Iâ€™ve even stopped talking to my mom itâ€™s been about 4 months now I think reason behind it is because I donâ€™t want to deal with her disappointment in me and how weak minded I have become Iâ€™d rather just cut people off rather than dealing with issues head on itâ€™s been 4 years since Iâ€™ve even had a relationship or been with a woman itâ€™s sad I constantly think about how other people view me Iâ€™m a joke Iâ€™m done I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore Iâ€™m constantly having negative thoughts about just blowing my brains out but Iâ€™m too scared to go through with because I donâ€™t want it to go wrong and turn into a vegetable becoming even more of a burden then I already am sometimes I just want to pick up and leave but I got no money no ones going to hire a fatass like me I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this I guess Iâ€™m just hoping someone can relate idk I just wish I couldâ€™ve been stronger me and my family were so close growing up and now we walk right past each other without saying a word my heart aches everyday why hasnâ€™t god or whoeverâ€™s in charge up there taken me already I donâ€™t want to be here anymore .
