I need a coping methodI have been thinking about ending my life today after an appointment with a psychologist. I don't want to tell a professional because in the past I've ended up in hospital because of doing that and it was just not helpful and took me years to get over it. I don't want to tell the people around me because it would worry them and cause them all to be upset plus it would be so selfish of me to worry them like that as a lot of them have had to deal with suicidal friends and family before. As far as they know I'm sad but dealing with things fine. I just wish I had someone close enough to ask me if I want to talk but sadly no one is but I guess that's why we have psychologists.
Im dealing with childhood trauma mixed with a recent break up on top of working into a new career. What are some things I can do to stop thinking about just ending things because it would be easier than dealing with all of these issues? I don't want to do it because I know people around me would blame themselves and would hurt so many of them and I don't think I'm ever actually going to. I just want to stop thinking about it.
