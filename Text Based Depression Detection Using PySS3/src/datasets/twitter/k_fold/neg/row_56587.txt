no idea what to do!!i feel trapped. i've been so depressed and suicidal for so long. my personality has mostly eroded away from years of self-hatred and attempting to "fix" myself, which in turn only made things worse by eliminating most facets of my personality.

even when i'm not going through an episode, i don't have any motivation to work on myself. my mind doesn't let me experience joy. i have to constantly justify everything i do to myself and usually in the end i give up as i realize there's no point in trying. i'll always fail!

i keep hitting "rock bottom", but it still never feels severe enough. i see a pysch, but i never see him when i'm this way so i always forget the emotions of the moment and it doesn't feel as bad in retrospect. i more just feel embarrassed. i'm just so embarrassed of my existence.

i don't know what to do. i'm not about to kill myself for real because i know it would be unfair to my boyfriend/family. i can't do it because of them, but it's all i think about!! just because i'm not going to do it doesn't mean the thoughts aren't constantly plaguing me to at least hurt myself bad! i can't go to hospital/crisis centre/whatever because i'm not going to kill myself, but i can barely function day-to-day. i do nothing all day. i'm so tired of this. i'm so mentally unwell and i know how i can change things for the better, but i always give up. god. writing all this out even feels pathetic.
