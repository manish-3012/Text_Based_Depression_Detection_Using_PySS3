[22F] Been clinically depressed for almost 13 years due to a traumatic event. Think I might finally do it tonight.I don't know what to do anymore. I tried to get help. I really did. I tried talking to people, I tried therapy, I tried antidepressants, but none of those seemed to help.

I see absolutely no reason why I shouldn't kill myself tonight. My life is pretty much just work and sleep now. I have no friends anymore, and the only people who cared about me are long dead. No one will miss me.
