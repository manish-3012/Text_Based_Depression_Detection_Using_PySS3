everything seems like too much lately.i just need to vent. i turned 19 two weeks ago. 4$8'fs have been bad since i was 17.

the summer i was 17, things got really bad. my little cousin that lived next door was raped by another family member and i didn't know about it until months after and i reported it to the police and she got taken away and my family members that were raising her blamed me and not who was raping her. me. i got blamed for ruining their lives because i got the police involved. the police, 't parents, and my therapist all say it's not my fault. it feels like it is. &amp; hate it. it's been a little over a year and i cry over it every day.

two weeks ago, i went through a really bad break up and i want closure and my ex won't give it to me and i feel crazy and i hate myself for being crazy and depressed and just i feel fucking awful. i feel stupid for believing she cared about me enough to offer closure.

last week, my grandma, who is my best friend, got diagnosed with stage 4 liver cancer and only months to live. i don't want to watch her die. i can't handle it. it'll be my first experience with someone i know dying and im scared. 

my anxiety is out of control and i don't know what to do anymore. im terrified of being alive and im terrified of my future and im terrified of things getting worse. i can't handle any more bad stuff. im so fucking scared
