Today is one of those days.I take Zoloft, occasionally Buspar for my anxiety and depression. Most days I'm okay.. but there's days like today when I just don't feel like living anymore.
More often than not, it's triggered by feeling like a failure. A disappointment. Beating myself up for having a hard time committing to the gym. Things of this nature. 
It's hard to love myself. I don't see how people do it. 
How do I.. lose weight? Become less concerned of my spouse's past viewage of porn? Become less self-critical? How do I talk more to others? In what way can I walk to combat these feelings?

I feel.. empty. But I know this feeling will pass.. and yet, it will return. I try to think of what it would be like to be a better wife, a better person. To love myself for my body, my skin, my personality and soul. To be.. happy.

And I focus on these things until the emptiness returns. I reach out today, because it is particularly hard and I feel that I burden those close to me if I open up. 

Thanks for reading.
