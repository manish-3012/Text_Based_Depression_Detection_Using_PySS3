Instead of studying in contemplating suicide.I'm about to fail out of college due to my mental illness and lack of access to healthcare. When I do, my friends will move on and I'll be alone again. I can't do that again. So I'm thinking about ending it. Anyway I just went to school and calculated the height of the parking garage. It's 44 meters surround by concrete, so I think I'll die pretty quick as long as I go head first. 
The only problem is my friends. I know first have what it's like when a close friend eats a gun. I know I'm an asshole. How can I make this easier on them? Would anybody mind proof reading my note? Is there any truth to the whole free tuition thing? I was thinking I'd take the note to my body in a Ziploc so it doesn't get covered in gore.
