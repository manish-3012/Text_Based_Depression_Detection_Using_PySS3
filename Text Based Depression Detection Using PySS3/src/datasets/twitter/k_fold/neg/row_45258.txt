Why do I even try anymore?I hate my life. My grades are terrible, but I want to have a life outside of school. I am in a school that is way above my level, but when I ask to change, my parents say that I am smart enough, even though I am not. I have clinical depression. I am a closeted atheist in a Christian household and I just got confirmed. These may seem like little things but they are constantly adding up. I want to cut myself today.
