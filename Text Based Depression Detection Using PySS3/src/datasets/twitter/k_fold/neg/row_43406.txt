I thought it was getting better, but I was wrong.Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression and suicide thoughts for years, and I thought it was starting to get better for 2-3 months, then my thoughts of hurting myself and how no one will miss me started again. Then it stoped for around a week, and it turned into thoughts of how â€œI donâ€™t deserve to eatâ€ and things like that. Food now tastes bitter, and I have no appetite. I got extremely sick from dehydration and from starvation, and I have been loosing a lot of weight,( keep in mind Iâ€™m already extremely underweight) and all that stuff.
