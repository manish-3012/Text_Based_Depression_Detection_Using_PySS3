There doesn't seem to be a point.I ruined a relationship with the girl of my dreams. We dated and lived together for three years, had a small little family unit with an adorable little cat. I imagined myself growing old with her and having children._x000D_
_x000D_
But she had depression, and I thought to help her, I had to be strong. I ignored my own depression. I tried to force myself to do what I thought was best, when what I really needed was help. I was terrified of being vulnerable. My tough approach towards myself and others had the opposite effect, and I turned into a monster. I became terrifying for her._x000D_
_x000D_
She spent a year after we broke up hopeful we would get back together. I was still numb, still ignoring my own issues. I didn't know what to do, I just took her affection for granted._x000D_
_x000D_
But something changed. I got rid of all distractions, and was able to see what I had become. Who was I? Where did I go? I felt like I hadn't been myself for years, and suddenly I bore the full brunt of the guilt and shame of hurting the girl I realized I loved more than ever. _x000D_
_x000D_
I confessed all this to her, and she suggested I take time to love myself first before trying to make our codependent relationship work again. I agreed, and went on no contact. I was such a fool, she has abandonment issues and it hurt her once more._x000D_
_x000D_
She started dating someone new, I suppose I hurt her for the last time._x000D_
_x000D_
It's been a month since then. I stopped eating at first, I didn't want to feed this horrible person who hurt such a vulnerable person. I went on fluoxetine, went to therapy. Im trying to take care of myself now...._x000D_

I am not new to breakups or heartbreak, and I understand that time heals wounds. I understand I do have an abusive childhood that created issues i still need to deal with and that I was also under a lot of pressure from issues on all sides that are far too complicated to explain._x000D_
_x000D_
But the only times I am happy now, are when I see she is happy with her new boyfriend. I still seem to exist as an instrument of her happiness. But I can't contact her. I don't live._x000D_
_x000D_
I know that humans are supposed to love themselves. I know that if I loved myself, I could have avoided hurting her. I know I'll likely meet someone new who will be able to occupy my heart in a similar way, and that I should be focusing on healing so that I don't hurt another person like this again._x000D_
_x000D_
But each and every day is so painful, getting to the point where I exist as a future me who isn't in pieces seems hopeless. My heart has hurt for so long, and I've never had any prior physical pain come close to matching how this feels. There's so much in my life a normal person would want to live for if they didn't have my memories. But I want to die._x000D_
_x000D_
I want to die. I won't do it, will I? I'll just keep living through the guilt, shame, loneliness, ennui, until I become a completely different person. But for now, I find myself wanting to die all day long, every day. I wish something would kill me._x000D_
_x000D_
I'm a nihilist who had something worth living for, and now it's gone, and I cant seem find something as valuable, anything that excites me, or gives any reason to keep living._x000D_
_x000D_
I fear if this continues, one day I'll become so numb I'll casually off myself. Or worse, continue starving myself until I develop an illness and slowly die from it. I WANT something to live for, but all I can find around me are reasons die._x000D_

I don't think anyone will read this, and its upsetting to know even if someone does, they won't be able to understand everything from what I wrote. Im so tired of living that I just needed to put something out there. Im so tired of suffering alone.
