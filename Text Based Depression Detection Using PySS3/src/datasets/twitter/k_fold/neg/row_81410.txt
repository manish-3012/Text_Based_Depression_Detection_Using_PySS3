I am sick of livingI have wanted to commit suicide since I was 10 years old. I am 22 and I feel like I have no one to talk to. No one ever understands me and I'm such an idiot. I have such immense hatred for myself that I fantasize about being murdered or tortured on a daily basis. I'm in crisis right now because I'm cat sitting and I can't fantasize about dying because the cats would die if I died. I feel stuck. I just want someone to murder me and get this all over with. Fighting depression is just too much and it doesn't help that I don't know how to make friends or be happy.
