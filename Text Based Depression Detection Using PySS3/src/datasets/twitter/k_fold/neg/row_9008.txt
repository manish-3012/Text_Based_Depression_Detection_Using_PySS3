I'm planning it and have finally the guts to do it but I only have 1 regretsThere's no point for me to stay alive, I'm always running for the past 4 years for my problema and create a big mess while hiding all my secrets from family, I have the guts to do it but I have regrets that If I die will not see the ending of some story that I read but what I'm gonna do, this is the only option I have.
