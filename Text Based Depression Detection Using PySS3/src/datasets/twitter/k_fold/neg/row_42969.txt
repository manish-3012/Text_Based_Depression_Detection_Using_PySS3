I might legitimately start planning my suicide.I can't function anymore, my life is in shambles and has been for two years and all people can say to me is "it gets better" while watching me have breakdown after breakdown...  People say they care about me but they don't, i'm the only person that does anything in my house, i'm the only person who TRIES to make money and when I bring it up to my sibling they just say "I'm sorry I'm so useless" but they NEVER try to help.

I'm broke, I have no money, I have over 70k debts that I'll NEVER be able to pay, I can't buy food, I can't feed my cat, I can't pay the rent, I lost my heating, I'm going to lose my electricity, every single day I wake up and I hate myself, my friends are non existant, and I feel like nobody cares if I die. 

I'm honestly starting to think i'd be better off if I just ended it, there's no happiness for me on the horizon, I can't keep waiting for something good thats never going to happen, I think I'm going to kill myself soon.
