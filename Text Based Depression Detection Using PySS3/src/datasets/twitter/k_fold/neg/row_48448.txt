Attempting a solution will cause more damageAt this point, Iâ€™m so fucked up I canâ€™t possibly resolve it.  

Sure, maybe I go out and make â€œreal friendsâ€, whatever the fuck those are.  And whether or not itâ€™s actually just fantasy unicorn hunting, letâ€™s imagine I bag a couple.

My mental illness is going to come back.  It always has.   With how depressed Iâ€™ve been and how little resources I have, statistically itâ€™s almost certain.   

Not to mention the only people who seem to relate or talk to me long term also have deep seated mental health issues.

If I donâ€™t end it now, Iâ€™ll end it later.   If I end it later and if I have friends, Iâ€™ll probably just cause them more grief than if I never existed in their life.  

Itâ€™s unfair for the world, for me to keep fighting.
