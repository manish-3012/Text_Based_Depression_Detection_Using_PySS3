I finally accepted the fact.When people say that others can't understand them, it always comes of as clichÃ© and insincere. That is why I've tried time and time again to formulate my state of mind to others in hopes that they would understand, alas, I can't. For a over a year straight I've conversed with people and I've tried to convey my thoughts and feelings but I've failed to do so every time. 

I don't have friends, I never did. Maybe my personality is to blame, maybe I'm just a terrible person. It's all very confusing, but the fact I could never find anyone I guess serves as a testament to my unintelligible self. 

I'm not bright enough to understand myself nor am I capable of describing how I think and feel. For many years I couldn't come to terms with this fact, but I finally managed to do so at last. It's become clear that I was destined to be alone, I can no longer build myself up only to fall back down. 

Don't bother reaching out to me as I know how all of those conversations go, neither should you try to befriend me since you'll inevitably leave once you tire of me. I simply felt like Ã had to get it out even though it didn't serve to accomplish anything.

I lived to be 19, at least no one will mourn my death.
