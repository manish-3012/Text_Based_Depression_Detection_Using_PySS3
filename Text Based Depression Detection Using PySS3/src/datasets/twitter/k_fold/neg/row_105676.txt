I just want to stop hurting.I'm in a lot of pain. I'm transgender, waiting on hormones (three more months of waiting). Every day without treatment hurts. I also have a panic disorder, GAD, and paranoia, and possibly depression, all of which cause me pain on top of being trans.  I don't want to die - I have one shot at life and there's a lot I want to do with it - but I want to stop hurting. I'm scared of myself. Intrusive thoughts tell me I want to hurt myself to feel in control of my own body, I want to end my suffering. I want to live but I'm so fucking terrified that I'm going to listen to those intrusive thoughts one day.
