Failing At LifeI'm in community college right now because I couldn't afford to go to a university and I'm getting good grades, but I keep worrying about my future. Just today, I couldn't afford to take the bus to class, so I had to stay home, and there are other things that I have to spend money on that my financial aid can't cover. My parents are also bankrupt, so they can't help. I don't have a job either, and no one seems to want to hire me. This thought that I'm going to just be a loser living with my parents for my whole life keeps creeping into my head, and I keep having suicidal thoughts. Some help would be appreciated, I don't know what to do. I'm still looking for work and my parents seem disappointed in me. Everything ahead of me looks bleak.
