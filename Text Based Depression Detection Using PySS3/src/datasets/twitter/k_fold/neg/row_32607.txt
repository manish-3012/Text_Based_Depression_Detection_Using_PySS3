Will I get ppl into trouble if I kill myself after I am discharged?Im gonna be seen by a senior consultant 
And I'm 100% not depressed and doing good
I believe I can be discharged shortly afterwards

But if things go wrong afterwards and I do take my life afterwards, Will I get ppl in the hospital  into trouble?

serious replies only 
thx
