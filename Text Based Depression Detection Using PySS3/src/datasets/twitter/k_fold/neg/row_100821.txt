I feel like i'm very worthless, and idk how to keep going for very longThis is my very first post here, so i'm sorry if i broke any rules or anything.

To start off, i tried getting a psychiatrist for my problems and all, but anyone that i've called of the 4, didn't pick up the phone. I tried calling them on different times and days, but they never picked up, even tho 3 of those 4, had prior notice from a child support worker, that i'd be calling them. Now, i am way too anxious to call other ones and i have no clue what to do. If this keeps up, i don't think i can hold myself back anymore.

It makes me feel, that i'm not good enough for me to get any kind of help andI feel like the only way to really get any improvement on my mental health, is with a psychiatrist. I tried self-help, therapists, talking it out and all, but it either didn't work for me, or even made it worse.

I'm sorry if this took too much time off of you, but thank you, if you bothered reading this all. And idk if this is relevant, but i'm a male 17 yo.
