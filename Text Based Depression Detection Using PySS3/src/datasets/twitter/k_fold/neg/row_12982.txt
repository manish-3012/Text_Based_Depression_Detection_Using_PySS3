Heroic TherapistsMy therapist was arguing with me that 95% of suicidal people after attempting suicide want to live. That is such bullshit. All the (4) suicidal people Iâ€™ve met whoâ€™ve attempted are still suicidal, including myself. Sheâ€™s 100% convinced sheâ€™s read â€œfacts and evidenceâ€ that 95% of suicidal people actually want to live because life is good :) and that I just need to be saved somehow with art and horses :) even though I genuinely want to die. Therapists really want to feel like theyâ€™re saving a life and being heroic doing the most but theyâ€™re â€œsavingâ€ people who want to die, leaving them to more suffering. They just donâ€™t understand, they havenâ€™t felt how we feel.
