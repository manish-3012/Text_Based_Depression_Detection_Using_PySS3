Itâ€™s never going to get betterMy life? Itâ€™s literally never going to get better. Iâ€™m not going to make it out alive. And I donâ€™t feel anything, I canâ€™t feel anything because like, iâ€™ve fought this for so long. Iâ€™m in my first semester of college, iâ€™m homeless, isolated from my entire family including immediate and extended. I have no friends. One time i had to live with a sex worker who was also a hoarder for three days, and during those three days i only ate canned soup. My stomach hurt so bad, i was starving. Iâ€™m still struggling to put food on my plate and clothes on my back and iâ€™ve never felt so disgusted with myself. I applied for food stamps and for some reason got denied. Nothing ever goes right or looks up for me, and iâ€™m fucking tired of it..It would be so much easier to end it and die with dignity
