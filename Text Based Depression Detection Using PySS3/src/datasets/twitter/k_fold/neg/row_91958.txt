anybody want to talk for comfort?im 21 year old female, and i dont know who i am anymore. ive had depression for as long as i can remember, and now i am having trouble figuring out who i am, what i want, and where i want to go in life. i almost ended it 2 nights ago at 4am on the road...and i would definitely appreciate it if anybody just wanted to talk.
