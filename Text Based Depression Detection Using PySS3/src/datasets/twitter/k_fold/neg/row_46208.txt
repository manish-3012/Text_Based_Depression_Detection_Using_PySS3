I have LITERALLY no reason to go on living.This is such a miserable, screwed up world and I hate my family and all my peers. Never been understood, loved, or thought about by any of my peers and my family is constantly yelling at me and hitting me over minor issues. Iâ€™m done with life, so close to 18 but doesnâ€™t it only get worse from there? Fuck man. Got cheated on after 2 years and my family doesnâ€™t care. I have no one to vent to for more than 10 minutes because no one cares enough to have an in-depth conversation with me and get to know me. If I just went away Iâ€™d be spared all this false hope, pain, and loneliness. If I just left this world..
