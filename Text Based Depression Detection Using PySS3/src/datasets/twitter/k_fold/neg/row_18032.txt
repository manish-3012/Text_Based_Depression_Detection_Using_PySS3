I dont know how to get over herStory for context

I (M17) been struggling with depression and social anxiety disorder for few years now. Never had friends nor been in a relationship. Recently (couple of months) I have started having suicidal thoughts. Last summer I've met a group of online friends that I was introduced to by a girl (F17) that I've also met online. Although I have problems with trust because of previous "friends" I've had, and despite sometimes being left out (not main reason, but I am the only not native english speaker in it) I felt accepted in it (and still do). But there was something more. I secretly had a crush on previously mentioned F17. I felt like perhaps one day I'd have slight chance. We were planning to meet in real life in few months. It all made me feel like I actually meant something, and could do something with my life. But god, was I wrong. Recently I've been told that she started dating with M15 from our friend group. I am happy for them, and I'm sure she is going to be much happier with him than she would ever be with me (if I had any chance, because she's way out of my league). Problem is that although I am glad that she is happy, the whole thing completely destroyed me inside and my suicidal thoughts are even worse than they ever were before. 

I don't know how to deal with it, and I'm pretty sure it will end with suicide. Earlier my life felt like having a knife in my chest. Now it has been pushed further in. And it has a hook. And it has been twisted around.
