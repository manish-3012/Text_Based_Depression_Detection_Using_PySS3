itâ€™s been 4 years. 4 years since a suicidal thought, but my streak is over. i canâ€™t understand why iâ€™m alive anymore. i shouldnâ€™t exist.iâ€™m such a screw up. i am such an embarrassment and burden to everyone i know. i had a panic attack today and i felt like i was a horrible daughter and shouldnâ€™t even exist. that my parents would be better of without having to worry about what iâ€™m doing. even my dog was avoiding me today. i want to die. i canâ€™t see any sort of future for me. iâ€™m gonna graduate soon but i canâ€™t see myself in college. like weâ€™ve been on tours and i love campuses but i canâ€™t see myself outside of my bedroom. it all feels like a movie. it would be better for everyone if i just died. they wouldnâ€™t have to worry about me. and my college money could go towards my brother. iâ€™m such a screw up it would be better for everyone anyway.
