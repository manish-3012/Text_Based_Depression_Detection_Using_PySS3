I lostMy story is quite funny actually ...
I was raped by the age of 12 by a older relative after that my life went down hills
I kept every thing to my self by the age of 14 i got cancer i struggeled till the age of 20 than i beated the illness once and for all I guess who knows .
any way I started hating everything everyone I was on the verge of self destruction I tried to kill my self too many time ,tired to count sluching my wrist throwing my self from the stairs  drinking detergent I was admitted countless time to a mental facilies but due to my family critical situation and beaning in conservative communities I was realised quickly even when am begging for help and care .
 21 I was hunging around the worst kind of people the trash of the society 
The worst of the worst 
One day I met someone who made feel happy and he helped I lied to him deceived him to stay with me we were the best we were happy or that's what i thought .
I depended on him i existed for him 
I was alive because of him i stopped going around I stopped doing stupid thing 
He was my life 
Three months ago we got married after 10 years of being together 
But on the wedding day I found out he had a girlfriend in the same time 10 years they 've been together 
Am a weak pathetic person I love him to much to leave him 
But am strong enough to kill my self to get rid of this pain ,betrayal ,sadness, emptiness, and loneliness 
I rather break every bone in my body than feel this pain in my soul .......
