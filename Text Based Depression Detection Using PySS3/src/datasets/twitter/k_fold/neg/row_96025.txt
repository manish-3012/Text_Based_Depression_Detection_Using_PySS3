I want to kill myselfMy girlfriend no longer is interested in me. I thought Iâ€™d marry her one day. When I say she is rare, I mean it. She was my one. And I fucked it up with her help. I dumped her when she did something stupid but now Iâ€™m not even sure if it was really that important for me to have reacted that way. 

Now I struggle without communication with her. Itâ€™s been 3 months. I want her in my life. I tried to get her back and it did not work. Only made things worse. 

So I offered to be friends. Genuine friends. 

Now she texts me about her life and when she is stressed. Today she texted me about her new guy friend. She hoped it develops into a new relationship for her. 

Hearing that makes me die inside. I still love the girl. And she tells me about feeling butterflies for another guy. 

There was still so much I could have shown her, so many more memories to be had. But now she has exchanged me for someone else. 


I know I am being irrational and there is more to life. But all I wanted this semester was to lay in bed with her and relax. Comb through her hair with my hand and cook her dinner. Rub her back till she fell asleep like the days before. Take care of her. 

But she is gone. And I want to be gone as well. I know it is irrational, but I want to be dead.
