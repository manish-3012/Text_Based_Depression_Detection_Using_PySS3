How to stop urges?I think I am depressed, but it is a self diagnosis so take that as you will

For 2-3 years I have not had any happiness or success in my life, for the last year I have been fighting suicidal urges but recently they have been getting stronger. I try not to walk anywhere alone because everytime I find my self by a road I have a strong urge to jump in front of a car, same thing happens when I am driving alone, I want to just speed straight into a wall. 

I also almost bought some CO gas, and have looked into buying a gun, but that isn't very easy where I am. 

I am wrestling with myself in both the short term and the long term, but I am interested in some short term ways of stopping the urges.
