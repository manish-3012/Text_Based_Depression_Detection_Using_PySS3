I'm doneI've been depressed for over a year now. I honestly don't want to fucking live, and the only reason why I havent killed myself is that I don't want to cause drama in my family. I don't care that I'm only 14, im ugly, im always tired, I don't make an impact on others lives, Im a douche, and I can't remember the last time when I was happy. Tonight may have been the tipping point, medicine doesn't do shit, I'm done.
