the idea around suicide and many other need to come to an end.   
we need to start being fully rational and take all circumstances in to account.

stop blanket thinking about it or other psych disorders stop letting antiquated laws and beliefs affect and prevent what logic and other information dictate may very well be correct. this is a dis-service to EVERYONE but and it needs to stop.   
its based on fear, desire to keep what you aren't meant to control, control tactic, and co-dependency.

its not based on trying to help the person but we are told we ARE helping the person nope. try again, and most can feel its not and they are conflicted saying the things too!

lets agree that from now on we go by logic and what is best for THEM not everyone else but the person we are trying to help what ACTUALLY would help them not what we want or society thinks would help.
