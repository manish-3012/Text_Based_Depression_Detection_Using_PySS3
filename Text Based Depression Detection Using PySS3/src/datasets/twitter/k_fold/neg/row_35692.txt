I've been happier then ever. But now because of one thing. I feel awful.For the last week and a half. I've been really enjoying life. I felt on top of the world. And now because I love someone who will never love me the way I love her. I feel terrible. I can't stop what I feel. The keep thinking that it'll go away but it hasn't for the last month. It's always there. Always in the back of head. It just sucks because I can't seem to do anything about it.
