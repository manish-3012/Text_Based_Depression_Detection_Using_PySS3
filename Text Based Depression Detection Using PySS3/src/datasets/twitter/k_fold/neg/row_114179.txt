Every 2 years for the past few years, someone at my school kills themselves on the last day of the Autumn school holidays. That's tomorrow.I'm petrified for tomorrow. At my school (5 years) someone has killed themselves on the last day of the April break every two years. The reason why I'm scared is because I've been thinking of killing myself consistently for the past few days, and I'm so scared that if it isn't me who kills myself, it'll be someone better, with more friends and a good future. 

My friends are in the process of trying to cut me out, my grades are dropping, I have no clue what to do with my life even in Year 12. I'm the perfect person out of everyone at my school who should be victim to this weird curse. I can think of four people from my school who would mourn me, and though I have family, I'm nowhere on the path to make them proud enough and staying alive longer would just cause more pain and disappointment in the long run. 

There are so many logical reasons to kill myself. I've had a plan for how to do it set out for a couple of years. Everything is telling me it's time for me to die. I turned 17 last month, and I was so proud of myself for getting past 16, when I planned to kill myself last time. Everything is telling me I wasn't meant to last this long and I'm so scared I'll be the one to die tomorrow. 

Any support would be wonderful.
