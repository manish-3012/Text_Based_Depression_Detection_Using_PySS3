Doing nothing with my life because I have no motivation. Tonight is the night.I've been struggling with a panic disorder and schizophrenia for years now. It's all become far too much for me to handle. I'm disabled and can't afford anything so I just sit in my room contemplating my death. I was thinking about going to school for a trade but i don't know which one or how to start. The point is, I'm 23, and my life has become madness, time to go to wonderland.
