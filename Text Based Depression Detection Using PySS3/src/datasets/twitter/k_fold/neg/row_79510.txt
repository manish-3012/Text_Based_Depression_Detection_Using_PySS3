I hope someone reads this. I've been writing this stuff in my "Existential Notebook". I hope someone can read this fully before this gets removed.No matter how hard we try to separate ourselves from the real world, we will always cone back here. We might hate it, but this is where we belong, in this plane of existence. Sometimes, we choose to embrace fantasy just to escape this world of endless torment, but in the end, this is where we'll go back to, with that, I tell you all. Our existence is a feeble one. We will only be here for a moment in the entirety of time. We will only stay here for a little while, so live life the way it is meant to be lived. Do not always seek for happiness for it will only make us feel sad. Be content on what this world has to offer, Be grateful for the challenges you faced for they molded you into who you are
now. Be grateful for your friends because they existed and your existence intertwined with them, Be grateful for the Universe, for we might be an insignificant speck of dust in the desert of unknown proportions, and we might never fully explore it until the day that we will all fade in time, but at least we get to experience the wonders this world has to offer to us. Smile. Never give up. Problems arrive, but they are never permanently there. They'll eventually fade, We all will eventually fade, but before we do, let us live a wonderful life and leave a mark... a mark which is surely to echo throughout the eons to come, the Verses to be created, and most importantly, for the sake of the future. I am Just a nobody but I sure hope that you have reached this point whilst being happy and not skipped a part of it. My reader, my fellow human... life is a gift from the cosmos, so it's wise if we pay our respects to it. 
That is all, thank you.
Yours truly, Nobody
