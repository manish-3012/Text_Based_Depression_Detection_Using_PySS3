Losing hope fastI thought the abuse would end.  I thought the pain would end when I moved out but of course it didn't. I feel like I'm a walking fucking empty sack of useless flesh. I would give anything to give my life to  ANYONE who didn't deserve to die because I sure as fuck don't deserve to live I hate it and I'm wasting it. I have a job and I'm in school and it doesn't make me want to fucking kill myself any less. Medication fucked up my brain forever and never helped. I don't have a doctor. I was in the hospital last year for trying to kill myself. I'm barely better off now. All I do is go to class or go to work and come home and sleep because I'm too depressed to do anything else. Talking to people is a chore. I barely eat. I love my father and he thinks I'm doing fine and I don't have the heart to tell him I'm miserable after everything he's done for me.

I hate being like this. I'm a waste in my eyes. I hate it.
