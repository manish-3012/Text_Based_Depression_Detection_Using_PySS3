There is no way outLife seems so pointless to me. In general. I try to pursue my goals and dreams, but I can't keep up with it. I recently dropped out from the last year of high school because of a huge misunderstanding (I'm 20). I have no job, I make shitty music just to persuade myself that there is a way out of the deep hole I'm in. I gave myself 5 years to get somewhere with my passion, if it doesn't work after that I would spare myself years of suffering by ending it all. But I can't do it. All my life I've been completely awkward socially, I'm anxious of social situations, and recently I didn't care about that, because I had something I lived for. But I can't live up to what I want to do. My mood changes so fast, I can't live with it. Sometimes I'm paranoid as hell. I haven't even talked about it to my doctor, I'm afraid of getting diagnosed with some major illness. That said, I have a choice - to be a copy and live a meaningless, lonely life full of guilt and fear, or to make the inevitable come faster.
