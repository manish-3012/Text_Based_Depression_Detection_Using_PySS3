I just lost my whole future and just don't see the point in anything anymore...I'm 18, started the second half of my senior year not too long ago. Got into every college I applied to including my dream school, had plans for what I'd do once I got there, but my family can't afford to send me to any of them. The main source of the money we would've used to pay for it fell through the cracks, so we have virtually nothing to pay my tuition. Financial aid is offering me little money, applied for only a few scholarships because I thought we were financially secure enough that it wasn't worth my time. I'm not a super genius, but still fairly smart. 3.8 GPA, top 5% of class, very talented artist and even got into two of the best art schools in the country. But for what? What's the point if I can't do anything with it, if I'll be stuck living as a bum in this godforsaken town? No job, no car (thanks a lot, driving phobia), and no sense of fulfillment waiting for me if I'm stuck here while all my friends move on to bigger and better things. Even if we somehow pile up enough money for me to get out, what about my younger bro? He will most likely want to go to college too in a few years, and there won't be any money left for him and he'll be in an even worse boat than me. I know there's other options, other routes I could take with my future, but none of them would be even remotely fulfilling to me. There's no point in anything, nothing to keep dragging myself through another five months or more of hell for. My parents hate each other and are eventually getting a divorce. A huge part of why we couldn't get the money is kind of my dad's fault so my mom hates him even more now, and all they do now is argue over my future. I can't go anywhere or do anything with friends anymore because I'm scared to leave the house. Got into two huge fights with my dad the other day, not sure if it was worth it. Feels like I can't trust either of them anymore. Scratch that, feels like I can't trust hardly *anyone* anymore.

I don't want to end it. There's too many people who care about me, too many people who I'd hurt if I left them behind. My friends, my parents, my little brother, my boyfriend, even my cats. I couldn't hurt them like that. Life is too valuable, so I couldn't imagine ever actually going through with anything. But soon, I feel like there's going to be nowhere else for me to go and if I keep going on like this I'll just drag everyone down. I've had issues with depression in the past, but this is a whole new level of down and I'm terrified of where I'll end up.
