I can't cope with stress or negative thoughtsMy entire life I've always overreacted to the tiniest things.  I can't for the life of me control my emotions or calm myself down when something bothers me and I constantly flood my mind with negative thoughts that make things worst for everyone around me.  Small insignificant things that happen to everyone is like the end of the world to me and my mind goes blank and I can no longer rationalize them for what they are.

I have trouble dealing with everyday life.  I don't think I can improve so what's the point?

I've been to two therapists and have done CBT.  The first therapist moved out of state and the second flat out told me that my issues will never go away.  That I'll always be in a constant state of anxiety.

Nothing in my life is particularly wrong.  I'm in an okay financial situation and I have people in my life that care for me and attempt to cheer me up.  I know my constant negativity is a drain to them but I don't know how else to express how awful and anxious I feel.

I have SO many options on how to make my life better but I feel like I can't handle the natural stress that comes with trying new things so I just don't bother.  I was planning on partnering up with someone I know to launch a start up (they have a lot of experience in the industry and I have management /accounting experience) but I can't see myself succeeding at something like that.  I'm so incompetent and over emotional that I'd probably fail.  I also have the chance to go to school for free but I don't think I'd be able to handle the pressure of school work especially because what I'd go for would be considered "difficult" by academic standards.

What's the point of life if you can't even live it properly?  What's the point of having aspirations when you know you're too ill equipped to face set backs?  Theoretically each challenge you overcome should make you stronger but it hasn't done that for me.
