Everything thats happened since Thursday has had me want to attempt to kill myself againso if you didnt read my last post last Thursday. I said I was near a bridge and was going to jump off it. And well obviously im not dead.

The day after I was went to a hospital, and then got put in a mental health ward for a day. I was shamed by my parents and a nurse for possibly having a mental illness which I didnt decide to have, didnt want to have and cant control it when I have thoughts/urges to self harm and commit suicide. 

I really feel like no one loves me because its not "aw it'll be alright, we'll get you help" no, its "you're a fucking childish baby and attention seeker for feeling depressed" , "dont say anything stupid to the nurses, just say you're fine so we can go home(an actual quote from my mum before she left the hospital to go get me a few clothes during my stay)". I cant express any emotion or feelings to anyone because I seem to get dismissed every time, no matter who it is. 

It hasnt even been a week since I last tried to kill myself and im already considering if im able to hang myself with my hoodie strings or a scarf or cutting myself again with whatever i can find it my room. If I cant talk to anyone or get any support by people who are meant to love and Care for me and help me. I want to take it upon myself to pull myself out of misery and if suicide is the only way how; ill take it. 

No one cares for me, no one loves me, I dont want to go on..
Im not going to kill myself tonight but In the next few days or weeks if everything turns to even more shit, I aint sticking around for long.
