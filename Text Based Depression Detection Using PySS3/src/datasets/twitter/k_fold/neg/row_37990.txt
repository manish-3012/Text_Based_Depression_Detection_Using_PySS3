My life is hell.I'm an 18 year old male. I've never had a girlfriend. I hate how I look. I'm sleep deprived because of the job I hate. At college I'm socially isolated. Therapy and meds do not help, and weightlifting causes me to break down. 

How is it humane to keep going and try to live? 

Women ignore me on real life and social media. My life is on a loop of wanting and failure.

I just hope I can push myself to stop it.
