I think I cant do this anymoreIt's getting so hard to stay going, I'm trying every day but it just gets harder and ever any better. I've been through so much and I feel so alone. I don't have anyone I trust to turn to. I've asked someone important to me for help and I just get ghosted. I don't know if I can do this. It's getting harder to talk myself out of it. Distracting myself with mindless YouTube isn't working anymore. I just can't. I feel like any day I'm gonna slip and give in.
