I need to make dinnerIn order to make dinner, I need to use the kitchen. To do that, the kitchen has to be usable. Thereâ€™s so many dishes, a smell thatâ€™s only been gettig worse, floors that are slowly tearing apart each time I attempt to sweep and mop them, and two holes in the ceiling that occasionally drip water. Sometimes a bee gets in. 

On a normal day, I just do the dishes, then make food. More frequently I just look at the pile of everything and sit back down as my life slowly falls apart
