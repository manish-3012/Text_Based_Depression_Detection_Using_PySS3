I wish there was a place for me to go.To get away from the pain and the exhaustion that haunts my daily life. If I could just have a small break, from the chronic pain, from the mental illness, from the crippling anxiety, I'd be forever grateful. But there aren't any breaks. And it's making me wish I was dead.
