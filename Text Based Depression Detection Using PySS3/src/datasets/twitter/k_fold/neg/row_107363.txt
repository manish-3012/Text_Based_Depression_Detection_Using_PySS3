I hate that I'm back here.I tried to commit suicide about a little over a year ago. I'm in a bad place again and I wish I had been successful. I don't have any particular need/want with posting this, but I just wanted to express it. I seriously have nothing to offer the world. I have before, but that time is gone. I'm a burden to my family and friends, and I have little to offer beyond paying my rent, and of course, my fair share of taxes.
