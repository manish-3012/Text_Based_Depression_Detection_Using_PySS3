Watching myself bleed for some kind of control.I have continued to cut and I just canâ€™t get myself to want to even stop again. 
Iâ€™ve been doing it in harder to see areas so people donâ€™t notice and start asking questions about marks etc so Iâ€™m obviously not cutting my arms like I once did, but I also know that it got to a point when I was younger that it turned into cutting my wrists and bleeding for as long as I could before needing to apply pressure and do something about it and riding that feeling of being so close to actually ending everything and itâ€™s so easy to think I could actually just do it. Iâ€™m older now, no one would particularly notice if I disappeared. At least not until it was too late to do anything about it. 
My head is just so jumbled up at the moment, I donâ€™t know what I want. I just feel hopeless.
