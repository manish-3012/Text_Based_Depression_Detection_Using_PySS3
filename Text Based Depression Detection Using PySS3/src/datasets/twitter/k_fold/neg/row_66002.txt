why do they say itâ€™s going to be better when they donâ€™t know what position youâ€™re inItâ€™s just draining at this point seeing people say â€œoh itâ€™s gonna get better just wait!!â€ or â€œtry waking up earlier in the morning and everything will get better!!â€ No, having a schedule isnâ€™t going to make me feel better. No, having someone tell me I have nothing to worry about because I have a roof over my head isnâ€™t going to make me feel better. No, hearing about what youâ€™ve been/going through isnâ€™t going to make me feel better.  Just stop giving people fake promises that life will eventually become sunshine and rainbows and suddenly everything you ever wanted will become true.
