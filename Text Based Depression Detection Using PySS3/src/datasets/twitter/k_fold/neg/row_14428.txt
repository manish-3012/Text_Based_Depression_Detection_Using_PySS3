Is it worth it?Existing is so hard right now. I kind of feel like each breath is harder. I'm at a point where I feel like this huge burden and annoyance to everyone I love. And it not even that I'll kill myself, because that would create a mess to really lovely people that I know and love. But I wouldn't mind being ran by a buss or anything.

And *is it worth it really?* I hate myself to an extent where I can't be bothered to properly be funcional. What am I doing? What should I be doing?
