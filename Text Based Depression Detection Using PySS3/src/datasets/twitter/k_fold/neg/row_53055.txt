Farewell, my SW family.I've made up my mind. I'm not going to fail this time.

You guys were absolutely lovely, and I loved talking to all of you. It would be nice if we got to spend more time, in much better conditions. But some things can't be helped.

It was a great pleasure talking to all of you, hearing your thoughts, helping some people in need... I was really happy to find people like me, people who would understand me. You made the final moments of my life worth it.

Don't miss me. Just know that my coming state is much better than this.

Even though we've just talked for a few days or so, you guys are still my family.

Wishing all of you the very best in your life, may you lead long, successful and happy lives which are worthwhile. Remember. You guys are the best. Don't let those demons get to you.

Goodbye, fam.
