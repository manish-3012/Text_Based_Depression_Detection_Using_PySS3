My life will end very soonHello , I'm almost 24 years old and my life will end . I was diagnosed with severe psychiatric disorders when I was young. Basically I live all my younger years with antidepressants, Psychiatrists , antipsychotics and stuff. For this reasons I was never able to have a normal life . I was never able to have success in studies or in sports . I always been alone in my room . I'm a failure in everything . I'm ugly and I have to die. This world is not made for me , I'm too weak . I think I will get a rope as soon as possible and I will hang myself at home . I should never be born .
