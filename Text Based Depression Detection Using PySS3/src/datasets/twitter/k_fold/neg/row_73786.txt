Not today, Satan. I'm losing faith that lock-down will ever end. I'm so lonely.  


I left my abusive wife in October after 7 years together because she won't stop fucking my ex-best-friend and rubbing their relationship in my face while denying any kind of affection. She invited me to spend xmas morning with her and my girls (and him). I can't be there, I'll lose my shit and ruin it for everyone then have to live with ruining xmas for the people i love most. My folks also invited me to drive 3 hours to see them, but I'm really not sure I'd make the drive through the mountains without pulling the steering wheel.  


Today I spent 30 minutes holding my razor and standing in front of my bathtub, sobbing. Eventually, I beat the urge. In the dark moments, and every time I start to crack I'm telling myself "It gets better", because I really want to believe that it will.
