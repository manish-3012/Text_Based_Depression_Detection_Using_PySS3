The transition from inner anger to outer anger in the case of mass shootings*I want to preface this by saying this is a very sensitive topic to speak about on the internet. I am in no way making a threat or suggesting an action will be taken. This is merely hypothetical discussion in the hopes that as a community we can better understand those of us that take extreme actions and want to hurt others. I am also speaking in the cases of murder-suicide and not cases of outright mass murder. That's another long discussion. I use the word 'victim' to describe people who commit mass shootings because this is speaking from a hypothetical point in time *before* they react in such a way. I suggest that any of us are at risk of this result, not that we are born into it, but that it is an extreme byproduct of an extreme environment. If this is true, then we should address ourselves as victims before we give that title to so many others. I speak from a perspective which only I hold, and if you have insight to share then please do so.*

Suicide is self loathing; a need to exterminate yourself from the world. Even the mods refer to the empirical model (one of few) that we base our understanding of suicide on. While i don't agree with it fully, it (basically) claims that suicide is an option which will only occur if the person A) perceives themselves as a burden to others or society and B) has experienced pain/suffering repeatedly. Going off of this, suicide is an outburst of desperation to end the suffering called life we trudge through day-in and day-out. But what factors come into play when those who suffer choose to harm others as well? One could argue it's an innate trait that happens to add to the issue of suicide. One could also argue that it's all in the same vein and is behavior as a byproduct of the environment they grew up in. But this isn't to debate eugenics or constructionist points of view. The point is that something occurs to **add** this element. I don't think the switch flips from 'I want to hurt myself' to 'I want to hurt the world'. I think there is a second switch, so that the two exist simultaneously. 

We'd have to look at why people who want to kill themselves -don't- want to kill other people too. Maybe it's a sense of empathy or humility instilled from the abuse the world has put upon them. Maybe being stepped on so much has affirmed their identity as a doormat, meant to be there and underneath everybody for the sole purpose of just that. In this case, when the world becomes too much and feels like it's all telling you to end it, you agree with it. 'Yeah, I am a burden. Yeah, I am a waste of time. Yeah, I am hopeless.". This is our fight or flight system responding with freeze. We accept the fate regardless of our dislike for it. Because what we want doesn't matter. What we need doesn't matter. It's too much to ask to get better.
Perhaps it's the self-loathing aspect. The belief that you genuinely are as bad as the world makes you feel. You want to extinguish yourself because all 8 billion fingers are pointed at you in chastisement. In this state, our self value has been reduced beyond zero to a negative state in which we owe the world an apology for merely being here. 

***We owe the world an apology for merely being here.*** 
The social norm is not to kill people. Pretty simple. Okay, so what causes somebody to transcend this social and moral boundary?
Let's consider what may happen if somebody going through these experiences doesn't lose all self value. What would happen? A sense of injustice could arise. Anger could probably come out as a form of self defense. However, the original sense of self loathing is merely reduced, not erased. The element of self hatred and feeling of being a burden somehow coexist. The victim may become lost in how depressed they are, yet simultaneously have a sense of how evil the world has been to them. 
***The victim may become lost in depression yet simultaneously have a sense of injustice.***

This clashes. Inner conflict is fueled here. The victim hates themselves and is locked in that perspective because of their endured abuse. It's incredibly disorienting. Everything they learned to be true is wrong. And the world is what taught them this. Yet the world also punishes them for trying. The world wants to seem them suffer. At this point, the anger and self hatred builds and bleeds into other realities. In some cases the victim can dissociate into completely different personalities because of this inability to comprehend two opposing ideas at the same time. Part of therapy is to accept things aren't your fault and that can very easily swing into outwards blame upon the world.  

***The anger and self hatred bleeds into other realities of their mind.***

Okay, cool, so we've established that the victims susceptible to becoming murder-suicides may be in an emotional purgatory juggling the dichotomy of two realities trying to control their life. Pretty disorienting, huh. But many experience this without wanting to hurt others, so *what* happens to make them *want* to hurt others? There is a transactional sense of success we tie to our effort. Our self value is separate from our value of effort. Some victims of mental health get help relatively quickly, some never do at all. I think those that want to hurt others initially see value in and seek help. As we all know we can try as hard as we want but ultimately understand the forces at work in the world are going to result in fruitlessness. So at this point, the victim feels awful, knows it's not their fault, and has no solution. Every corner they turn the world punishes them for their efforts to try and get better. Not only this, but they are surrounded by others who chastise them for being different. If they cross the line of feeling the urge, medical care immediately becomes unavailable. Instantly you are dehumanized and feared- nobody will help you. If they so much as mention they want to hurt others, they go straight to the hospital against their will not for rehabilitation, but for removal from society. This alienation, at any point in the process, can cause a myriad problems, and then the world punishes their efforts to try and get better. ***The world punishes them for their efforts to try and get better.***

I think this is the turning point. They are not hopeless and actionless and just 'snap' one day. I think it's a huge buildup of trying to be normal and function properly because the world tells them to. Effort well intended, but ultimately misplaced because the lens of depression distorts the world (hence the 'we never saw this coming' dialogue from family members). But when they try, the world turns around and punishes them for it. No matter what they want, they are a simp to the world. Nothing they desire for matters. Their existence is required but so is their suffering. They are being sadistically used by the world. There are no instructions on how to make it stop. 

I think this is where the anger comes from, even though the end result of suicide is the same as those of us who are nonviolent. It's the added element that your efforts are encouraged *and* punished by the same world. It's hypocrisy that would break anybody into a fragmented shell of a human being. When feeling like shit, we often lean towards acceptance/depression or anger/depression. It's the same energy caused by the same suffering but allocated differently based on our brain's chemistry. The actions taken by these people are an effort to silence the deafening noise which has been installed in their heads. The core idea is something we actually respect. Stand up for yourself right? These people most likely think they are doing that. And if they're going to die, they might as well make sure the world knows that it is not tolerable to treat people in such a way. 


I believe that's the mindset. I don't agree with it. I don't think it's the right thing to do. Even writing this post probably puts my IP on some watchlist. There seems to be a stigma surrounding the discussion of this. If you so much as sympathize with a single person who's committed atrocities you are just as bad as them, apparently. I cannot withstand the attitude of avoidance this country has towards tough topics. But I think the world will keep seeing mass murders unless we understand what the fuck is happening in our heads. Because that's where this comes from. Our heads interpreting our environment. Nobody is born wanting to shoot up a school. Given the same circumstances, I believe we'd see many people fall into the same mindset and take the same actions. The circumstances are just so very specific. We could go into the evidence to support why white males would be the primary demographic of this but, another post maybe. I don't know if I'll live to a point to see this become public understanding and knowledge but I will die for the rights we deserve as a community and as human beings. If we don't change this, then many more innocent people will keep dying.

Thank you for reading. I encourage you to share your experience whether current or past. I wish you love and peace throughout your day.
