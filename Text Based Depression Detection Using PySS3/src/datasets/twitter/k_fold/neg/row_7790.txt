I canâ€™t face daylight. How do I fight this?How do I get up and face the daylight? All I do is sit in my room with the blinds closed and I feel so depressed when I have to open the window and see the daylight. All I want to do is kill myself so I just decide to do nothing all day. What do I do? I want to get better for my friends and family, because I love them. At the same time I just want to vanish of this earth. Can anyone help me? I am currently taking Prozac and feel more suicidal than ever.
