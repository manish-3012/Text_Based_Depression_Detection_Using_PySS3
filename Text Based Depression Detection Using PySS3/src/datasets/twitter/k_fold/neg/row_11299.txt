chronic pain and my life going nowhere. don't want to do this anymore.I've been diagnosed with endometriosis, fibromyalgia, PCOS, and am going to a specialist next month to see if my bladder is fucked up too. I've had to take medical leave from college and have to live with my mom and grandma (because my parents don't currently have a home) in a one bedroom apartment. we go without food some weeks. i can't afford to keep seeing my therapist. i can't afford shampoo. i can't get a job because most days i can't get out of bed, and when i ask my mom for help with stuff she gets mad at me. 

i don't want to be alive anymore. I'm a burden emotionally and financially, i spend every day either in bed or playing video games. i just hate myself and want to die.
