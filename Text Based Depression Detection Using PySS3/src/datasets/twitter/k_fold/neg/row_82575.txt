Need helpI'm at point where i have zero energy and willpower. I don't care about anything and i don't enjoy anything, i'm just in constant pain. I don't even care if i hurt my friends and family when i leave and i don't want anything from life anymore. Now i'm trying my best not to give up until Christmas so i don't ruin holidays for people as well and after that i'm gonna stop eating and drinking because even those things are tiring me. Not sure why i'm even writing this, probably because i'm bored to death and wanna try one last time, but is there a way to bounce off from this?
