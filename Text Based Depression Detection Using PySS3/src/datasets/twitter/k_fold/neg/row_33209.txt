I need helpThis is not about me directly. A girlfriend in another country has had a family member a 19 Yo boy, the son of her sister commit suicide yesterday. 1 year ago the brother of her sister's husband also committed suicide. She herself has told me she has struggled with suicidal thoughts. The whole family is 1 day into this. How do I suggest they all get counseling without sounding like a busy body.
The complexity is we were recconnecting via email after a 7 year absence from each others lives. Making plans to visit and now this.
I don't expect her to answer my emails right now and maybe never.
I am worried about her primarily but I think the whole family may need some counseling now with 2 people in 2 years.
Her sister is a palliative care nurse so she has dealt with loss but this is much different. Her son. For my girlfriend its a bitter loss because she can not have children. Her first email to me said."What did we do that was so bad? ''  I am miles away I knew she would say no but I had to ask if she needed me to come to be there for her. I know she will be there for her sister and the rest of the family but my selfish urge was to want to be there for her. 
I am not sure what to do. I feel like everything we were planning is just over now. Its a big family for her a dozen kids dotted around the country. They will all be getting together now for the worst of all possible reasons. 19 years old and gone. We are much older in our 40's and  mid 50's but still this is going to be a very sad year or two.
Any help with an approach that is appropriate would be appreciated
