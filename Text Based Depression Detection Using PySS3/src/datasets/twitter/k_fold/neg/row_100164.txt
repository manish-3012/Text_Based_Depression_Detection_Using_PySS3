MeditationI have been carefully meditating and I've finally come to to the conclusion that I want to die. Truly, not sure if it's a broke switch in my brain or not, but I'm trying to decide how.

Personally, I would rather be given a large injection of "Belladonna" the pretty lady. Opium mixed with nightshade I believe, should be a helluva trip before my heart stops.

Or perhaps something violent, bloody, gory. All I know is I keep taking the doctors pills and they are robbing me of what little life I feel I have.

Gas bag with helium sounds good too since faking a license to get a firearm seems like a hassle.

Honestly I just want to get away from everyone for a bit, take enough opium so that the hunger doesn't hurt too much, and then od and fade away.

Unless anyone here wants to make a few bucks and shoot me in my home.
