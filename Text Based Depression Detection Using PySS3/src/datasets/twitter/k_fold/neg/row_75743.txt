Epic crisisHello, Iâ€™m in a huge money crisis. I promised someone in my life I would pay them back for something and itâ€™s been over a couple of months since I had to pay them back. They are a good friend of mine but not so good. They are demanding I pay them back 100 dollars. I was currently let down from a job due to a car accident I got into a while ago. They have put me down ever since. Iâ€™m jobless and Iâ€™ve got no where to turn to and this money thing is killing me inside. Iâ€™m a failure.  I donâ€™t have the money at all Iâ€™ve felt guilty asking for friends money so Iâ€™ve come to here. I doubt anyone will actually give me money but itâ€™s worth a try. My friend wonâ€™t take no for an answer and Iâ€™m letting them down big time. Including myself. On top of that I just came out as a trans male with no support and emotional support from my family. Iâ€™m suffering from sever anxiety and PTSD. Iâ€™m in a rut, I feel like I should just go to sleep and ever wake up.  Someone please help me.
