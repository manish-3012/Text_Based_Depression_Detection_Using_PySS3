[XPost] My dog's only thing keeping me aliveI'd kill myself if I could, my dog is only reason I can't do this. I tried everything. Drugs from psychiatrist, amphetamine, lsd, 4-ho-mipt, weed, alcohol, nothing can silence my suicidal thoughts and depression. I'm crying a lot, cutting myself, I feel like nothing can help me.
