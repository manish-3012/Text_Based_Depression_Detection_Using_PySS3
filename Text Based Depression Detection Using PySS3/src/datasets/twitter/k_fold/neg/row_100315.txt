I've lost myselfDepression, anxiety, mental illness, eating disorders. It's all been adding up for a while. I've suffered from a number of issues, but I've always tried to make things the best they can be, not only for myself, but my loved ones too. The problem is, the things I've gone through have made me quite easy to exploit. After leaving an emotionally abusive relationship recently, and having a chance to reflect on it all, it's becoming too much for me. I tried cutting my wrists last night but I couldn't manage to do it properly. I've lost who I am. I should be becoming a father in 5 months but she won't let me even see my child. It's all too much, I feel like I'm drowning.
