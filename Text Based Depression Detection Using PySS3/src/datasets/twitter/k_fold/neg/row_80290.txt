Never Ending Cycle =\This is probably the third time I've posted to this subreddit.  As with my reaching out here, I am starting to feel guilty for constantly being a downer to those I know irl.  I feel like the boy who cried "Wolf."  I'm simply not feeling better at all, even with the meds.  Each time I reach out for help I feel more guilty for doing so than the last time, because I feel like people will start to view me as just some attention whore or something.  Maybe I am &amp; I don't realize it.  I do know though that everytime I reach out it gets harder &amp; harder.  How can I overcome at least that?
