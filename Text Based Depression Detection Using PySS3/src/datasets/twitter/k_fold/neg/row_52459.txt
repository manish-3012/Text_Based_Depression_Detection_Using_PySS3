How do I luv weigh the guilt ?When I was at my lowest, 15 i got a rabbit called Peanut. He was up for adoption he had these big scary eyes he was a rex 

I kind of bonded with him. I 

think we both felt very alone. He gave me so much comfort and love I gave him nothing in return. His hutch was too small, I didnâ€™t clean it regularly. I should have done more. 


At exam prep season, I kind of forgot about him. I didnâ€™t feed him properly I didnâ€™t realise how fast heâ€™d starve. One day I took him out to get some grass and he fell he was too weak. 

I had to take him to the vets I remember thinking itâ€™s going to be okay on the car there. He passed away but euthanisa and I wasnâ€™t even there with him I was a coward. I should have been there in him last moments... he gave me so much I feel so bad 

I mean I cried for 3 months non stop, I woke up crying I want to sleep crying. Iâ€™m not exaggerating Iâ€™m crying now... something triggered the pain. 

I know I made mistakes. I have two Guinea pigs now they free roam I give them the best food and care. I love them but the death of peanut haunts me, the guilt.. i dont really eat anymore because of the guilt that if he starved so should I 

I canâ€™t get to a place where I deal with it healthily.. itâ€™s been two years I think itâ€™s time I seek some advice

I honestly feel like it eats away a little bit more everyday, and I believe in a eye for a eye. I feel like I have to kill myself to make up for what happened
