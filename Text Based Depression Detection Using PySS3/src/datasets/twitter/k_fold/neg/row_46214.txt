Completely desperate, nowhere to turn, everything to lose. I'm this close to ending everything.So I'm 22 years old, Female. Lost my job (waitress) recently due to an injury (well, due to a lack of compassion from my employer) and now work as a Christmas temp in retail, working 4 hours a week for next to nothing (not being paid until Christmas Eve).
I've had no stable income since September, due to my injury and sick pay and everything. I'm now down to my last pennies and have no money for rent, which is due tomorrow. I've considered everything, porn, even sleeping with random people for money. I'm desperate. I'm over 2k in debt now and to be honest, I might end it tonight if I can't think of a solution. I've got no one close who cares enough about me. My parents live 5 hours away and my boyfriend is no help other than "it'll be okay". I have no friends, no prospects, nothing. I've got nothing. 
I'd appreciate some kind of solution, but if not, thanks for the laughs reddit. Thanks for everything.
