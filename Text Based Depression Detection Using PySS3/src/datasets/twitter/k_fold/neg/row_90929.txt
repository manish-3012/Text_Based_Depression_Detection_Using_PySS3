I dont know what to do please help meI was molested by my father when i was 4 years old in portugal, where i lived at the time, he was a drug dealer but mt mom didnt know that and after my mom divorced him he tried killing her and my grandparents multiple times, me and my mom managed to flee away from him to brasil, now im 14 years old and i need help.
I live in a very abusive home, whenever i try to talk to my mom about my problems and that i need professional help she tells me to shrug it off and that its temporary, that is all just a phase, and always try to shift the blame to me, sometimes she says that she is going to get me a therapistbut never actually does it, she promised me that over a year and a half ago, i love her very much for what she did to me, she saved me but i cant take this anymore.

My grandpa cheated on my grandma several times, but always accused her of doing it, he treated my mom and  grandma like trash beating them and belittling them whenever he could, but always treated my moms brother and sister the best he could,  my grandpa and grandma still live in portugal but they visit me and my mom every year, when he isnt with me in brasil he abuses my grandma mentally abd treats her like trash, when hes here he treats me and my mom like trash also, he says that he wants to see me happy and that he wants to be a father figure to me, i admit he changed a lot, and that he tries to change, but its not enough, just today he started shouting at me and threatening to hit me, saying he would destroy my face, all of that just because i took a little time to open the car door to get out because i had to take a bag that was in my feet, i begged for him to stop shouting at me but i just got worse after that, he legit tried to punch me and neither my mom or grandma did anything, they both shifted the blame to me saying i tried to challenge him.

My grandma suffered a lot because of him, and i understand that, the problem is, she always shifts the blame to me and guilttrips me saying she will kill herself, and im scared of that because i know she will do that, because she did, me and my grandpa hot out of tha house for a walk and my grandma stayed, after some time we come back and knock on the door, no response, after 3 hours we get in the house and she says that she was sleeping, a year after my mom tells me that she took 25 pills and tried to kill herself that day.

Im in a bad place because i want to kill myself because im not happy and dont know how ti be happy, because i cant take all of this anymore, because im not sure im gonna have a future, if im honna have a job or a girl that loves me, im a failure at school and at everything, i want to kill myself so they can see the consequences of their actions.

But i also cant bring myself to doing it because i dont want them to see my body and know that i killed myself, because i know that if i died my mom would kill herself too and my grandma too, also i dont want my 2 dogs and 3 cats to wonder i didnt come back home and why im not there with them, i dont want my few friends to be alone.

Im planning on committing suicide in a few hours, i have an exacto knife in my hands and plenty of pills that i can use but i dont know if i should do it help me please.
