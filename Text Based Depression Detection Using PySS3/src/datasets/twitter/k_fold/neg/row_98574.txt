iâ€™m so fucking tired.i work my ass off so i can barely afford to eat after i pay the rest of my bills. i have animals that i forget to feed because i get too depressed. my 2 friends have their own lives and specifically told me they shouldnâ€™t be my reason to live. i refuse to make plans more than a month ahead because i know that iâ€™m going to break soon. i canâ€™t talk to anyone because i just feel annoying. i donâ€™t want to be alive. i donâ€™t remember a time where i have felt truly happy. i remember self harming when i was in 1st grade. i know exactly how i want to do it. itâ€™s just a matter of when. and honestly, itâ€™s coming really soon.
