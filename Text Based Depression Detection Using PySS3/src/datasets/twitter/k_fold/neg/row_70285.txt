I'm not scared and I'm not okay with thatI've tried and failed to kill myself once. Sent my friends and family texts saying I was sorry. They called the cops and I was put in the hospital. I lied through my fucking teeth and they let me go in less than a day. On that day, I was VERY okay with finally doing it. I still feel it. Constantly creeping up on me. It doesn't scare me. 
I've been depressed for fucking years. Back in the day, I didn't really get it. I thought I was just being a bitch. Later I learned it runs in the family and hit me like a fucking truck. I'm the type of guy that plasters a fat smile on my face and pretends I'm the happiest mother fucker alive. Telling jokes, making everyone laugh. So fucking happy. 
I don't want to be here anymore. I'm not scared. I have this feeling that I'll keep going further and further down until I just give up completely. I've accepted that I will. Every few days I hit bottom after I try to stay happy. And I hit harder every time. 
I don't know want to be here. Nobody else I know really gets it so it's hard to talk about. 
I'm sorry to everyone. Maybe this is my last cry for help. Help from internet strangers that might know what the fuck I'm talking about.
