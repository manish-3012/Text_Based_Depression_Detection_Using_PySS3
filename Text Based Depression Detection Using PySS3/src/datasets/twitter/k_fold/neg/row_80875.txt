Ran away, living on the streets, wishing I was dead.My stepfather got really angry at me the other day and was shouting at me. It scared me and freaked me out and so I've gotten to my car and I left. This was on Friday and I've been sleeping in my car since then. He scares me he reminds me of my father who had a horrible temper and would often yell insult threaten and occasionally hit me. 

I have no plans of returning back home. Last night I called The Suicide Prevention hotline because I just felt like the chances of me killing myself were high. I still feel like dying. I don't know what to do I certainly don't want to go home and face everything there.
