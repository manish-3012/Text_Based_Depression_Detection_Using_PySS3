Severe anxiety and passive suicidal thoughtsHey all, I've really struggling with passive suicidal ideation recently.
For the past year and a half, I've been trying to cope with severe anxiety issues. The anxiety problems appeared out of nowhere one day, and since then I've been bouncing from medication to medication with very little success. If I'm lucky, an antidepressant/anti-anxiety medication might work for a bit, perhaps anywhere from two weeks to a month, but the medications always seem to stop working, and the anxiety and depression return. I'm terrified I'll never find a medication that works, and that my life will always be an unrelenting hell of anxiety.
I'm just so tired of fighting, and I realized that if I had no immediate family, no boyfriend, no dog, basically, if I had no one who cared about me, I'd kill myself in an instant. I don't like myself, so I couldn't live for just me, and non-exsistence would be so very preferable to going through life in a haze and trying to ward off panic attacks. The thing of it is, I can't help but think it would be so goddamn easy, just take some pills, go to sleep, and never wake up again. 
As it is, I occasionally self-harm when I'm in a severe anxiety attack. As an adult, it seems like an incredibly stupid, immature thing to do, but I often feel a compulsion to punish myself for being an awful human being, and the pain can help me focus in an anxiety attack. 
The other vastly discouraging thing is, I have Asperger's Syndrome, and I do work part time, but I'm on social security income and have Medicaid as my health insurance. It seems that mental health care is considered a non-essential service by a lot of Medicaid insurance policies, and the few mental health resources that do take my insurance in my area are underfunded and overworked. I pay out of pocket with the psychiatrist I currently see, and I'm not seeing any sort of therapist or psychologist because I haven't been able to find one who will take my insurance. I honestly lack the will to keep looking for help, so I just feel as though I'm stuck in a sort of limbo. 
So yeah, I'm not going to attempt to die, I just want to die, because I feel like I've run out of hope and options.
