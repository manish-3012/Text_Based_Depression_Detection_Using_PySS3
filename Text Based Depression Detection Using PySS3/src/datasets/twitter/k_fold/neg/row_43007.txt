Wallahi (swear to God) there is hope for you allAssalamulaikum everyone 
Im a 20 year old guy who got severely depressed during the first semester of college but somehow managed to pass 3/4 courses and decided to take break for the next semester so that i can be 100% well before i get back to my studies.

Imo all you need to get well is see a good therapist,time,hangout with ur friends or got out more often instead of sitting at home and overthinking,good sleep,stop taking drugs and Stop listening to depressing and sad music/songs(listen to young thug and little wayne instead).

Its true that no one cares about you except your family so stop saying that "They only care when your gone" and that shit.

Some of the guys/girls are like "I m ugly","No one loves me"n all. At some point in life you will get someone as BEAUTIFUL as you so stop stop worrying about it.

Its not that depression is incurable so stop worrying and take your time, take break from work/studies and see a therapist.
It will take time but i guarantee you it gets better. Im a living example. I too thought of killing myslef n all but im glad i didn't. 

You came into this world alone and will leave alone so stay strong.
