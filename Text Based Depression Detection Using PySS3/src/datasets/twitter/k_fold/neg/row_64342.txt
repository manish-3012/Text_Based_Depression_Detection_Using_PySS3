The inevitable.I've resolved myself to suicide. Not today, probably not tomorrow, but one day soon. I think about it everyday, many times a day. It is a soothing thought to me - the knowledge that I can end it all.

My life is a series of bad decisions and mistakes. I have nothing to offer anyone. I'm broke and miserable and a burden to everyone around me. I am 25 years old, morbidly obese, ugly, $80,000+ in debt and I am completely fucking useless.

I have no job and no prospects. I have two college degrees that are completely useless and a waste of time and money because I never did anything to build a resume. I graduated law school in May and passed the bar in July. Literally hundreds of job applications later and I have had one interview. I am completely out of money and have nowhere to go. My family cannot help me, and they shouldn't have to because I'm an adult and should be able to handle my own shit, so I am maxing out credit cards to just survive.

I have no friends. I try to reach out to people I know and no one returns calls or messages. My "best friend" in NY never talks to me - I've sent her multiple cards and letters and texts and calls and the last time I heard from her was 3 months ago.

I feel terribly alone and useless. I'm miserable and fat and disgusting. I just want everything to end. I just want to disappear. I wish I had never existed.
