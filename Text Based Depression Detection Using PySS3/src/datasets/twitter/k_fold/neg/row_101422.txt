I think April is my time to goThis is it. Iâ€™m too tired to carry on. Someone please show they love me or even care this month because Iâ€™m tired of doing all the work. iâ€™m tired of giving it all i got for everything and everyone..and in return feeling like no one gives a shit. I am absolutely super exhausted..like seeing me on Friday is a chore. An â€œoh alright...fine maybe friday tooâ€...kinda crap. iâ€™m absolutely done with feeling like shit.
