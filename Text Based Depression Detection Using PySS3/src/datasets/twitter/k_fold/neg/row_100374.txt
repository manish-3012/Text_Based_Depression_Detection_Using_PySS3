I binged again. I am so tired.Hi everyone. I just wanted to make a post, I am not sure why, I guess just to tell my feelings as I am lying In the dark in silent tears after sneaking downstairs into the kitchen and gorging on bread, jam, anything I could lay my hands on only to immediately be greeted once more with those feelings of utter shame and disgust of what I have just done. I never recovered from anorexia, but now I am in a cycle of binging also, I am a paradox, a disappointment. I have broken every rule that I had followed so closely and destroyed everything, my relationships with my friends and family to be now left with none and totally alone. It has been 7 years since this began hideous battle with food, my body, my ugliness destroyed everything in its path to leave me as a shell of a human. I am tired. I am so tired. Just leave me in this blanket and please let me sleep. Sleep will take the pain away.
