Painless methodFor around 2 years Iâ€™ve been struggling with chronic headaches, and now Iâ€™ve started to get shooting pains in my face and arms. Iâ€™ve been to the doctors countless times and they tell me that itâ€™s basically all in my head. I suffer with bad anxiety so they probably think that Iâ€™m making it up. 

I canâ€™t take this pain anymore I often sit and think back to when I used to be pain free, and watch everyone else enjoying their lives without a chronic pain problem. 

Iâ€™ve been reading into my symptoms a lot over this time and Iâ€™m about 95% sure I have multiple sclerosis. 

Now I donâ€™t want to die I was looking forward to doing so many things and visiting a lot of different places, but I cannot take this pain anymore. I spend so much time indoors because I always feel like shit, I always get told I look miserable because Iâ€™m always in pain.

What would be the best way to kill myself? Iâ€™ve been thinking about taking a large dose of ketamine with a rope round my neck attached to something solid and just waiting for the rest to happen. I really donâ€™t want to die but I think itâ€™s the only thing left for me to do as every day is physically painful. 

Iâ€™m also very worried about what happens after death it really isnâ€™t something I want to do.
