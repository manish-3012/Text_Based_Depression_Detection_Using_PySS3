I've Given Up.It's been around a year and a half since I attempted suicide, I was fine, just had quite a lot of pain. My mental health was great afterwards, I realised that I did want to live.

That has changed, over the last few weeks I'm gradually feeling worse and worse and I've decided I'm making another attempt tonight. I've had a great Christmas and I've been able to see my family, but I'm too tired now; I've had enough.
