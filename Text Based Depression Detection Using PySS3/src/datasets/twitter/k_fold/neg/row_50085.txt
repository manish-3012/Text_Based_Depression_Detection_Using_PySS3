I'm so fucking lonely and unwanted, don't see a reason to stay anymore. It's been 10 years of this now and I don't see it changingI'm a horribel person. We all make mistakes but mine are never forgiven because no one knows me and sees the good in me. I've got rxtremly few friends and the ones I do have have fucked me over as long as I can remember. Can't do anything like a normal person without getting anxiety or crying. I hate myself to a depth I didn't think was possible. Just when I think it's getting better it all falls apart again even worse than before. I don't know why I'm here.
