Why is being suicidal considered a "mental illness"?I'd be put away if anyone knew I was suicidal. Here's the deal, though: I don't have a family. I grew up being tortured by my family and have deep, painful, lifelong scars from that. I have no friends. I'm being bullied and tormented at my job, and I can't just quit because I'd be homeless since employees have no protections in the US.

So it's like ... objectively, things are really quite horrible. And considering I've never even experienced what love or kindness is for the most part, I think it's pretty reasonable to think I'd want to kill myself. A lifetime of pain. Not knowing much good in the world. Being completely, legitimately alone. I think any rational person would want to kill themselves in this situation.

So why does society have such a hard-on for calling this "mental illness"? Can people really not fathom how hard life can be, and that it might not always work out for some people?
