The belt buckle couldn't support my weight.I've tried partial suspension for almost a year now.

Always trying to get used to the idea of hanging myself so that suicide doesn't seem as daunting if I fully go through with it.

I used a belt with those clips you could squeeze to release.

I'd hang myself with it while standing on a chair until I break down or realise how dumb I was being.

The clips always held so I figured, today I'd try taking my feet off the chair.

I had one hand at the clip so I can release myself once I've had enough.

I barely hung for a couple of seconds before the clip gave without me needing to press it.

On the one hand, I was terrified that I actually took my feet off the chair, even if I wasn't going to go through with it completely.

But on the other, I'm worried that this means I'll need a proper noose next time, and I think my stupidity might finally kill me if I keep this up.

I just want peace.
