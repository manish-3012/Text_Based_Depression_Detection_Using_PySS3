Suicide PlanOn a throwaway account cause I canâ€™t find it in myself to post on my main acc. Probably the only time Iâ€™ll post here anyway.

I could write a whole books worth of stuff here but thereâ€™s really not anytime to explain. 

Iâ€™ve set certain intervals of time for when I will more than likely end up attempting suicide, and Im planning it out day by day. Iâ€™m giving myself 3 years to see any kind of change and if not then Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™ll kick the bucket.

I canâ€™t explain what I feel, my life isnâ€™t inherently bad, Iâ€™m in good health, but mentally I just canâ€™t find anything good in myself. I beat myself down constantly, and no one in the world cares at all.

Im saying all this on here now cause I refuse to open up to anyone. I no longer expect anything good or bad to happen, I just go through motions. I donâ€™t tell anyone how I feel, I hold in everything because I hate appearing weak even though I am

Iâ€™m trying so hard to be a â€œmanâ€ and I try so hard to be stoic and void my feelings and it just eats at my soul. None of my friends give a shit about me, and I donâ€™t know anyone irl, I know one girl but every time I tried to talk to her she gave me the same advice I always hear â€œI understandâ€ or â€œItâ€™ll get betterâ€ which basically just means nothing. She has a boyfriend but sometimes I take her out just to have some kind of meaningful interaction with someone but sheâ€™s normally on her phone and Im a blabbering idiot with nothing to offer.

I just wish instead of â€œI understandâ€ someone would just for would instead just try and lend a hand, meet me, talk with me, ask me about my day, but nope. 

This where suicide becomes so tantalizing to me because this world is so disconnected and shit and Iâ€™m caught in the middle of it and no one would care if I left it. People will never say anything to your face but the moment you die theyâ€™ll go on about â€œoh he was such a great guyâ€ just to be sycophants and post about it on their social media to look like a good person. Iâ€™m invisible to everyone but thatâ€™s the price we pay for existing. 

I really want it to get better, I have will somewhere in me, I just have no light to follow. 

I really hope it doesnâ€™t come to taking myself out but it very well might.
