Aren't we all just going to die anyway?I feel numb. I've always been depressed and casually suicidal, but now I'm just numb. Nothing feels right and I've been thinking about killing myself again. I got to thinking, even if I was happy, wouldn't killing myself just speed up what's coming? Why would I want things to get better if it's just going to make it that much more painful, and hurt more people when I pass naturally? I truly don't understand why people try to convince strangers to live for no reason anymore. I can understand not wanting to lose a loved one, but to some extent, even that seems pointless and a bit selfish. I don't know what's going on with me, but I feel like now I'm basically just waiting for the day I stop fearing death at this point. That way I can end things on my own terms.
