Pills before sleepFor the past week or so iâ€™ve been taking random pills i can find before sleeping in hope that i donâ€™t wake up. yesterday i took 800mg of propranolol and felt like i was on the verge of death. gonna take the rest of my pills tonight (about 1200mg) hopefully that will do the trick :)
