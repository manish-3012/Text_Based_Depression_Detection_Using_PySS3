GoodbyeI'm so tired of being alive. I bought some pills and plan to overdose after I go on one last road trip. I don't really know why I'm posting this because I won't be checking back in here. I guess I just want to tell my story before I leave. It started back a year ago during my third year at medical school. I came to terms that I was transgender and at the same time burned out of school. For the past year I've been dealing with depression, gender dysphoria, non-supportive family, and financial issues. Long story short, I'm in $120k student debt with no future prospects, never going to pass as my desired gender, and with no friends or any hope that I'll ever be happy. Maybe if I were a stronger person I could have made it through this. Maybe if I were luckier, smarter, or with more resources. Maybe if I got the right support at the right time. But there's no place for weak and lazy people like me in this world. Maybe its the depression speaking to me, but I'm just so tired of it all. I hope the future can be a kinder brighter place for the people that have to stay and soldier on. Be good to one another. Goodbye.
