So Iâ€™m having suicide impulses come out of nowhere...but itâ€™s not like it usually is.Hey everybody, so Iâ€™ve posted a couple times here in my lows. But Iâ€™ve been weirdly suicidal and am just wondering what this is, is it dangerous, and should I go talk to someone about this specifically? 

So usually when I start thinking about suicide itâ€™s like...an infatuation. Itâ€™s all I think about, I research the hell out of the way I want to attempt, I isolate myself, i start smoking pot constantly because itâ€™s the only thing the helps with the panics attacks, I skip class, I self harm to try and stop the thoughts of killing myself, itâ€™s a whole thing... 

But recently itâ€™s been different. Iâ€™m doing a lot better but sometimes I just get a strong impulse to kill myself with something in the environment at the time. 

For example:

I was working out at my gym last night and thereâ€™s a balcony in the gym...and where I was was 20 stories up. Randomly I just had the sudden urge to jump off. And I couldnâ€™t shake it for like 10 minutes. 

Sometimes when Iâ€™m driving Iâ€™ll have the sudden urge just to open my door at 70mph and jump from my truck to the opposite lane of traffic. 

Today I went target shooting with my buddy. I was loading my revolver and had this sudden urge to turn it on myself and blow my head off....and idk why but I never have wanted to die by gunshot. Like the thought of the feeling of your skull getting taken off and feeling that just really discomforts me (Iâ€™m way more of a noose or benzos guy). Iâ€™ve tried to make plans involving my guns before but I really really dislike the idea of dying that way. So why the change now?
