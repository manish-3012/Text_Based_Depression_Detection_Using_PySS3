I feel like if I killed myself nobody would care or hold a big memorial. They would just see it on the news and say, "Huh, I figured he had done it years ago."I'm in my 20's, don't have a driver's license, didn't finish college and don't have a job. I provide for no one and have so many health problems because I've been a fat tub of shit my whole life. I live at home and just wonder why I bother living. I am of benefit to no one. I seem like I'm happy and funny to everyone but inside I just want to end it all, honestly the only reason I haven't already is that I don't want my little brother to deal with that.

I hate myself and spent 5 minutes punching myself in the stomach today as hard as I could. My mom reminds me how useless I am every time she's stressed about something so it just cements how I'm a waste of resources to this Earth. Kids with Autism have accomplished more on this planet than I have, I know because one of my mom's friends has an autistic son younger than me who's done better in life.

I won't bother with a throwaway because I don't give a fuck if somebody wants to go through my history.

I just don't know what to do and wanted to get this off my chest, since nobody would understand in my real life.
