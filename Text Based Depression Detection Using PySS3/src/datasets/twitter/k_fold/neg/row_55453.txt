Rather be dead than a failure.25 years old. 0 life experiences, 0 friends, 0 hope. I should graduate college in a year or so, but I donâ€™t even see myself making it a week, let alone a year. And whatâ€™s the point when your brain is beyond fucked that you canâ€™t hold a simple conversation. Nothing matters anymore. No one will miss me or realize Iâ€™m dead anyway. Fuck it
