I wish people didnt care about me so i could kill myselfmy whole life is just a bunch of dead ends with no way out. it sucks living everyday knowing that my life cant go anywhere that will make me happy and itd be so nice just to die, but i have genuinely good friends and parents who care so i could never bring myself to, and thats become really frustrating.
