Want to die again after so long of being okayRecently I have had a massive slump I havnt really thought about sicucde much recently till this week, thus week I have tho8ght about just fucking killing myself like 3 times and was so close to doing it I have been self harm free for ages but I have started again, I have counselling tommror9w and I don't know whether to tell him everything or just keep all this shit to myself I don't want to tell any of my friend or my boyfriend what's going in because I don't want to hurt them and I don't want them being sad because of me and I don't want my counsellor to know because if he tells my parents it won't go well I am lost
