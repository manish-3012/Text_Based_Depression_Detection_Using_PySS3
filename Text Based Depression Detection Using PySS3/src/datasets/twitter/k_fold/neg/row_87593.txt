I dont know what to doIm a kid.
I suffer from depression, anxiety and chronoc migraines.
Each time i cry, a fucking migraine pops in. Its like i cant fucking cry at all, which means i cant let it off.
This burden i had carried for 3 months has now come back to haunt me. And is it bad.
I can't cry in my house, because all the time my parents and brother just yell at me to shut up.
I also have serious suicidal thoughts. Probably gonna end it tommorow or some shit. Any ways i can do it? I dont have rope, medication or guns in my house.
Sorry i really just needed to vent.
