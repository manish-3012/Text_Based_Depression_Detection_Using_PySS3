I think I'm finally ready to go...This has been a decision that I've struggled with for a few months now, and I'm fighting back tears writing notes to my family who have kept me here for so long.

I'm socially isolated, I have one friend who I only speak to when he needs something - ever since I left school, I've had no friends. Everyone I work with is 3x my age and I can't change jobs, to top it off, I'm gay and closeted - it's something I've been struggling with forever, I've never had a real relationship or any experiences that a normal 19 year old would have had.

I'm not worried about dying or the pain it might cause me, I am only worried about my family - my little siblings and my parents who I know will be distraught, but however selfish it may be, I think this is best.

Thank you for hearing me out Reddit, even though I may no longer be around.
