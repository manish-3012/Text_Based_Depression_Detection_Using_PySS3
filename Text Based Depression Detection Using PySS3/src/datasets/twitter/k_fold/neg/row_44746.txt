Is there a way I can tell my therapist that I'm suicidal WITHOUT getting sent to a hospital/mental asylum?I have been seeing a therapist for a week now, and I want to tell her I've been experiencing suicidal thoughts recently (I've been close to actually doing it numerous times; I sat on the edge of a 7-story building last week), but I also don't *want* to be hospitalized. Especially because I'm in the US.

Is there any possible way I can spill the beans to my therapist about these intrusive thoughts without facing a mountain of bills?
