I can't function anymoreI've never posted in a suicide forum or called into a hotline before but I've been mildly suicidal, done self harm and have been majorly depressed I'd say my whole life. I've tried so many medications and therapy to no avail and gave up after my early twenties. I'm now 29 and after watching my mom pass away from Huntingtons Disease and knowing I might have the disease and that my sister whom I love dearly will soon become symptomatic in less than 10 years... I just ran out of energy to keep up a facade I have done since elementary school. I just can't even pretend to care about daily life anymore. My relationship is done.. all the crying and lying about drinking just to numb myself lately. I can't do my job, I don't care about anything I used to like for at least the past 5 years.. it's all just to keep going for no reason. If therapy and pills don't work what's the point. To be miserable until I see my sister die horribly and possibly die from Huntingtons myself Why?
