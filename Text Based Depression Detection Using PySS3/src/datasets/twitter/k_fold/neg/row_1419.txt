I should be happy, yet I wish to die.Emotions, sadness,... it's too much. I'm really tired of this...
I want to die, but I can't, since there's no way for me to do so right now... maybe if I get past high school and live alone, then I have a plan for that..
I'm guilty for wasting my parents effort. I want to end my life earlier so they waste less on me. 
Life, everything, is a challenge, everything is sadness.
Happiness is a small tease, it's a rare, short, moment. Then sadness and pain comes after.
"No one cares" "Please shut up" I tell myself. Yeah. I know, no one really really cares. But... writing it out, on reddit, on some, new account, makes me feel slightly better. For maybe an hour. 
I know, I know I am hopeless. 
I'm seriously tired of life, I've been walking though the sad reality for months.. I wish it could end. I need it to end... this pain and sadness. I cannot bare it, I'm too weak...
I wish someone would invite me to some double suicide thing.
Or, just get shot in the head accidentally somehow.
I did try to make things better, I did try, but that was the mistake.
You're not supposed to try to make things better, because you will end up in disappointment... and more sadness.
I will keep in mind to not to expect much by posting here. 
... please.. I wish I wasn't born.
