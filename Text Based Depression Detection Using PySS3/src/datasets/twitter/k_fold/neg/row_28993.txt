Failing a class while on academic probation, I feel utterly hopeless. I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m at the end of my rope. Iâ€™m a 21 female year old university student and my university career has been an utter failure so far. I have ADHD, but I canâ€™t take any stimulants because the crash from them makes me too morose to function. My first year, I was in a great books programme- I loved it, but unfortunately I got very depressed towards the end and ended up getting an ILL. I took time off from school, took classes at a local university near my home (didnâ€™t go stellar in a couple classes there either), and was accepted back at my original university. Iâ€™m doing average in the rest of my classes, but I just found out that I will undoubtedly fail one of the classes Iâ€™m in. I missed a test, immediately emailed the professor to schedule a retake (one is allowed), and did not hear back from her- or so I thought. Iâ€™m such a scatterbrained idiot that I missed her email for an entire week-DESPITE CHECKING FOR IT- and emailed her back a week ago asking if I could retake it. I heard nothing back until today, when I emailed her asking if she received my email. She told me she would not allow me to retake the test because I had â€œconsistently failedâ€ to respond to her emails even though she hadnâ€™t responded to mine for a week. I also found out I missed an assignment for that class. There are four assignments total. I am going to fail this class and probably be kicked out of university. I donâ€™t know what to do- I had such big dreams and so much potential but Iâ€™ve ruined it all. Iâ€™m Catholic and I donâ€™t believe in suicide, but I see no other option going forward right now. I donâ€™t know what to do. I just cut myself for the first time in my life.

Sorry for the wall of text but Iâ€™m too ashamed to tell anyone else this. I know what Iâ€™ve done wrong but I donâ€™t know how to fix it
