My death would open so many opportunities for my familyMy wife would be able to pay off her debts. Her bank account wouldnâ€™t be negative anymore. Sheâ€™d be able to afford to take the kids on vacations and live a life I couldnâ€™t bring them. I wouldnâ€™t be in pain anymore. People live with parents and loved ones killing themselves. All the time, so they would move past it and me. I really see no downside at this point. I could just take my gun, find a nice quiet spot in the woods, let the cops know where to find my body, and end it all
