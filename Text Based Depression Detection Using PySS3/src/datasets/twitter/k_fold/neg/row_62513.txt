Didn't takeI tried last night, but it didn't take. I kept bleeding and bleeding, but after about 20 minutes the bleeding stopped, and I was too woozy and my blood was pumping too hard and I couldn't put in the effort to cut more. I think I lost like... probably almost a liter? It was a hell of a lot. It's 20 hours later now and I'm still very woozy and tingly in places especially when I like, when I cross my legs.

I've been drinking a lot of water and some gatorade and I've been eating some food but is there something better for me to be eating or drinking?

I still don't want to live but I'm too out of it to do anything about it at this point. I did make an appointment with my therapist and I'm going to talk to her about it so don't worry about that. I just keep thinking back to the feeling of losing all that blood, watching it fill the tub, and just feeling so calm. It was like I was finally coming home. I know this isn't the best kind of post for this subreddit but yeah. I'm kind of mad at myself for not being able to do it all the way but I can't feel much of anything right now.

Don't worry right now I am safe, just... food? drink? there has to be something better I can do to get less woozy. I don't want to go to the hospital because they're going to lock me up again and I'd rather be at home with my roommates. I feel safer with them around.
