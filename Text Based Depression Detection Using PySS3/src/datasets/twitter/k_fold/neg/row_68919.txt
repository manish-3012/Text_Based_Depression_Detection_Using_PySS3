Impulses are out of control and I plan to exploit themI have BPD and the impulsivity and suicidal thoughts are currently kicking my ass. Iâ€™ve never had a real suicide plan: just a preferred method. Iâ€™ve had a love/hate relationship with heroin and an overdose has always seemed like a wonderful way to go. Sleep to oblivion as you stop breathing. But that doesnâ€™t tend to be an impulsive way to go and opiates make me so numb I just want them, not death. So recently, Iâ€™ve been wanting to own a gun. That way when impulsivity strikes, I can just reach out and pull the trigger and go. So thatâ€™s my plan now. Walk outside and give it a shot.
