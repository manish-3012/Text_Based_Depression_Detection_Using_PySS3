Close to the edgeThe constant and monotone-esc phrases of "It'll get better" are starting to do nothing. Just the same lies spewed at me. And nobody brings up actual evidence to disprove the fact that my death wouldn't mean anything in the grand scheme of the world and the people around me. I'm supposed to be a faint life that just dies. It's like, going back to what I was supposed to be. Nothing. Nonexistent.

And I just need to get the courage and willpower to grab that knife and cut deep, deep, deep into my body.

Red and all.

And I feel like- I KNOW, that I'm close to the edge.
