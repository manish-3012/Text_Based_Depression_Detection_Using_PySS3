2 yearsIt's been 2 years since I last tried to kill myself. I'd like to say I'm pretty damn proud too. No self harm, no attempts, no problem. 

It's also been 2 years since I last felt whole. Since I felt actual, meaningful happiness. Since I was last touched by another person. Since I did more than just survive. 

Maybe I should have taken more pills or cut a little deeper. Maybe I did and this is actually my hell. A place so void of any emotion or attachment. 

I can't sleep. I can't stop eating til I make myself sick. Which is why I hate myself. For getting so big. For having no control. 

Maybe I won't kill myself very soon, but it sounds so nice. No shame, no pressures, no painful emptiness. 

I know I have so much going for me. I know I have family who love and adore me. But I can't be the best me for them anymore. 

Thanks for reading this. I'll live another day. Maybe another after that. I'll exist. I'll be here physically. But the real me seems long gone.
