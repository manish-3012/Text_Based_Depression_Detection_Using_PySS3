i keep disconnecting from people and it makes me sickso this is my (F20) very first reddit post and iâ€™m sorry in advance bc my english isnâ€™t perfect. iâ€˜m not exactly suicidal, have that behind me already since i realized that iâ€˜m too cowardly to kill myself anyway. i just feel extremely apathetic and tired of being alive. energy level is running pretty low all the time for years now. iâ€™m also struggling with severe depression which started when i was around 10 or something. there were many things that went wrong since childhood. i tried so many things over the last couple years like therapies and stuff but i managed improving my lifestyle mostly by myself, i donâ€˜t have a hard time leaving my apartment and seeing people regularly anymore, i take my vitamins, eat healthy, drink a lot of water, exercise, take much more time for my passions etc. i guess for the people around me i seem kinda light-hearted most of the time bc iâ€˜m usually laughing about everything, joking around and being super laid-back outwardly. iâ€˜ve got everything i need and cut out all the toxic people over the past few years, only got friends and family members around me who are really caring and supportive. all in all i should say iâ€˜m relatively doing well for the first time in my life. but despite the fact that iâ€˜m so exhausted 24/7 without any particular reason, i can also feel myself disconnecting from everyone more and more. iâ€™m experiencing this as long as i can remember and itâ€˜s always been increasing as time flies by but currently itâ€™s insanely overpowering and slowly taking my will to live. iâ€™m so lost. i donâ€™t feel any significant emotion towards others anymore like iâ€™m completely dead inside. iâ€™ve always had the feeling that every interpersonally relationship in my life was kind of trivial no matter how intimate it probably got, but now i really feel like a ghost wandering around and nobody actually can see me. i know that people connect with me but iâ€˜m not able to connect with anyone. like i said iâ€™m not suicidal atm but every time i go out i think if iâ€™d accidentally die or whatever it would be fine bc thereâ€™s nothing left here for me. i sure am kinda lonely even though i enjoy being alone, i just wish i could have someone in my life who i can really get close to and connect with since iâ€˜ve never had that for real. itâ€™s a heavy burden for me and after 20 years of that shit i donâ€˜t know what to do anymore. thanks for reading it all.
