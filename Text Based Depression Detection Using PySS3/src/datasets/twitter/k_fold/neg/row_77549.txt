It would be nice!.I don't know how to start this off. But I've always felt out of place. Not belonging into this world, most people just don't like me. Or think I'm just a nobody and I honestly do feel like a nobody at most times. People don't treat me with respect at all. I just get looked down upon, literally!. I feel like an outkast. It Just would be nice if someone cared about me for once.
