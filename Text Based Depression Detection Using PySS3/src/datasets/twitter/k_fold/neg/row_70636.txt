All I want is deathSelf-improvement is a joke to me. Iâ€™d rather just die young than make futile efforts of trying to change. I canâ€™t take this anymore. Every year has been the same cycle of wanting to improve myself and failing miserably. 

I have been looking up all kinds of different suicide methods lately. Itâ€™s the only thing that is on my mind now. I just want to end everything while I am young so that I can avoid an inevitable lifetime of loneliness and misery.
