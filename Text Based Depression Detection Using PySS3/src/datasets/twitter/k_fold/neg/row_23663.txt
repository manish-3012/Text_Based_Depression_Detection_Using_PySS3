4 am and nothing to live forMy life isn't bad, but it's like I have a heavy dark monster on my shoulder I have to carry around everywhere. I'm in college and missed another party tonight. There is no point in living if you can't find happiness in anything. 

I can't see myself being alive for much longer. It would be so easy to make all the bullshit in my head to go away.
