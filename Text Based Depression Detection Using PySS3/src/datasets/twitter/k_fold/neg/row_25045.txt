I want to end it allI canâ€™t take the suffering anymore.
I canâ€™t take the sleepless nights, the constant brain fog, being irritated 24/7, feeling fucking hopeless despite my best efforts for years.
I donâ€™t see any point in staying alive.
Two reasons Iâ€™m still there are my cat and the fact Iâ€™m too afraid to kill myself yet.
I donâ€™t give a shit about anything anymore.
Iâ€™ve ruined my life years ago, tried time and time again to do something about it and failed miserably. I have no friends, nobody to talk to, and even if my mood get better for a day or a week, itâ€™s always the same fucking thing, right back at suicidal thoughts upon waking up, when I canâ€™t sleep, and multiple time during the day.
I have no motivation, no energy, no hope, nothing fucking interest me anymore. Iâ€™m numb to everything, and itâ€™s been that way for years.
Why keeping on suffering would be worth it ? I just canâ€™t stand it any more ..
