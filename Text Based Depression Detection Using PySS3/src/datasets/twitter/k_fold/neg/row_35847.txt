I feel tremendously ridiculous because there are people in the world with real problems that they can't control.Me, myself, everything I've lost could have been prevented. And now I'm terrified of making my life better because I will probably lose it again and I don't have the coping skills to face any more loss. Every little thing that happens is the end of the world and now I want to kill myself because my partner says he will never have sex with me ever. He flew to NY to visit a girl he just met and now he's trapped in this storm for another week and he's my only support. I am shallow and ridiculous and a waste of resources.
