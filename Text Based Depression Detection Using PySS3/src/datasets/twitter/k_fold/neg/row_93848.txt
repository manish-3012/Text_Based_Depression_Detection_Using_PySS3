Life or Death...please help.Iâ€™m 16 years old. Iâ€™m too young. Iâ€™ve been suicidal and depressed for almost 7 years now. Iâ€™m going to be completely honest and say that the only reason Iâ€™m alive is because Iâ€™m too scared to die and I donâ€™t really know how, because I donâ€™t want to take pills and end up alive with organ failure, then my life will get even worse. Please donâ€™t think Iâ€™m one or those â€œangsty teenage girlsâ€...please. I guess a part of me wants to live or else I wouldnâ€™t be posting this...right? I know nothing a stranger might say online can free me from this pain but I donâ€™t want to die. I really donâ€™t. I just...I canâ€™t â€œstayâ€ here like this. 

Iâ€™ll give some insight on what has happened in my life so far to make me feel this way: Self-harm, hospitalization for self-harm, massive loss of friends, bullying, poverty, homelessness, social anxiety, public panic attacks, emotional abuse, ill parents, extreme poverty before homelessness, insecurity on a scale to where I canâ€™t look in the mirror, repeated failure, sexual harassment...and thatâ€™s just the cover story.

I feel like Iâ€™m some personal target. A mistake. 

Iâ€™m all alone. My parents are the ones who cause all of the problems and the one person in my life who helped me is gone.

Iâ€™ve attempted suicide a few times before, one of which my mom left me to die, claiming she â€œthought I was fakingâ€ when I told her how many pills I took. I didnâ€™t take enough, obviously, but I was 13 then.

Iâ€™m a 16 year old black teenage girl who has experienced the worst of the worst. To top it all off, 4 separate occasions have happened just this week in which someone has expressed how much they wish I was gone. How could I not feel this way?
