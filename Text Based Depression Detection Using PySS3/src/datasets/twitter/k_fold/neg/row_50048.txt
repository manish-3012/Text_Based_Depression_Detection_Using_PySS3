Wednesday is the dayYo donâ€™t read this, just needed a place to vent I guess, donâ€™t know, just stop here, cheers.


I got a plan and everything, everyoneâ€™s out of the house and itâ€™s all to myself for me to do the deed, fuck i donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting here, maybe for some last minute change of heart? Doubt itâ€™ll come but meh, may as well. Guess it wonâ€™t kill me, hah.
Maybe Iâ€™m just tired and will have a change of heart by then, donâ€™t know, itâ€™s  23:34 at the time of writing this. Not sure if that matters.
I canâ€™t remember a time where I havenâ€™t thought about dying. Imagine that, being happy. I wish. Iâ€™m not even old, Iâ€™m just a kid and Iâ€™m already tired of this crap, I donâ€™t know how there is anyone over the age of 20 still being happy and productive. 
Before you guys flood comments saying â€˜get helpâ€™ or â€˜talk to family/friendsâ€™ Iâ€™m broke, and I donâ€™t have any true friends, and my family arenâ€™t the kind that youâ€™d talk to. 
Might say at the top of this for people to not read this, I donâ€™t even know why I waited so long.
