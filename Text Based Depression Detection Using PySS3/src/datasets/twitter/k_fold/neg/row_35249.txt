lost and willing to dieI've had anxiety disorder since I was about 12. Recently things have become much worse. I got depressed and had many problems in my life related and caused by my mental illness. I lost my love. She was the only person who could understand me but the state I was in managed to destroy that. I also feel different from everyone around me. And this has been going on since I can remember. I feel like most people at least have someone to talk to, someone to trust. I don't. I have always struggled with some sort of loneliness, differentness and thought about death. Now I seriously consider it. I am here to ask anyone of you how to survive and to to feel understood.
