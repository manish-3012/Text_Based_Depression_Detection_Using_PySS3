Headed AwayJust writing things out. Feel so desperate. I dont know what's wrong with me. I don't know what to do. I need to study, but every time I get to doing it, I lose it. I can't focus and I break down randomly. In my car, in class, while I'm biking, in the grocery. I'm a fuckup. The only thing I had going for me were my grades. Now that's gone. Nothing left.


Even though it's cliche, I don't have anyone and family is basically nonexistent. The only people I care about are my professors, as lame as that is. They're good and interesting people who've encouraged and helped me. But I'm just a disappointment to everyone and I always will be. I'm not capable of handling school or life in general. There's nothing I want in life. I don't have the will for anything.


I've been thinking of just dropping out and abandoning my life here. Moving to a new state, a big city. Working full time. The professors would be the only people I'd miss. But I don't want to be just another college dropout. Giving up now would just put me farther behind. Suicide seems like the only other option.


I don't know why I'm posting here really. Human contact, I guess. Tell me about your day. What'd you do at work? How's life? Whatever's clever. Someone, anyone, just talk at me. I can't be alone right now.
