EMERGENCY: I think a friend in another continent is calling it quits. Any advice for someone with limited contact? [U.K.]He's in the UK, I'm in North America. He's had depression for quite a while, and has always been vocally emotional on facebook; but today it's pretty textbook clinical-depression suicide stuff. Has apologized for being a bad person (he's not) and more or less said he can't take it anymore. He's one for emotional posts, but not at this level of extremity. 

I've reached out to him on facebook and received limited response but he hasn't responded at all for nearly an hour. I feel like physical intervention may be required, but do not know his address. Any ideas?

Edit: He's with a local friend. Phew.
