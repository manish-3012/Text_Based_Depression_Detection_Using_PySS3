Sounds fucked upBut I'm happier knowing that all of you are like this. I came on here because I'm fuckin dieing inside and idk who to talk to or how to even talk about it. And seeing all the posts made and reading some I'm shook. Not a day has passed without thinking of suicide for at least 10 years. But i kept going on the worst days because I thought about the people who care about me and how my suicide would effect them. I know the feeling of talking to someone and have them say they are ok things are good and then kill themselves the next day. That feeling still haunts me inside years later But is a constant reminder why I can never do it even if I do want to die. I never would've thought that staying alive would become such a hard option to take.
