It's time to goSo I currently have a noose tied and ready to go sitting next to me. It's been here for about a few days. I'm just waiting for the snow to melt a bit. I don't think, that after all these years of dealing with this self hatred, that life has felt this hopeless. I don't really see a future for myself. If I'm this miserable and going through the motions is such a pain, then why would I want to prolong this?
