I just don't think I'll ever amount to much. ADHD is preventing me from accomplishing anything.Just want to end it all. I feel alone. I'll never accomplish the things I want to because of fucking ADHD. (yes I'm on meds for it.)

Fuck. Just wish someone would kill me or something. I really don't want to wake up tomorrow. Fuck. I hate myself. I hate the way I am. I hate how I am never able to make friends because I never care enough to try.

Just want it all to end. I can't deal with the stress. Kill me.
