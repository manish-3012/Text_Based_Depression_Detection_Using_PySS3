Have you ever just been a burdenI feel like crap today, I haven't gone university scince the day it started as I been scared, my family blames everything on me, some is my fault some is not, they b lame the death and debt of my brother on me, my debts what I had issues with that I've been trying to resolve in every way, I just feel like that's it everything is done,

i am stressed depressed and had enough, from the complaining, from being ill having a constant cough bringing up shit all the time and having chest pains, with all of this i don't have a clear or level head and it is making me make stupid decisions and it affecting me so much i just want everything to be perfect but this is far from perfect and their is nothing i can do 
everything is out of control,

I've been trying for months to rectify this  but i cant i am just done with everything, i won't let this stress be the end of me, the only thing that will be the end of me is me.

Thank you for reading, i hope all of your lifes get better, you all deserve it more than me in every way
