Severe acne scarring. Dropping out of college. Quitting job. Killing myselfI am studying accounting. I am a senior in college. I am 21. I have severe acne scarring and still some acne. Had bad cystic acne when I was a teen. I can't keep going on. I am constantly paranoid about what others think about me. Never had a serious relationship/never will. I'm extremely ugly and worthless. I do not know how I will support myself. I suffer from social anxiety and major depression. Was raised by narcissistic parents and I literally have no friends. I have been made fun of more times than I can count in college. Made little to no friends the 4 years I was there. Tried counseling. Didn't help much. So I am basically preparing to drop out, quit my job, and eventually end it. Any advice would be cool. Thanks.
