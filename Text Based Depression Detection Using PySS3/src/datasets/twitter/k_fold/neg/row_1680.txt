On my birthday next month.Is the day I'll finally get out of this world. I've done all I can to make myself happy coming out of an abusive upbringing. I developed sociopathic tendencies and have had depression for the past 4 years. I cannot get rid of it. I've tried everything from anti depressants to heroin to find something to comfort me. I continue with noone out of my family even caring I exist. The woman I loved told me to go fuck myself and all the ones I've talked to afterwards aren't interested in even basic conversation with me. I hide my depression in social situations quite well. But lately these thoughts have overwhelmed my brain. 

I'm tired of the way I am and there is one final fix I'm going to try. Reddit has been an incredible source of news, comradery, and humor. But it alone cannot fix me. Only permanent silence can.

Thank you reddit. :)
