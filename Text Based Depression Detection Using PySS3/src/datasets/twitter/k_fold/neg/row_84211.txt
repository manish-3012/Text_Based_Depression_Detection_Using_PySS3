I'm going to kill myself todayI don't know why I thought this would be a good idea, but fuck it, here it goes. 

I work retail, I always have, but this is the first holiday I've worked in nearly 5 years where I'm not a manager, and I feel completely useless all of a sudden. I've been battling depression since I was 16 (23 now) and I just don't want to deal with it anymore. I was at work last night until 3am, never fell asleep, so maybe it's just my insomnia talking, but this isn't a life worth living. I hate myself, I hate that I'm overweight, I hate that I have no friend anymore, I hate that even though life is going well right now and I'm making more than I've ever made, I feel more empty now than I ever have before. 

I don't want this to become a "hey, don't do that" thread, I guess it's more so for who ever goes through my phone, so that they know why I decided to do this. 

Anyway, I hope you guys have a happy holiday, I'm glad that I won't have to deal with it again
