No one takes me seriously anymore.After my attempts a while back, I feel like I've been completely disconnected from this world ever since. I try talking to my family, and they just act like I'm not even there and just ignore what I'm trying to say. They also often make jokes about me being suicidal in the past, and depression. After my attempts, I came back home with them still not accepting me and completely ignoring my existence. I feel like they wouldn't care if I was gone at the rate it's looking at. I'm trying to understand what I'm doing wrong, but I really just can't think of anything.
