i hate livingthere is no way to escape this pain except death. it always creeps up on me. im not worthy of love it feels like. i struggle to make it out of bed my heart is so heavy. i miss being happy. all i do is cope now. i just dont want to live anymore. this all seems pointless but i hope i can find a way to peacefully pass.
