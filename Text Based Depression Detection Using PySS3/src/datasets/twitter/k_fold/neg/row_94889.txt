My suicide note. I don't know if I should tell that for my love.,, I decided to end it. I finally reached the point where I'm completely calm with my decission. I had so much dreams as a teen, I had so much motivation to get better, but now I don't have anything. Life isn't fair, everyone knows it, but nobody tells that. Just because I managed to born different from you, mom and dad, I always struggled a lot. It's kinda joke, that I was born like minority, while you were so beautiful whites people. I'm still managed to live, I was learned to think that what matters is inside, I had friends an my lovely girlfriend, but now I lost them all. As university started I was rejected by everyone. I haven't done anything wrong, people just judged me , because I don't look like them. My sweetheart.. I miss you so much. You were too good for me . I can't describe how lucky I was that you were 4 years with me. I still can remember the first time I saw you. I've never let you knew , how much I was attached to you, but you were my only love. I'm so happy what you reached your dream, you finally accepted in your dreams university. I still remember how I teached you math and chemistry , our first kiss , how happy you were when we were together. Now you know much more than me and I'm so proud of you. It hurts that you left me,  but I kinda happy that you have found your new boyfriend, I just want that he will treat you good. It was my fault that I had let you go, but maybe it's for the best. I'm crying right now, it's so hard to leave all of you , but I can't live. I know that future will not bring better memories that I had so far and it only goes worse. 21 years is enough for me to understand how this world works. Goodbye." 

I translated it from my native language .I don't know if I should tell something for my    ex, she is happy right now, but I also know what she will try to reach me in the future and she will not be able to do that. I'm going to drive in the forest in the 3 PM in America time (11 PM in my country) and I will shot myself with my father gun I've taken from their home.
