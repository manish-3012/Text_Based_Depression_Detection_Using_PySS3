I attempted suicide on Saturday, went to the hospital yesterday but was sent home with some worksheets. Still suicidal.I attempted suicide on Saturday by swallowing my medication. My parents confiscated the meds and I went to the hospital yesterday. I saw a psychiatrist but I was sent home with some worksheets and a referral to a non-government crisis centre, but I have no idea when my appointment is. Haven't taken my meds in 3 days and I don't know where to go from here. I would try to kill myself again but my sister is in the house.
