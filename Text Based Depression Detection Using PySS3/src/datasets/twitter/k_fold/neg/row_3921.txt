I just want to drive my car into anything as fast as it'll go.Experiencing it like it's in slow motion would be the most satisfying thing that I could imagine.
My entire life I've struggled with some disorder, depression or cyclothymia or something similar, and I can't get help.
I've tried medications and they made me so much worse, so I'm scared to try others. I had one good therapist, but I moved hours away for school. After many months I finally got myself to reach out to another, but it didn't work out and now it makes me sick to think about searching again.
My education and my relationship are falling apart and I don't have anyone.
