I think I'm going insaneI constantly dissociate to the point where any little thing makes me dissociate so badly that I attack my friends and family. My memory disappears every few minutes. I can't concentrate or remember anything. I feel like I'm constantly drowning.

I can't do this. I can't keep licing like this, and I don't know what to do anymore. I just wanna slit my wrists and make it all stop.
