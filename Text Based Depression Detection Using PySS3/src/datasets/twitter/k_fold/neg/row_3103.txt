Fresh out of the inpatient psych unit, seriously considering overdose.Hey guys,
So a bit of background for you. I was admitted into the inpatient psych unit about a week ago and got out two days ago. Now Iâ€™m home and things are still terrible. Iâ€™m seriously considering trying to OD on Tylenol Extra Strength. Idk what to do anymore.

My family hates me for certain things Iâ€™ve done (ex:going to the cops on my dad for abuse), my best friend isnâ€™t talking to me for God knows why, and living with BPD/Depression for years without seeing anything getting remotely better is soul crushing. 

I struggle with suicidal thoughts on a daily basis and honestly Iâ€™m just tired of it all.
