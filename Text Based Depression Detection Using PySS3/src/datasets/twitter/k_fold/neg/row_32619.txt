What can I do to?I apologize in advance if I use insensitive language. It is my first time writing on this matter, and I am not very familiar with the terms. 

I lost a relative to suicide a year ago. It was very painful. Few days ago, I heard another news from a high school friend. 

It scares me much that I might lose more to suicide. It scares me especially, because when the relative took his life, no one saw any signs. What can I do to protect the ones I care for? How do I know if my loved one is in danger before it is too late? I am not good at reading non verbal signs. I have a strong tendency to think everything is okay, which makes me blind to subtleties. 

What would help when someone's in pain?
