Feel trapped between sanity and madnessMy mental health is broken and I feel beyond repair,  there are so many problems going on at once in my head it's hard to tell what is doing what sometimes, my mood changes so rapidly I don't trust myself anymore. 

I feel useless and less worth then others, I have tried to bring myself some self worth but i can't get it in a positive light  it's so deeply rutted in my mind it's a foundation of my reality, that I am less that I am not deserving of anything but pain. 


Anxiety,depression,feeling compelled to hurt myself,gender-dysphoria and uncontrollably mood swings, idk what to do anymore, I feel cursed, useless. 

Idk how I have been able to stay alive, how am I anymore ? 

Idk anymore
