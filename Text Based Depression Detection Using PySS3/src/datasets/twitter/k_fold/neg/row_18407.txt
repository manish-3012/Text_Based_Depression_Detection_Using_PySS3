what's the point?I'm 19 going on 20. life is honestly pretty shit since everything is just a monotonous routine and looking at other people's situations, its all the same when you're a "professional" working your 9 to 5.  life just drags slowly until you retire and even then you're too worn out for honestly anything. I was involved in an accident in June that almost rendered me a quadriplegic and i still don't see much purpose to my existence. i told myself that things would be different from now on since my accident. but i don't have the drive to do anything anymore, i have no real talents, never had a girlfriend, only have one friend who i feel is friends with me out of pity. i lost my virginity to a hooker for $30 in South America. never had much friends, i've never even held hands or kissed a girl. i'm too far into my college career (third year student) to change a major and even then i have zero idea what to change it to. they say, "go after something you enjoy", but nothing captured my interest in particular. i was a social outcast in my school years, and it stayed this way until my high school graduation. being ridiculed and pushed away is normal to me. all i ever do is give up on everything i attempt. one way or another, i somehow find a way to stop doing it. I have attempted possible solutions many times but I don't even know if I want to help myself anymore.
