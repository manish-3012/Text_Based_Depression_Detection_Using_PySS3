So lost and confused at 18My entire life I've been poor as fuck . My dad grew a gambling addiction that's grew out of control for the past 5 years which makes me and my mother suffer and we've been living pay check to pay check ever since. Ive helped out with the bills since I was 16 but recently am now unemployed looking for a better job since my last one didn't work out . Everyday my gums have been aching since I need two root canals and need to remove all my wisdom teeth with no dental insurance so that's a definite no go . I've been applying to jobs non stop but no luck so far. A week ago I went to the Er due to severe lower stomach pain and found out one of my ovaries is basically growing out of control and might be cancer . Going to the gyno to check everything on that in 2 days . Which adds on to the money situation . And I'm starting college this August with no fucking idea what I want to do in this life . I've been through so much these last couple of months and trying to stand up to my dad is impossible because he's basically a dead beat . He does nothing to contribute and my mom can't even stand up for herself . I just feel so lost and I need guidance . I know things might get better but right now the world feels like it's turning on me. I feel so stuck and especially with my severe anxiety I just feel like I'm being crushed every single day that everything is out of my hands . I don't know what I'm doing
