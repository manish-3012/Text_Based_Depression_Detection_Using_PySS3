I canâ€™t do itI have schizoaffective bipolar disorder and itâ€™s ruined my life. After many failed half ass attempts Iâ€™ve decided the best way to get it over with is through firearms. Iâ€™ve been trying to find an excuse to get to my parents house and borrow one of theirs. Finally the day is here, and I just canâ€™t do it...Iâ€™ve held the gun, pointed it to my head, played with the safety switch...Iâ€™m a coward and I know Iâ€™m going to regret walking away from this opportunity. Time is almost up and here I am still breathing. Why do I do this to myself??
