I honestly cant wait to leave. I can feel how much of a burden i am to those around me. Im aware of everything.Its not delusion or my BPD acting up. Its proven facts. Im a smart person and i studied a lot of psychology. I can read the people around me. Everyone has an issue with me even if i give them the world  and break my back around for them all the time. I donâ€™t want none of that â€œyouâ€™ll find the right people who appreciate youâ€ this is abuse from my own family, my boyfriend, my friends. You can feel it in the way they resent you and talk to you. Like they know they dinâ€™t want you around and they wish you were never born.
