I told my boyfriend I was gonna kill myself and he didn't believe me.So I slit my wrists instead. Do you believe me now? Do you notice me now?! You can tell someone upfront, "I have a problem." And they'll just toss you aside like you're nothing. I thought you were supposed to tell people when you felt like this but clearly keeping it a secret is better! Because the people who should support you don't.
