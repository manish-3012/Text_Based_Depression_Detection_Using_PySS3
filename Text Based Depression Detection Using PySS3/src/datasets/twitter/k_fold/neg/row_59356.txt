I'm probably going to die anywayI'm gay, and the shooting in Orlando has affected me more than I'd have ever thought something like this would. I've already struggled with my sexuality on multiple levels, and now it honestly feels like I will never be safe or happy anywhere.

If someone's going to kill me, I'd rather beat them to it. I was already dealing with suicidal impulses, as I've posted here before, but now it just feels like it's pointless not to act on them. The world doesn't fucking want me here, and it keeps reminding me of that. So I don't see why I don't just go.
