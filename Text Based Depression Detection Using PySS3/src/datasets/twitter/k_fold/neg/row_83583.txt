I've felt suicidal ever since this one person came into my life...I really feel like I've been feeling suicidal since this one person came into my life... They have been having some problems too, but they never help me out. We both have depression and anxiety, and the thing is that he doesn't think that I have these conditions, and calls me an attention seeking, anger-fueled retarded bitch, so I never mention it, but he always forgets. We've been getting into some fights lately, the thing is, I do the same thing with everyone else and we don't start fights. He always tells me to "shut the fuck up" even though he started the argument and got me, but shifts the blame on me, and people believe it. He says I'm going to become a school shooter, and that I'm retarded because of my Asperger's syndrome. He's desperate for a romantic partner, and has asked my sister out 7 times, and she's been hurt by him almost always, and he threatens suicide if he doesn't get what he wants. He denies therapy for his depression and anxiety, and I think he needs a test for narcissism, however, because he always acts like he's perfect.

I kind of want to cut him out and see how I do but there's a few things in my way:

1. I still see him as a friend to a degree, it's like a case of Stockholm syndrome.
2. We have the same group of friends, so we're usually going to have to hang out, and I'm terrible at making friends, I'm not popular at all at my school, and I feel too scared to go up and hang out with new people

I just don't know what to do, and I need help, I've been feeling really suicidal for the past few days, so I've decided to post this.
