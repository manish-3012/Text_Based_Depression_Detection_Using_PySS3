I think I want to call it quits...I'm new to reddit so forgive any potential errors I make. I'm 17 (practically 18) and I am going to drop out of high school. The idea of the 9 to 5, day in day out kind of grind seems like pure hell to me. And since I lack the motivation to finish high school (less than one year left) college definitely aint happening. And I've heard the usual response, "You have your whole life ahead of you!!" No I don't. All the good music has died. Any and all creativity has flew out the fucking window and you don't have to take my word for that one just look at every movie coming out nowadays. I just feel like I was the last one to the party and everyone's already left and I'm just here twiddling my fucking thumbs. And I've basically already lived the life I've wanted to live! Iv'e done every drug I wanted to with the exclusion of DMT,  I've been in three relationships all of which I've been laid, and I've seen every movie and heard just about every piece of music I've wanted to hear. There's nothing left. Shit is just boring now. Fuck motivation and fuck living. I'm done.
