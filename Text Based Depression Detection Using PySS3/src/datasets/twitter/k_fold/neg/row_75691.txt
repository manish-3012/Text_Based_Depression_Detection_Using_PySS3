Please, SW, give me a reason, a reason I've never heard before, as to why I shouldn't kill myself.I'm broke, jobless, nearly homeless, with a mountain of debt.
I just don't see any reason as to why I should keep carrying on, when death would be so much easier.  It'd be simple really.  One bottle of pills and I'm gone.  A footnote in the novel of life.  An after-thought in the minds of the people I once knew.
Why shouldn't I just kill myself right now, and save myself the trouble?
