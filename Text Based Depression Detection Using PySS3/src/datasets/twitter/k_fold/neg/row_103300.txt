I Can't.I just can't do this anymore. I've lost everything in my life. The woman I loved and gave everything to. My muse in life ripped my heart out and cheated on me because I was too controlling. My mother is gone and my father is off probably predating on another young boy or girl. My family that I do live with does nothing but fight and I hear it every single day. I work a dead end job only to go nowhere. I have no higher education to escape that trap; not like I could afford it anyway. My only skill in life is writing and I can't even finish a rough draft because I overanalyze every excruciating detail. My best friend who pulled me out of my slump and got me out of a previous toxic relationship just gave up on me because I said some things that I really shouldn't have. I'm only twenty three years old and the only thing I'm good for is getting black out drunk and reaching for the knife to numb my pain. I feel nothing except the tightness in my chest. I just want a way out.
