What for?I donÂ´t even know what to say here. CanÂ´t get a straight thought together. Everything is just so meaningless, nothing makes sense anymore. IÂ´m way too old to go through all this crap. Getting hurt over and over. 

Edit: I tried to calm down and get sleep but nothing is working and i just canÂ´t take it no more. Thank you for trying though.
