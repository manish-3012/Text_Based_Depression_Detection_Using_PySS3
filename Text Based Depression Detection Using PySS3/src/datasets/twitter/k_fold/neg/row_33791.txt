What other option is there?Horrible, horrible relationship with a woman who doesn't even understand that she hates me. I live with her.

About to get hired at the same company she works at part time, but it'll be forever before I can save up enough money to move out, and even if I did I would never be able to afford to live in this city.

Starting school in September....or at least I'd like to, but how will I attend the community college around here if I can't live in this area unless I'm willing to stay in a relationship that makes me want to drink bleach.

No money.

No family or friends that could take me in or really help me in any way that's significant.

No real future. No real drive. Depressed. Like actually depressed, not sad. 

What's the point of this? 

I just want to go to sleep and wake up when all these problems are gone. But that's not going to happen. So why not just stay asleep?
