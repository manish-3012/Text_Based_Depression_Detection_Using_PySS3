Looking for HelpI imagine at least half of the people are like me, and just want things to be better, and are frustrated that they aren't and/or can't be. Nevertheless, I'm back past the point where I wouldn't be mad about driving off a cliff if it happened, and going more into the fantasizing about not being here anymore.

I just restarted some meds, which may understandably be making me feel this way as I am adjusting, but I have felt quite numb all year. My dad died last year and my family is still kind of recovering from it, especially my mom who, although he made her stress daily, misses him terribly. Beyond that, I am in a job I hate (military, so I can't leave), my personal goals of bettering myself in fitness and learning new things are there but I've been feeling consumed by failure so I end up just not (which I know, everyone fails and SHOULD, to learn, but tell my depression that), and oh right, I'm a closeted gay man despite everyone probably knowing anyway. 

I can't kill myself because my family has been through enough in the last two years, and if I go, I think I may bring down my mom too. I go to counseling, but she helps more with anxiety rather than depression, and I just can't bring myself to trouble my friends with my issues as I had an experience when I was younger when I told my friend everything about my depression...and after trying to help, he got frustrated and stopped talking to me. You can say all you want real friends won't do that, but everyone has their breaking point. 

What do I do? I ask for guidance from the interwebs despite none of you knowing a thing about me really.
