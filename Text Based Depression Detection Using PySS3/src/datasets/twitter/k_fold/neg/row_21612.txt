I'm just numbI don't really know what to feel right now My girlfriend/best friend died last week. She probably was the closest thing to happiness I have had. Honestly I don't know what to do without her, it's just I can't think of anything anymore. I feel like an asshole because I haven't cried nd I'm unwilling to talk to anyone. I feel pathetic because I can't face her little sister who called me her big brother. I just can't face the world right now and I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm going to find it here but I want to talk to someone who won't give me shit for it.
