August 5thIâ€™m doing it August 5th. Thatâ€™s when I get my drivers license and that night Iâ€™m just going drive to the end. Making sure I say it so I donâ€™t change my mind. I want to stop thinking it will get better even though it never does. The good comes but itâ€™s never worth all the bad as well.
