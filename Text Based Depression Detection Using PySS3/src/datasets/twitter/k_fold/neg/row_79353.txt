I am trying to hold onI left you, I left home, I left everything. I want to end my life today. I think about it constantly, but at the same time I donâ€™t. I want help. I want to be okay. I loved you. I loved you so much and youâ€™ll blame yourself. I burned our bridge. I drove you away. All I did was love you. I fuck up. I push you away with my health. I need to seek help, I need to feel normal. Being diagnosed with a personality disorder and not getting help for it is rough. I wish you would just reach out to me. I wish you wouldnâ€™t have let me go. I wish you wouldnâ€™t have told me to go. I wish you would save me. 
But you wonâ€™t, youâ€™ll move on, find someone who loves you more than I did, find someone who doesnâ€™t need help, find someone who treated you better, who didnâ€™t lie, who didnâ€™t already put you through this. I want to hurt myself and get help. I want to die or maybe not. I donâ€™t know. All I did want was you. I wish I had someone to talk to every day like we did. It got me through it all. we still talk and all I do is push you away, all you do is care I think, I donâ€™t even know if you miss me. I donâ€™t know what you want from me. You canâ€™t save me this time
