I'm so tired of constantly thinking about deathI just wanna be a happy carefree dude like everyone around me seems to be. It doesnt matter what I'm doing, playing video games, making art, hell right now I'm supposed to be practicing the banjo for mother's day but no matter what I do I can't stop wondering if just offing myself would heal this sadness I cant get rid of- I cant stop wanting an easy way out  and I cant stop crying when I feel like I'm trapped here..
