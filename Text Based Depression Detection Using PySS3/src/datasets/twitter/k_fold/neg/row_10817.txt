I NEED to end itI've traveled, seen this world and what it has to offer. I dont want to be apart of it. It isnt that my life isnt going anywhere, it isnt that I have no friends, and it isnt that nobody loves me. I cant stay here, this place is too fucking disgusting. I dont have the strength to deal with it, any of it.
