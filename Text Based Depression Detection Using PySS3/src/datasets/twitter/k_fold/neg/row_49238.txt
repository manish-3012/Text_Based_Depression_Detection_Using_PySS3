I don't know how to deal with thisI'm only 14 years old when I say I've had a pretty shit life I mean it my moms a drug addict and my dad doesn't care about me luckily they separated when I was young so I don't really feel the affects of him not being there but I do live with him now. I have dog over in my mams house. I had my dog belle for only about a year and a half of 2 years but she's still a big part of my life and I would never let anything happen to her. I have an older brother who's 22 and an older sister who's 18. My brother was kept by my nana because my mam was only 16 having him and she wasn't able to raise him properly. I have a little sister who my mam currently has custody of now and I don't know how long it's going to stay that way. My mam has had anxiety since she was around my age she's never told me the root but it's very bad and it was only about 4 months ago I moved to my dads due to being unhappy living with my mam step dad and 2 sister's. It was better living in my dads for the first month he's been really good to me and i appreciate that hes really trying to make up for lost time but no matter what I feel guilty. My mam has attempted suicide before and wouldn't be here right now if if wasn't me for me being nosy as a 10 year old as to why my mam had not come out of her room for half an hour and seen her hanging from the ceiling. She's In the same state again because of me moving out she's lost nearly every child from not being capable of raising us properly and I feel so fucking bad. This doesn't sound bad to everyone reading this but it is for me I could go on for more but basically I'm trying to say I feel like I want to take my life and get rid of all this pressure and just be free. I don't know what to do if any one could reply back and give me something even just advice please I'm at my breaking point please.
