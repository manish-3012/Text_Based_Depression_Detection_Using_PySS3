I'm experiencing some Anxiety Attacks. The problem is, I really don't know if I or someone is in Depression.Sometimes I would like to commit bad things. I would cry and I don't know why exactly. The next thing in the morning I am normal. Then later on after 2-3 Days, I'm going to bed and suffer Anxiety Attacks again. Sometimes more often. I always get used to doing things so uncomfortable to me when I don't do it. Should I see a doctor?
