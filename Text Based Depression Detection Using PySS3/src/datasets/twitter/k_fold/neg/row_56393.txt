i dont know what to put for the title but i'm absolutely miserablei am a 17 year old closeted transgirl, victim of multiple acts of sexual violence (more than I can count) at the ages of 7 and 8, and have social anxiety and some sort of depressive disorder (i have also been labeled as "pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified")

my life has been made more difficult due to sexual abuse in the past, but recently i have been struggling with my gender identity and sexuality. i am a junior in high school and have a couple of friends but my relationship with them is not very meaningful. outside i have very few others who i do consider to be people that i have "meaningful" relationships with but they are much less accessible as they are a bit further away. so i spend most of my time outside of school alone.

recently the only thing on my mind has been suicide. all i can think about is how i'm going to do it, when i'm going to do it, where etc. I can't go for more than 15 seconds it seems without having some kind of suicide related thought.

i go to therapy (i have since i was abused,) have attended LGBTQ+ groups and all that stuff but there are a number of issues with those. i don't want my parents to know that i am feeling the way i do, and i am not sure if they will learn through my therapist. i also have found that i cannot connect to many people at these kind of lgbtq+ groups as many people seem to be studied eccentrics and honestly rather immature. 

i never have felt like i could assimilate into society at school. i have been called into the principal's office because i was suspected of being a school shooter last month because i opened up about feeling isolated on my personal facebook page and someone felt that they needed to report that. that only made me feel worse.

i just dont know what to do and know that i will not survive much longer if life continues the way it is.
