I am evil and I destroy everyone around me. I have proof.Posted here a few days ago.  Managed to work shit out temporarily although my adviser is still abusive and I'm terrified to do anything about it.  However, I called and texted my boyfriend in the midst of this fake "crisis," as I do all the time, and he talked me through it...then he found out today, out of nowhere, that his job is no longer moving forward with his training. He says it has nothing to do with me, but I know he just wants to make me feel better.   THIS IS MY FAULT for calling/texting him at work and being emotionally manipulative.  It's what I do.  I leave everyone else's lives in a wreckage behind me and then move on as if nothing happened.  I'm a fucking vampire.  I live by creating chaos and draining the life out of other people. This is not the first person I've done it to; it's been an ongoing pattern all my life. Changing my behavior will not help if it's even possible; the damage is already done and I will never forgive myself. I will also never forgive myself for not having committed suicide this summer when I still had money in my savings that I could at least leave to the people I care about. I am a destructive piece of shit and I am beyond help.

Yet I can't make myself do it, and that is what makes me even more evil...that some part of me still thinks I deserve love and hope and healing.  I no longer trust my therapist, my friends, anyone who tells me I am capable of redemption.  Sorry for wasting all of your time.  Someone please just talk me into killing myself.  Please.  You'd be doing the world a favor.
