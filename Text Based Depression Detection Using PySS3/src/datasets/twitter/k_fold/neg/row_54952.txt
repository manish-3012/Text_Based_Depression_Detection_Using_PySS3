Boyfriend is talking about suicide. What should i do?My boyfriend lost his job a year back. He got 2 offers but failed background check. He is not willing to do part time job to support himself. He planned to do suicide around december 2018. He is thinking about it again. 

He do not have any relatives or friends.  He do not have any money.  That's why i am staying here with him until he gets a job  and planning to break up and move on 

What should i do to avoid any problems?
Will i go to jail if he does something? I m paying all his bills until now and staying positive 
Should i call police and let them know about his intentions right away?
