Life sucksI donâ€™t have a relationship with my mom or my dad it barely even feels like I have a father figure in my life with him gone a month and here a week. When he is here heâ€™s sitting on his ass watching tv or sleeping. I understand he has to provide for the family but itâ€™s sucks. My grades are currently shit and my parents are getting on my ass for it but they donâ€™t understand Iâ€™m just purely stupid. Iâ€™m a fucking idiot and I know it nothing you say will change how I think. Iâ€™ve been abusing drugs for the past year now... almost anything I can get my hands on I do. I just turned 18 and Iâ€™ve already done heroin,coke and meth. What the fuck am I doing. Iâ€™m 4 months time Iâ€™ve already dropped 65 pounds and people congratulate me on it... I tell them I work out and do all this shit just to feel better about myself but even I know itâ€™s the drugs. If I donâ€™t do drugs everyday Iâ€™m constantly thinking about how I got raped at the age of 5, I even remember sucking the dudes dick like who the fuck remembers that and sees it visually in their head?? I feel worthless and uncared for and Iâ€™ve already had 2 actual suicide attempts but my parents think that both times I just wanted to get drunk and high and they hold it against me. The first time I downed a whole big ass bottle of 40 percent liquor hoping Iâ€™d get alcohol poisoning but nope. Woke up the next day feeling like shit but I didnâ€™t throw up or anything. The second time I took 5 expired pills my grandma used to take for epilepsy and I got rushed to the hospital the 3rd day after that due to my throat closing up and me not being able to breath. I canâ€™t even kill myself right Iâ€™m a fucking failure. Thinking about this paycheck Iâ€™m getting on the next Wednesday and Iâ€™ve been thinking for a minute that Iâ€™ll have enough money to finally go the way I want to. I hate my life and Iâ€™m sick of it I just want to fucking die.
