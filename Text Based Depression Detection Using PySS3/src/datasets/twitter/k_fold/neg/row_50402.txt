Every morning I wake up and all I think about is how to dieI donâ€™t want to die. I feel like there are certain things I want in life but they are unobtainable now that Iâ€™m 30. 

I used to be very hard working. Looking for work and going to school. But school has ended and there arenâ€™t many jobs. 

I donâ€™t have any friends. I donâ€™t understand how to make or maintain friendships. And I donâ€™t feel good going out and trying to meet people because of corona. 

I feel incredibly lonely and I have lost interest in everything. But I donâ€™t want to die. But I feel like my life is psychological torture.
