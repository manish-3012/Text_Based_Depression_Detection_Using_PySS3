My therapist sucks. I've went through too many and I'm tired of looking for a new one. Afraid when next crisis happens nobody will be able to help and something bad happen. Psychiatrists didn't help. Tips? Anyone feel the same way?I don't want to end therapy with my current therapists because I want to stick with her for eight weeks instead of quitting. But she's expensive AF like most.
