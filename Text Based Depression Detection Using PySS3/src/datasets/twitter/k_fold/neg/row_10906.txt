I hate everythingAfter a long day of pretty moderate suffering I learned today that my ngrandparent found out about the fact i wasnâ€™t doing my work (being so fucking overwhelmed with stress) and they might be coming home to yell at me for HOURS on end and possibly even hurt me. If they do today will be the end.
