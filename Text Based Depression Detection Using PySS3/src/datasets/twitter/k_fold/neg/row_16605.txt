Moved back home. Family doesn't believe bipolar exists. Criticizes those that help. Losing my will.I'm pretty drunk for a Thursday afternoon, and I'm gazing at my pills and weapons. Forgive me if I'm not as a clear as I should be.

I've attempted before, but mostly as a cry for help. I've told myself that if I were to ever try again, I'd be sure to do it right. I've made strides, but the calls in my head to give in remain strong.

My self-destructive nature has temporarily forced me out of college and to live back home. I've been twice diagnosed as bipolar, but my family won't have any of that.

They've been highly critical of my doctors---even threatening to kill them at one point for ruining my future. They refuse to take any part in my treatment, even when they're requested to attend. They're trying their best to keep me away from my best friend, who has supported me for the past year and has helped stop one of my prior attempts. They've even been critical of and implied I should halt my medication, although they've now backed down on this.

I'd leave, but I don't have the financial means to do so. To be independent, I would first need to be stable. To be stable, I'd first need to be independent.

I think---well, hope---that I can keep it together long enough to find a job and get the hell out of here. Any advice on how to cope, though, would be appreciated.
