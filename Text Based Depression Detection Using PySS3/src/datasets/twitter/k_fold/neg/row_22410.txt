One year later no hope foundA year since my last attempt failed and I was involuntary committed to the hospital for evaluation nothing has gotten any better I am emotionally detached I stopped taking my meds because they don't work anyway. I have a big time certification exam on Saturday and I am most likely to fail and lose my job. So when I fail the exam I will go home put my neck in the noose I have already tied and end my life. The only advantage is that I am far enough away from home that I won't be stopped. Sorry mom and dad and my friends but yall are better off without me anyway.
