Social Anxiety and SuicideI want to kill myself because I have never felt close to anyone in my life. I come from a not-so-decent family life filled with drugs and abuse, because of this and a history of mental illness I have developed extreme social anxiety on top of everything else I have been diagnosed with.

I have never felt true human connection or closeness, growing up my family felt like a bunch of strangers to me, even while in the same house, none of us ever spoke to each other, we could go easily a week without uttering a word to eachother. Now I have moved back home after some drug issues at school and all I can think about is killing my family and myself. This social anxiety is causing me to have both suicidal and homicidal ideation; I slit my wrists and my neck daily and the other day stole one of my fathers guns, loaded it, held it up to my throat and ended up shooting it out the open window. 

I just want to disappear, get away from my family, and to live a normal life, but I am becoming more aware that that is not possible, I can't live a normal life with a middle-class job and a husband and some kids and some fucking suburban neighborhood. I am not even capable of speaking to another human being without wanting to murder them or myself. I really just want to give up, whats the point of going forward, I have been to therapy and its shit, I have been on medication and its shit, I have been in the mental hospital and its shit, nothing really helps.
