I'm literally 15 steps from killing myselfThat's how far it is from my bedroom to the bottle of pills in the cabinet. It takes 14 pills of extra strength tylenol to cause liver failure, so I'd take probably 30. I can't keep doing this. I can't keep going. The only person who matters doesn't care, and the other only person who matters isn't even old enough to talk.

Please, I just want to die. Cutting myself isn't helping anymore.
