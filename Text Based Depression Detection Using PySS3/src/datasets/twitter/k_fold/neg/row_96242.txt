I feel so bad but I don't want to hurt anyone who cares for meI have had depression since early this year and have had two types of anti depressants that don't seem to work at all, i'm supposed to be having therapy but it seems I just have to keep waiting and waiting for it. The pain of each day is unbearable sometimes and I feel almost constantly suicidal and the only thing keeping me from doing it is the thought of hurting my family and friends. I don't know what to do anymore I feel like i'm no longer who people think I am and I just want it all to end but I can't bring myself to hurt anyone. Should I tell them what's going on or just keep it a secret? because i'm scared how they will react to something like this
