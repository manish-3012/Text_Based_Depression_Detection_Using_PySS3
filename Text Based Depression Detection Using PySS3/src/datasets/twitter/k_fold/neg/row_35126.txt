Losing interest in everythingNot in immediate danger but find myself feeling more and more isolated. My husband was mad about a picture I posted (not a bad picture it's literally just a picture of my face smiling genuinely mostly. I was wearing a high necked work sweater so not racey or anything in any way shape or form.) I just thought it was a nice picture that captured how I was starting to feel a bit better about life. He said I should send nice photos to him instead of posting them (uh... what?) It wasn't his intention but I felt like such a piece of shit that I deleted every single picture of myself off every social media platform then deleted all my apps and accounts, any picture of myself off my phone and for the past couple months feel very uncomfortable having any photos taken of me. I deleted all my games as well so I'd have no reason to sit behind my phone screen. Reinstalled reddit like 30 seconds ago just as an outlet...I've noticed I'm losing interest in literally everything that I usually enjoy. Just recognizing a bad pattern lately and feel like I might start a downward spiral. I just don't want to get back under a black cloud. Blagh... thanks for letting me rant
