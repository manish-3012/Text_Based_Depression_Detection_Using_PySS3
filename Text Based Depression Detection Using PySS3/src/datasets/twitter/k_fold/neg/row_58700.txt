Carbon monoxide poisoning questionEarlier in the week (about 3 days ago) I tried to kill myself by driving my car into the garage. I was in there for about 2 hours, but the car was only on for about ~20 minutes total. 

I had an extreme headache and felt dizzy that day, but felt better the next couple days. However, today I woke up and I feel extremely sick and dizzy. Is this a symptom of the carbon monoxide or am I just developing a cold?
