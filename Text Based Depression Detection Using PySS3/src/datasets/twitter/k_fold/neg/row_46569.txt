Wrote this yesterdayThere's just a feeling of slipping away. I feel relieved in a sense that I'm not really attached to anybody. I feel there's not much point in telling this to anyone. Always thought I'd find somebody and sort of bare my soul with them. That they'd understand me and would appreciate me. Someone I connected with. Maybe it's better that doesn't happen. I think I'm ready to be done with this life. What are you supposed to say to that? Nothing comes to mind. 

There is nothing here. I look around and I see "beauty" but it's not fulfilling. None of it is. This entire life is like that of the sound just before a song starts playing on a record player. Static. Eager anticipation but nothing of substance that follows. 

Maybe I'm not willing to put in the work. Maybe nothing is worth the work. You ever feel your face pinched in an expression like stone? A facial expression devoid of life or joy or zest. Perpetual disinterest. This might seem silly but I remember Elon musk saying it in that recent podcast something like "I'd rather be optimistic and wrong, instead of pessimistic and right". I'd just rather not feel. 

It's like I start to get sad and remind myself... What is there really to be sad about?  

Just riffing and felt like expressing myself.
