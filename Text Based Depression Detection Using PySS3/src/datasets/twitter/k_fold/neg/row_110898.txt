What if you survive? Better to get help...I was suicidal AF (again) a couple years ago and now am at a high point in my life. I wanted to share an unusual survival strategy that Ive never seen elsewhere. 

Im going to keep this as vague, succinct, and low-triggery as possible. 

OK so here is the thing. There is no 100% chance of death with suicide attempts.

A lot of methods have a very high probability you will live and be in more pain, possibly with a new disability, and with a new horrible memory. 

I did research. The more I learned the more I realized there is no easy way out. 

The only way forward is to do a lot of hard work with a lot of help to have the best life you can and cope with the pain. 

I thought I had no hope, I was wrong. Most people are wrong when they think that, people have survived some truly horrifying situations that seemed hopeless. Our negative thoughts are often liars.

but I get why pep talks feel empty. My way is very factual and concrete: if you attempt, there is a high likelihood you will end up just having another horrible week or more in a hospital, or worse. 

If you keep working on getting help, there is a high likelihood you will have better days in the future. 

Hopefully that helps someone. 

The rules didnt indicate this wouldnt be ok to post but if I missed something sorry about that. 

Please do not describe any suicide methods or anything like that in comments, thanks. 

wishing you peace, health, and happiness.
