I don't want to play this game anymore.It's all just too painful. I keep fighting battles that I can't win. It hurts. I have tried to do everything I could, constantly get doors slammed in my face, constantly get opposition from every angle.

I try everything I can, I try to be happy, I try to be outgoing, to be polite, to take care of myself, to workout, to work hard at my job. None of it gets me anywhere. I've just dealt with the pain for so long and I am sick of being in pain, actual physical pain from this every day.

I hate myself, for not being who the world seems to want. I've tried so hard to be that but I'm just me and no one wants that. Hell, I wouldn't either. The only time anyone has wanted me is if I can give them something, or they can take advantage of me. I never just feel, loved, like who I am is okay.

I just don't want to be here anymore and be sad anymore. Anything I want is unattainable, anything I feel is wrong, everything about my existence is wrong. I just don't want to do this anymore.
