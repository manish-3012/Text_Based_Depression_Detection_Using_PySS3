I'm going to do itI thought I'd make it farther. Getting a new car, having a decent job. Getting accepted into a college I wanted to go to. I thought things were getting better. But nothing can ever be too good. I'm only 18. Its always in the moment when I realize that sinking feeling. This feeling like I'm being watched. The feeling of failure and sadness. I love my girlfriend but I'm not enough. I  love my family they never did anything wrong. I love them all. I just can't take it anymore. This feeling just doesn't go away. Maybe they'll see this. I'm crazy. This world don't need me. I'd be doing the world a favor. Goodbye
