A sadness you canâ€™t explain?the first thought whenever something goes bad or wrong is just to kill myself. i hate it so much. i donâ€™t know where my life is taking me but every night it always feels like too much.   i truly thought my ex was the love of my life, and when she left me it was like a weight taken off of my chest. iâ€™m a better person for it but it left me scarred. the abuse. it just basically left me unable to trust anyone. 

so my closest friends never know the pain that i go through because i know everyone feels the need to blab. maybe it isnâ€™t like that? but thatâ€™s just the way that i feel. i just donâ€™t think itâ€™s possible for me to trust anyone that iâ€™ve known. so no one ever knows that iâ€™m suffering and always expects me to be happy and be there for them when i can barely keep my head above water. 

but at the end of the day. when i try to put my sadness into words i canâ€™t. thereâ€™s no combination for it. i just donâ€™t want to be here anymore you know? i donâ€™t want to exist. iâ€™ve thought about it too much lately. it sucks. 

thanks for listening
