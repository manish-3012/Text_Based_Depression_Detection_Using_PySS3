I hate that people want me aliveI wanna fucking die soooo fucking bad. But I can't leave the people I've tricked into loving me. I tell them all the time they'll get tired of me. They need to end the relationship. They need to cut me off. Be done with all the fabricated drama I cause for attention. But they always latch on to me harder. I fucking hate it. Fuck. I miss being a normal person. Funny, charismatic, still ugly but at least I had confidence. I miss him so much. My best friend is mourning his grandmother and I'm supposed to be there to support him. Instead my mind is buried in my head as I mourn my grandfather and my old self. It's unfortunate timing. I'm a terrible friend and I hope they see that someday so I can leave forever.
