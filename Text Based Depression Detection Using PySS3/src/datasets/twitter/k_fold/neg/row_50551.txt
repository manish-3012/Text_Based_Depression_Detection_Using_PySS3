I'm not necessarily "there" yet, but i feel like i soon might be.I guess I just need to vent.

I turn 21 in a few weeks. And I just know that everyone around me will act like they care. They don't care. They don't know how I am really feeling inside, and I know that's on me for not seeking help. But I just don't think it's fair to put my feelings into someone's brain just so they can be forced to care about me. I really don't have the strength to seek help to begin with.

I've been depressed for the past two years and I never thought about commiting suicide. I always felt like it would've gotten better by now, but it hasn't. It's slowly but gradually getting worse. And I feel like my birthday will be my last.

I've been fantasizing jumping off a bridge, while I reminisce before I do so. Part of me thinks it'll never happen, because I'm too scared to. But I can't help but feel like it might just happen.

It's tough for me to have this much family around, and loathe that they aren't the family I thought they were growing up. I always felt like family was everything. But as I got older and after my parents got divorced, it's shattered that perspective. My family was never close to begin with anyways, and it's certainly not close now.

I don't know anymore. I just feel lonely and helpless. I just needed to vent.
