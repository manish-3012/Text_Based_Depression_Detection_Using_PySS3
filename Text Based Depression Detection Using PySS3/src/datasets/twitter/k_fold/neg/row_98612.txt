I feel like I've failed at life. College was my only hope at being happy but that is gone now.I really just can't take it anymore. I've been writing in a notebook recently about my life and all the times I have messed up. I want to try to keep it short here so it doesn't get to boring. I'm 16 right now and have been depressed my whole life. I have no friends, never been invited to any parties, never had a girlfriend, never got to do anything fun as I've been growing up. I thought it would all get better when I went to college. My parents wanted me to be a doctor but that won't ever happen now. I've been flunking out of high school and don't think I can go to college anymore. I have a 2.9 gpa and my class rank is like 360 out of 520. College has really been my only hope for making friends and finally enjoying life but that is gone now. I just don't even know what to do anymore.


EDIT: Thank you all for the replies. It really returned my hopes of going to college some day. I had heard that it is a place where lots of people with depression change for the better and I hope that will happen for me someday. I just don't want to end up living the rest of my life the way I currently am.
