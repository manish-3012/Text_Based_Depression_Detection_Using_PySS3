I donâ€™t feel anything anymoreI feel lost. Nothing. Just a empty f**king person drifting through life. Grades going down, I feel shitty to my friends, just f**cking not making any efforts since what the point if life is going to get harder from here. I feel like an arrogant person since I display all sign of high ego (not caring, not good enough so why try) and I feel like a person who lost all hope. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to a place that I personally chose to be the best only for me to feel lost. Anybody else feel this ?
