What is the point of living if you can't be happy after many attempts of trying to change my life or myself? I can't find a reason to stay alive anymore. Nothing or no-one matters. All i've been doing lately is planning my own suicide. Sorry, not "lately" i meant about 7 years now. And the urge becomes stronger and stronger each time a new day comes. I'm soo tired, tired of life. I can't even think straight anymore.

Yeah i'm calling tomorrow to go and seek help btw. Because i think that i'm at my breaking point. The only reason why i haven't commited suicide yet is because i didn't want to go through the hassle of killing myself. But tbh i don't care anymore.
