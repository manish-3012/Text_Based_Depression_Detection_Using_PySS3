Wrote this whilst at a very low point; Iâ€™m really sad right nowðŸ˜What is life but more pain to suffer? 
Suffering in life is more than pain.
My weakness drags me further and further down.
The further down, the weaker I get.

Why should I continue to go on?
When going on in itself is in question.
No one to speak to, to loosen the hurt.
I get angry, anger to hurt.

When all I see is despise.
In all of their eyes.

Hungry, oh so hungry.
I canâ€™t wait to be hungry no more.

Already their eyes see me, askance
How would they see me if they knew?
My flaws and follies, they could subdue
Me with words, heavyset arms armed with 
my weakness

The world continues, life is grey and colour 
The world over shines anew.
They might gasp 
For a day or two at least

Then, as tears subside
So does their caring
And their memories, dim as my own light
Not quite as bright
As the day I was born

A sweet, sweet baby
Once loved, he feels it no longer
If only he understood or knew what heâ€™d been given
Could appreciate it just once or twice

Then everyone would know, 
But he cannot, and down I go
Into a pit of emotional pain
I donâ€™t understand
But YOU do
