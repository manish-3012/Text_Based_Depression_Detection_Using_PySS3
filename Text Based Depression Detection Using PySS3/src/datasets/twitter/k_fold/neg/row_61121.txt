Parking lot Golden Gate BridgeIdk where to start or if I even want to give my sob story on the internet.  I came back to visit San Francisco to try to find some purpose or meaning and only had all my insecurities and anxieties further validated. I don't belong, I will die alone, but will I let society slowly choke me of happiness, joy and life over a lifespan or will I check out on my own terms? I just wish I had never existed and ever impacted anyone's life in the first place. I've had everything at at least one point in my life, how do I mess everything up every time, I don't get it. It's not the world, it's me, I need to go.
