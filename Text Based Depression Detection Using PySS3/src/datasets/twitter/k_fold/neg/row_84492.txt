My dog saved my life. Looking back on it, I wish he was still here.3 years ago I was wildly depressed, distancing myself from friends, family, everything. One day, in the summer(excuse the illusivness but any memory past 2 years for me is faded and blurred) I decided I had enough and sent to the garage to grable my father's old rifle. I cant even begin to explain what I was thinking at that time but whatever it was it was better than being alive. Only thing that has me typing here today is the fact that my dog must have overheard the crying coming from the garage. No barking no scratching at the door, somehow, some way, my dog opened the door(circle door handle, not somthing a chocolate lab should be able to open). He just came up to me lying on the garage floor crying and layed down on top if me. A year later, that dogs end came, he had a good run tho, made it to 15. I woke up one day and gathered my snowboarding shit and as I was about to leave, I overheard some panting. The second he saw me walk into the room, the panting turned into full on heaving, and I instantly knew it was his time. I just sat their with him in my arms. The dog I grew up with, he was as old as I was. From birth to death, always there. The one being on this planet that saved my life has been gone for so long now. I'll never forget the name. Only thing is, I've felt different since then. 3 years, but different.
