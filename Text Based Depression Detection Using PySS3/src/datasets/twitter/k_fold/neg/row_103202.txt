My life is a fucking mess, I'm drowning in stress, and I want to die.Let me preface this by saying I'm not at the imminent risk stage - I've lost friends to suicide and my soon to be ex husband lost his dad. I have two young kids. So I'm holding on to my personal moral objections harder than anything else right now.

That said... I want to die. I think about it all the time. My life has gone to shit and I just want it to end. I'm getting a divorce, my new relationship is a constant source of stress because I'm trying to hide my depression from him, I'm barely keeping myself motivated in school, I'm very nearly blind and facing the prospect of an eye surgery that risks blinding me, I can't make enough money to support myself freelancing because I'm overwhelmed by waves of anxiety and apathy by turns, I'm supposed to be getting my own apartment soon and I've never lived alone, I'm in pain all the time, I'm constantly isolated because of the whole almost blind/can't drive/stay at home parent thing.

I found myself laying in the tub debating how I could kill myself that would be easiest for the EMTs to deal with and came to the conclusion that even in death I'd be too much of an inconvenience and burden to bear so I'd better not.

I don't have time or transportation to get in therapy, but I don't know how much longer I can keep pushing ahead like everything is all right.
