Do I tell someone about my friend ??I myself suffer with depression the idea of suicide but this has been ongoing since I was 14 I'm now 27 . So It feels almost normal I'm used to it used to my patterns and with the last year I suffer mostly with anxiety now but can drift but I feel somewhat In control which I'm happy with. I've never really told my friends they seem to never get it bar one . Shes my best friend witn 13 years now but lately I've noticed her mood is low . I asked her about it and she broke down completely broke down she said she dosnent know why she is always anxious etc but one thing she seemed to make clear in a off the topic way was how suicide is so horrible for those left behind and couldn't imagine it etc but to me that's a worry . When I was having low points I would say similar things but yet be thinking of how I would kill myself later that night . What do I do ? I feel so lost as to how to help her , shes a private person but i feel this is something to important to just let slide by . Do I tell another of our friends? But then I'm breaking her trust even tho she didnf tell me not to tell anyone it's a given . I've sent her on some pages I use for my anxiety that help but I still feel like I don't know .. advice would be much appreciated
