No Longer Have Anything To Live ForThis time it feels different. I knew what it was like not being alone for the first time. Now that I no longer have that I feel empty. Moreso than I already did. I've always had thoughts of suicide, but I've tried to get help. But now I no longer see a point in trying. I'm not going to kill myself, I'm just not going to care at all anymore about trying to do anything. Life can do whatever it wants with me now. Nothing can be or feel worse than this.
