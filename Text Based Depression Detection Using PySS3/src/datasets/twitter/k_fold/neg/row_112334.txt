The weird excitement of finding a suicide methid that you think you can do..It seems like a relief. The end of everything. I think I've found it. It just requires a little work. But it's not that much work and if I actually put myself to it, I feel I  could have a decent chance of succeeding. No half assed attempts that I stop because I'm afraid of the pain or living and explaining everything. I'm just too tired for this world. This is the best option.
