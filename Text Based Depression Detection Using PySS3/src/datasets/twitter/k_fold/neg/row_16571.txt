Have you ever had a relationship with a suicidal partner and been able to have a good relationship with him/her when things got better ?Hey guys! Throwaway account fyi. 

My girlfriend and I've been together for the last 2 years. She's always been depressed since I met her. I tried everything to help her but a couple of months ago she tried to commit suicide. 

Luckily I understood something was wrong and could seek medical attention so she could survive. 

Since then I'm still doing everything to keep her alive and get better. Sometimes it's good some times it's back on the suicide trail. She is seeing a psychiatrist and is also medicated. 

I've read a lot of people writing on different subs about an SO who was suicidal. And every story I've read has ended in 2 ways. 1. Suicide and 2. Breakup.

Now I love my GF and I'm living on the hope that she will get better and we'll have the life we deserve with each other . 

But recently I've started to think if it's actually possible together after everything. I've never read or heard someone stay together after everything.

Sorry if I've miswritten anything, English is not my mothertounge.

Tl;Dr: has anyone lasted with a suicidal partner until things got better
