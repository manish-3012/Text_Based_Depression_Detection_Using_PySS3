I give up, I said I wasn't going to but I've finally gave up. I said yesterday I couldn't commit suicide because of my family but after today I don't think I care anymore

I went to work and was treated like shit by everyone, I come home and get treated like shit by my family, no one cares, why would they, I've gave up, this isn't a suicide note, this is me letting you know, even after everyone's help nothing has helped after all, there isn't a point anymore.
