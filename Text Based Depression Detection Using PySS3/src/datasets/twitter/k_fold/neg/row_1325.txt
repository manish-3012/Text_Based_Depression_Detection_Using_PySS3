Cannot think of a reason to keep goingJust completely alone. Lost the girl I love to another guy. Can't think of a person that would ever be there for me. No friends, only child. I have absolutely nothing, and all I constantly think about is how if I were to die, it would mean nothing because I am nothing. People that said they would always be there aren't. Unable to make myself happy. If I could sleep forever I would because dreams are the only escape. Waking up knowing that I'm alone is just the worst. Suicide seems to be the only option for ending things.
