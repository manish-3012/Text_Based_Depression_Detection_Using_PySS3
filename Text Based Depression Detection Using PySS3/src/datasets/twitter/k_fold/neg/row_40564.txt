i dont know what to doBeen feeling like shit this whole year. Been wanting to die since then. Today, I've been harrased by random stranger, during on my way back to home. I dont know what to do. Ive called everyone, but no one answer. I dont know what to do. I dont know anymore. Among so many people, it was me that he choose. Why, just f*cking why, dammit. Should I make a police report? But it will make everything complicated. The moments that thing happened, my mind went blank. I dont know anymore. Oh God, why me? I can still feel the hands on me. I hate this world. I hate those people. What should I do? Coming home like nothing happened is hard. Been smiling since entering the house when you feel like crying is so damn hard. I should not been crying. I cant cry, it will make everything seems suspicious. The moment I want to take a step forward, it just seems like happines is not meant for me. Every single time. Just, what should I really do.
