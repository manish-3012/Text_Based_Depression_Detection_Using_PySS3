I want to kill my selfIâ€™m at a point in my life (18) when I have nothing left to live for. I have my parents but they would get over it...I donâ€™t have any friends, people just donâ€™t seem to like me. I donâ€™t want to get a career and have to live an adult life, it all just seems so horrible. I have nothing left to live for And Iâ€™m not being dramatic, I just donâ€™t have anything and I really want to kill myself...
