I'm 3 years free from addiction and suicidal thoughts, my message to othersI'm a former Ukrainian soldier, I moved to Australia, got into a drug and alcohol addiction, I started to get suicide thoughts and a deep depression. My message to other is stay strong, seek someone who will listen and help. I was lucky enough to meet someone who I would eventually marry. So to every suicidal person out there,you are loved and stay strong
