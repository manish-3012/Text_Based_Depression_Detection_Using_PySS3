Decade long struggle. No self-harmIâ€™ve been struggling with a romanticized daydream. I wake up every morning thinking about putting a gun in my mouth and pulling the trigger. 

This has been occurring for nearly ten years now at different intervals. I find it especially prevalent in times of distress, which escalates to feelings of inadequacy and self-loathing, More often than not, these perversions manifest themselves when I make any sort of mistake or sense conflict or uncertainty in a relationship, whether platonic or romantic. 

I do not have plans of ever acting on this fantasy of an urge. I find that I default to anger in times of discomfort or uncertainty, and in turn, direct that anger inward which results in this projection. 

I recently told my partner about this phenomenon and she did not react well. She sobbed. She said it will take a while for her to process and adjust to this. She felt deceived because I am an extroverted individual with exemplary charisma, humor and charm, yet I struggle with this very emotional preoccupation. I love and want a future with person, but she has expressed nothing but fear in the wake of my revelation. 

I donâ€™t know what I am searching for in this post. I donâ€™t need comfort. I see a professional weekly about my issues. I am growing tried of having to explain to others that this is, though immensely concerning, an improbable likelihood.
