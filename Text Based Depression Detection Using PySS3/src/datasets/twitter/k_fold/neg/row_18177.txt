PlanI'm only gonna try &amp; overdose enough to get me hospitalized because no one will bat an eye at me and/or give a shit about my mental health unless I kill myself, school is stressful, having so many responsibilities is stressful and just being alive makes me want to die. I truly will never be happy and no one cares, everyone leaves, I let the walk away and hurt me. I just want a break from life, I feel like i'm gonna snap on everyone and I just feel so low and angry all the time. I'm miserable, life for me is an everlasting game that repeats everyday. life just kicks you in the ass no matter what you do. I feel like life after trying to attempt is never gonna be the same, my parents/family will never look at me the same and throw me a pity party and then get angry at me for being "selfish",  there's no fucking escape from anything. I guess I'll just take a couple of pills, call the police or something and say what I did, go to the hospital, and so on, I'm just sick of living like this and I want it to stop, maybe I'll actually die and it'd be 10x better.
