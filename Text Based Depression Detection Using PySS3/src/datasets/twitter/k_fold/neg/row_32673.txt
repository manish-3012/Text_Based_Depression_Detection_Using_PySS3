I just don't understand.Every day it's the same cycle, wake up feeling somewhat ok, remember I have no future or ambition, become slowly melancholy towards lunchtime, try to reach out to my one or two friends. Realise I'm just venting and hate myself for annoying them, get angry at myself and tell them to leave me alone when being alone is the last thing I want. Spend hours staring at my phone and crying until I'm so tired I can't stay up anymore, planning to end it all because it's not getting better and then I wake up the next day. Repeat ad-infinitum. It's like some sick joke. I just want it to stop.
