Maybe my friend is suicidal?Hi! I have a friend of about a year that recently told me that he had some thoughts about killing himself, not in a direct way but like â€œif I jumped in front of that car, what would happen?â€ And if it would feel nice to just die, that you donâ€™t have anything to worry about anymore. Something about how he made it seem like a good thing made me worried. He told me he only had these thought like twice or something (he didnâ€™t give me an exact number) but I still feel like the thoughts are kinda real (in a way that he actually might do it, but not really). 
It also made me scared that he talked about how itâ€™s good that we arenâ€™t allowed  to own guns in our country. I told him to talk to someone that know this stuff and he said he would look it up but wasnâ€™t sure if he wanted to do it. He said he trusts me and I donâ€™t want to break his trust by telling someone, especially since Iâ€™m not sure if he actually wants to do it. 

Now I feel like itâ€™s my responsibility but Iâ€™m not sure on what to do? I donâ€™t know this kind of stuff, Iâ€™ve never had these kind of thoughts myself so I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s normal and not. 
And to top it all of I feel like I donâ€™t have the energy and time to properly support him because of school and I feel kinda stressed out about everything. 
What should I do?
