For the first time in my life, I am considering suicide as an optionI am tired. I feel so exhausted with everything. My family, my girlfriend, the recession etc.

My parents are being a huge problem. My father doesn't respect us as a family and just starts shouting at the top of his voice when we try to have a simple conversation. My mother cries everyday and calls me to share her pain. I live in a different country, halfway around the world. I try to get on calls and diffuse the tension, but it is getting on my nerves. Last night, my dad just yelled at me said he's never going to talk to me and started abusing my mom verbally. This has been happening for 25 years now. He just doesn't care about us and doesn't treat us well at all. He just assumes that if he brings money home, he gets to treat us like anything he wants. I begged my mom to move out and stay away from him for a bit, but she doesn't want to do it. 

My girlfriend is very caring. She's been on a dieting programme for almost a year now and doesn't eat anything that has carbs. So, everytime I eat something that I like, but she can't she just shares my food and later complains that she ate it. So, I try to tell her to consider stopping if she's not getting a control of herself. But the moment I try to help her, she starts yelling at me saying I have no right to tell her to not eat something. If I want to say anything about it, she just wants me to stop eating what I want to so that she doesn't eat it. But at the same time she says I shouldn't sacrifice what I want to eat. Am I doing something very wrong here?   


The company I work for is in layoffs mode and I could lose my job, since I am an entry level employee. If I do, I will only have 60 days to get a new job before the Immigration kicks me out. I am so stressed that I don't eat anything these days on time. I don't like this phase of my life. I don't like myself.   


I just feel so depressed that I have no friends that I can talk about this to. My family is conservative and I can't say these to them and they won't understand. The last time I tried to say things, they brushed it off. These are the things that just happened in the last 12 hours. For the first time ever, I considered killing myself last night. I was lying in my bed crying, powerless and hopeless, unable to share my family pain with my girlfriend and the girlfriend issues with anyone else.  


I really don't want to die and feel like this anymore. Please save me!
