I just need a hug at this pointI am so tired.


I know people donâ€™t hate me, itâ€™s my mind lying to me.


I know my mind lies to me slog but I am so tired.



I know I should just call someone up but honestly I am not really gonna kill my self anytime soon this week so I donâ€™t want to wake them up at 12 am just because I felt useless and worthless and like they hate me but they somehow are stuck with me cause I have alcohol and other connections for them to get high and party. 



I canâ€™t even let myself call them my friends now cause honestly I know myself, I am not gonna let them get near me and even if they do I am gonna run away. 


I am so exhausted of being alone and feeling like every single person who sees me, hates me that I just canâ€™t do this alone.




Honestly, I miss the days when I had the guts to suicide. I wish my first OD actually killed me instead of me puking tf out.



I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s true anymore. Was my mom even abusive or was I just an over sensitive kid or it was just normal for all parents to be like that?



But hey I keep remembering the first time I wanted to kill my self (or that I remember of). I was 5 years old, it was my sisterâ€™s birthday. All the cousins were there and my aunts and uncles. My sister used to always hit me (and she is 2 years younger than me) and that day she tripped infront of everyone in the family because she and I were playing a game and running. 



I donâ€™t even know why my dad scolding me (for something I didnâ€™t do) made me want to die so badly.




I remember the day my sister had to go to doctor because of a trap I set up for my mother, so she could stop hurting me and possibly be injured enough to stop making me want to kill myself. 



I donâ€™t even know why but I have always hated myself and wanted to kill myself. Itâ€™s all I remember. The earliest memory of me being suicidal is when I was 5 years old, I am almost 19 now and I just hope I had done it correctly atleast once because now I canâ€™t attempt anymore. I am too tired for that. I canâ€™t do that again. 


So I am just forced to exist, I am addicted to cutting once again, I am addicted to smoking also. But hey atleast I reduced the drinking to numb everything out.
