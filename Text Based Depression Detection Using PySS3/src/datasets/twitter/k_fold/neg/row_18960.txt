Getting hard to stay positive when you realize only 3 people in my life would care if I was goneAnd all 3 of those people are family members.

Maybe 4 if I include someone online but he'd probably forget about it eventually. And I hate that I have another year of school left cause I know each day I'm gonna be at the bus stop thinking "What if I just put my head under the bus when it comes by" just like I did this school year
