There's nothing leftI don't want anything life has to offer, no path contains anything worth traveling it for. If it's a race with no rules why follow the track of you can take a shortcut. If lifes just the way it is and we have to deal with it, why isn't suicide a valid way to do that. It's not like I'd miss anything, nor will other people. I dont want to do anything for anyone and no one want to do anything back, we're all just miserable objects taking the pain of existence and pretending we're fine. Can't life be something better than this massive waste of time.
