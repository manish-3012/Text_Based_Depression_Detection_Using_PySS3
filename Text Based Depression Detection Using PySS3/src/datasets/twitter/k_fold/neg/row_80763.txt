I donâ€™t want to live but I donâ€™t want to dieDoes anyone else feel this way? Iâ€™ve been at a low point in life for a while now. I have many thoughts about not being alive and killing myself but Iâ€™m not sure if id ever be able to go though with it. Iâ€™d had to disappoint my family but also donâ€™t see a point in being alive if I hate living
