I stay up all night and sleep all day. Feel tired all the timeFeels like the only way Iâ€™ve managed to get through a lot of days is by sleeping through them. I always feel exhausted when Iâ€™m awake. But for some reason I donâ€™t feel as outright depressed when Iâ€™m awake at night, even though Iâ€™m still tired itâ€™s like the exhaustion makes it harder to be sad, and maybe because I donâ€™t have to see so many people.

I wish I could give my body to someone whoâ€™s dying and wants to keep living. I hate living. And Iâ€™m an absolute failure of a human being.p, and I canâ€™t enjoy anything. Every waking day is just anxiety and depression and wishing I was brave and motivated enough to end my life.
