Hi!First time posting here and honestly too distraught to read the rules- been crying on and off for almost 14 hours but the big jag was for six hours.

My work seriously triggered me today and I ended with a welfare and a bunch of well meaning but time consuming friends. My boss is so toxic. I canâ€™t think of a permanent (no suicide) is ay out. Iâ€™ve grappled with depression over the years and am very proactive in learning new strategies.

Today was too much- itâ€™s a long story, but my boss wanted me to write out the details of my child rape and molestation (25 years later), because I asked for a schedule change and detailed major reasons (such as currently trying to my abuser prosecuted) and he felt I should write a mass email to my coworkers to get someone to swap a class with me. Which is his job- heâ€™s even changed the classes I teach two days before school has started before.

All I can say is people do not give a fuck even in education. So glad that my struggles with PTSD should be used to play the victims card to ask for a schedule change.

Talked to the union, itâ€™s legal. Got upset. Made some stupid comments. Boss called a welfare check. When the police didnâ€™t take me away- my request for leave by my psychiatrist was denied.

Well at least schools donâ€™t really believe in mental health or supporting pediatric sex victims. Yay.
