Life has never been easyLast week my Husband moved out. I have kids, none of which are home over the weekend. My life has been full of mistakes, regrets, loss and pain. Tonight I feel so very alone. In a home we made together. I don't think I can actually do it, but man do I want to. I've caused so much pain for my family. What is my purpose?
