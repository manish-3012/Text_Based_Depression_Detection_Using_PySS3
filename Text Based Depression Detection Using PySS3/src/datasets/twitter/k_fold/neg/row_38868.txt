I'm a really shitty human and I deserve itI really want to end it right now. I've not been in a dark place like this hardly in my life, a couple times when the thought slipped through my mind, but I never acted on it. I'm still really doubtful I would act on it but I really want to. I went through a couple abusive relationships and then I met a guy who was nice to me. But I am really messed up and I ended up seeing one of my abusive exs after he contacted a couple times. I know it was the stupidest thing I could of possibly done and I don't know what was making me think that was a good idea. The guy I was with was devastated and I know he's really hurt over it. I had such a good guy finally and all I did was go back to the abusive ones. I don't know what's wrong with me but I feel so awful and I just want to punish myself as hard as I can.
