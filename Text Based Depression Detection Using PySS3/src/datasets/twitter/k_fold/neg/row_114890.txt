I don't even know if this belongs here, but I need help, and fastSomeone I know said they wanted to kill themselves after they had a near breakup with their significant other. This was about an hour ago. I was on the phone with them when they got really upset and hung up and I have not seen a trace of them since. I have tried contacting them this entire time through various means. I don't know about calling the police because if the threat wasn't serious I don't want an over-response. And I might be overreacting. Please help.
