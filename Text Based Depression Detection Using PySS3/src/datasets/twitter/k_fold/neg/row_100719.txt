First TimerSeeing other posts in this subreddit makes me look like it's not really that big of a problem, but oh well...

Recently, as a foreigner of the USA, I've applied to go to a boarding school in the United States, to pursue my dreams as a future engineer in Silicon Valley. 
My parents nearly spent 20K for travel expense/admissions. 
The SSAT scores just came out, which is the equivalent of an SAT, but for highschools, and it's pretty bad. I feel like "what's the point?"  if I can't go to a boarding school in US? Living in my country is a hellhole, where everything is extremely competitive, and even if you succeed, engineers are disrespected in this fucking country.

I've let my parents down, and myself. I feel like my parents have done so much, while I did so little. The results of admission isn't going to come out any soon, but I feel like jumping off before that comes.
