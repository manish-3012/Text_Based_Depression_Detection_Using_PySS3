I literally have everything handed to me and I still fuck up.Wasted my fathers hard earned saved money for me to go to college debt free and fucked up every year and now Im done with the fourth year which i fucked up on as well and dad already told me three times not to mess up. I just want to leave earth right now. Im a piece of shit and a waste of space and my parents deserve a hard working child that doesnt waste their money. I just feel like I want to go away and never come back. I don't deserve to be in a good mood or to eat or do anything.
