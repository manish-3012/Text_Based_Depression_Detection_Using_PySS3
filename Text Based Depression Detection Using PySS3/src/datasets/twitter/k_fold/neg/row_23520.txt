DrowningI am 19. I made friends for first time and found self identity last summer, got scared, sabotaged every relationship at the small college this past semester. I cant go back from paranoia (have another post with more info). My parents will overwhelm me with guilt and anger. I have shut everything down from pain. I cant go through peoples' layers to find trust and emotional intimacy. I have suffered too much since elementary school. There is nothing left for me I 'have potential' but I have no options and everything is surreal and I am drowning. I remember when this subreddit had less posts than every hour. I cannot bring a child into this world because I will pass down dysfunction, distrust, depression, substance abuse, similar to my family line. I am not defined by them but I have nothing and my mind has become so dark. Mental hospitals, therapists, have not helped, there is a long dark tunnel with decreasing oxygen I will fall down until I can die. I read a quote saying how death is the rarest experience and to sleep through it would be a waste. I am not planning, so dont report, but I am not afraid of death. I wish I never existed, I am a perfectly designed curse to point out my parents flaws as they mourn my downfall and watch peers less genetically intelligent surpass me. I am paralyzed, with anger, almost completely hopeless. I dont see how I can move past or ahead, everything is pain, I have no one.
