Tired of myself Iâ€™m fucking tired of this illness. It always seems like Iâ€™m getting better, and everything is different, but then it wins again.

 And Iâ€™m just tired. I canâ€™t stand it anymore. I think I hate it, or I hate myself for always coming back to the same place. 

 Iâ€™ve tried meeting new people but they end up getting away from me because of my instability. I end up loving people who donâ€™t love me back. Iâ€™m always searching for a hug that wonâ€™t come. 

I wonâ€™t change, like, ever, Iâ€™ll be always the miserable and coward person Iâ€™ve always been.

I just want it to be over, I canâ€™t deal with myself anymore.
