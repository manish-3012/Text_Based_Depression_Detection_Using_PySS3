I hate my body and all of my friends have left meI was born a boy but i wish i was a girl. Every day that i wake up and realise I'm going to be a boy that day makes me die a little inside. To top it off, all of my closest friends have suddenly moved school leaving me with no-one. I'm behind in school, I can't tell anyone my feelings and I've been suicidal for about two years now. I feel like I'm getting close to attempting suicide.
