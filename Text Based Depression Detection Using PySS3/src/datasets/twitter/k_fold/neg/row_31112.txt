I'm searching for a brother and idgaf how lame it soundsSmall summary I'm tried of pain and bullshit honestly I felt so much this way that I became used to it, therefore I don't plan to hang myself cuz I'm still young and yeah yeah whatever the fuck it happens from now on it happens but  all I care now is going forward with life no matter how many times because I realized as much as I'm crying afterwards all I remain with is a burning passion to step forward and hopefully make some progress no matter how small it is.

Also, I'm 19 nice to meet ya, I have only one requirement and that is, be by my side and I'll be by yours, let's have contact and now each other with all our problems and such, no shame, thanks
