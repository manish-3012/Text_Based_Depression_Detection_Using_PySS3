Idk if I want to live anymoreI'm not going to do it yet but I'm slowly going insane I'm going to put a bullet through my head when I'm old enough to move out. My parents are great people but I just got 2 of my bikes stolen that I saved all of my money up for so now I have to get a job and my mom told me I'm useless like my cousin and that I wont get a job. So now my dream of riding bmx for a living will never come true...
