Came to this sub for help, but it made me even more depressed as I read everyone else's...I read a few of the other posts before I finally clicked that submit button. I can't help but feel that everything is just shitty.

I have been working through all this in therapy, but I honestly think that everyone... Every single human who has ever existed, is selfish and ONLY does things that are self serving. We expect something back, even if you don't realize it. Sometimes you are making an "investment" into a relationship with someone, and expect to be able to gain something in the future.

This idea in my head has taken strong roots and is starting to shape my life... And I am finding it much harder to resist the urge to self harm... Or just do the big one. I am laying in bed now, craving to cut... But I haven't... Yet, at least.

My life is going nowhere and I have no income and severe disabilities but would never get approved for disability benefits because they have a huge bias with younger people... I was lucky enough to not be homeless, but this situation lasts 6 months (if it even lasts) and I have no one. Family is shitty, I'm divorced, no job, no income, no home or car... Very limited (if any at all) ability to "get a job" but I am trying to figure out a business idea... But then I struggle cuz... Why even put in the effort?

I should just get it done with this evening and be done with it... Solves all my problems

tl;dr - I'm suicidal.
