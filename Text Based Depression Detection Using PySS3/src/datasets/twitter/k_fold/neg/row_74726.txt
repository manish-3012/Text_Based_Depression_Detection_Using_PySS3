Struggling to connect with a therapist.I've emailed and called several offices. It's been a week and no response. I desperately want help. I want out of this but no one's picking up and I'm so distressed. I have someone who will help pay for treatment but it's fucking pointless if I can't even get help. How on Earth do you get a psychologist or therapist to contact you back? I've been struggling for weeks...
