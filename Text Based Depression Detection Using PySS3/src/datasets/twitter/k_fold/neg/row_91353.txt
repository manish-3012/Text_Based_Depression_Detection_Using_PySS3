(T.W.) suicide joke from a suicidal ideot (#way too relatable)Them: "do your [school] work"

Me:"i don't care about my education"

Them: "why not"

Me: "because it doesn't matter, we're all gonna die anyways."
Me (under my breath): "*some of us sooner than others*"

Them: "what did you say?"

Me: "we're all gonna die anyways?"

Them: "no, after that"

Me: "i didn't say anything, you sure you're ok?"
