This morning is my time to flyI know that if I go to bed, I'll wake up with just enough will to make it through the day. But I don't want that, I just want to be done with this life. So I'll be here all night, writing a few goodbyes and getting my shit in order for whatever poor soul will have to clean out my apartment.

And in the morning, I jump.
