if my parents see my grades, itâ€™s either being homeless, or dyingIâ€™ve been suicidal for a while.  Iâ€™ve gotten therapy and treatment for it.  I got admitted a few times and they seemed to work but only temporary.  Everything just gets worse.  And I canâ€™t get therapy or anything like it rn.  And hotlines make me feel even worse.  My abusive ex trying to contact me again put me over the edge.  I put this idea in my head that if things get too hard, then I can just attempt again.  Well then I started another year in college.  And everything just kind of caved in.  I skipped one day of school and now I canâ€™t stop.  Once again, Iâ€™ve completely given up like the weak person I am.  My life is going nowhere.  My parents wonâ€™t let me get a job again or else theyâ€™ll kick me out.  Theyâ€™re only letting me stay with him until college is over with.  But I donâ€™t fucking want to be here.  I donâ€™t want to go to class anymore.  I just want to die or waste away.  If I go through more college, and finish my degree (if I get my shit together), Iâ€™ll get kicked out anyways and will be homeless.  Itâ€™s inevitable.  I have nobody to stay with and I donâ€™t trust people anymore.  So I just want to die but there are these small little things that make me want to stay.  But I canâ€™t because Iâ€™ve already dug myself into a fucking hole.  If my parents see my grades (two Fs, completely zeros), theyâ€™ll kick me out.  And since I donâ€™t want to go through being homeless again, I just want to die.  Nobody will miss me.  I have nobody.
