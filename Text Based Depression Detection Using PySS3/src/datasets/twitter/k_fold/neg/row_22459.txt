Never have I meant it as I do today when I say "I want to die."I'm scared as I might lose the thing I love most. The thing that keeps me alive. That gives me structure. Purpose. Happiness. Joy. That encourages me to work hard. That encourages me to go through hell. That encourages me to fight the good fight. That's kept me at the top of my game. That's enabled me to be myself. I might lose that thing forever. I can't go for more than 3 days without it or else I feel I'll literally explode like a hydrogen bomb.
