Feeling so alone doesnâ€™t help the suicidal thoughtsHi all, 

Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression for 7 years now and have had suicidal thoughts for 6 years. I thought I had it under control now but itâ€™s all come back 

I graduated high school about a month and a half ago and it was supposed to be a happy day. Itâ€™s an achievement that I stayed alive long enough to see the day, but I knew what was going to happen. My friends and I would start to drift away as we all go our separate ways. I was expecting it, but not like this. 

I have absolutely no one. Iâ€™ve tried to stay in contact with everyone and already, no one wants anything to do with me. The person I call my best friend keeps cancelling any plans I try to make so she can be with her boyfriend. All my friends went to a concert last night, without me. Itâ€™s one of my favorite artists, they know I wouldnâ€™t mind going or anything. 

Jesus Christ.
