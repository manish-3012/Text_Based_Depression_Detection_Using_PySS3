I think this is it.I felt like I was doing a lot better in my life. But my brother started mocking me for still caring about my friend who killed himself a couple years ago, and everyone laughed along. 

I'm feeling like at a certain point, it doesn't matter how much I try to be better when no one wants me around still.

I'm really scared that it won't work and I'll end up alive but trapped in a body that doesn't work. But I don't have any other immediate options. 

I don't even know why I'm bothering to post anymore
