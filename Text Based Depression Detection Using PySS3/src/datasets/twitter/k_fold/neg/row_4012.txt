Yup. Back in this mood.Everyday, at one last of the day I end up low low low. Can't get through the day. Can't get through the second. I need to sleep. Negative body image and esteem. Again I cry. I am doing nothing to get better. Even if something does make me kinda happy, who cares? Nothing means anything. It's just life. It's not a big deal. You life is your own destiny, your own reason, your own journey. If you end it, you end it. Who cares. You're barely alive anyway. In 200 years once everyone you know is dead. Your memory is forgotten. It's like you were never born anyway. Doesn't matter.

I'm not gonna do it but I really wish it would. Existence is overrated. Getting through the day is impossible without sleeping pills. I have to turn my phone off because I don't want to feel worse about myself. Every post, chat, viewing, item, reading, etc. Just makes me feel like shit on every aspect. But, idk how to spend the time before these pills kick in. Another day sleeping. I bet they stop working soon. I bet you don't read this. I bet it's a waste.

Sometimes I post something about how shitty I feel on Facebook. I was to spread my darkness and should people how dark I am. Not a cry for help, just their recognition that people are living like this. someone they know is this injured. But then I realize I'm a broken record and by now I bet they're sick of it. Just shut up and stop complaining, I bet they'd say. Kill me.


I'm going to beg to be treated for bipolar disorder. I have to last 8 more days like this until NY appointment. It is too much to handle.
