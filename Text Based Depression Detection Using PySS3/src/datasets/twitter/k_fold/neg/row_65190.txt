I want to kill myself by CO poisoning.I'm done... I can't take any more pain and anxiety. I've been depressed for years and I don't want to suffer anymore. I don't really want to die, but it's the only way to end the pain. There's no other option left... I think about suicide all the time. I've already tried to kill myself twice (by suffocation bag and by hanging/long drop), but I chickened out at the last moment both times. The first attempt was two years ago and the second one was two days ago.

I've recently read that CO (carbon monoxide) is odorless and therefore not easily detectable and that in high concentrations it can kill you relatively painlessly within very few minutes, since you become unconscious fast after taking a few breaths and your body doesn't realize it is inhaling it instead of oxygen.

So, does anyone know where I can find pure CO? I'd also like to know the amount I need to buy to do the job fast; I want it to end quickly and with as little agony as possible. I've had enough of this world... I finally want to find some peace!
