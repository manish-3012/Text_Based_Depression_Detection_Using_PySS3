i went to visit my sister for a weekend. she will be fine. she lost 65 lbs since i last saw her; example of how disconnected we are. my parents will be able to focus on her as well, so they will be fine.

i realize there is a lot i want to write down, things i learned, very basic things that society needs to focus on to be better. and i feel i should explain things so no one blames themself. with the lack of energy and focus i have right now it will take a few weeks to get it all out, no more than a month though. i also have some things to give back to people

i really just need support that wont come in my current circumstances and my life will never get easier

it isnt just depression. i cant get close to people. that wont change. and i realized any time i have tried to care about people i end up getting hurt. 

it has been an especially tough day today. deep sadness has tried to come up at least a dozen times today but every time in the past i have tried to open up i just get hurt, so i just cant

i let go of caring about having money to live as i wont be needing it soon

i thought i owed you all an update for putting time in writing, dont know if i will be responding
