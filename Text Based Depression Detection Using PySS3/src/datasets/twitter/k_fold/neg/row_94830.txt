I want to be gone.Im 18 turning 19 and im a failure.

I have no life skills or qualifications, I'm finishing college in less than two months and I'm going to fail my final project.  

I have a no job or any serious way of income. 

I feel like I have disappointed my entire family with my life sometimes stemming from the fact I smoke weed with my mates. 

I also feel so alone I can't even express how alone i feel, though I have people but I don't have anyone to actually speak with. 

I also have a girlfriend that I'm growing distant with everyday and if I lose her I don't know how I would react. 

My life is just miserable pain and torment. I can't process anything and I'm sad enough to believe people on the internet is my last resort.
