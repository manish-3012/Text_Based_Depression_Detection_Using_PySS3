I feel like giving upI'm tired, I'm numb, and I'm exhausted of trying. My whole life has been a battle with myself and other people. I want to give up, i want to let go. I have no family left who cares.
I have an amazing partner and dog. I should be so happy but the battle against myself is tiring and exhausting... Nothing works anymore....nothing.
I feel empty damn near all the time. I have stopped cutting myself for a year now but its also so exhausting to resist the urge to cut sometimes.
I have no supportive friends, i have only my partner and dog. I am grateful for them, but I'm so sad all the time. Most days its hard to get out of bed. I feel useless, hopeless and fucking TIRED.
I want to get better, i want to live. Every time i seek help it doesn't work or i get pushed away, so i quit searching.
I think my partner would be happier with another person who isn't too far gone to truly be happy and content. I think my soul is too damaged to be like that. I hate feeling numb, i hate it. And the empty feeling...it's just a hole in my stomach and heart.
I have bad anxiety and the depression is so bad on top of that. I also got diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder last year. That has been incredibly difficult to manage. I find it so hard to get out of the house and just feel like sleeping all day. I feel pretty much dead inside.
I don't know what to do anymore.
