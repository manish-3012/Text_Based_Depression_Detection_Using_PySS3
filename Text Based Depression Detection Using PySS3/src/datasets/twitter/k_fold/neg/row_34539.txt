No immediate danger here, but I think about suicide pretty often. Do me a solid, r/SuicideWatch, and help me see life as something ultimately worth living. Hearing of injustice infuriates me to no end. I have genuine respect for those who thwart the evils of oppression in all its forms. For example, subreddits like this are among the things that i deeply respect.

At the same time, I feel that it is nothing more than our **duty** as humans to help others. I don't think it is something to have pride about. It is our virtue as autonomous beings to help each other destroy the evils that plague society. I'm sure many of you would agree. 

For this reason, people who ignore, and especially people who perpetuate such injustices, drive me to more anger than anything else.

Furthermore, no matter what good people do, there is absolutely no way to eliminate all the evil on this planet. I will hear about toddlers being run over by cars today, domestic disputes ending in murder tomorrow, and heinous war crimes after that. No matter how many people I try to help, and the sense of satisfaction I get from helping even one person, the fact that injustice is so widespread everywhere outweighs this in my thoughts. 

I'm not depressed. I have many friends, and outwardly I'm extremely goofy and seemingly happy-go-lucky. Yet, the sheer inhumanity in the world causes me to occasionally entertain the thought of checking out from this world.

I live for others, but I personally would rather not live. Even the positive emotions I feel from my connections with other people don't outweigh this.
