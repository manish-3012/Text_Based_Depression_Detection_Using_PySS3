It just feel right. Like itâ€™s inevitable.I canâ€™t do a lot of things. I canâ€™t focus and my only real friend just said I was an asshole and is cutting contact. I donâ€™t fully understand why they took so long to tell me and why they didnâ€™t just talk it out. I think the fact that i canâ€™t understand that is just proof of it all. I canâ€™t think. I just want to die. There would be nothing left to worry about. I really want to. Iâ€™ve been fantasizing about it for weeks. Not a single person I know really likes me. Itâ€™s a problem with me, and I know that. Itâ€™s been so long I donâ€™t think it will be fixed. I thought I had improved a little bit but Iâ€™m still just an asshole. I really would just be doing a favor to the world. I donâ€™t have anything special about me to live for. The person who was my friend is just right. I am. Iâ€™m not going to get anywhere being an asshole. Iâ€™m sorry if anyone does get sad but I do think itâ€™d be a net positive. I tried to open up but then i was told that i only talk about myself. I didnâ€™t even realize I was doing that. Iâ€™m socially inept. I donâ€™t want someone to feel like Iâ€™m using them. Thatâ€™s the last thing Iâ€™d want them to feel. I get clingy sometimes too. Thatâ€™s my bad as well. Anyway, thatâ€™s all. Iâ€™m having like cathartic feelings when I imagine myself putting a bullet in the back of my throat or hanging on a noose. I would love to feel that. Iâ€™d love to get rid of all the feelings and Iâ€™d love to just unburden everybody.
