My suffering ruins other people's happinessAnd there's no shit I can do about it. My partner, my friends, my family, all of them are negatively affected by how pointless and depressing my existence is.

And even if I decided to end it all, they'd still suffer for my loss. I just wish I never existed or people suddenly all forgot about me.
