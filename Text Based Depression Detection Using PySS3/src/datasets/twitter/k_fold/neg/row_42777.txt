Suicidal at workI had been in remission from suicidal depression for more than a year, but I feel like I want to die again. I know these feelings will pass, so I am trying to work, but I just can't concentrate in this state of mind. I don't know what to do. The fact that I can't concentrate is making me feel even more useless and makes trying seem more futile.
