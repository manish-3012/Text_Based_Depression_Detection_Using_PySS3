Can't figure out what today.I had made such a fantastic turn around, loving everything and doing great these past few months. This past week has just. Gone. I don't know what to do. I'm a junior in college. And I can't get myself out of the rut. Not the first time, it's a time of many. Constant thoughts and self destructive actions. I feel like tonight may be the night. I have all of my pills ready. I'm ready to go. I just can't bring myself to do it. I have one person to talk to, but they recently got a new GF. So I'm stuck alone, contemplating. At least [some tunes help sooth the heart](https://imgur.com/a/dfKDE), if the actions come though.
