State of SW: The mod team needs your input!As there have been more posts lately about how the subreddit is being run and about what changes should be made, weâ€™ve decided that it would be a good time to discuss what *we're* discussing and get some feedback. This is going to cover a lot of varied topics, including some potential changes, and an opportunity for random suggestions to be made. 

Before we get to the fun stuff - a few reminders. 

**Reminder One** 

We are **not** a hotline and cannot guarentee an answer to every post or a timely response. Sometimes it gets quiet here, sometimes a post gets buried, and sometimes we mods have to sleep. (We're working on fixing the sleep bug so that it will no longer interrupt our work. Bear with us.) 

**Reminder Two** 

Moving discussions to pm is not something we recommend for multiple reasons. We have a lot of lurkers here that read what others post and are helped by replies to things they haven't posted. In addition, keeping things out in the open so to speak gives others a chance to chime in, to see new points of view that may help them, and takes the pressure off of people trying to help. *Even the professionals at suicide hotlines do not handle phone calls by themselves. They always have someone there to support them and offer input.* 

**Reminder Three** 

Please read the sidebar before you post. It has all sorts of cool stuff in it, and we've worked really hard on it. A lot of the things that we have to remove could stay up if the poster had read the rules and made a few small changes. 

**CHANGES WE ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING**

Right now we are talking about how we can improve the subreddit and take advantage of some of redditâ€™s cool features. We would love to know what you think/if you have any ideas about how we can do this. 

1. Flair. We're talking about it. What kind of flair would *you* find helpful? What would be unhelpful? Do we need flair at all? 

2. Self-posts only. We're considering turning the community into a self-post only subreddit. Links would still be allowed - BUT they would have to be in a self post with text accompanying them that explains the link. Things like 'Click here' wouldn't count, but explaining why you found it helpful and then linking would be. What do you all think? 


3. As you may know, reddit is now using wiki pages. What sort of things do you think would be helpful on ours? Do you have something cool we could use? 

**THINGS WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND WILL NOT BE DOING**

These are less fun, but we thought we would preemptively explain why some suggestions just aren't going to happen. 

The downvote button stays - we can't actually remove it, but we have the ability to hide if. However, it is very easy for people to get around this change and continue to downvote despite the change. If the admins give us a way to truly disable the button instead of hiding it, we will revisit this. 

We will not be setting up an IRC channel, a message board, a chat room, or anything of the sort. We've got our hands full here, and don't have the ability or the time to moderate them properly. Any such thing that shows up is going to have no moderation or an entirely different mod team - please keep that in mind if you find one and decide to visit it. 


**YOUR TURN!**

Now that all of the serious stuff is out of the way - what do you want to see in this community? Is there a change that you think would be good to make? Do you have a suggestion? Now is a great time to let us know!
