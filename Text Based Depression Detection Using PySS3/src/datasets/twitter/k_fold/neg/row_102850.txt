Just leave the house already so I can do thisBroke up with my ex but we still live in the same house. I'm just asking him to leave for one hour! Today needs to be the day. If he's not gone long enough I'm worried I'll be left alive but with brain damage becoming an even greater burden on my friends and family. Please go. I need this today. Wish I was just having a cry for help but there is no help to cry for. Burnt every bridge I've ever had. Self sabotaged. It was so nice to feel love again for a little bit. But that's gone too because of me. Just do me this one last favor. Please.
