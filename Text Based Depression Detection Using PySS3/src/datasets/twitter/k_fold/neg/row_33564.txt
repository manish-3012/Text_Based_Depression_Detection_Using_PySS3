I suck at titlesI currently live in New Zealand and I just turned 15. My birthday had me thinking that I won't make it to the next one, I'm just so tired and I don't what to do anymore. I'm originally from Eritrea, Eritrea is not a very nice place to live, but I sometimes miss it, but the memories from there also haunt me. It's like having cocaine withdrawal or some shit. Ever since my family left, our relationships have deteriorated, I have never really been valued because I'm a daughter and a middle child of seven, but now it's really just awful. My family hardly ever interacts with me anymore, and I rely on them for emotional support because I'm super socially awkward and introverted. I hardly ever talk to people outside of them. I feel so alone, why did God punish me like this? I desperately want to die and be free.
