My Experience.I grew up in an unstable home, it really wasnâ€™t the best because my father was an alcoholic and we were homeless for a few months twice. Even eventually we left my dads house because he was abusive toward my mother and older siblings to the point my mother registered a restraining order against him so he couldnâ€™t come near us by law. Eventually we moved away and I started going to school and met some extraordinary people who I ~~still~~ sometimes talk to. Eventually my sister moved out and it was just me alone with my mom, she would say stuff on a daily basis like â€œyou know, youâ€™re a shitty person.â€ And â€œare you fucking retarded?â€ To me and it made me fall into a depression where I pushed back all of my friends and was completely alone. Eventually we became homeless again because my mom was basically using my father as an ATM and he stopped sending checks. By this point, my mother was diagnosed with lung cancer and we moved once again to the south where I finished up 8th grade. Iâ€™m now a sophomore in high school and my mom still says â€œyouâ€™re stupidâ€ â€œyouâ€™re a fucking idiotâ€ â€œget away from meâ€ and it makes me seriously reflect on how my life has played out and I ~~want~~ to commit suicide. Iâ€™m afraid to do so because I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s waiting for me and there are family members I adore, just none where I am. I feel like a selfish, moron who is struggling to find a path, please help me.
