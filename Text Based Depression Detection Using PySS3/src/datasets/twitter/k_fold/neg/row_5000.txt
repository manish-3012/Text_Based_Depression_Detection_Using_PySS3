Please help me. Please give me advice.I don't think I want to kill myself. I like living. But I don't have any real hope for my life. Suicide is the best, most rational option.

I'm in my 20s and I'm still living with my parents. I went to college and got a worthless degree and worked a terrible job for years and had to quit because my boss was physically harassing and threatening me and the company wouldn't do anything about it. Of course I had no back-up plan. I was unemployed for a year and did nothing. My parents threatened to kick me out of the house unless I got a job or got into a program at a school. I ended up getting into a post-bacc program for medicine. My parents were so proud of me because they thought it was my first step to becoming a doctor. But that's never going to happen. First and foremost I'm too fucking stupid. And second, *I don't want to do that shit.*

I have suffered from mental illness all my life. I've tried to kill myself three times before, been institutionalized, all that happy horseshit. I was an alcoholic throughout my early twenties. I have no friends. I have no skills. My parents are fucking nuts. I *love* them, but they're fucking nuts. My mum lives in a bubble world. She hasn't worked since she was in college and spent all her time raising me and now that I'm older she has no hobbies or friends. My dad is a Trump-supporting fanatic who still thinks it's the 1980s. They don't understand the world. They don't want to. They're real boomers. 

I have no plans, no money, no credit, no ambitions, no desires. I don't want to have children. I don't want to get married or have a house. I don't want to work. I'm pathetic. I don't function correctly. So why the fuck prolong it?
