i care about everyone too muchwhen my friends hurt themselves it hurts me too

sometimes my friends do stupid things and get hurt anf it just pains me to know theyre going through pain, one of my friends hurt themselves on purpose and it really made me upset, i understand its an outlet ive done so too but man it makes me think how much pain they feel to do such a thing 

maybe that makes me empathetic or something

if i could take away someones pain i would do it in a heartbeat, i dont want anyone to suffer ever
