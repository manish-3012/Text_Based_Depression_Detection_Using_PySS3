Why do ppl always guilt trip depressed people?i have a whole body, family and shelter. I feel so ungrateful I wish someone could replace me. So what if i fix a temporary problem with a permanent solution, I don't want to live a life that's always about fighting. I'm tired, unmotivated to make achievements. I am a lazy coward. i was not built strong enough for this world.
