I have no choice but to die tonightIâ€™m a 22 year old privileged white girl, and I have thought about suicide every day for more than 3 years. 

Sparknotes of my story: My family is wonderful. I have 5 beautiful close friends who love me. I was my high school valedictorian. I went to a top ten university in 2014, easily making Deanâ€™s List my first semester. 

Yet, by 2015, I developed severe depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I tried to kill myself for the first time in my freshman dorm room, mere feet from my roommates. I have ALWAYS wished that attempt was successful, even during my happiest periods since. 

Flash forward to now. I have dropped out of that fancy university because of my mental illness. I go to a shitty regional university where canâ€™t even force myself to go to class or do easy homework. I have a public senior capstone presentation tomorrow, but I have not been to class in months. I have to die tonight, before my parents find out that Iâ€™m not going to school or graduating in May. 

I am just so sorry and ashamed and tired of the agony of daily minute-by-minute suicidal ideation. I know the only way to be free from this is to end it.
