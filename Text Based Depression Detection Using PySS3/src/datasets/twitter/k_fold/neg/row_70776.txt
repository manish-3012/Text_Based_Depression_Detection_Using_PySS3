I think Iâ€™ve hit my breaking point..Iâ€™ve decided to kill myself. 
Iâ€™m unlovable.
Iâ€™m broken,
Iâ€™m no ones forever but
Always someoneâ€™s temporary. 
Iâ€™ve been through so much pain in life. 
My mother murdered my 9 year old sister and then killed herself, you can google karina Clark for the story. 
Iâ€™ve had 3 kids with 3 separate mothers, 
I let my credit stoop and collect debt from prior suicide attempts. 
Iâ€™m tired.. 
Iâ€™m tired of trying for nothing with nothing to show. 
Iâ€™m tired of being a disappointment and losing everything I love and never being good enough. 
I donâ€™t have any friend..
Iâ€™ve lost literally everything that mattered to me today. 
My mom and sisters death anniversary is on dec 7. Just a week away. 
Seems like a fitting day. 

Iâ€™ve already planned this one to be permanent,
I believe Iâ€™m ready. Iâ€™m scared I wish things were different but you guys canâ€™t imagine the pain I go through, of having no one to hold at night or talk to, or someone who really truly love you for you and wonâ€™t let you go. 

Iâ€™ll never have that true love or stone for mistakes. 

I hope you all find your peace. 
I think Iâ€™ve found mine.
