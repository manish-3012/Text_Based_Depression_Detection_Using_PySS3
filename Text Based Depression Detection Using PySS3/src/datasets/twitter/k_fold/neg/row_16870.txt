I really need someone to talk toOkay, so I'm just gonna let it all out right now, I have no one else to talk to because my only friend and the girl I not so secretly have a crush on lives a few hundred miles away and is busy with life, her birthday and her dogs death were a few days ago so I can't really talk to her about my problems, one time I tried and she said she was gonna have a panic attack if I didn't stop, so now I have no one else to talk to

Basically, I'm a failure, my sister went to Harvard and my brother was in all honors classes before he became depressed, so now he's homeschooled but he's still the started person I've ever met, he's gotten me into computers and technology and he knows so much about everything, I look up to him. But he just thinks of me as his annoying younger brother, always locking me out my room and telling me to leave him alone. My sister was always trying to get good grades I barely ever saw her leave her room, so she was never really my sister, just another mom or someone I should be copying, the only good memory I have with her is when she put 10 minutes of her studying aside to play with me and my brother outside, this was about 6 years ago.

Now I'm 14, living in a house with my mom who hates me and a brother that thinks im a piece of shit. And I know she hates me because she's told me she'd wished she'd had an abortion, and she's kicked me out the house with no shoes in 30 degree weather with a fractured foot.

And now let me just explain how everyone would've been happier without me, if I wasn't born it would be my brother and sister, both excelling in school, and my mom and dad, who would've both had great paying jobs, and they would travel the world like they did before I was born, but when my mom became pregnant my dad left and my mom was let go from her job, and ever since she's been a bus driver for minimum wage, and I haven't been helping her, I've constantly asked her for things, I've made her life hell, and she says she has no one and nothing in life. So that's why she stays with her rude and arrogant boyfriend that's hit her on several occasions. 

My mom doesn't know I'm planning on killing myself and my brother thinks I'll never go through with it, but the thought can't leave my head because I have nothing to live for anymore, the only person I care about basically hates me and she never talks to me, all of my hopes and dreams have been crushed, and I can't do anything right, I've come to realize I'm the problem, not anyone around me. So I'm planning on killing myself before my birthday in February, I just have to think of a when and how

And if anyone does see this sad as shit post in new, I've heard all of the "don't worry, everything's gonna get better" speeches, so save your breath, and thanks for reading all that shit, I don't normally vent I just let myself boil over and freak out when no one's looking, so yeah, thanks for wasting your time on me like everyone else has, cya
