Iâ€™ve had enoughI want to end it all. Iâ€™m 16 about to take my GCSEs and this is my first time posting on Reddit because I need to speak out about this shit. I hate life, always have and always will. Nothing ever goes right for me and I can take it anymore. Iâ€™ve cried myself to sleep for many nights and I can no longer withstand the torture that is life. Iâ€™m almost confident if I was to die no one would notice a thing. I want to die but Iâ€™m too afraid to end it all. Iâ€™m too afraid of the pain. Everyday I just hope of an accident to come along and rid me of this life. I may sound stupid because I have my whole life ahead of me but dying feels right for me.
