i think this is either the end of me or the very beginning. so during fall quarter of college, i pretty much just dropped out, so damm depressed i just stopped, i couldn't do anything. all i kept thinking about was ways in which to kill myself and it consumed me. Of course i failed the whole quarter. now all my lies to my family and friends are starting to surface, i can't pretend that im doing fine anymore the walls of my lies are crashing down and now im losing everything. the world never looked as dark as it right now. never been as scared as this in my life. i dont' know what i want in life. i see people all round me moving on. im only 22 years old and i been telling myself things will get better. Just keep putting that one foot in front of the other. I just dont' know what to do. I dont' feel like trying to live anymore. its like im just too damm lazy to live. i hate that about myself.

 so at the start of spring quarter i threw myself back into the game and try as hard as i could to keep up. I fell and got back up each day. Each day i went to class. I pushed and pushed myself to work harder, try harder, to stop being so depressed and im been doing ok(ish) but the school just sent a letter to my house stating that i flunked out of fall quarter and if i can't prove i attended class throughout the quarter i lose my financial aid and would have to pay it back for that quarter and lose it for spring and have to pay late fees on top of that. sometimes i feel that i like to set myself up for this kind of shit. i really wished i CTB sooner :(  .  

all of this is just ramblings i don't know where else to turn or who to talk too. do i just come out with it? being depressed and suicidal? or deny and hope of the best? should i just CTB and avoid it all and take the most cowardly approach there is?
