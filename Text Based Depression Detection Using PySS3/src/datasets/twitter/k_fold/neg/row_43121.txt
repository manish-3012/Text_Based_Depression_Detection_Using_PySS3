I dont know if anybody is going to see this or if anybody cares, but i'm going to kill myself within the next week.I've been struggling with depression for 10 years now. It's been crippling, awful, and I've barely been able to move on every day even with the 3 different medications they have me on (currently on my sixth antidepressant). After going to university for four and a half years and changing my major, I've just been academically suspended. I dont have any job skills, barely have any job experience, and no money to my name. My parents want me to get a job and try to take some part time classes at the local junior college, but I can see the painful disappointment in their eyes. I'm the first born son following three generations of every single family member getting at least a masters degree, and two PhDs. 

I'm a massive failure, and I always have been. Even when I was doing well in High school, my parents were always dissapointed in the choices I made (Not joining the IB program, playing video games and D&amp;D instead of an actual extracurricular activity)

I barely have any friends that care about me, and the only regret that I have is the massive emotional pain I'm going to cause them when they find out. I have a massive fear of death, but at this point it really doesn't seem like i have a better option. I'm a kissless virgin at 23 years old and nobody has shared even a shred of interest in that way, even when i went on okcupid and sent messages to every single match I had both male and female.

So yeah, I'm not long for this world, probably the only time I've ever regretted shunning religion. If anybody would care to talk to me during my last few days so I dont feel so alone, I would really appreciate it.
