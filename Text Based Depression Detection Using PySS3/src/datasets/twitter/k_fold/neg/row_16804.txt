I donâ€™t see myself dying any other way.Whenever I try to imagine a future for myself, I canâ€™t. I just canâ€™t see myself doing anything with my life. I donâ€™t see myself graduating or getting old. I donâ€™t see myself having any major milestones. I only see suicide. But I just donâ€™t know how. Itâ€™s such an odd feeling of uncertainty that I hate. I would do it tonight but i have no way to. Iâ€™m just sick of struggling and I wish I could just die already.
