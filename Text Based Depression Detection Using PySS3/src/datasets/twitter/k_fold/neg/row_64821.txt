Sick of putting off deathIâ€™m 31, and Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself for the last ten years. Itâ€™s only through the urging from friends and family that Iâ€™ve continued on for this long, but I canâ€™t keep up the farce. I despise being here, and I despise myself even more for dragging it out this long.

For those who would encourage me to seek treatment, I spent a week in a mental hospital two years ago. It was one of the most horrible experiences of my life, and I will never go back. I have had five therapists in ten years. Three were incompetent. One betrayed my confidence, and one I could no longer afford due to my lousy HMO. Iâ€™m done talking to â€œprofessionalsâ€. Iâ€™ve been on nearly every antidepressant you could name, and they all have the same effect: They keep me functional enough to get through the work day without having a breakdown. Thatâ€™s it.

Iâ€™ve had a plan in place on how to kill myself for a while now. The only thing that keeps me from going through with it is the fear of botching the job and giving myself some kind of brain damage or other form of debilitation. I canâ€™t even handle life as it is, let alone under those circumstances. So for right now Iâ€™m just an empty vessel walking around, hoping to get run down by a car or shot by a mugger, to take the choice out of my cowardâ€™s hands.
