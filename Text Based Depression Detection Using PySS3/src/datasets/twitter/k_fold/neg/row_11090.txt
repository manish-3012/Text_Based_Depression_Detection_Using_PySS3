I'm 17M. I have anxiety issues, depression and every time I wake up I want to end it. I started cutting again a month and a half back.When I was 11, I tried to hang myself but the rope broke. I never thought about suicide or depression until I was 14 years of age when I started feeling the need to die again so I started hurting myself with a knife. I just turned 17 and I can feel my life turning to shit, I can feel myself clamming up with anxiety in any social situation. I just need someone to talk to because I always feel lonely.
