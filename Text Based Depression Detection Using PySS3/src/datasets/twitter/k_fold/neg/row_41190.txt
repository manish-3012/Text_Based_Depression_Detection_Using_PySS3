I dont think I can deal with anything much longerI've been depressed my whole life and always felt that I had no where to go. But about 8 months ago I met my wonderful boyfriend and we got along so well that I ended up moving states away to live with him. Dumb idea I know. I thought that would be the start of something new, a start to a happy life but I was wrong. I feel so alone down here and I feel like I have no options left. I just want out. I want to be done. I simply don't want to exist anymore. I need the pain and feeling of emptiness to stop.  Im sorry for the jumble of words but its been a really rough couple of month and I just haven't been in the right head space. Maybe soon enough It'll all be over for me if I get the strength
