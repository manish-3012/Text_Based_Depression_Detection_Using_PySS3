Is this enough to cause respiratory arrest and certain death?I have 5mg Ã— 20  diazepam,  
2mg Ã— 60 lorazepam,
1mg Ã— 10 alprazolam, and 60mg Ã— 40 phenobarbital. 

I plan on taking them with a bottle of whiskey and some antihistamine, I need to know how likely it will cause respiratory depression and death? 
I don't wanna wake up a hospital bed brain-damaged. 

Thanks for listening.
