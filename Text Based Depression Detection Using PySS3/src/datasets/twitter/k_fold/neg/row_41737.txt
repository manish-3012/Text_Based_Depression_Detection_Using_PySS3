CowardI'm a coward. I drank a mouthful of cough syrup because I can't shoot or hang myself. I don't like pain. When I die, I want to go out painlessly as possible. No aches, stings, or burns. Just lulled off to sleep never to wake up again.

I don't have anything to live for. My brother is an adult now, so he's got to take control of his life now. I'll never learn how to drive, keep a steady job, go to school and actually pay attention, find anything meaningful and exciting in my life â€” all because of some stupid fucking diseases I was born with and can't change. I switched doctors and therapists because of these illnesses, but no one can help. They cushioned the blows with meds, but nothing stopped them.

I'm rambling. Can't think straight and my head hurts like hell. Goodbye.
