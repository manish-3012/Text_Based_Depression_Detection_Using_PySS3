Depressed over being singleSorry I've been posting a lot on here recently. Every day is sort of like a new theme for what I'm going through.

23M. Very suicidal over how isolated I feel, one part of which is relationships. I'm sort of stuck feeling how I don't fit in.

It sort of seems that everyone is in a relationship. Everyone's posting stories about their partners and how much they love them, with loads of their friends cheering them on. People are crying about how they don't get to see them enough because of quarantine restrictions and how they're dying to go see them once this is all over.

People seem to have so much intimacy with one another that they buy a plane ticket to go visit them in another country. Meanwhile I can't even get a text back.

Even trying to stay home and do nothing causes these triggers. Listening to music, watching TV, reading books all often explore relationships, because of how central of a theme it is to human experience. Oh the pain...

Lastly, while you might argue that it's not just me, almost everyone has a story about a past relationship, a bad breakup, a prom date, or whatever. At least people have had some experience in this world. All of these things are just so out of reach for me. I've never been immersed in my community to ever have this kind of experience.

Looking at how bleak the outlook is, there might be merit to doing something drastic today. I'm too much of a coward to actually do it, but this is one of the themes that's especially apparent for me today.
