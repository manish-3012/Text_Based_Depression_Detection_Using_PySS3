What to doI'm 19 and have had brain fog for 4 years which is just getting worse, destroys everything I try and has turned me into a fucking retard to be quite frank. Been working for 4 months employed by a few family distant-ish and can't believe I've not been sacked yet considering I have a pathetic panic attack whenever I answer the phone and fuck the call up. Got no friends at work despite everyone being nice there &amp; making effort to conversate with me. Can't drive will never pass the test can't concentrate. I look forward to nothing but taking amphetamines and wanking all night at the weekend. I don't want to kill myself because my family would be devastated but I don't know what the fuck to do anymore like. Feels like life is completely scripted
