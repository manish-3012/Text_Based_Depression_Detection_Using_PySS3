iâ€™m just really tiredmy mental health has really hit rock bottom as of late. iâ€™m not going to do anything harmful to myself because i have no desire to at this time, but there really isnâ€™t anything holding me back from it either. i just wanted a space to rant without people freaking out really.

i still have a lot of my life left to live. iâ€™m not even out of high school, i havenâ€™t gotten piss drunk or stupid high yet and iâ€™d like to do some stupid shit like that before i close the curtains. but to be honest, getting old scares me so much. i donâ€™t feel comfortable living past 35, even late 20s feels like a stretch but since itâ€™s still far out iâ€™d like to be optimistic while i still can.

i donâ€™t have a desire to end it now, but i have no motivation to get old and rickety either. iâ€™ve seen my grandma pass away with alzheimerâ€™s and dementia and being unable to recognize me or my mother. some people want to go that way, but i want to go just before i start breaking down. just before iâ€™m stuck in a 9 to 5 job i hate with two kids i can barely feed and a partner whoâ€™s spark died a long time ago. i donâ€™t want that. 

which makes me all the more troubled when i get lonely. sure, iâ€™m only 16 and i donâ€™t need to worry about finding the one yet, but i donâ€™t want to get close with someone knowing that i wonâ€™t be with them as long as theyâ€™re thinking. but then again, iâ€™m very lonely and would like someone to hold me close at night when i canâ€™t sleep. i hate hookup culture because a lot of it is sex-oriented and objectified, which my ace ass wants no part of. but holy fuck i have not had a proper hug in years now. iâ€™m a very physical person who wants to be held/hold someone, have someone play with my hair/let me play with their hair, etc. but in most hookup or friends with benefits models at least in my town itâ€™s really only dick appointments.

i donâ€™t know, iâ€™m just lonely and want someone to hold me and tell me itâ€™s gonna be fine but i really doubt iâ€™ll get that anytime soon if at all. and even if i do i donâ€™t want to upset them when i mysteriously disappear one day only to have my corpse found in a lake nine days later. i donâ€™t want to be a burden, i donâ€™t want to let anyone down, and i donâ€™t know how to do that. 

i really donâ€™t think this rant made much sense, but if anyone has anything to say iâ€™d be very happy to listen, my DMs are always open too if anyone is struggling and just wants someone to listen. thank you for your time.
