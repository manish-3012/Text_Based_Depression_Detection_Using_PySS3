can't stay functionable for more than two daysnor hopeful for that matter, though i haven't been hopeful or even at peace since i began my freshmen year at college, and this is my first finals week. Everything feels fake. I can barely find comfort in online suicide resources, half of them being "depression might never get better, kill yourself or live miserably for the next 40 years" and the other half is the even worse "well you just need to DO things your depression keeps you from doing! If it keeps you in bed just get out of bed!" I mean, yeah I get it, I *could* just act against depression, but I still don't so i guess i'm depressed just for the sake of being an insufferable burden to my family, i revel in making people mad at me. 

How can I argue with that, this sorta treatment was developed and used by actual psychologists who I hope know better than me on how the brain works (i spent a lot of money on them yk) so i guess if i cant follow it i just probably secretly or subconsciously dont want to get better (bc im a shitty person or wtv). idk what's the catch here i'm just extra pissy bc i havent found anything worth staying or considered a "not-terrible" future to be realistically attainable since my 14s and i'm 20 now so yk. I feel like crap and there is not a corner in the web or a psychologist in this country that was ever able to make me feel better and i still feel that its just bc im a lazy liar who has everything to get better but just wont bc i've become complacent or wtv it was my last psychologist told me.

sorry for the rambling post, im just in crisis bc college life demands me to act like a reasonable human being and since im unable to be productive in any way i guess college is just not happening and unfortunately i dont have much option but dying bc my family is just not going to accept having a living daughter that won't attend college
