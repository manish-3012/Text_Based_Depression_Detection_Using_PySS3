I really really just need to leaveI'm a horrible person. Like actually. I one of those people that people talk about on the internet and everyone is like wow how can they be so mean and stupid. 
I'm really mean and stupid and I hate it. I'm like a leech I can't survive without sucking the life out of someone. I can't do anything all I do all day is draw and draw and draw. It's all I can bring myself to care about. I can barely do my homework, I still don't have a job, I don't know if I can graduate high school let alone find a successful career.  I'm not going to make it in life. 
The only person that would care if I was gone is my boyfriend. I can't understand why he still wants me around but he really shouldn't. I'm just going to be a dead weight holding him back. He does literally everything for me and all I do is make his life worse. I don't want to keep hurting him. 
I just want to die then everyone can forget about me and I'll stop hurting people. 
I don't know if I will tho. I'm too much of a fucking scaredy cat to try anything. 
I'm such a horrible person. I can't do anything good. I can't even end myself to save my friends.
