I'm committing suicide tonightI initially made this account over a year ago so I could comment and make posts on this subreddit. I've been suicidal for a while and really the only thing that happens when I decide to not kill myself is things get worse. 

I've already done really horrible things to other people in the past which I can't stop feeling guilt and regret over. Now I'm also on academic probation in college with no clear major in mind, I lost most my friends at school over the past year thanks to isolating myself and being the idiot I am. I never had anything I cared about and I still don't. Even if my death destroys my family I really don't care because all I want to do is stop feeling like shit and not be around anymore. I've been to two therapists over the past several months and it hasn't helped at all. Now my therapist says I need to take antidepressants but I don't believe getting hooked on drugs(that have dozens of side effects treated with even more drugs with more side effects) for life is a good answer. Death is preferable to that because if anything I don't want to lose my dignity. 

There's really nothing I have hope for doing in the future. I never had goals or dreams anyways and so far there's no reason for the future to not be shitty. 

I've been going out to a bridge near where my parents live every once in a while for over a year. I tried measuring how tall it is and it should be high enough for me to die. When I refuse to jump off things just get worse. I don't really have a choice but to kill myself at this point and in a few hours hopefully I'll be dead.
