I gave up.I fully gave up. No friends, no care for social status, nothing I'm interested, nothing that makes me different, no life. It's hard to say when it all happened. Maybe last year during summer. No friends (or so I thought) called, texted or invited me over. I wasn't a ass to them. I cared for and about them. I was nice to them and my classmates. In return I was called stuff like "pussy, loner, emo" and I was made fun of for my interests. My closest friend went as far to make fun of my dad to where he lived (his first house after my parents seperation) and I fealt so bad. He's popular now. I'm clingy and it's not my fault. I just miss human interaction is all.
