A plea for help.I posted on [/r/ihaveissues](/r/ihaveissues) but I'm not sure it was the right place.
Tonight I had a pretty rough conversation with a girl I've been absolutely head over heels for for 2 years. I'd been a total White Knight for her and was trapped in the friend zone for a long time, on and off. I recently moved, but before I left I made sure to tell her how I felt. She responded well, and for a couple weeks things looked okay. Today was the start of spring break, I was planning to visit, but we got in a little bit of a fight on facebook that ended up in...this.

I was absolutely in love with this girl, and then she went and did this. I need help from someone out there. This isn't even a request for pity or attention. I've tried to kill myself before, and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm sure she'll spread word of my being a 'lying bastard' to the rest of my friends back there, and I don't have any friends where I am. I'm alone, reddit. Help.
