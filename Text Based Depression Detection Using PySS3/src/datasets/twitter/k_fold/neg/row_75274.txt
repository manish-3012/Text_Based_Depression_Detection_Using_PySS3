Debt is coming for meI gave up on paying it, I gave up on getting a job to fix it and now it's started and it's pushing me to kill myself as I intended even before getting this debt, even after getting it, but for some reason I didn't. But now I will have to, clock's ticking. It's not even fucking lot, yet they are already threatening, kinda insane but whatever. It's a fucking 1 month wage. But I have given up, I'm not going to ask family for help, I would be ashamed of saying what I got myself into. Because it is only and only my own fault. I will rather die.
