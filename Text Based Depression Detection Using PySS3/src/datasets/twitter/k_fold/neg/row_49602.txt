I donâ€™t know what to do about my ex BF anymoreIâ€™m a 17-year-old bisexual male who struggles with Aspergerâ€™s OCD and depression. And let me just tell you when I got my first boyfriend it was amazing we would say romantic stuff to each other all the time and things were just great I did tend to be manipulative at times and I wasnâ€™t unaware of that but for some reason I donâ€™t want to change my manipulative side 
at first my boyfriend said that I wasnâ€™t manipulative and that he would always love me but now he called me disgusting manipulative immature and close minded I donâ€™t know what to do I canâ€™t stand the thought of him hating me I see him every day at school and it just hurts me I think it would be best if I just ended it all
