Almost jumped in front of a car after trying to get help today.The title says it all. In my state a parent is required to be present in order for behavioral health clinics and facilities to even think about seeing you. My mom doesn't really like helping me with anything, and always "forgets", so I took matters into my own hands and went to a CODAC facility with my signed papers and recommendation from the doctor. 


I bring everything to the receptionist and she gives me this concerned look and tells me she's pretty sure I need a parent or guardian present but she'll check. So she goes to the back to talk to someone and I overhear them through the door talking about how unless I was emancipated they can't do anything for me. She the na comes out, tells me everything and asks if there's anything else they could do for me. I ask for a bottle of water, she gives me one, and I walk out holding back tears. I had been trying to set this up for around a month and to just have it all collapse in an instant really killed me a little.


After that I call one of my friends to ask for a ride, as I just missed my bus and the next one didn't come for an hour, so I'm sat there waiting for them to respond for fifteen minutes and when she finally does she says she doesn't have enough gas. So I walk to the bus stop, crying, and some little shit yells at me from across the street to "kill yourself, pussy!", so I thought it over, it was a green light and there were a few cars coming. I look at the next one and take a step forward about to close my eyes and just fall into it. But something kicks in and I pull myself back and take a drink of water and make my way to the bus stop.


Now I'm laying in bed, wishing I had done it. I guess I'm just lucky I lost my knife a week ago, or else tonight would probably be my relapse in self harm. I just wish I could die in peace.
