I think i need to talk to someoneI'm a 20 year old guy and ideally I'd like to talk to someone ideally the same age.

I don't mind talking via reddit, email, whatsapp etc. If you're from the UK as well I'd love to have a phone call if you're up for it. 

I'm really lonely. No friends. No job and not in education anymore. I haven't left the house in 2 weeks. I live off benefits i get for my mental health difficulties. I hate it. I feel incredibly isolated. Lots of shitty things have happened in the past and recently. Equally i miss just having a normal conversation.
