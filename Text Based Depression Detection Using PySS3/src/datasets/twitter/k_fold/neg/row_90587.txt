I just need to ventI just need a place to vent.

Today was my second day of school, and I'm already feeling extremely suicidal again. I can't handle the responsibility of doing all the homework and turning it in on time and trying to keep my grades up.

I honestly don't even know why I still go to school because I don't know what I want to do with my life anyway. I see no future for myself. College is way too expensive and I don't want to waste 4-10 years of my life there. If I didn't go to college, I'd probably end up being a cashier or something and turn out broke like my parents.

Besides all that, the world is just total shit at this point and honestly I think it'll end or come close to it within my lifetime. Global warming, shootings every day, untrustworthy government, etc. And no one's doing anything about it and it just keeps getting worse.

My mental health is not good either. I have BPD, OCD, anxiety, and severe depression. I over think everything and focus on negative things and it makes me miserable. 

Honestly the only reason I haven't committed suicide is because I don't know what happens when we die and I'm too scared to find out.
