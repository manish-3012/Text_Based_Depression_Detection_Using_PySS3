I actually think the people who don't want to kill themselves are the mentally ill ones, not usHow tf can you wake up every morning happy to be here living this hell. Doing the same boring shit every single day knowing you have another 40+years of it for it to only get worse.

We the suicidal ones I think are truly woke. We see how bad the world is, how bad things are, how pointless things are.

Those people on the other hand are so blasÃ© to it all it's worrying, they're like aliens to me.

Fuck this life, hate it all, give me some happiness back.
