Why am i feeling like thisim 22 yrs old, have everything, house, dog, family 2 kids etc.

iv been unhappy ever since my father died 7yrs ago, had no one to talk to about it. to this day i havent talked to a professional about anything or even anyone at all.

I have everything in life yet why do i want to let it go. if it wasn't for my partner and 2 children i wouldnt be here right now.

I was good in school particularly in maths scoring A*'s at gcse and a-level (UK qualifications) 

Yet now i work in a postroom pushing parcels living paycheck to paycheck miserable and never happy.

i cant even go out with my partner and the kids because im always unhappy and want to go home.

all i do in my spare time is play cs:go i mean im 1 rank off the highest rank but not even this makes me happy. its something ive done since i was 9 (play older versions of the same game)

Cant even think of it as a job prospect, people tell me to stream but who would want to watch me glum and depressed playing games.

Why when i see disabled people who have everything stacked up against them, are they always so happy. id give anything to feel real happiness. i work 9 hrs a day fake smiling to colleagues.

I dont even know why im posting here as i cant think of anything that would help. i mean if i could i wouldnt be here i guess.
