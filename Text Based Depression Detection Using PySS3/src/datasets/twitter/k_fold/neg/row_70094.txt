This is all just pointless. I can't wait to blow my head off and be done with itI'm so tired of not being enough and being the last option. I'm tired of being unappreciated I'm tired of being hated I'm tired of feeling so fucking shitty.

The only time I ever really get that weight off my shoulders is when I think about shooting myself. It's the only way I can feel pure joy anymore. I'm aching to die. It's so easy yet I'm still here. I don't care if I'm meant to be I don't want to be. Fuck everything 
Fuck everyone for putting me on the back burner. 

Nobody gives a fuck about you till you're dead. I'm gonna be dead soon enough.
