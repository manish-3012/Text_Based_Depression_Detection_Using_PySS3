They left a turd before they did itthey left me a giant turd (you lied...you're not there for me) and exited....i can't get over it...rational or not...i could have answered the phone and called 911...i didnt answer...by the time i heard the voicemail...i already had another with the funeral location...mental illness is a mother fucker...it haunts me...it feels like it will haunt me forever...sorry for the shitty post...im not suicidal at all...i just dont get it and am tired of missing/pain/guilt/anger
