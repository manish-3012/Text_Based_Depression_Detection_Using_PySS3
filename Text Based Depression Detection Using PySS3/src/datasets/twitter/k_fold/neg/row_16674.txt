Todayâ€™s the dayItâ€™s 11am and Iâ€™ve been searching how to kill my self for almost three hours. Iâ€™ve read up on how to do it with pills, hanging, crashing my car, etc. the most intriguing option is crashing my car. I feel like thatâ€™s one of the only ways I can successfully do it. Especially if Iâ€™m on the highway. 
I donâ€™t see the point in living anymore. Iâ€™m about to lose my job because i, admittedly, fucked up. Iâ€™m basically mooching off my mom right now when it comes to a place to live and food. My sister and her boyfriend hate me. I have over $60k in debt and only make $16k a year. I canâ€™t afford bankruptcy (which is ironic). Thereâ€™s too much other shit for me to go into. Iâ€™m too tired of fighting. I donâ€™t see how life could get any harder. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.  Iâ€™d rather die and let my life insurance policies help my bills and my mom. Iâ€™m not useful or needed. 
I guess Iâ€™m posting this on here just to say, itâ€™s too much and Iâ€™m not able to fight anymore. I want to die. I want to not be the reason for so many peoples stress. Iâ€™ve wasted this life and itâ€™s better for everyone if Iâ€™m gone. At least the worms can eat.

I know thatâ€™s all over the place. Just know today is goodbye.
