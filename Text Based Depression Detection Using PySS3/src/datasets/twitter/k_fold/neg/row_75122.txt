I think Iâ€™m done.I canâ€™t do this anymore

A few years ago I was dating an emotional abusing girl. Everything had to go her way or else you get â€œconsequencesâ€. All I ever wanted in life was to have a significant other and make her the happiest I can. Looking back in life I donâ€™t think I was ever happy. When I was in high school I developed lower back pain, which increased in pain over time. I was diagnosed with anklosing spondlytis. I donâ€™t have anything to life for anymore. Good bye.
