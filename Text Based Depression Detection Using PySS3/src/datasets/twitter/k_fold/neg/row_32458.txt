What is ultimately the point to keep going?Iâ€™ve nothing besides a few measly numbers on academic papers to make up for something, I have no family to look up to , no one to love, nothing to be passionate about. I donâ€™t have a place that I can call home, no one to call for support, no goal to motivate myself. Whenever I try to improve, it always ends up in one fuck up or another and Iâ€™m left hurt. What is there to keep me going, why shouldnâ€™t I just end it all?Got no one to mourn after me, why continue this life of alienation and disappointment?
