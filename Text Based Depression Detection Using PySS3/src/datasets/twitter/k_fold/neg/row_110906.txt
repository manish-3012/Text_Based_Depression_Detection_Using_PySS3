I'm going to hang myself when I get homeI have a handsome, smart, funny son. I moved him in to my psycho controlling mother's house. She wouldn't even let me go to the bathroom this morning. I have nowhere else to turn. I feel like if we left she would try for custody. My coworkers don't give a shit.
