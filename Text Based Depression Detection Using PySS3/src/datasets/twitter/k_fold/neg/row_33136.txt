I thought I found a reasonI thought that the thing which kept me for years actually happened again and I feel in love. Maybe I get pushed away maybe these loves never come true but atleast falling for someone helped to climb out of my hole. High enough to have a pretty long way before I can keep digging.
But now this seems to be over. I was at the most terrible point in my life, I thought I would find something but I can't believe into anything. No friends no family no partner.
I don't even mean romantical love I just mean any way of love starting by myself ending with a partner but I must admit that this seems to be over for me.
I'm at the bottom and I feel that soon I will have been digging so deep that I am going to fall. Into the abyss in my dreams but on the hard floor, 6 floors deep in real life.
