Just want someone to listenI've had thoughts of suicide since I was very VERY young. I hang in for my mother and sister. But im fucking tired. I just wanna lay some shit on the table. Get it out of my head, off my shoulders. I've tried friends, family, therapists. Maybe a stranger can hear me. I'm so stuck inside of my own head all the time I miss entire conversations, whole days go by that I can't remember because I'm locked in with myself. I have to get out. I'm not begging, but if someone could just fucking hear me I think I'd feel better.
