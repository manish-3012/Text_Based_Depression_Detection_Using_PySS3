Can i talk to someone please or someone give me a reason why i shouldnâ€™t overdose right now.[15M]
Hi. Can someone please convice me not to overdose rn. I had to build up massive courage to tell one of my friends that i was suicidle and tried to OD last week on Melatonin. I was asleep for 15 hours and was throwing up and fainting. He didnâ€™t believe me and made jokes about it. I feel like shit. I want to escape. I have ADHD, Severe anxiety, depression, PTSD. 
I get bullied. I get told to kill myself infront of my face. I get hit â€œas a jokeâ€ by people at school. If iâ€™m outside i get shouted mean things to me. I just canâ€™t live anymore. I want to make the people who tell me to end myself happy. It would be a better place for everyone. Iâ€™m such a burden, i canâ€™t do anything right at all. I have hurt myself because of it. And i will probably delete this account either in regret or if i do decide to do it. 

And yes, i do have a therapist who doesnâ€™t know of my attempt last week yet. I donâ€™t want anyone to know. 

I have Melatonin, Anti depressants, Adderall, Lexapro all next to me. Idk what to do. Iâ€™m not calling anyone. Or texting.
