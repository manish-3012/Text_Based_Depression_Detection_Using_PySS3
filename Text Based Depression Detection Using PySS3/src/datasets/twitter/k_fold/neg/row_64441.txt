What do i do?Can't seem to get to the place i aimed for. I try so hard, move to new places, try different work and study at different schools but i can't seem to find myself in a position of comfort, happiness or somewhere i feel that i can be who i am. I am lonely, bitter and constantly angry at shit that doesn't really matter. And it's not like i try, i hang out with people, party and do social things. And it has started to annoy me. People annoy me. I wasn't always like this but now it seems like it's all that i can do. Be angry. Close myself of. Hate people. 'Cuz the problem really comes down to me, i don't know how to change more things about me to make me feel better. I can't move to anymore places, i am totally clueless to what i am supposed to do. I am currently three weeks into my new film-school. It's nice. That's pretty much it. This was my last card to play with. I honestly can't think of more things to change. I don't have the energy anymore. End of the fucking line.

So here is my dilemma: I believe i will kill myself one day. Not today. Not tomorrow. Props in a  couple of years. But i am fairly certain this is the way i will go. I am a person who is, for some reason, incapable of forming any meaningful relationships with anyone anymore and i will kill myself eventually. Right now, the only thing that's keeping me is my mom. I saw a video of her and me when i was a baby, and i felt all her love and care. I knew then how much i mean to her. I can't kill myself just yet. I will eventually, just not yet. I can't do that to her. 

I'm stuck. I've been stuck for two years. I hate being stuck.

So, anyone who knows what i'm talking about? I'm not feeling sad, just pretty much hopeless.
