Nothing besides religion was holding me backBut last night i realized how mad and hurt i was at the God i worship and it made me snap. It isnt even His fault its just the fact that my abusers keep using religion as an excuse to hurt me. I want my eating disorder to get to me. Im already underweight and if i fast for 72 hours i start passing out. I just need to push myself far enough to slip into a hypoglycemiac coma in my sleep. I think im ready theres nothing keeping me here. I see no hope because every single option i have right now have their own cons that i cant ignore. 

I cant report my abusers because theyre my family and i think i love them. I feel so guilty about even thinking about it. Also ill have to give up my degree that im 2 years into getting. I just started my 3rd year two weeks ago. Ill most likely end up working part time jobs to get by and that means ill have to be financially dependent on someone else again. And the cycle of abuse will continue.

I cant not report because they keep making death threats, accusing me of heinous actions and physically hurting me. I also am rarely allowed to leave the house and when i do i normally have a family member with me. Quarantine did nothing besides effectively trap me with them for 7 months now. We arent even allowed to open the windows because were constantly yelling at one another and the neighbours keep hearing the disagreements.

I cant move in temporarily with a friend because id feel like a burden and im really scared their parents (they all live with their families) will send me back to my family. 

The only way is to wait here until they accidentally kill me by going too far or kill myself.
