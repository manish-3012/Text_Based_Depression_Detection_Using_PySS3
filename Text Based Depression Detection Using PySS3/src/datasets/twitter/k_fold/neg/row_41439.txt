Need someone to talk to for some advice. I have suffered from depression since I was 16. At this moment, I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. I honestly feel like the things around me aren't real, and my head feels weird. I'm going to talk to my parents now. If anyone here has experience with this, I would be really, really glad to have someone to talk to on aim or msn tomorrow (Wednesday). 

I'm not going to commit suicide, but everything seems too weird right now. If you're there, please send me a PM and post in the thread to let others know someone has messaged, it would mean a lot to me.
