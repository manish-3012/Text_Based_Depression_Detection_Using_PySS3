I can't fucking take itI'm a ticking time bomb. I keep all my emotions inside and refuse to let them out. And I honestly dont even know how. 

I want to fuckimg kill myself. It's been 4 years of suicidal thoughts and I haven't felt happiness for longer than a couple hours in the last 6 months or so. Why the fuck cant I be happy. I want to be happy. 

I'm not going to actually kill myself,  maybe just write a suicide note and have a panic attack when it gets too real. Just another day.
