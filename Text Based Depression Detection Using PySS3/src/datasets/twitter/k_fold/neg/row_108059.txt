I'm smoking DMT tomorrow and killing myself.Everything in life is based on being a extrovert. I can't cope anymore. I can't talk to people I don't know without coming across as weird because of my anxiety. I can't do anything because my social skills are so inadequate. I feel like everyone hates me and avoids me I can't carry on anymore.
