Conflicting thoughtsMy life is kinda shit at the moment. No job, no money, severe depression and suicidal thoughts, feeling worthless 24/7. I feel like I've wasted my life and haven't really built any meaningful skills or talents for myself. But the thing is, I know I can change all this, I just can't seem to. I give up at the slightest bit of difficulty or hardship. I coasted through school by being "gifted", but I don't have the skills to make it through real life. I don't know why I simply refuse to try. I see people pushing through life and wonder how they even do it.
