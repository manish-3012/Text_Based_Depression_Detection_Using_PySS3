I'm having crazy mood swings that go from amazing to suicidal and now is the latterI told myself I'll try to do it in a few months if things don't get better, but then I'm also stressing about what if it goes wrong and how do I do it as painless as possible for my family. I keep wanting to call a psychiatrist but my mood cycles extremely and goes very up through the day and I end up not doing it because it feels like I can push through. Then this feeling comes and I know I can't push through. I don't know what to do but I feel horrible and the mood switching is so exhausting. Fuck this so much
