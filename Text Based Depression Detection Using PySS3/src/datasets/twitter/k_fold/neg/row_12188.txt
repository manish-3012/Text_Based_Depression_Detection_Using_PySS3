I hope I do it this time.Iâ€™m so very tired. I see my stepdadâ€™s grave in my mindâ€™s eye and I cry because I so long to jump down there with him and go to sleep.

People just never stop hurting you. Abusing you, abandoning you. Every single one in three decades. Last time I attempted, it nearly worked. I was hanging and I just managed to find my feet before I blacked out.

I hope I do it. I want to go under the ground and sleep.
