I envy the deadI always joked about suicide, I have to. It makes the idea less scary. But I guess that means no one thinks I would ever do it. I've helped so many of my friends though depression and suicidal episodes, and right after I helped them, they disappeared. They didn't need me anymore.
One actually did pass away not too long ago. After that, I realized that I was jealous. Dead people win. They have nothing to struggle with anymore. It's everyone left that has to wallow in the dirt. I don't think I believe in the afterlife anymore. That's why it's so tempting. I know I'd hurt some people, maybe a few more people would remember I existed once I'm dead. But eventually they would disappear too and we'll all be gone. Idk, some people just aren't cut out for life, and I think I'm one of them.
