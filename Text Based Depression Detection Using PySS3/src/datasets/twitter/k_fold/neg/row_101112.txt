Today's thoughtsI feel like I'm drowning. No boat, no vest, in the middle of the ocean during a hurricane. Everyday is another struggle, another thrashing of tired legs that, in the end, will have been in vain. In this world you really have to take care of yourself. No one can do it for you. No one can save you. And, if you don't have the skills necessary...tough shit! I, obviously, don't have those skills. My mind is a fucked up tunnel leading to caves of utter despair. The more I try to shine a light and find my way out, the more I become hopefully lost. Even when I manage to escape the grasp of this depression with some sort of distraction or diversion, my mind acts like a sun, and my thoughts cannot escape the gravity of it, the orbit that keeps spinning the bullshit back around at me. I really thought if I just poured myself in trying to get my career started, it would lead me to something better. At first, I could focus and really had a drive to become what I wanted. Partly out of a sense of hope, but now looking back, I think it was more out of a sense of desperation to escape a shitty situation and prove that in the end, their would be some sort of positive outcome. But now, in these days where i can barely focus, have lost all joy in things I really used to love, I know that a positive outcome is not in my cards. I hoped today would give me something to go on. Just one sign that what I'm doing (which feels like stumbling through a pitch black hallway at night) is actually leading to something better, or at least in a better direction. The internship, the state job, the cat, Angie letting me know she would be okay. Then, I found the cat online! I rushed down there, excited and happy for the first time in a long while. As I entered the pound, I allowed myself to imagine this as a launching point. "Things can get better now." But life likes to remind you of just how helpless and powerless you truly are. I can't even be there for my cat when he needs me, let alone any person in my life. Just a leech that will eventually disappoint all those around me.

I'm about to be 40 years old,  no money, living in my Mom's basement, dependent on people who can't afford it, and pretty much a burden to anyone who has anything to do with me. I watch people's reactions as I mumble to them, failing horribly to explain what's going on in my head, let alone my life. They feel so uncomfortable, like any other place in the world would be better than around me. You can tell that my parents are pretty much sick and tired of the same conversation they feel they need to have with me. Like I'm a fuckup who is never going to learn what everyone else knows. Every time they talk to me about my problems, it makes me feel like I'm still a child and that kills me. My Dad literally doesn't think I can do a damn thing myself. Every time I would try to help him with anything, he would get frustrated and start doing it himself like I'm some reject who just won't learn. I always thought that was just him but these last few months, I've noticed my Mom do the same thing. Maybe I am this pathetic person. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's felt like that a lot of my life. Like people just look right through me. Invisible. A nice person, sometimes interesting, but mostly just a commercial people suffer through when they're trying to watch their favourite show. I know my family loves me, but as I learned painfully in this life, that's just not enough. I really don't know if I'm a person that can be loved if it wasn't for genetic biology or society telling them to. I think that's why I fell for Angie so hard. She was the first person, (literally) that made me feel like I was something. That I could be desirable, loved for actually being myself. I will always love her for that feeling. It was probably the best feeling I have ever had. I think that's why I fought so hard, even when she had clearly given up. After 14 years, that feeling has all but dissipated and every time I unrealistically expect somebody with Borderline to come to her senses and not make me feel like utter bullshit, the reality comes down like that boulder on that Colorado highway. My only love, was somebody who just couldn't love me back. And I loved that feeling so much, that I probably put myself through too much. I always thought I was strong enough to handle the chaos. Now it just feels like it hollowed me out like a termite infected tree.

If the universe did have anything to give me hope or inspiration, why would it wait so long to show. I know they're are people in much worse places than I am, which just makes me feel weak and pathetic. Mom's always telling me how hard she had to fight, which just makes me feel like I really don't have what it takes to survive. Like I really am too sensitive for this world. I want desperately to make an impact. To matter to somebody beyond just being related to them. In the end, i will just be a waste of potential and and truly insignificant. Not making a difference in this world one bit. I never thought I would think about suicide, but the more I do, the more I understand. I've been so fearful about Angie doing it. The panic that would hit and the quick talking to get her back to a better mental place. It all seems pretty hypocritical now. If you really look at everything logically, suicide really makes sense. The amount of work I need to do, just to get to non-pathetic place in this life, seems like too much. Like I waited way to long to make a healthy life for myself. And even if I somehow became this badass that turned it all around, the world is in such a shitty place that the question of "was it all worth it?" is actually valid. I really do feel like the day after everything starts to show promise, really turn around, will the day I will have a stroke or something fucked up like that. When I finally get to a place of independence, truly not relying on anyone, Russia would bomb us or a supervolcano would decide to blow. All a reminder that I fucking wasted my life. So why wait, at least I can control how it ends. At least the one thing I can do is not let experience that final indignation.

So the question becomes do I put the people I care about through that. I'm not so blind to pretend that it wouldn't hurt those close to me. I always hated when people who are suicidal say that. But the real question would be is the pain they would go through my suicide be more or less than all the disappointment and stress I put them through. Seeing my Mom's reaction and my sisters face, how sad I make them is unbearable. I think the pain at first would be bad, but then they can say "at least he isn't in pain anymore". I also debate whether it's better for them to know I committed the act or to just disappear and do it somewhere no one knows who I am, Just some John Doe. Some melancholy  story that will never be fully told, or remembered. Maybe that will provide my loved ones the opportunity to cling to the idea that I'm doing well somewhere, an asshole that doesn't talk to his family which is pretty much the truth. It was always too hard. Too many bad memories and feelings. No one in my life was a villain or a bad person. Just a bunch of fucked up generational inertia that was just too powerful for me to deal with. I tried, I definitely tried. I coped by not thinking or dealing with it. Now that I try to, I feel like it's too late. Like it's Godzilla and I'm one of those people running around the streets, trying hysterically to survive it all. Nothing I really do or did, will have made a difference. If Godzilla wants to fuck up the whole city, who am I to stop it. Like everyone I love is just in a bunch of misery themselves and all my existence does is remind them of it. What's ironic, is I always wanted to be an inspiration to people. What a fucking joke. Childish thoughts from a childish person.

So, as I weep for the billionth time these last few weeks and use way to much kleenex to not make a total snotty mess, I think that my story will be a sad story. Not enough importance or significance to really even be a tragedy. Too intelligent to be blissfully ignorant, but not smart enough to navigate these rough waters. No, just a boring dude, who in the end, might as well not of existed in the first place. A heartbeat of existence that was pointless, and made no positive impact on anything or anyone around him. A person who peaked in the 8th grade and was all downhill from there. Not worth the breath to tell the story.
