I'm constantly being misgendered by customers at my job.I'm a guy and nearly every time a customer finishes checking out they say "Thank you, ma'am.". I can't take this shit much longer. I literally have no self-esteem, no confidence. I can't remember what it feels like to be genuinely happy. I want to die. The only thing stopping me is the thought of the pain it would put on my mom. I've been trying to hold it off but when she's gone I'm 99.9% certain I won't be far behind. Every day I wish someone would just rob and shoot me or I get killed by a drunk driver or hydroplane and wreck my car.
