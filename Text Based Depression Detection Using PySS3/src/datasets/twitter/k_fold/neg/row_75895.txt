Just a quick question. Not an emergency.I just met this boy and we've recently become good friends but I've noticed that his statuses on facebook and instant messenger are always "sad" or "depressed, end of story" or just song quotes. When I've brought it up to him, he won't tell me about it. I just wanted some suggestions for you guys for a song you like when you're sad that cheers you up. Just a relaxing song that makes you feel like everything is alright. Also, I'm not sure if I should keep prodding him for answers because I don't want to annoy him about it but I want him to know he can talk with me. So, song and friendship suggestions? Thanks

EDIT: I do know that he ended a 2 year relationship in May. Could that be it?
