Planning for the 31st. But now I'm having doubtsI'm clear headed right now. It's only when my emotions get in the way that I'm not suicidal. I've thought about it logically and know that this is the right decision for me. For the last few days I've been starting to prepare to kill myself on December 31st. I have a lot to do before then. But thinking about it makes me feel happy and at peace. For the most part.

My main doubt is that I have only recently started opening up about my mental health struggles to one of my close friends, and it's been stressing him out to the point where I don't think I should try to talk to him at all right now. I think he needs space from me even if it's just from casual conversations. But I want to talk to him before I die...both because he means a lot to me and I would hate to spend all of my last days without him, and because I don't want him to feel like I shut him out before dying. So I don't know what to do. I don't want to stay alive longer solely because I want to end things on a good note with him. That is probably just going to make me resentful. But I don't want to do this to either of us.
