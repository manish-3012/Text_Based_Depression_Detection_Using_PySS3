I just can't deal with life anymoreSo yea as the title said i am finding it really hard to cope, i don't know why i, i though i was getting better because i started to speak to someone about my problems from the past and the ones i face now, but i just can't seem to find a reason to carry on living, i am bi and a trans man so me mum and step father always treat me as less then human, i can't go to my sisters for help because they both have problems in their lives at the minute. I also can't talk to my best friend about it because she is hurting from the abuse she gets from her father, mother and sister. I just feel so alone and like i would do everyone a favor if i was not here anymore. I just want to die, i don't even know why i am writing this know. I am so pathetic and selfish , i am 18 and everyone always tells me i have a whole life ahead off me and i am just there thinking in my head about how much i want to die. 
Sorry for anyone who reads this i know that my spelling and grammar is horrible.
