Hanging myself tonight18m who has tried already 3 times and failed (first was overdose attempt, second two were plans to jump Infront of a train).

Social anxiety has fucking ruined me, I can't function in normal social situations so often find myself hiding in toilets at college/avoiding public transport/avoiding certain jobs at work. There's so much more to it but I just can't explain. 

Managed to tie a noose with a strong thick cable and will be heading out into the forest at some point tonight (probably around 2 am so my parents don't wake up).

Goodbye guys, you're the only people who will know about this. I hope some of you reading this go on to leave great fulfilling lives.
