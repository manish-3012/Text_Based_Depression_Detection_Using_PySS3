Im so sad and miserableIm so alone and i want someone to just say hi to me even if i go to work everyone avoids me or stares and at me judging me. No one even cares about my existance. I tries to stay home from work to get my family to even ask how i was doing i was waiting in my room for a response but instead I get scolded. No one looks at me like a human i hate myself and everyone. There is no one in the world i admire or like cause im hated, Im deciding if i just off a bridge and drown. Granted ill probably be in hell but who knows. I hate being sad i hate no one caring for me SOMEONE PLEASE ASK HOW IM DOING OR JUST WAVE DONT IGNORE ME PLEASE IM VERY FRAGILE SOMEONE PLEASE CARE FOR ME
