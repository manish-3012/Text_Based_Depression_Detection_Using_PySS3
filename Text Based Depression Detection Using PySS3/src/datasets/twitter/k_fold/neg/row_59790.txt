I'm unsure, but I feel like tonight might be the night or I'm really closeI have prescription pills that have a severe interaction. More than enough it seems. I can't take them in little bunches over the days. I already taking a small bunch and it didn't do anything, so I need to either take it all or none. I still feel unsure, but I feel my "crisis level" slowly wavering upward.
