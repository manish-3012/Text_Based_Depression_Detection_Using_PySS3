I'll listen. Say or Rant it all on me. : )Just wanna tell you that if you wanna lift something off your chest, rant it all on me. I'll listen.

No questions asked. I won't ever judge. 

Something troubling you? Some minor or major issues? I gotchu, I'll listen.

Disclaimer: I do not give advices, sometimes I do but  I'm not the best at it. Still, I listen to every story and issue or rant that is given upon me. 

I want to keep you company.

I won't ever judge 'cause I know how it feels to be anxious in sharing just because you might not be accepted or undertood for your mistakes and issues.
