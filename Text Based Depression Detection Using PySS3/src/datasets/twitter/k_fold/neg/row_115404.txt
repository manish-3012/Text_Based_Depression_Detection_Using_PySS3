How I saved my own lifeAbout a year ago I started to drop into serious depression.  I lost my scholarship and lost a great friend in a drunk driving accident.  I was later diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder, but that is not the point of this post.  I want everyone having dark thoughts to read this and realize that they always have the power to improve their life, and that there is always hope.

So there I was, suddenly six digits in debt, and upset about the loss of my best friend.  I decided I was going to be "strong".  I was going to keep my problems to myself and present a normal front.  The bills piled up and I started to skip class to get high.  I had smoked and drank socially before, but now I was abusing it.  The months stretched on, and around January I was at the end of my leash.

I decided to tough it out and try to graduate.  I didnt make it that far.  After weeks of only leaving the couch to buy more booze and pot, I snapped.   I drove home from college when I knew my parents were at work with the intention of getting my gun out of the safe to end it all.  As I opened the safe, I felt something well up.  I dont want to call it a will to live, but something I have since come to call "survival mode".

Instead of a gun, I pulled out my passport and hopped back in my truck.  A few hours later I had sold my truck and pawned a few valuables.  Ten grand in hand, I bought back-packing gear and a plane ticket to Paris.  24 hours later I was in Europe.

I spent a few weeks in Europe, in contact with myfamily only via facebook.  They were justifiably worried, but they understood my choice.  I was in control again.  I felt super aware of everything going on around me.  Life seemed like a distant problem, I was busy having an adventure.  After a few weeks and some odd adventures, I found myway home.

Therapy helped me find my center.  I realized that happiness is a state of mind, and that friends and famiky always care.  Strangers even care if you reach out to the right people.  Taking your own life is a perminent solution to what is probablya temporary problem.

I was able to finish my degree and now work as a Brand Manager in a well known marketing firm.  I love life and am off of the lexapro I took at the beginning of my therapy.

Thanks for reading, and remember that someone, somewhere loves you.  I love you.  You are a member of the human experience and a great person.  If you ever need to talk PM me.  Thanks for reading, and good luck.
