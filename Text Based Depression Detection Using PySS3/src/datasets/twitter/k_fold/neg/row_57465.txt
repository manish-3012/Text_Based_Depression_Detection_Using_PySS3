I'm in a slump and might fail uniIt's 1AM here and I have a big presentation day today or/ and tomorrow. I'm supposed to build a website for booking and they gave us 6 months for it. I procrastinated so much and I just realized I'm not even 10% done. I fcked up real bad. I can't do this. I have nothing to deliver today. Should I just go to the ocean at dawn and just vanish? This is impossible. I'm going to fail this subject. And if I fail this subject, I can't go for internship. And I can't graduate. God, I am so stupid, What the fuck have I been doing all these while? That's it, I should just end my life. That or my parents will kill me. It's a loss-loss situation now. I have to go. To everyone, thank you for your support in my past posts. I hope you'll find your way out. I can't. Bye
