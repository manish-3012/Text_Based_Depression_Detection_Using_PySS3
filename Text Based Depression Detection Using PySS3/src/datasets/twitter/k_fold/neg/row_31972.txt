After 13 years of chickening out of suicidal thoughts, it's finally beginning to seem not so bad.I've been depressed since I was 6 years old. My primitive mind tried to kill myself before I was even out of kindergarten by getting wasps to sting me to death, and it failed. Ever since that, I've always been reluctant to end my life but it's always been in the back of my mind.

Now, I haven't spoken to anyone in over 100 days. Staying alone with just my own thoughts to accompany me every day is really driving me insane. I know this isolation isn't the real issue, it's just a product of the lifelong depression. This is where it's taken me.

For the first time since that first attempt, death really doesn't seem so bad. It can't be too different to how things are now.
