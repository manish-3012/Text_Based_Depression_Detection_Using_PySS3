Justifiable SufferingHow long does on have to suffer before society says it is acceptable to die?

I've done my part by reaching out and trying to get better only to be shat upon each and every time. 

I will not be opening up to people again. Vulnerability is only exploited against me. It is a weakness.

People do not want to help. They just don't want to be exposed to the negativity of someone's suicide. They think only of themselves, especially in our unhealthy hyperindividualistic society of today.

So, how long will you let others suffer so that you do not have to feel bad?
