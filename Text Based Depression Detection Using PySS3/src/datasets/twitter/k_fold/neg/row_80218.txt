Still on the suicide thoughts, what's new?I don't even know why I'm making any posts anymore. I just don't see any point in living. I've always struggled to make friends and put myself out there. I'm studying something I don't necessarily enjoy. I'm 26 and never had a gf. I just lost my passion for life. I'm gonna go for broke and reveal to this girl that I want take her out on a few dates. I genuinely like her and if she rejects me it will probably play a role in me potentially not seeing 2018. It just adds to my shitty life. 

I will fight till 31 December and then make my decision. I know I can do better, but sometimes I wonder if the effort is worth the struggle. You can argue that my life could get better around the corner, but you can also argue that it will stay this way for years or get worse even.
