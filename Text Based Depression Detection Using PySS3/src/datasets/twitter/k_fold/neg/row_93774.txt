Life ain't getting better and I honestly can't take this anymoreI'm really tired. College is a mess. Just got a test back and it was a fucking 2/20. I studied my ass off and I got a two. I'm really tired of trying and trying and nothing works. I've reached my breaking point. I've asked for help. I just feel ever more dumb and worthless. It's tiring when you've been feeling like this for 15 years. From my mother trying to kill me, to my parents insulting me everyday, to nothing working out for me, i don't really see a point anymore. I really don't.

It seems like I can't win no matter what I do. I think this is the end. Education was the only thing I was proud of in myself. I had good grades, I was an excelent student. But in college... none of that is happening. I have nothing going for me anymore. So what's the point of being here if I'm only causing more harm than doing any good? I know my friends will miss me, and my SO will too, but... they deserve someone better than this. They deserve someone who's good at at least something. Not a complete failure who drags themselves along the days, weeks, months and years. I have no point in being here anymore. So I guess this is rock bottom. I'm oficially broken.
