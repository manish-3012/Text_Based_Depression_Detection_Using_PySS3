I feel pathetic. help?Throw away account.

I'm 22, just graduated college, living with my parents, working for my parents (and not earning a wage cause they can barely keep things together right now), in huge credit card debt, student loan debt. All my friends left back at school. No friends where I'm living. Can rarely visit friends. 

And I hate it. I have thought about suicide for years. since before high school. But I don't think I will ever commit it. Too scared of the effect it would have on my family. However, I am constantly daydreaming about dying in a car crash, or of lung cancer, or something that would bring my life to an end without causing the pain of having a suicide for a son and brother. 

Here I am, feeling completely helpless, and I don't know what to do to rectify my situation. I've tried therapy. Barely helped.

and again, I will probably never commit suicide so I feel pathetic asking for help here, but I can't stop wishing I was dead.
