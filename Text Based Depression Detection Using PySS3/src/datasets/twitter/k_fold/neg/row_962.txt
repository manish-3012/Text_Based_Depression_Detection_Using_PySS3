I feel like I have way to much trauma to feel like I can carry on anymore.I have put myself in too many positions where I have created trauma for myself. I have repeatedly chosen abusive people over people that genuinely cared for me &amp; thatâ€™s why I am in this position. I hate myself for the choices I have made &amp; I hate myself for being such a fucking doormat &amp; allowing people to be abusuve &amp; manipulative to me. I think I am past the point of getting better &amp; I am beyond repair. I try to get better I rlly do , but the past always sneaks up on me. I feel like Iâ€™m doing well sometimes but I have made too many mistakes &amp; I truly feel like I will be better off if it just ended it all. I can finally be free.
