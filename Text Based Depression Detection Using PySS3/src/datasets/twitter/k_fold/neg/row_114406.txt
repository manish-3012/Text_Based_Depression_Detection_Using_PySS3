need some supportwell right now i have a knife next to me and i was just talking to my brother about my depression and social anxiety yet again another family member has blown me off saying it's normal... I've already tried to kill myself twice and told my family about it... i feel alone and have to much social anxiety to go to see a doctor, I honestly have no idea what to do at this point.  I could really use some words of encouragement.... please help
