My best friend ran away and possibly kill herself i don't know what to doOkay so my long distance best friend told me how she wants to kill herself but its so hard to do anything because of the distance. I haven't heard anything from her for the past 3 days nothing I call her but she doesn't pick up I text her and she doesn't reply and the last thing she told me is "I'm saying goodbye, I don't want to talk to you anymore, I'm going to jump in the river and drown myself, thanks for trying." I'm so scared because I don't have any contact to her family. All I wanna know is if she's safe, I told her if she's going to hurt herself then I'm going to do the same I'm feel so lost right now and I just don't want to think about the worst possibilitie. If this continues and I keep losing people I will lose myself and probably succumb to my suicidal thoughts. What should I do please anyone help me.
