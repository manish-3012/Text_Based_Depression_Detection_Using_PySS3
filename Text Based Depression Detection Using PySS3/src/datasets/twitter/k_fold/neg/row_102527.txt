Graduated college at 22, broke and about to be homeless at 23.  I think it might be time.I'm totally lost, and I'm not sure what to do.  I'm going to try and keep this as short as possible, but feel free to ask me to go more in depth about anything, I literally have 65 microsoft word pages worth of shit I've written over the past year.

I'm a 23 year old male from a middle class family.  I've had severe ADD my entire life, though I didn't start getting treatment for it until college (my parents never took me to a doctor even though every teacher from 3rd grade on had written on at least 1 report card that they thought I had ADD).  In high school I developed an anxiety disorder and OCD (mostly thoughts, though I have a few annoying rituals).

Still, I managed to drag my ass through college, using the structure of school to hide my conditions (I never had much of a social life even though I'm very outgoing and love to be around people).  Once college ended though, I was fucked.  I couldn't hide anymore.  I was expected to go out and pursue a job, blah blah.  I started to have panic attacks.  My parents started to get angry that I didn't have a job and played a fair amount of video games (my coping mechanism for anxiety).  As my overall stress increased, my illnesses got worse.  At the end of June of last year, I admitted myself to the local hospital for suicidal thoughts and anxiety.  I stayed for 8 days, and then did an 8 week out patient program.

On Christmas Eve I was thrown out of my house by my parents after I told them I couldn't go to a family Christmas Party because my anxiety was too high and I knew it would only get worse if I went.  Luckily, my angel of a best friend and his mom took me in.  5 days ago, my mother told me I could come back for a little while until I got my feet under me.  The next day, I headed back to my house, only to be confronted by my dad who informed me that he wasn't supporting a slacker anymore, he didn't believe anything was wrong with me (both my parents have told 2 psychologists that they don't believe in mental illness right to their faces), that psychologists are just greedy hacks, and that I was just making excuses to not get a job (b/c being homeless is so much better, right?).

Now I'm in serious trouble.  My friends mom can only support me for a few more days, and NONE of my relatives are willing to take me in (they've all talked to my parents first and agree that I need tough love).  I tried to buck up and push through it, knowing my life was on the line, and have gone out everyday this week for 7-8 hours trying to apply to minimum wage jobs.  And it's not fucking working.  My anxiety and OCD are worse then they have EVER been.  I've got about $1,000 to my name (600 of which is on a credit card), and that's it.

I won't survive on my own.  During the 20-30 minutes a day I actually feel good I get super confident and make all sorts of plans.  But then the anxiety, OCD, and depression kick in and I can't function.  The massive irony is that except for my ADD, my OCD/anxiety/depression all become very mild when I'm at a low stress level.  But for the past 6 months it's just become a vicious cycle.  All I can do now is cry and think about all of my failures.  Just 2 years ago I had the whole world open to me (fuck it, I still technically do), but now I'm about to be on the streets.

Hell, it's not even my failures that bug me.  I understand how life works.  I understand that you don't always get what you want.  It's my inability to even pursue my own goals that drives me nuts.  The person that everyone has seen for the past 3-4 years is little the COMPLETE opposite of who I really am.  Normally I'm a survivor.  I don't give up.  But it's wearing on me.

Everyday since I left the hospital I wake up every morning and have to convince myself not to kill myself.  And I'm sick of it.  I'm sick of fighting myself.  I'm fucking tired of it all. Fuck.
