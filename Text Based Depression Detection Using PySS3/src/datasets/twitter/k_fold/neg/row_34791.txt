Im just brokenI dont think anybody can really help me anyway, but i wanna scream and just end this. Life in meaningless, nothing is going to fill this void, and the one person who can isnt here anymore. Im broke, my country is just in total chaos and i wanna die. I hope there is no life beyond here. I hope just end everything. I used to love so much, i just hope yall can do it to, and feel the beauty of a filled life, because all of you deserve it. Sorry for this, and for everything. I just cant anymore.
