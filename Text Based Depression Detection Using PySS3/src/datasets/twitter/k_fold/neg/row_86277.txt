I think I am developing bi polar disorder, and after being normal my whole life until now, i dont think i want to live with this shitI worked hard as shit my entire life.  Been working almost full time since the day I turned 14.  Cant even go to work recently, i dont want to be a burden on society and i am having problems taking care of myself.  I dont have anyone who I can count on. Im tired

Bipolar runs in family, family member commited suicide, and i want to go the same way they did it.  i dont want to suffer anymore.  The only reason i havent done it yet is cause of a dog, which is pathetic in itself; but she is a really good dog.  My best friend.
