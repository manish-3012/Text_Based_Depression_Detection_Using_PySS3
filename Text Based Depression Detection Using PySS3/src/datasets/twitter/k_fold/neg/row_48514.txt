"Happiness" feels like an impossible dreamI know, like everyone else, that happiness is a fleeting emotion like any other. It's temporary, as is this feeling of hopelessness and loneliness and frustration. This too, will pass, blah blah blah. 
But I'm fucking scared. I'm quite young, 16 years old, and I'm so fucking scared. I go to the gym semi-regularly. I'm eating healthier, talking to friends at school, I'm more-or-less on top of my school work. But it all feels like I'm just stuffing tissues into the mouth of the black dog. It's still there, I'm just making it quieter. I'm still empty and scared, I'm just distracting myself with a bunch of useless filler. School is a bunch of useless filler! The media is just a bunch of useless filler! Conversations with my mum, where I don't even hide how I truly feel about our relationship; it still turns out as nothing as filler. There is no catharsis in anything I do. These moments of pure peace I build in my head and treat as a goal don't exist, they never could. If I got to them, nothing would change. A pure peace of mind doesn't seem to be a real thing. 
Nothing seems to be a real thing. Yet, I continue. Semi-regular gym lessons, healthy food, manage-able time management skills, and "friends" that I wouldn't shed tears for if they died. This, apparently, is the closest thing to 'happiness' a stupid teenager like me can ever hope for. 
Just don't think about the future.
