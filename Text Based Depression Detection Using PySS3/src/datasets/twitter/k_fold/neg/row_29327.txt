I am living a nightmareEveryday I wake up and I suffer. I am making my parents suffer by letting them see me like this. I don't want to die, I don't deserve to die. I cry everyday and every ounce of my energy is drained. I'll probably cry till my heart gives up because I feel helpless. I've caused all the pain to myself and my family, I am responsible, I am guilty, the feeling of guilt, shame, embarrassment eats me up every day. I've gambled with drugs and made a bad mistake, I've heard my mum cry so much it breaks me. I pretend to be strong in front of them but deep down I am so broken, I feel like a kid that made a bad mistake. My parent's deep down know I am suicidal and suffering, my mum broke down and told me that I am all she has, I had to be strong and tell her not to think about it. I can't interact with anyone, I am not normal anymore. I want to die a painless death but I know that's not possible, I know Ill cause more pain to the people around me after I'm gone but I'm no good right now, I am the worst wreckless scumbag and I will never forgive myself for what I've done. Everyone shames me, everyone knows... its my future I ruined, its my family's happiness I've robbed. Even though I'm alive and breathing I've lost myself in the midst of my own life experience, I never used to be liked this but the condition I am in right now has forced me to cause myself this enormous emotional pain. I'm having mental breakdowns every day, I feel helpless. I've lost a gift that was too good to lose and now its too late, the mistake's irreparable, broken forever, living a nightmare. Shall I write my own fate? because my future is no more.
