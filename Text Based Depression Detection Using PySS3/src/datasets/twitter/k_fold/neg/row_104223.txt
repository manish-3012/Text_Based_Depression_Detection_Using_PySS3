Why do we post here?Why yell into the void and hope someone responds? 


I wonder how many of us go through with it after posting here. 


why why why






I'll start. (Last time I posted here was a different account I forgot months ago.) I post here when I'm lonely. I'll make some effort to get in contact with some of my friends, and they'll brush it off and go back to whatever they're doing, and I realize how much more I think about them than they think about me. So I pull away.


 Obviously I haven't killed myself yet. 


What I'm dealing with right now is, lots of confusion and uncertainty. I don't know whether I'm becoming paranoid or beginning to see the truth. I don't know who I am, really. I don't know what I want out of life. Where's motivation without goals?



Since we're at least staying our hands long enough to post here, why not? Just talk.
