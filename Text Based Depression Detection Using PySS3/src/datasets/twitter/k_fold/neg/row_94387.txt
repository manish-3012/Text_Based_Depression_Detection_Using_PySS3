As it turns out, no one caresAs it turns out, no one actually cares. You tell people you're going through a rough time or struggling and it's all, I'll be there for you or anything you need, and I'll be there for you. It's all a lie. They're there for a second to offer empty words and say they want to be there for you, but when you actually start leaning on them, you become a burden. I don't feel like anyone cares lately, and when I pointed this out to the people who are supposed to be closest to me, the basic response was "dont trust people" or "people have their own stuff to deal with, don't expect them to be there". And I understand. I get that it's hard to support someone. And that it's better to put yourself first, even if it means not being there. 

But I just wish these weren't the same people who lied to me and said they'd be there when I needed them, they weren't. I wish these weren't the same people who would cry if I decided to go through with it, saying at my funeral they wish they could have done more, because when I needed someone they decided it was too much. And most of all, it's the same people who tell me I don't share enough with them, that I push them away. No shit. This is why. I'm angry and frustrated. Maybe I'm being unfair but these are the same people that I wanted to trust who I feel let down by. Who do nothing now but will be all tears and regret later. I hate how angry and resentful I am, especially because I should understand that people need to look after themselves. I just wish they wouldn't offer me lies then.

Mostly, I wish I could find a way to help myself without relying on these people. I want to find a way to continue he friendship without letting my resentment show. I wish I could just fix myself, considering not even therapy is an option right now. How do I even do that? I wish I had someone to talk to.
