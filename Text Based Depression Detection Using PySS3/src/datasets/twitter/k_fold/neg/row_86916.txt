im just tiredLast week I broke downcrying during a videochat. My best asset is my life insurance. I cant escape this marriage. it's killing me. Today i had company and entertained from the bed. im tired of not leaving bed. I dont have the means to leave. im unhappy the kids are unhappy. im just tired. sounds stupid but im going to try to make it to my daughters bday. no one loves me i feel trapped and used. im real downhill, i only have a few weeks of life left in me. idki gotta deal and since i cant, i wont. im just incredibly tired.
