It's not so much that I hate myself but more like I want to end existence.Really that what suicide means to me, the end of existence. Just nothing. But why not have something instead of nothing? Because "something" is shit. Most of the universe is empty space anyways, it won't be anymore full or empty with me in it. It will remain a cold, sad, desolate space for the rest of time and everyone is just tricking themselves. Good for you.
