I never thought I would make it to 30. My fight with Bipolar Depression.Obvious trigger warning, I am going to talk about suicide. If that will upset you please skip this post.

I turned 30 this November, No one was as shocked as me.

For a long time I would have told you my base state was somewhat suicidal. Not always extreme or a worry. Just a thought that underpinned everything in my life. For instance if you gave me a button that would remove me from reality without a trace, or moment of pain for my loved ones. I would have pushed it in a second. 

Its like the old joke, "My car broke down, I could fix it, Abandon it, or kill myself." But i was like that with literally everything. "Should I do this or that, or just kill myself."

I was in the hospital in 2017 for a severe depression episode. It started slow but built to the point every other thought was actively suicidal. I had plans, I had dates, I was ready... One morning I woke up and I was in so much pain. There was only one thought on my mind. To go get my parents gun and end my life. I actually left the house that morning with the intent of doing just that. By the time i was in the car and driving, I was so deep in my head i started driving to work instead of my parents. I made the first wrong turn, and snapped out of it, and decided I could always do it tomorrow. I went to work and without being there an hour , I sent the text that saved my life. 

I texted my SO and mother "I think its time for me to go to the hospital." Left work and committed myself. I spent 12 hard days there but i got back on my feet. But I still wanted to die, The thought that i had made a mistake, that i shouldn't have sent that text plagued me for months. Once I shared this feeling with those close to me it got weaker, lost its power over me.

Fast forward to the end of Oct 2019. I am forced to move apart from my SO. I felt like i failed us, like i was worthless, and I just didn't know how to life apart from her and be okay.

Not that i would recommend anyone try anything from this story so far. But im doubly reminding everyone that now.

The last night of the move was the first night we HAD to sleep apart. We've done it before but this was different. It was like she was stolen from me by my failures.  


In a moment of desperation I dont regret. I comitted what I am calling, Psychadelic Suicide. I took 6 tabs of LSD, for those who care dose totaled 750ug. The story of the rest of the night is posted on this account if thats something you want to hear. But for this post ill just copy the TLDR

" TL:DR I dropped 750ug after being awake for over 24h, Watched the Suicidal part of me lose once and for all to a newly discovered part that wants to live. I switch teams in my head, Life gets easier! "

The change I want to talk about here isn't some coping mechanism, its not some trick i play on myself. I genuinely would prefer to be alive for the first time I can remember. I never planned past 30 because I assumed I would give in by then and be dead anyway.

I let go of the feeling of wanting to be dead that night. It was hard, suicide was always so comforting to me. No matter how bad it got I always had an out, or so I thought. But I wasn't living life, I wasn't taking care of myself. I spent many sleepless nights on suicide watch, [lostallhope.com](https://lostallhope.com), and other neutral or pro suicide sites. Logically I was convinced that I was better off dead. 

I believe that was my fault for allowing the thoughts to consume me whole.

My issue now is that i need to plan like i never have before. I want to see 60 now, I might even want a child someday!

My advice to anyone struggling like i was isn't ground breaking, or anything you haven't heard. But I believe these things are true.

1) Plan actions not results. If you only plan what you are going to \*Do\* not whats going to \*Happen\* you wont be as disappointed. All that can happen is you do it or not.

2) Thoughts will pop up about anything and everything. The best thing to do is nothing. Just let it wash over you until its gone. Dont embrace it or push it away, just let it be.

3) Reach out to someone, anyone. If you are going to hurt yourself call someone, anyone. There are resources everywhere if you dont have someone personal and close to you. I know it can be terrifying to admit to these feelings. But it is the first step on the road to recovery!

4) I dont know shit, talk to a doctor. Seriously Im only in my head, I am not a professional, I just want to see you get through this.  


PS: If you really dont see any ways out of your pain, Try Psychedelics first. Just dont do a huge dose like me. Be safe.

TL:DR: I was going to kill myself before i turned 30, but didn't thanks to My doctor, My SO, My family, and My drugs.
