Just wanted to sayIâ€™ve been having more crisis lately, in part because my birthday has come in the past few days, and i hate birthdays, just to show another year has gone by and iâ€™ve done nothing with my life apart from aging

Also thereâ€™s this girl, we became so close, and now is more and more trivial, distant, uninterested 

TIFO shes into another guy

I want to puke, literally have the desire to puke, the other day I had a crisis in which i couldnâ€™t get off my head â€œi will kmsâ€

I donâ€™t talk with anyone online, my family doesnâ€™t talk to me either, im cool with that, but that makes a little difficult to get this girl off my head, after all theyâ€™ll make a good couple I guess

I have no money to get psychological help, i had it years prior for another purposes, I think this time I really need it.

The years pass by, and i feel the world forgot me, no social media, nobody remembers me, im truly alone

I know i kill myself but not yet, Iâ€™ll wait for my parents to die first

I also quit drinking, marijuana and smoking these days, im thinking on getting pretty and fit, keep up with my studies and life, and then end it all out of nowhere when my parents die

Its a little hard you know, not getting money for substitutes, support from nobody, nobody to tell, i have made a chat with me, i tell myself my reflections, when i have anxiety crisis or suicidal thoughts, what to tell to this girl, to not flood her with thoughts or be toxic in any way with her, so i order my thoughts, i have that chat also to feel i tell someone this plan, or my little achievements, its hard to be that depressed, that lonely, and swim against the tides

I cant sleep, i want to puke
