WhyI donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m not happy. I want to die so god damn bad and I donâ€™t know why. My life is fine, nothing great but generally nothing traumatic or overly bad has ever happened to me. Iâ€™ve felt like shit for years now. 
Last night I went on a first date with a girl Iâ€™ve liked for over a year. It went super well. Iâ€™ve never been happier than I was last night. But that was last night. Today I felt worse than I ever have. I donâ€™t understand why. I want to know but I canâ€™t get to the bottom of this shit without therapy but my parents wonâ€™t let me get any.
What the FUCK is wrong with me? Iâ€™m trying as hard as I fucking can to feel any semblance of happiness I can but it always goes away. It never stays and itâ€™s always worse than before once itâ€™s gone. FUCK MY FUCKING LIFE. I absolutely HATE being alive. This girl is the only reason I havenâ€™t offed myself by now. Iâ€™ve been holding out hope that maybe having a good relationship would bring me some joy but after today I can see that I was just being naive. I have no reason to stay at this point. No future that I think will lead to a happier life. Iâ€™m starting college in two years and itâ€™s already giving me anxiety. I have no passions, no real friends and a shitty family. I want to die.
