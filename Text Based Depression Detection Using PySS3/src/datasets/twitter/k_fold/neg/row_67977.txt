Give me a reason not to end thisbe me

-21 yo

-getting drunk pretty much every single day;

-fell in love with the "wrong" person;

-very inteligent(to the point to know where this is going to end( though im always thinking the tide is going to change on my favor ));

-raised as a "loner" pretty much my entire childhood (though my parents we're working , **BUT** they **HAD** time to take care of my sister , whilst, well , **THEY LEFT ME** );

-shitty friends(tried to make new friends, but i cant because of the above);

-shitty job (work hard , get physically hurt a lot, low paycheck);

**I CANÂ´T SEE A REASON TO KEEP THIS GOING!!!**

-it hurts(not physically) to even think of how my life is going;

-depressed pretty much 24/7;

-sometimes it almost actually hurts physically to think of my life;

**GIVE ME A GOOD REASON NOT TO END THIS , PLEASE!!!**
