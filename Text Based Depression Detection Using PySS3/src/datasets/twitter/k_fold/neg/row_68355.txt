I'll probably get blind in the next 6 years and I don't have a reason to live anymoreI'm sorry in advance for the bad grammar I'm still shaking from discovering my conditions and English is not my native language.

6 months ago I noticed my vision got a little blurry than usual. I had my glasses since I was 8 and trough the years it was always getting worse. Yesterday I went to doctor and he sent me to a different doctor in capital city. Long story short I will loose complete vision in about 6 years, I'm 18 now and can't imagine myself as a 24 year old woman who can't take care of myself.

I wouldn't be able to get a job in the field of my liking, I've been studying chemistry and wanted to go to a college to become chemical engineer but I can't do that if I'm blind.

I would never ever be able to be independent, as I would have to rely on charity of others.

I'm living in a third world country where we have no adviced medical care whatsoever for the disabled, as I wouldn't even be treated as a human.

My hobbies are always been movies, comics, video games and reading but without my vision I wouldn't be able to do more than half of these things.

It's shit when you learn your life would never peek and I don't see any reason for me to continue living like that.
Only good thing is that I discovered my condition early on so I can end myself on time.
