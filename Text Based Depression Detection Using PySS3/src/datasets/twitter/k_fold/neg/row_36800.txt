Never thought I'd be here...I'm sure there are other people with more pertinent problems so I guess this would be more of a vent. I woke up today and realized I can't control my drinking. I'm hurting the people I love. I've been depressed for years but with the mounting stress of school I'm reaching a snapping point. 

The past few days I've caught myself 'rationalizing' taking myself out of the world.  I got really drunk and came out to a friend. He was accepting. I thought it would be a relief but I feel like shit. I am 'reclusing.' I want to never wake up. I feel like the shittiest person alive right now. Simply, it doesn't feel worth it.

In my binge I randomly punched a stranger in the face. The police saw it. I was lucky he didn't press charges but I don't feel anything but disdain for myself.
