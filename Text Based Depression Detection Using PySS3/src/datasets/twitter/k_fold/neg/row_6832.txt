I donâ€™t look forward to the future anymoreAs the title says, I donâ€™t really look forward to the future anymore, I donâ€™t have any aspirations or a meaning in my life anymore. I would never kill myself because I donâ€™t want to leave a mess for my family or for the people that care about me, but everyday I do live in hope that something finally takes me out of this world. I was diagnosed with depression in late 2016 and while most people always say that it will get better and whatnot, my point still stands, I just donâ€™t really desire the thought of living anymore.
