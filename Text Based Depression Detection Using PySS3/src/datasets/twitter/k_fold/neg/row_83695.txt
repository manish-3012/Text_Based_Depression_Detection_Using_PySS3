God I want to do it nowI'm withdrawing from pain meds so fucking hard. My skin is crawling and I just want to kill anyone that looks at me wrong. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy (well, maybe I would). Also I'm broke and my car is about to completely fuck up on me (engine issues). I've already decided that if my bank account goes into the negatives I'm gonna blow my brains out. This life is just too much for losers like me that can't get their shit together.
