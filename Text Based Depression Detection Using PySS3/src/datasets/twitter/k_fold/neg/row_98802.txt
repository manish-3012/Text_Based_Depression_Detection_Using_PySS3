No one actually caresI just wish someone gave an actual shit ya know, my parents don't fucking care, they just made that real fucking clear, I honestly can't take this anymore, I want to be away from them so bad, I just want someone in my life who really does care.

I can't take this shit anymore, I can barely do anything but sleep and they still just say im lazy and not trying like I want to do nothing all day. I wish so badly I could do anything, but I can't force myself to and absolutely NOBODY is there to help me.

They force me to tell them what's going on and get mad and belittle me when I do and I just can't anymore, I'm actually bleeding more than usual and I might be able to do this this time, if not on purpose by accident. It doesn't matter anyway, I don't have anyone who actually cares so it doesn't make a difference. The worlds fucked and I give up.
