I hate to throw this pity party, but I really don't know if I can cope with this breakup.I've never felt like this before. Like I'd give anything and everything I have to go back a few weeks in time and change the way that I treated her. It was a 3 year relationship. The last year was really rough. Lots and lots of fighting -- typically over stupid things, but we had some tough things to get past. Differences in religious beliefs being one of the biggest culprits. She's spiritual, I'm an atheist. I've been lying to myself for years about what I want. Mostly because I'm afraid of the future. Afraid about job security, being able to provide for a family, making my parents proud, and things of the like. 

She's so ambitious and it scared the hell out of me. When she talked about getting job promotions and moving cross country, I didn't support her. I never supported her like I should have. I was selfish and afraid. All said and done, I still want to marry the girl. She makes me a better person and I love everything about her. Truth be told, I'd love to see her go far in her career, even if that meant spending some time apart from me. 

It was completely out of the blue and I just wish more than anything I could've done things differently. I've completely screwed up here and it feels like I'm losing everything I was living for -- my future. I go to sleep crying. I wake up crying. I just don't know what to do with myself. I'm sorry.
