I fail as soon as I start trying,so why bother?

To give some context, I (18 male) just failed my finals and I'll retake the exams next week. Two of them on Monday and one on Tuesday. The problem is I## have to get a B+ at two and a straight A at another to pass now.

And I AM gonna try, I'm just not sure whether I can take another failure because in all of the exams that I had maybe a handful were B's and only one or two of them A's.

I'm aware that failing wouldn't be the end and nowhere near as drastic as I make it out, as I could just repeat the year, or drop out and get a job, but to me, it would be. Everything I've ever dreamt of being basically hinged on my academic success and I just can't imagine myself being happy without this.

It's not really spontaneous either, I actually told myself years ago that, should I have to repeat or drop out, I would kill myself.

Soy as I said, I do still hope for the best and will try my best (for what it's worth), but realistically speaking? This is likely to be my last week in this... whatever this sick joke is supposed to be.
