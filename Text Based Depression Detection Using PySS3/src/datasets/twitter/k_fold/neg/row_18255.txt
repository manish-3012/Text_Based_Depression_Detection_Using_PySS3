lots of first timesI drank a can of beer for the first time in my life because I thought it would help me feel better and sleep easier. first of all I had no idea my face could become that red and the alcohol just made me feel worse lol. My parents even walked by and saw the bottle but they didn't care...I've been sitting in bed crying and hyperventilating but they didn't care I have no one who cares. I've just been googling suicide methods over and over and for the first time I dug scissors into my wrist to see what it felt like. it wasn't enough pressure to bleed but I saw where the skin had been scratched and I just stared at my wrist and thought about how I really could cut myself and then scream and cry about it but no one would care
