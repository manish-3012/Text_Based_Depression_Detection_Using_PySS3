Back and sinking fastI checked myself into a mental hospital- 'behavioral center'- last Sunday and came home yesterday. They changed my anti anxiety medication slightly, raised my Buspar by 15 mg. I was good the first day I got back, which was at around five in the afternoon. Now I'm not quite as depressed but also worse in a way? I want to kill myself more than before but I'm not upset about it. I'm cutting myself more deeply and I don't feel the pain. Not upset or in distress when I cut either. I just do it.
