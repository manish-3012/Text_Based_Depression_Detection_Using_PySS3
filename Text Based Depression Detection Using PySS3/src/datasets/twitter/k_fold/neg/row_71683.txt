I just want this pregnancy to be over so I can kill myself without regret.I'm so sick of everything. This gross fucking room. The temper tantrums my toddler throws. The mice that think they own the place. The roomies that have dishes and trash everywhere. The pain of being pregnant again despite being on birth control. The scraping by to keep up with bills just to stay in thousands of dollars in debt. Having to apply for jobs on behalf of my SO because he won't fucking do it himself. My doctors blatantly making it difficult to get sterilized after I give birth for a second time because at 28 I'm "still young and may change your mind before 30." Constantly being judged as a mom because I sometimes scream when I cant take it any more. But then again, maybe I am a shit mom becauae even now as my toddler yanks at my hair and hits me with toys I just put away during his shortened nap, all I can think about is how much I just want to die. I try so desperately not to cry around him but I cant hold it in and I know him seeing me this way is damaging him in some way. Its not his fault his shitty mom is like this but hes not old enough to understand that. He just sees me, a wreck and mess, and the only thing really keeping me together right now is the fact that its pretty fucked up to kill myself and leave a toddler alone for hours till his dad gets home and only a few weeks before his baby sibling is born. 

And maybe for most moms having kids to live for is enough but honestly it hurts me more. All my choices and options, even death revolve entirely around what's best for my kids. I'm trapped and lost and angry. I dont want to feel this way but I cant stop it. I wanted 2019 to be a better foot forward. I wanted to be a stronger, happier mother and wife but I just dont have the spine for it. I feel like I'm being crushed alive and no one and nothing can help me. I'm so tired. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I just want to be done.
