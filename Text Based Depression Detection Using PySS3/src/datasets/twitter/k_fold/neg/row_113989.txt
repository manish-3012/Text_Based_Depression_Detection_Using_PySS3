The Signs Are EverywhereI posted here for the first time last night and stayed up all night responding, digging myself deeper into a hole.

Then today, a bunch of bad things happen at once?? It's a sign, you gotta take it as a sign at this point! I'm DESTINED to kill myself soon,  the universe knows and it wants me to get it over with. I'm wasting oxygen.
