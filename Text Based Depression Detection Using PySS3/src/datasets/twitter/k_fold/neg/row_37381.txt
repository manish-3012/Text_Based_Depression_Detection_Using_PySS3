Fuck everybody.Iâ€™ve posted here so many times and nobody ever says anything. Thatâ€™s fine. Add it to the list. Iâ€™ve struggled for 10 years. I thought it would get better but after a long series of ups and downs, Iâ€™m still fucking back to feeling the same as where I was when I set my deadline to be gone before I turned 18. I turn 23 today and nothingâ€™s changed. I shouldnâ€™t have given it a chance. The therapists Iâ€™ve had either donâ€™t understand and itâ€™s basically just venting, or I never have enough time. The crisis text lines only try to help you in the moment and they say they understand but they donâ€™t. Theyâ€™re just talking to strangers and itâ€™s what theyâ€™ve volunteered to do. Every time I close my eyes, I think about jumping off the highest parking ramp I know of with a knife held to my heart so when I land, itâ€™ll go straight in. I want to increase the chances of success as much as possible. If the fall and head trauma doesnâ€™t do it then the stabbing will. Iâ€™m not going to fail. Thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™m going to keep going. I hate everything so much.
