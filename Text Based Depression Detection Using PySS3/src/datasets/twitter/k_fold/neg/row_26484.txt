[L][F 20] Struggling with depressionI have been struggling with depression for years, but lately it's been getting worse. I am always irritated with everyone, isolating myself from everyone, crying, meeting strange guys and going to their house for the night, self-harming and even attempted suicide. I am honestly not okay, I have no friends, no body calls to check in on me, and I live with a toxic/abusive family.
