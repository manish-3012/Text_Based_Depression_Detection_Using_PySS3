I want to dieBut I don't know how, I'm too afraid to jump, too afraid to throw myself in front of a car or a train, I don't have anything to overdose. My family is a mess, one of the main reasons to end it, but at the same time I feel guilty. I would like to make it look like an accident.
I don't have anything to hold me here, I love my dog we just got him a few months ago, but he's more into my mom, so he wouldn't really miss me I guess, my cat doesn't care too. I have a few friends, but I could never imagine talking with them about my mental health.
I've never been in love, I wish I would fall in love but never did and nobody loves me either or thinks I'm cute.
I'm ugly, boring, stupid, useless. I shouldn't be alive, it won't get better, it never did. I'm sorry, I wish to stop existing.
