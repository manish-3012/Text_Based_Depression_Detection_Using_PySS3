feeling like this is it, im not even sadi don't know how to describe what i'm feeling but its bad. im just thinking about ending it, my mental health seems whacky as hell, im diagnosed with a lot of bullshit. on top of that my physical health is horrible my immune system has been compromised for a year, still no help. its not getting any better. im not set on a plan but i have a few in mind. im lost with this feeling, i just dont want to live anymore, im unable to leave the house, i live in the middle of nowhere, i get to go out for groceries and therapy, im sitting in my chair in my room all day, im just sick and im done. my art doesnt even make me happy anymore and im an artist for a living. 

recently got a friend back that made me extremely happy but everyone around them seems to be toxic and its dragging me down too, life just isn't cut out for me. im sick.
