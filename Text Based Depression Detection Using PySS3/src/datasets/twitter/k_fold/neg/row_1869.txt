Most effective form of suicide?Not looking to kill my self, just curious. Iâ€™ve had 2 friends who have died via self inflicted gunshot to the head, but Iâ€™ve been reading that thereâ€™s actually a decent chance you survive? Seems like the best and most painless way, but i canâ€™t imagine what a family thinks walking in and seeing that. 
As far as you guys know, what are the most deadly drug cocktails, painless routes, or fastest routes. Like i said not looking to commit suicide, just have a lot of questions.
Thank you.
