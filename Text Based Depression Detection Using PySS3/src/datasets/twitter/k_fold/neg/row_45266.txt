My sexuality and HOCD is ruining my life.I can't stop obsessing over being a lesbian. I'm not, I'm bisexual and I don't want to be and I'm petrified of being a lesbian. My brain keeps lying to me and tricking me into thinking I might be when I'm not. I just want those disgusting lesbian thoughts to go away. 

I hate being attracted to women. I'm never ever going to come out of the closet. I'll date men and marry one until I die. I will never act on my feelings about women and that makes me fucking depressed to an extent. Depressed because I lean towards women more and I want to fuck one so bad. I can't stop thinking about being with one and loving her and cuddling and having kids with her. Why the fuck does my brain  do this to me. And thinking about the same thing with men doesn't give me the same feeling.

And you know what, no one is proving me wrong. No one. All I hear from lesbians is how shit it is. How they're so lonely and going to die alone. So no, I'm not wrong, and no, I cannot be happy with my same sex attractions. 

I don't even know why I fucking care about lesbians when I'm not one? All I do is obsess over it. I'm *bi*. I like men too. 

I don't want to fucking deal with this shit. I want to fucking kill myself and I won't be thinking any of this anymore.
