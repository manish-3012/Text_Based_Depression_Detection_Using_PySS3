Suicide Over Spring BreakHello all. I have had suicidal thoughts in the past, but this is the first time I've really idealized them and dwelt on them and made plans. I plan on killing myself this spring break. There's a bridge near my house. I'm going to walk to it and hang myself under it in the night. I have a day set and everything. 

My life is going nowhere. Everyone has different priorities than me. People tell me I'm doing a lot with my life and making the most of college but I'm an English major and don't plan on going into education--so what am I going to do with that? Fuck this.

I've been depressed since freshman year of high school when I came out to my parents and they reacted badly and got my church involved. They're fine with it now, but that just started a spiral of negative thoughts in my head. I can't get rid of them. I try accomplish things all the time so they go away but it only lasts for like 2 or 3 minutes and then they come back. It's been like this for 6 years now. I'm a junior in college. I don't care. I'm doing self-care shit my whole life. I do good in school, run a club, get semi-decent sleep (almost always more than 6 hours, usually 7 or 8), exercise, eat well (thanks to my workplace), and even do creative outlets. I also take and have switched medication, which helped for a couple months and now I'm shit again.

I still feel shitty all the time unless I'm busy. I can never be at peace with myself. I just want to be done because all of this feels meaningless. I have no emotions inside except for shots of fear, constant anxiety, random anger, worries about the past present and future. It's all hidden under an always smiling exterior. My coworkers ask if it's possible for me to stop smiling, if only they knew the irony is that I don't feel anything ever. It seems that some people are meant to be depressed.
