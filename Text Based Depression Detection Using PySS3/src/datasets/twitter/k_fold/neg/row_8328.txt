Sitting in my car and wondering what I should doI know a huge part of it is because I'm out of paxil and I can't get a refill until I see my doctor next week. But I've been wondering what the point is before the meds even ran out. We can't afford December's rent, the landlady is breathing down my neck because of November, I'm failing all of my classes, still haven't found a way to deal with my chronic stomach pain... I can't even afford to take care of my pets right now. I've let my husband down. my step kids. My animals. Myself. 

I know I should just go to the er and tell them I want nothing more than to die right now. I can't stop crying. But I've already missed a ton of work and I haven't even finished my first 90 days. If I go in, I'll probably lose my job. We're already too broke to feed ourselves. 

There are train tracks a block away and all I want to do is lie down on them and never wake up again
