Don't know anymoreFeeling like my life has no purpose. Most of you would think I'm too young to feel this way ( I'm 17) but it's something I've been thinking about over and over, idk how many times I've thought about it to tell you the truth but the only thing I've realized is that from the start I was a mistake. Everything is falling apart.. It's as if I'm doomed to fail in life. Dropping out was a thought that for the first time came into my mind today and idk what to do anymore
