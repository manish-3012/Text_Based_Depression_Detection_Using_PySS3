Do I deserve to liveI called my bf a bad name involving his insecurity because he was unknowingly making fun of my big insecurity and I didnâ€™t mean to but I hurt him deeply. I really didnâ€™t mean to hurt him I just wanted to try and relay how much he was hurting me but now he doesnâ€™t want to open up with me anymore and I canâ€™t blame him. I love him so much and I hurt him badly and I canâ€™t stop thinking about how I deserve to die. I never wanted to hurt him but I feel like I just hurt people when Iâ€™m alive and it kills me to think I hurt someone as amazing as himðŸ˜¥
