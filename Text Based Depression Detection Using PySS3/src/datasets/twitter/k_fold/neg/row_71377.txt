I am lonely.I donâ€™t wanna live anymore. No one cares they wonâ€™t ever care my parents donâ€™t care. I am always alone idk what to do with my life. I donâ€™t care anymore, I want to sleep forever. Nothing helps. The only thing that keeps me going is games. My happiness is a facade. The smile on my face when I go to school is a facade I show to the world.
