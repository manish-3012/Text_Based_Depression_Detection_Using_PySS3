I've been doing a good job of bottling everything up but one thing goes wrong...And it's all back again.

I got an email saying that I probably will be kicked out of an internship program I've been banking on. 

Even if I did get to do it, my grades are too bad to have scholarship cover it and there's no way to raise them at this point.

I know I did this all to myself. I was so lazy, didn't do any of my work, just shut myself off from the world and pretended that class or anything important didn't exist. 

I pretend that I don't exist, really. 

Now it's getting to the end of the line and my rope is all knotted up. There is so much wrong going on in my life. 

I've gained so much weight, my grades are awful, I never go out anymore... But I'm supposed to be happy, so I'm happy, right?

I just want to die. I really want to die.

I don't have the strength to kill myself but sometimes I just walk on train tracks and hope something comes and takes me out.

The only way I can sleep anymore is if I listen to something. I can't listen to the sound of my own brain anymore.

Medicine doesn't work. Therapy doesn't work. Nothing works. 

I have failed myself and those around me. 

I don't even know what I'm looking for anymore. Or what I'm looking for here. I'm sorry to those who have to read this overly angsty nonsense.

I hope I don't wake up in the morning.
