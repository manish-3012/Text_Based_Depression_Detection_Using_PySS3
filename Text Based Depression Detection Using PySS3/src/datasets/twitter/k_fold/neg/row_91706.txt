Feeling like people will just abandon me and feeling alone and like I'll never have someone to cuddle withI get this feeling that people just want to abandon me and if I think about peolpe abandoning me then I'll want to kill myself. I don't want people to just abandon me or just ignore me because I really don't want to be uncared for. I want to kill myself every time I think about this. I'm so tired of being alone. I really just want someone to cuddle with. I'll never be able to actually find someone to cuddle with who would want to cuddle some 25 year old guy on the spectrum. So I guess it's all hopeless.
