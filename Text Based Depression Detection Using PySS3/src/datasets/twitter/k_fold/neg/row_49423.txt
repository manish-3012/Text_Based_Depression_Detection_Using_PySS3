I need to write this out.Each day I drive home from work, I wonder how quickly I could end it if I just drove into a barrier on the expressway. I think about the barrier and my car colliding and a jolt of electricity runs through my body. Then I think of the after math and I begin to sob. 

I don't know what's wrong with me. 

I know I'm not happy.
