Canâ€™t decide on where and how I want to kill myselfI seriously wish I lived near a high bridge like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. If I did, I wouldnâ€™t be alive right now. Thereâ€™s lots of trees near my house whereI could learn how to tie a noose and hang myself. I could also crash my car into a metal poll or a tree at high speeds. I just want a method thatâ€™s fast and painless.

The world is an evil, cruel place and I no longer want any part of it. If my parents ever owned a firearm, I would have likely killed myself by now. I just wish they did own one. I could have just stuck the gun into the roof of my mouth and die painlessly.

This will be my last year of being alive. Iâ€™m excited to fucking escape everything permanently. Canâ€™t live life as a loser if you killed yourself at a young age
