need helpi am really struggling. have had depression, ptsd and anxiety all my life. i'm 29 and though i am on medication i feel like things have gotten steadily worse since 2013 when my dad died and i'm increasingly unable to see a reason to go on. the only thing keeping me going is my fiance but i'm starting to feel selfish and like a burden to everyone i love. i just want to sleep. what i'm afraid of is the pain or i'd just do it. i'm also afraid of what would happen if i failed, how much worse it could potentially make my life -- like what if i lost my job and couldn't get a new one, what if my family and fiance got so angry they rejected me and i feel more alone than ever??
