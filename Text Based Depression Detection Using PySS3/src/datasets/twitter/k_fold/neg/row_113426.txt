I'm really desperateI don't know really, i've had a super good life but there's something not right. I always feel so terrible and I can't enjoy things the way most people do and I always feel too tired to even take care of myself so I look disgusting and every veers away from me. I'm not a super religious person, I was raised with religious beliefs but they're not as prevelant in my life anymore, not that I have anything against it though. But I prayed and begged to whatever could listen if anything could and just asked for some sort of pick me up or support or something to help me get through my days but all of a sudden I got bad luck and it feels like it's a sign that maybe I am just supposed to die. Albeit it's all silly stuff but i've been at my worst so i havent even been handling it well. I just feel so alone and sigusting and I keep thinking things will change but how? how would they change and how long am I willing to live this way? I know it's stupid but i honestly just dont have the strength to keep doing this, ive been fighting this for my entire life and i just cant do this anymore.

But I don't want to die, i want to be better and i want to be happy and i dont want to feel isolated or hurt anymore. But its so unrealistic to think that everything will just change and my life will suddenly change its established pattern so it honestly seems like the most logical explanation is that this is who i am and ill feel this way until im gone or im somehow morph into a suddenly different person. I feel so cornered, i want a new life so badly.
