It's just getting worse.I posted a thread here about a week ago. Look in my post history to find it, it contains a lot of the backstory. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel worse every day, and my old coping methods are not working as well anymore. I am just sitting here all day literally not knowing what to do. I'm still in the denial phase of grief, and I'm honestly afraid of the other phases, especially despair. I still don't want to end it, but I feel like I can't be sure I won't when it gets there. I don't even know what I want from this thread. Maybe it's just attention. Who knows.
