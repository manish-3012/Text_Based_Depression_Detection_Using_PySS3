Iâ€™m really fucked upSo when I was young my mom never really got out of bed. The only vivid memories I have were her manic episodes. She has pretty bad bipolar episodes so most of the time she was really depressed. The few times she became manic I either went to live with my grandma or got sent to foster care. I hadnâ€™t talked to my dad ever until recently. She had a boyfriend once that I remember bonding with a lot but then he left.

Well now Iâ€™m going on 23 and still live at home. I used to have a really good online friend group and a handful of irl friends, but I got into my own huge depressive episode. I didnâ€™t talk to anybody for almost 3 years and when I started to it became really hard to hold conversations. I was sort of the group joke and theyâ€™d call me a robot, stiff, ect.

Well my mom has another really bad manic episode recently and she ends up calling my old best friend I hadnâ€™t talked to in a year or two. She goes to pick up weed from him I guess and then he forced her to suck his dick... 

When she said she sucked his dick she made it seem like she did it on purpose and was laughing. I really didnâ€™t know how to react. I basically told her to get out of the car because the place I was driving her too was close and I just felt like I had to react somehow. When she didnâ€™t get out of the car I threw one of her bags out of the car... Then she started pushing me and it was just really messed up that we were fighting and I just waited till she got out of the car.

She keeps being extremely passive aggressive and blasting rap music with all the windows open because sheâ€™s manic. One night it got extremely heated and I pushed this broken vacuum cleaner we got at goodwill down the stairs. Iâ€™ve yelled at her, said horrible things, and writing this makes me feel awful.

During my super long depression Iâ€™ve talked to her openly about suicide. Weâ€™ve had suicide in our family and Iâ€™m sure she was extremely worried that whole time. My uncle knows most of this but hasnâ€™t responded negatively like Iâ€™m the bad guy, but I feel like Iâ€™m the one who caused a large amount of this and really needs to change. 

I have horrible social skills but have held 4 - 5 jobs. I donâ€™t have a job right now and canâ€™t keep a single friend. My mom and friends usually make fun of how Iâ€™m a man child. And I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve held a conversation with my online friends for about 2 weeks.

I really freaked my mom out with some things Iâ€™ve said and I feel like she just doesnâ€™t want me in her life anymore. I donâ€™t know what I need to do. Iâ€™ve also gained about 50 pounds.
