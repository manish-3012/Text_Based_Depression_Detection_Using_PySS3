I'm 30After I finished high school I worked with my father in his small shop for a couple of years. I then continued my education in computer science and got a bachelor degree. Since then, I never got a real job. I was doing some freelance programming that did get me some money, but it isn't really something that would shine in a CV.

I'm an atheist. Born and living in Saudi Arabia. And no one knows about my apostasy. As a result, I'm single, as I don't want to get into a relationship with someone who doesn't know who I am or wouldn't accept me if she'd known that I'm an atheist, and it's near impossible to find a girl who's also an atheist here. I also have no one to talk to. I've lost all my friends, because I couldn't be with someone who wouldn't accept me as an atheist.

When I first left islam, I had hope to start a new life in a new place. My plan to escape from this living hell was to land a job somewhere else in order to get a work visa, and then work on being a permanent resident. I was hoping that I'd find a place to fit in. A place that will accept me for who I am. A place where I would get married, have kids, and die there, after living an honest life.

But when I remembered that today's my 30th birthday, I lost all the hope I've had.
