Depression isn't real, fuck yourself idiotI've been dead for so fucking looking now, I don't know how I've continued but I'm persistent but today was just. My family is in the process of moving and we are trying to sell our house that we still live in, unfortunately my grandmother is a clean freak but also to lazy to do anything (last night she told me to run the washer even though all it needed was the soap) so she wants me to keep all of our somewhat large yard cut and free of limbs that fall which means at best once a month or worse every week, do all the dishes, keep the kitchen clean take care of all the trash in the house and some more stuff which is most of the house work. I'm also the only worker that can do everything and actually do it all right at work usually one of the last people there in a 9 or ten hour work day. What do I come home to "you didn't clean the kitchen" even though that was pretty good and "you didn't clean your room" aka didn't make my bed and an empty can of soda. I had hit my limit for the day and was about to crash and try hibernation for the next three years so I asked her to please shut up and she asks me to not use that language with her, grab my dinner that is still sitting next to me nearly an hour later and my sister starts talking to me and brings up my asshole of a father I'm trying to kindly kick out of my life because he helped my depression and makes it so I can't be around guys anymore without being anxious and defensive. She wants to know if I've been avoiding him and yeah I have, she asks why I would do that and I detailed those reasons. She says I should see a doctor and that this is all hormonal basically invalidating ask the pain I'm in every single day and the fact I'd love to slit my own throat every damn day. This is why I never talk about my problems because nobody tries understanding the things I go through and the multitude of problems I have. I'm just tired.
