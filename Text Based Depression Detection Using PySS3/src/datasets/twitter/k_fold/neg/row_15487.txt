I think I'm done.So, reddit, not that anyone cares, I think I'm about done.

I'm nineteen, failing out of college, my girlfriend of over a year is at a music festival, and I've found things on her Facebook of her planning to fuck an ex fling there. I confronted her about it and we had an actually very productive conversation about it.

While she has been there I've caught her in several lies, and just bullshit after bullshit. So there's that.

I'm also failing out of school, I'm not happy. I work as a waiter and get constantly berated by costumers all day. I hate my job. I hate school. 

I constantly fight with my parents now that I'm back home for the summer. We have always butted heads, and now they are planning on cutting me off because of it and because of grades. I was planning on moving in with the girlfriend eventually like we had talked about, but that doesn't seem to be happening.

I've attempted two times before, once when I was sixteen and another when I was seventeen. Hanging both times. I think I'll try something different now, probably OD. 

I'll probably end up waiting until she gets back and see how that goes. I'm trying my best to keep occupied and such. Oh did I mention that the money she used to go to the music festival mainly came from me before I found all of this out? So I paid for her to go fuck another dude. Good job me.

I doubt anyone cares, but I just thought someone might.
