I don't know what to doMy twin sister was hospitalized a few months ago for suicidal thoughts. I feel like if i try and go to the ER I will just be seen as seeking attention. 

I don't want to die, but I don't want to be living right now. I've been sick I think for so long. I feel like if I end up I  the hospital my boyfriend will break up with me once he realizes that I'm not as well as he thinks I'm doing. But it's getting harder and harder to get up and interact. Yesterday I had a midterm and for a bit I swore I was going home to end it. It's getting harder to not do it. I don't want too worry my mother, but it's getting harder. I'm on medication and I've been through therapy, idk what else there is to do.
