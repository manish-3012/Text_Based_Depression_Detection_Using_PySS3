When that light starts to fadewhen someone is suicidal its like all the light has left them they can no longer feel anymore and the feelings only go away more and more everyday. i want to be happy. god knows i want to be happy. but when that light fades away in you. when you lose your passion for everything in life when even food or sex no longer brings you pleasure when everything becomes unsatisfying and you feel like every day is only going to be more dissapointing than the last. when that light fades away. its weird because its such a weird feeling to just lose it. This world let me down.
