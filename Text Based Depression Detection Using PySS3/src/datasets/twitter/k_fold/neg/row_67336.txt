I can't do this anymoreI wish things were different. Every aspect of my life feels horrible. I don't have any friends to be with, I'm banned from even talking to my girlfriend, I try so hard to be people's friends but they always go to the people they want to be with. I'm never the person that gets chosen over someone else. I'm completely worthless to everyone I know. Yeah I can send someone a text and they'll tell me it'll be okay and look to the future but that doesn't help. I want the experience of being with people. I want to be happy and I never am. I just want to disappear into thin air without leaving a trace. If I could erase the memory of myself from my parents I would. I don't even see a reason for taking my parents into consideration at this point. They are divorced, I only live with my dad, my mom is crazy and tries to brainwash me, my dad is never happy with me even after I bend over backwards just trying to please him. Anything I've ever done for my dad is not good enough and every time I try as much as I can he yells at me because I'm not good enough. Always telling me I should be like that kid or I should have more of this trait. I'm just done with it all. I feel completely out of place in this world. It's gotten to the point where I cry every night and sometimes it lasts up to an hour. I haven't been able to get excited about anything in my life. I feel tired numb and broken and can't find a reason to keep fighting if this is the world I'm fighting to live in.
