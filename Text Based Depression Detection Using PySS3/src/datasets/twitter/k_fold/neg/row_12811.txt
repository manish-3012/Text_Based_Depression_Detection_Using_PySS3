Iâ€™ve waited 7 years, I can wait another 5Just felt like sharing to get this load off my chest. Iâ€™ve made the decision to not go through with suicide until Iâ€™m really sure. 

My dogs a rescue and sheâ€™s too attached to me. Sheâ€™s scared of everyone and everything and she only has me to look after her. I canâ€™t trust anyone to take care of her if I took my life so Iâ€™ll wait until sheâ€™s older, and more socialized. 

I guess I feel a little proud of myself for not going through with it tonight. I keep thinking about it but if I keep repeating â€œ5 yearsâ€ it calms me down enough to not take all my meds at once. 

I hope if anyone else feels like this, maybe theyâ€™ll do the same and repeat those words as well. I mean I canâ€™t see anything getting better but I can try for another 5 years, I know I can. 

Thanks for reading
