Finally bounced back. You can too!![One second video of my life every day in 2017.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9ITApQDEIA)

I had aimed to do a one second a day video for 2017; however, I filmed a second a day in 2017. My life went to shit as i did. I ended up nearly called it a day in 2018 after not leaving the house in months. I've finally bounced back. I even remember posting on here at one point, hence my return. 2019 is my year. Why can't it be yours too?

I almost shelved making the video as 2017 and onward was horrendous, and this video made it look great, but I suppose thatâ€™s what we do online. We post a highlight reel. We post positivity. We flex. But we forget thatâ€™s the case when we look at others, and envy what we see online; therein lies the problem! Donâ€™t envy others. Envy the future you and what you might do!     Anyway, I edited most of this last year, but couldnâ€™t go any further, so instead itâ€™s here, well in part anyway. Reason being, I almost called it a day in 2018. I hadnâ€™t got out of bed in days, hadnâ€™t got out of the the house in weeks,  and hadnâ€™t got out of my head in months. Luckily a few friends old and new, helped me bounce back, and man am I glad I was smarter than that and kept fighting. Iâ€™ve never been happier than I am right now. All I did was start believing in myself again and cut out those that didnâ€™t believe in me, or had sabotaged me in the past. Oh and met the girl of my dreams. Iâ€™ve been in care, adopted, physically and emotionally abused most my childhood, in trouble with the police, homeless, bullied at work, all sorts, but Iâ€™ve kept going. So many amazing people have helped me along the way. I'm not looking for sympathy; I'm just saying if I can do it, why can't you? Someone loves you. Someone wants you to reach out to them. Life can be hard, but keep going. Donâ€™t forget that. 

No more excuses. Iâ€™m back.
