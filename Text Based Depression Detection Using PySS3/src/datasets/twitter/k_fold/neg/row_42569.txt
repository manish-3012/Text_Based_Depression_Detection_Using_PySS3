I could use someone to talk to.I'm a person who is only happy while being in a relationship. I finally found my person but now it looks like we will not make it. I can't help but to feel like I don't want to live anymore, and what would be my easiest way out. I don't want to hear that there's another person.. I could just use someone to talk to because a part of me wants to stay, even though most of me wants to get out of my room and end it
