IdkHonestly donâ€™t know how much longer I have, I donâ€™t want to die, but I donâ€™t see anything getting better any time soon. Iâ€™m starting college in a week, have no idea what I wanna do, it will just be wasting my parents hard earned money, they can barely afford to pay. I have extreme social anxiety, so bad I quit my job after only 3 weeks, I have no motivation to do anything with my life, thereâ€™s nothing I enjoy doing anymore, not even video games or Netflix, my parents and friends have no idea, I started self harming again after 3 years clean and I donâ€™t really see a point in continuing to live. I donâ€™t wanna die, i just wanna live happy but I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s possible at this point, Iâ€™m just a burden to my family and friends but Iâ€™m too much of a coward to end it. I just want to be normal. 

If anyone has anything that helps them stay motivated please lmk, Iâ€™d much appreciate it
