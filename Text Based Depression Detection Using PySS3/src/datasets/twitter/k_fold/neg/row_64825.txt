I am REALLY struggling with my life right now. I don't know what to do or who to talk to. Help?I didn't realize how bad it was until I was holding the alcohol bottle in one hand and the phone in the other. I tapped the call button to the suicide hotline. The person who answered spoke didn't speak English and she hung up when she discovered I didn't speak Spanish. Or maybe it's because all I said was a squeaky "hi?" and then felt like crying. I put the bottle back in the box so my parents wouldn't find out, but it's been a while since I've eaten. I've started really long Netflix series, and ordered stuff on Amazon so I have a reason to live a few more days. Just to see what happens. People say "It'll get better" but as far as I can tell it won't. We still can't afford good food, I can't go back and undo being raped when I was 9, school and boys are still confusing, bullies are still mean. The school guidance counselor will report if I tell her anything concerning, I've tried before, and all it does is worries my parents, make them drink more and buy less food because they're buying alcohol instead. I suppose hope is really the only thing keeping me alive. Either hope or stupidity. I definitely can't afford therapy or counseling. I don't want to call a hotline again. I really want a friend but I don't trust anyone anymore. Somebody please help me.
