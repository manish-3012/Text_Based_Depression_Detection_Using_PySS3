I don't want to kill myselfI believe in God, and that's the only reason I haven't killed myself , but I'm really getting weaker everyday, and already swallowed a lot of pills in a moment of weakness, thankfully they only made me fall asleep, but I'm scared to lose all hope that is left in me, my problem is financial and love thing, my best moments are when I'm asleep, every time I wake up I feel like I'm living a nightmare
