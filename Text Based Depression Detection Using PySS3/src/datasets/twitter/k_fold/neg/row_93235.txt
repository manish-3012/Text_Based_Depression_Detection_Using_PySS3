It's too late to get the life I wantSo I envisioned in myself a great life where I would be married go a lovely, beautiful, wife, have a few kids, live in a nice house and be at the top of my career game. 

Now that seems all but impossible. I recently graduated with a civil engineering degree but I have no job lined up. I accrued internship experience like I was suppose to but no job at the end of the tunnel. I know I should've networked, I would do anything to go back and focus on networking and making a ton of friends in school. 

Now this would be ok if I was 22 or even 24, but I'm not. I'm 27 years old. Starting my career when I am 28 is far too late. I'm 4 years behind everyone else. 

On top of that I don't have as much experience with women as the average guy my age, just a couple girlfriends. Most guys my age have had several fwb, as well as a couple **long term** gfs 

In my observation, most girls over the age of 22 are either taken, massive sluts, overweight, ugly, retarded, or mentally ill. Many times it is a combination. On the other hand, feminists have created a stigma of "older men" dating younger women. No one is going to introduce their 20 year old friend to a 30 something year old man as a potential girlfriend. 

Seriously the next time someone says something about age gaps and "sick old men" I will bash their baby's head into a wall and tell them this is what it's like to go through some real hardship bitch. I'll laugh and enjoy their sorrow and tell them it is just a splinter compared to the agony I face. 

Luckily I just turned 27 so getting my career started at early 27 is fine but if I don't get started by the end of the summer I'm going to drown myself in a farmer irrigation lake. There's just no way I'm going to be able to live life on my terms. I'm deathly afraid of being alone but I'm also deathly afraid of marrying a "reformed" slut and getting divorce raped. 

If anyone knows of someone who started late in life **and** is still married to their first wife who **wasn't hooking up with random men** by all means talk about them. Until then there is no light at the end of the tunnel.
