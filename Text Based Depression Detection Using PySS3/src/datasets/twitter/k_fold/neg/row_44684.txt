i dont know how to meaningfully cope with these feelings. I'm getting overwhelmed and I don't know what to do.ive basically given up. ive stopped caring about most people, most of my old hobbies, most of anything. one of my oldest and at one point, my best friend, has totally betrayed me.

I lost my job at the place he worked at because I just couldn't cope with working there. I ended up leaving the job, and then that friend pushed me out of his life. I am thankful for it. It showed his true colors.

he called me pathetic, he said that i was faking my depression and my anxiety, and that if I couldn't handle pushing carts that i should just give up. give up on getting a new job, dont bother going back to school. i tried. its been like a month, but im so tired. i dont think i can try anymore. this person had been my friend for most of my life, he was one of the first to know when I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and aspergers aside from my family. now he just keeps posting about online, and I only found out because someone told me. Im both glad and not glad they did tell me. I dont know how to deal with this. 

i dont know what i did to deserve this. 

i dont know if I want to really die, really.. but im not afraid of it anymore.


i dont know how to meaningfully cope with all of these feelings, and I'm feeling overwhelmed.
