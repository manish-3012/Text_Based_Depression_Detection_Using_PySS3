Unsure whatâ€™s going onThis past year I feel like Iâ€™m grown so much as a person and learn to see the beauty of the world and the people in it. Iâ€™ve become a lot less shy and developed good social skills, been working out and basically gotten to a place where my past self would admire who I am today but in the back of my head that sense of tiredness seems to grown. I feel less sure about my future and sometimes canâ€™t even imagine having one. I think Iâ€™m happy and enjoy where Iâ€™ve gotten but Iâ€™ve lost that sense of being able to see a future for myself. I keep jumping between feeling like I just want to die to feeling so proud of myself when I look in the mirror. I donâ€™t even feel sad about it just tired and waiting to be able to sleep and rest peacefully. I think about suicide a lot more often now but donâ€™t feel scared or anything and that feels worrisome, like there is something wrong with me. Iâ€™ve tried talking to some friends about it and they sometimes tel me to think about the people around me but Iâ€™m my head Iâ€™m thinking why would I care if once I pass away itâ€™s no longer my problem,  my reality just stop exciting, my problems go away and I just become part of the energy and matter that makes up the world. Donâ€™t expect any help but I guess itâ€™s just nice to feel heard and know that you arenâ€™t alone. If my time is short itâ€™s better to make that short time feel better.
