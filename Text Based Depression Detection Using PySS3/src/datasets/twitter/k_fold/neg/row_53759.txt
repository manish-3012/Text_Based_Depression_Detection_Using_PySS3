I'll finally make it stopIt's all too much. So much is going on. I'm fed up with everything. Why am I so fucking useless. I'm just a fucking burden to everyone. Burdening and inconveniencing all the people I care about. I keep disappointing everyone. Especially this person I've been talking to recently. They're just so goddamn lovely and I just keep annoying them. I can't wait to end it all. When I end it all I'll be at peace. I won't bother them anymore. They'll live their lives. It'll all be so much better.

What's there to live for anyways? Someone else? Who it I keep disappointing everyone. Live for something? I've got nothing to live for. Nothing I'm good at, no passion just nothing. Live for the people I care for? I might not care for them as much as I say if I wanna die so badly... Why does everyone try to tell me life is worth living when I just bother everyone who meets me.
