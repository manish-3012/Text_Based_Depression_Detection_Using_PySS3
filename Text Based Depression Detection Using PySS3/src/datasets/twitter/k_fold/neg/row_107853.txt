Suicidal ThoughtsI haven't gone 1 day without thinking about suicide.I wish that I could just be OK with living or actually want to be alive but I don't, but at the same time I'm scared of what would happen if I die,and I know that people will miss me but no one but two people even know that I'm feeling this way,and even then there's not much they can do.Im kinda starting to give up,I relapsed recently(was almost a year clean from self harming),I started starving myself again and purging (was recovered from anorexia 2 years ago) and  I'm just letting my thoughts take control.I barely leave my room or go anywhere,I even started to take my daydreams and pretend that they were real,make up fake good news just so I could feel good about something. I know my family loves me,I know my two best friends would hate to lose me,but I just really, really wish I cared about my life as much as they do.Thank you if you took the time to read this
