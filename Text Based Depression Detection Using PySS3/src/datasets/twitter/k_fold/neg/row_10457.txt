Self Harm (Stabbing)For the most part I am just writing this to see if anyone has done or does the same thing and has advice towards removing the feeling.  

Lately I have moved from very light cutting to taking a knife and puncturing the skin on my chest just enough to reach the muscle and bleed.  Even with the pain it almost feels euphoric? It takes a few days for the small wounds to heal, but I have to say I want to push it further, deeper and cut past the muscle? 

So yeah again I am just writing this to see if anyone has had a similar feeling or done something similar and was able to stop the feeling of euphoria that comes with it?
