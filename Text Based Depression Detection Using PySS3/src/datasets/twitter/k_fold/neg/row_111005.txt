Nothing has worked....I'm sure my liver is hating me.  I have gone through about 1 1/2 bottles of wine per night, to include taking more than the recommended amount of Tylenol (yesterday about 1 gram).  I have bought out my liquor store of one kind of wine.  Recently bought six bottles of Pinot (pee-no) Noir (nwar) and am working my way through those.

I have eaten well up to 2lbs+ of amygdalin (soft center of cherry pit).  I am depressed for the shit I have done and the people I have hurt.  I wish I can go back to last year and not do what I did....time travel has not been invented therefore I have to live with my shame, guilt and regret.  This is my hell I guess.  During my wine binge I have taken over-the-counter sleeping pills, well I am typing this...so that didn't work.  I have tried mixing bleach and ammonia with my bathroom door closed and vent off.  I panicked, chickened out and ran out for fresh air.  I hate myself for the pain I have caused.  I am less than a man, less than nothing.  I have placed a knife to the radial artery on my wrist (the one you can feel your pulse with)....and wussed out.  I watched the movie "Wrist Cutters" and the opening scene was this dude cutting his wrists, dying and ending up in limbo.  WHY CAN'T I DO THAT?!?  I occupy myself throughout the day with working from home and then going on hikes or running errands...anything to keep these thoughts out of my head.  Then it's time to come home and they just come back up.  I just want the hurt inside me to end and the pain of those I hurt to end.  I figure if I am no longer in the picture, they can move on with their lives.
