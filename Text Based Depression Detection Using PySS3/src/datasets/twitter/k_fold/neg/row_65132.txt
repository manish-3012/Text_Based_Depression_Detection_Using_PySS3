april 1st.around 1 a.m. on april 1st a few years ago, my cousin killed himself. he was only sixteen at the time. here i am, so many years later, wondering what it would be like to have the same fate as him on the same day. i'm realizing why he did it; how pointless and existential life is. when he did it, i never understood why, but now that i do and i can relate fully, i want to join him. my friends (online of course) always say that he would want me to live the life he doesn't get to have, but it doesn't seem fair. he didn't get to live a full life, he gets away from this nightmare, and i don't? i just want to die, i don't know what to fucking do. i don't even know why i'm bothering to vent on this subreddit, maybe it's a cry for help, i don't know. i. just. want. out.
