Canâ€™t stop thinking about it.I canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself. Iâ€™m feeling so lonely, so useless and incapable of anything. Iâ€™m barely leaving my house, Iâ€™ve been missing a lot of classes, I probably wonâ€™t get into an university this year and I feel like trash. 
My mom gave birth to me when she was only 19. Honestly, she shouldâ€™ve aborted. She would be financially, mentally and physically better. 

I just feel useless. Iâ€™m paranoid, afraid that Iâ€™ll go out and someone will rape me. Iâ€™m afraid to leave my house. Iâ€™m afraid to live another day. Iâ€™m drowning in fear and paranoia. I can barely get out of my bed anymore. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m being stalked. Iâ€™m afraid of being alive. 

I just want this to end. I just feel like a burden to people. 

I tried to kill myself so many different times. But Iâ€™m such a coward. I just canâ€™t do it. 
But every single day, thereâ€™s this thing inside me that wants to put an end to everything. 

I tried overdose and poisoning. 

Iâ€™m so sorry if it sounds as if Iâ€™m trying to grab attention. Iâ€™m really not. I just feel so lonely and I donâ€™t really know where to go with all this. I do have a psychologist and a psychiatrist but I really donâ€™t think itâ€™s enough â€” given Iâ€™m currently taking medication and still thinking about suicide. I probably just needed to vent a little, since my next appointment is going to take a while. 

Thank you so much for reading.
