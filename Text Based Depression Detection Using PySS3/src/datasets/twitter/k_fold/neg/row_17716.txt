How do I push myself?I keep getting to that point where I'm ready to die 
I write a note, I set up the event - and then I stop. I don't know why though. I'm not afraid or upset. I'm wanting this to happen. But I just can't. 
How do I push past that? How do I get myself to the point where I can do it? 
The only time I thought I was able to, I was stopped by someone else. No one knows or can stop me now
