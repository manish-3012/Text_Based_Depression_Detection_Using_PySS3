I keep going back and forth.I'm 19 and in community college. I'm failing out of this college because of procrastination and a lack of motivation. My medical cocktail hasn't been working and right now I'm going through withdrawal from one of my pills because I haven't refilled it. Also I just Skyped my ex for the third time since broke up in October. Her life is getting so much better. She has an amazing boyfriend and couldn't be happier. I can't stop thinking about her. The fact is- I am so alone and have no one to talk to outside of school and work. My family would want to put me in the hospital if they found out I was so derailed from life. And I can't allow them to do that because we can't afford another stay there. I'm tired all the time and sleep doesn't help anymore. I just want it all to go away. Forever.
(TL:DR Help I'm losing it)
