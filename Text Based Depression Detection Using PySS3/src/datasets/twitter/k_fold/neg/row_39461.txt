I got really drunk and did so many things I regretI'm studying abroad in Japan right now. I don't have a phone number I can really use and Skype is being a butt so I can't call any lifelines, but god I feel like I've royally fucked up and there's nothing I can do to come back from it.

Last night I went clubbing with some friends and got wasted way too fast. I think I've had a problem with alcohol ever since I got here. I ended up spilling everything I was feeling to my crush (who didn't feel the same way) and completely blamed one of my closest friends for encouraging me to tell him like that. I ended up texting a friend who is doing a homestay for a weekend and I can't stop thinking about how I probably ruined her experience by making her worry. The friend I yelled at last night is angry with me for that because he keeps telling me not to rely on her because helping people has been stressing her out lately. So we yelled at each other about that too.

Worst of all, I posted shit in our group chat without realizing it. Now I can't fucking escape.

I don't remember a lot of what happened last night, and I'm dreading finding out. I don't want to open my LINE because I'm afraid of what I said to people. I don't want to leave my room because I'm afraid of running into somebody. I have no one I can turn to because I know I'll just be a burden to whoever I talk to. 

I desperately want to jump off the roof of my dorm. I don't want to die, I just want to injure myself. I feel like I need to be punished for all this. But that would really fuck up my parents back home. I have so many other things to worry about, like getting good grades here in Japan, finding an internship for next semester, etc. But I sincerely can't move past this. I'm in such a bad place, my heart is in the pit of my stomach and there's nothing I can do.
