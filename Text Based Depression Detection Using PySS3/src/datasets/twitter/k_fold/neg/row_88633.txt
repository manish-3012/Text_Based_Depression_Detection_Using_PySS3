I just want it to end my life to make this pain go away...I lost both my children my cat went missing I have no friends or family and my twin brother passed in 2009 and our birthday is next week I cry every minute of every day and I just want to end my life and make the pain stop. It seems like the only option for me anymore. Im so alone and in such a dark place and nothing I do makes the pain any better. Ive taken to doing any drug i can get my hands on just to make it through the day and hoping one day I go too far and O.D. I dont know what to do anymore.
