I think I sexually harassed someone (?) and I've hit the lowest of lows.I'm going to try to keep this as short as possible. 

I'm American gay 20 Male. Last December 2019, I went to a Christmas frat party where I struck up conversation with a guy I was attracted to and we shot the shit. I thought he was cute, so I gave him flirty eyes and flirty energy. He returned it and we had a fun back-and-forth going. I became handsier and started brushing his arm or putting my hand on his shoulder. Eventually I decided to show him my play and revealed my sexual orientation to him. He replied with "that's cool, man" and I asked him if he was gay or curious even a little. He laughed and said he was straight. I didn't believe it and thought he was straight-presenting only because he was raised strongly Catholic (he told me about his piety earlier). Whatever the case may be with his orientation, I should have respected he was straight and stopped. 

I was hooked on the good thing we had going and didn't stop flirting. He said many times I was interesting and funny, so I took that as a sign that what I was doing was alright. I asked him several times in a teasing way if he was actually straight or not throughout the night. He assured me he was. He didn't seem to express any discomfort or distaste towards my flirtiness, so I continued. At one point, I put my arm around his waist and he held my arm and rubbed it with his thumb. I kissed his shoulder too and put my head on his shoulder. He walked me home because we live in the same general direction. Before I went inside, he said he's glad we met and that we should be friends. Then he left. 

I go inside my house, open a bottle of Powerade because I was drunk, and lay in bed. My guy friend calls me to make sure I made it home in one piece. In the same call, my guy friend tells me I overstepped the line by coming onto a guy who maintained he was straight and probably made him uncomfortable. My heart sank and I agreed. I cried myself to sleep that night. I woke up the next day to a text message asking if I was fine and a meme from the guy. I apologized to him for my actions and he said it was no issue and that he had a good night. He invited me to a small get-together mid-week he was hosting. Since then, we've been normal friends. 

There are several things here: 

* I'm worried sick he felt coerced or uncomfortable and felt he could freely express it. And that my touchy-feely flirtation was sexual harassment at the least and sexual assault at most. I know heterosexual standards mean men have a harder time openly sharing their emotions especially ones related to sexual violence. He was a good-natured guy and might have wanted to avoid starting a scene. I don't want to have hurt him and just not know. 

* I walked away from the night thinking both me and him experienced the night positively. Could there be a possibility I saw the situation one way and he and others saw it completely different? From what I saw, he was okay and actively enjoying himself during and after, but the phone call from my friend and my anxious thoughts are making me second-guess my perception. I believed he was returning the flirts but his heterosexual claims may have negated all that. 

* I was out-of-line for denying his claims that he was straight and continuing to flirt. This was wrong, disrespectful and I was going too far. I take full responsibility for this. 

* I'm scared of being exposed. My friends are disappointed in me that night and I'm worried they'll share their version of events and what they think of me. I'm worried the guy didn't enjoy himself as much as I thought and expose me too. I'm reading girls' accounts of sexual abuse as they come forward and it starts with the abuser flirting, putting his hand around their waist or something of the kind despite clear discomfort and distress from the victim, and builds up to the abuser forcing themselves sexually onto the victim. I did not force myself on the guy, I didn't make an actual move because I didn't want to get punched, but I did put my hand around his waist, flirted etc. like what those abusers did at the start. He didn't express any discomfort or distress and I thought there was positive feedback actually, but I could've misread the situation. I don't want to be like those abusers, but I can't help feeling like I am one.

I'm hurting so badly.
