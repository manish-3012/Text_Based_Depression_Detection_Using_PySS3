Ending it FridayIve never told my true story but here it goes.

Im currently a junior in college. Ive never really figured out what i want to do with my life but im so ancious to find it in order to find a good job. Ive been really interested in forensic science and wanted to do something like that. Ive been a criminal justice major for the past two years which was super easy and gave me plenty of time to goof off. But this year i learned i will never get a job in forensics unless i get a chemistry degree. I made the change this year and now its nothing but super hard calculus classes chemistry classes and biology. I remember nothing from my time in high school because im also learning im an awful student never retaining info just spitting it out for tests. I feel like im everything and every morning wake up with painful anxiety attacks. Not to mention i have no friends, no experiences from the past two years of school. The only thing keeping me here is my parents, but now it doesnt feel like thats enough. I thought i could change and adapt but i cant. Everything hurts and i just want to die so i can have peace. I just cant imagine my moms reaction. Im a failure of a student. No where to go in life. I feel like a disappointment. A waste of space. I dont want to hurt anymore. Nothing helps. Therapy. Doctors. Medication. Its all worthless. Goodbye
