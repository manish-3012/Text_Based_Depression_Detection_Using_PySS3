Losing battleI wouldn't normally post in something like this but I have no one in my life who understands mental illness and I'm drained of reasons to endure. I have BPD along with a slew of co-occuring issues, including an eating disorder, sex addiction, PTSD, and bipolar just so you get the gist. I've been in treatment facilities over a year of my life and months more in psych wards. 2 years ago I attempted suicide and got 'rescued'. From then I changed my life. Got the divorce I needed and started a new life and got back to school. Things got superficially better but lately I've been losing all hope in any kind of life void of constant emotional turmoil and pain. I'm only 32 and my internal organs are messing up from the laxative abuse but the drs won't do anything to help get it sorted out. Trying to get my life sorted out but it seems no one will take you seriously as a single mother of 5 with tattoos and piercings. Now my 14 year old is cutting and suicidal and I don't know how to help him. Half my kids hate going to their dads house but he used my mental illness against me in court so I am having a hard time getting lawyers to even listen to me. The man I'm dating now is incredibly smart but an idiot on the emotional side of things so I feel like I can't run to him. I can't seem to get out of my low I was in last week. I keep trying to tell myself it will get better but even a break from the depressive state leaves me at a steady low. Only reason I'm around is for my kids. I see no purpose in life at all. No reason to exist. I have money, someone who loves me, 5 beautiful kids... I'm the thing in my life that is screwed up and my mind is so messed up I don't even know what is really my own thoughts anymore.
