No futureI couldâ€™ve been a successful person. I come from a good background, went to a good school. By all accounts I should have lived a normal life. But Iâ€™m a broken person and have wasted every opportunity presented to me. Iâ€™ve pushed away the people who cared about me, dropped out of school, and ruined my body. Now Iâ€™m just an empty husk of a human shuffling from day to day. Either Iâ€™ll live like this, suffering and contributing nothing to the world, for years or Iâ€™ll end it all myself. Killing myself seems like the only reasonable option, both to end my pain and so I donâ€™t continue to hurt those around me.
