Death is a friendHaving one of those moments where I had realized I can fight suicidal thoughts and be happy. Started off this year with registering to do a post graduate course. I was passing and failing but that was the juice of life, I convinced myself. I have had more than 6 years of weekly suicidal thoughts so I knew how pessimism can be so I was still fighting.

Around Oct I was diagnosed with a fatal disease. I thought to myself "wow, maybe I truly need to die.." but I wanted to fight first. I thought maybe all these things happening are paving a way for this post grad to come to fruition.
I worked for it and I was constantly scared of what might happen as soon as it doesn't work out as every odd has proven that" things don't get better"

I received my results today and unfortunately I did not make it. Apart from the fact that this has given a good green light for the suicide but I am in disbelief. How can God be so silent. How can the universe be so unkind. 
Not only am I finishing a glass of wine, didn't go to work, staring at 45 pills in front of me but I am also calmly thinking a about it all. 
One of the most terrifying cognitive dissonance is learning that there's what we call optimism and all the dynamics of it are not applicable in my own life even though they are meant for me. 

This probably will serve as a suicide note, but I have got a couple ones in my diary. It feels like I'm about to go on a journey as I am about to drink these pills. It feels like a new hope to find the truth. Whatever and wherever it is, I hope it bring me redemption
