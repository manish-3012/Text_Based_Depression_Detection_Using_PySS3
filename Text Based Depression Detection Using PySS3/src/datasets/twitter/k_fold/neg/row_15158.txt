I don't care about how i act anymoreJumping around like a child in public? I don't give a shit.

Not gonna do harmfull things to other people, not gonna be directly annoying or anything to them, i just don't care if i'm acting silly. In a supermarket. On the streets. In the woods. Fuck this. It doesn't matter. In a few years no one will ever think of the guy acting weird in public, because he didn't add any value to the lives of passerby's. There doesn't have to be value, but still. Fuck. I'm just a weird passerby to people. It's all fucking pointless.
