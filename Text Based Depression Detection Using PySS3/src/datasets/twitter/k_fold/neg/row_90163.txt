I feel like doing it at the end of vacationThe last two months or so have been total hell for me. Iâ€™ve been the lowest I have been in many years, Iâ€™ve never felt this level of stress, anxiety, depression and anger. I never feel good and no matter of stimulants helps. Iâ€™m going on a big camping trip tomorrow and seeing family I havenâ€™t seen in a bit, Iâ€™m hoping that Iâ€™ll feel better after it but I doubt thatâ€™ll be true. Iâ€™m thinking that Iâ€™ll try to enjoy this trip as much as possible then just end it on as high a note as possible. Iâ€™d feel terrible for my parents but I doubt many other would care. I just donâ€™t want to have to deal with the constant self loathing and anxiety with everything I do. I donâ€™t want to obsess over my ex constantly leading me on and toying with me, saying weâ€™ll try to get back together and that she loves me while she goes around fucking random guys. I donâ€™t want to worry about getting my fulls or what Iâ€™m going to do for university or afterwards. Iâ€™m tired of dragging myself along for other people. Iâ€™m tired and sick of life.
