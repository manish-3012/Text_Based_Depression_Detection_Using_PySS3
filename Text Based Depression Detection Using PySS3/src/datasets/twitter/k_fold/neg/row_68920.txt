My wife and I have lost our jobs, our home and now our pets to depression. The latter feels the worst. I'm not sure where to turn from here.I'm not sure why I'm doing this or what it can help achieve, but I feel the need to put this out in the open. Depression has taken almost everything from us, and I see no end to this cycle of loss, guilt and pain.

&amp;nspb;

To start nearer the beginning, my wife and I relocated across the country about 6 years ago for work. We stayed there and were fairly happy but have never had friends and miss our family hugely. My wife especially because they have always been her support network, outside of me. Both suffer from horrendous depression, and are seeking referrals to see if we are bipolar, which fits but I'm unsure.

&amp;nspb;

Anyway, a few years back my wife's depression gets bad enough that she can not work. She goes on sick leave and I try my best to act as a carer for her when I'm not at work. I manage this for 8-10 months before I have a breakdown (retail management+Christmas+carer=bad) and we both end up off work. During this time, family help us with rent and bills, but her parents are retired and mine are not in good financial shape. Lots of guilt and feeling like a permanent burden.

&amp;nspb; 

Skipping a few years, we both end up flitting in and out of work as our symptoms are never really address. We survive on monthly help from my wife's parents and several large loans and overdrafts we have taken out to get by. I develop a fast food addiction and spend a fortune on takeouts as I feel too Ill to cook or clean and my wife spends most her time in bed.

&amp;nspb;

Last year, things turn a corner. We're both working, money is coming in and we're on medication that seems to be working. My contract is temporary but I'm making myself invaluable and they extend it monthly. Wife gets sick, I get sick from trying to hold down job whilst caring for her and the cycle repeats. My contract is cancelled, wife's is about to be and is now on and statutory sick pay (Â£90ish a week). Parents money has run out, to the point where they chip us a bit of money here and there for food but that's it- we've fucked up their lives too. We can't pay the rent, bills, loan repayments or anything of the sort. Literally the only thing keeping us alive is our 4 cats who have becom surrogate children for me. Cleaning after them, feeding them and caring for them has given me a reason to get out of bed.

&amp;nspb;

The only sensible option for us it to move in with her parents, try and get jobs there and start a fresh for ourselves. They can't afford it, but their house is big enough for us to have a bedroom and storage for our furniture and things. The downside, over than the extra strain we'll be putting on them, is that they are both hugely allergic to cats. They also have two very large dogs who will not make their home welcoming, so to speak.

&amp;nspb;

The saving grace for this is that my brother in law has said he would take one of our boys for us. Pippin is very special to us, and whilst we don't have a favourite cat, he totally is. We got his as a very ill kitten and nursed him back to health. He has a heart murmur, a lung condition and some weird obsession with burning hismelf on the butt that we cannot explain or understand. Despite this, he is the happiest, most loving cat I've ever met. He greets you like a dog, and is always happy to see people. He is very special to us. Of the others, two will be easily rehomable (a gorgeous Maine Coon cross and a 1 year old kitten) and one very old boy who we suspect may have cancer. This doesn't make it any easier, but the idea that one of our cats will be at least there for us to visit makes it workable.

&amp;nspb;

Today they ring to tell us they can't take him any more. We have no other option than to give away all of my reasons to live. We've drained her family of everything, are systematically inserting ourselves on their lives, have no job, a sickness record that won't allow me get another one, no money to pay the bills and am facing bailiffs collection what I haven't managed to sell of my possessions. Now my wife won't talk to me because she is worried that hearing about the cat would push me over the edge. I had to hear it from her mother. I'm not sure if it hasn't been the last straw.
