I just feel like me staying alive is selfishI'm fucked up I was born fucked up I am a fuck up. I get anxious and overreact to anything I fly of the handle at my parents for no reason we argue nightly they probably hate me. I think my mum might just up and leave she hates spending time with me and being near her I don't even blame her I would want me out of my life if I was her too. My dad tries to be nice but he gets mad all the time because he has so much anger towards me and again it's my fault I started it I caused it. I'm upsetting my brother by having all these arguments all I am to him is a loud annoyance. fuck it I'm even upsetting my dog with all the shouting. My friends are great but I know deep down I'm an annoying piece of shit and they would be a lot fucking happier if I wasn't there. And as for the rest of my family all they hear about is the fucked up one with the mental issues they wouldn't care. I don't see how I am benefiting anyone by being alive my death would cause less damage than me being alive does. I should just do it why do I have to so selfish in keeping myself alive Im not enjoying living so seriously what's the point.
