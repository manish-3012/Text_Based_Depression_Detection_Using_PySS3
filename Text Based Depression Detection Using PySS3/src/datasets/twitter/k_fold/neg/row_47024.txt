Nobody ever took an interest in me. I'm ugly.I've been left alone my entire life. I've developed bad habits that led me to drop out of high school and led me to be socially isolated and led me to be irreversably damaged.

The other day I had a picture taken of me for a membership card. That is when I realized I'm hideous. I'm 21 and I'm obese and I'm nearly bald. People make fun of me in social settings because I'm damaged inside and out.

I'm a straight, white, christian-believing male. I sometimes hear that is something to be desired. But nobody cares about me. I'm miserable every day. I am damaged by prolonged isolation, bulimia, and a flawed personality. I'm an easy target. I hate my life.
