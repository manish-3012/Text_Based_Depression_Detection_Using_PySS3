Its 1 am..For the past while I've been trying to find the strength to hold on while also trying to find the strength to just get it over with and end it all... I know deep down.. I can feel it deep in the pits of my stomach that my life is going nowhere... i am still holding on to hope.. like there might be a slight chance that I'll be able to escape all this shit... maybe I'll have a family and grow old.. but I'm also afraid that if I ever have children I'll just fuck them up... idk.. I feel worthless.. I feel like life no meaning.. just pain.. idk where I'm going with this tbh... but if you're here.. thanks for giving a second of your time to reading this.. i really mean it.. thanks a lot.
