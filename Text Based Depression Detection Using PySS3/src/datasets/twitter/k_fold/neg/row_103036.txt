I really feel like I'm going nowhere.I'm not going to get into details but I always thought I was depressed. I'm going no where and doing nothing to fix it because I have no energy or motivation to do so. I just feel stuck, you know?

This past week I've been saying "You know, I really wouldn't mind if I died right now" or "If I had a gun right now, I'd probably shoot". I've been thinking things like that. 

It's scaring me that I don't care. Which means I must care, right? I don't know. I'm really confused and I don't know what to do about these thoughts. I'm afraid I might act on them if they stay in my head for too long.

I don't even know what I'm looking for out of this post. But I'm posting it. It's a step, right? 

I guess I just need to know I'm not alone. I've been pushing away everyone for the past year and I feel like I have no one left.
