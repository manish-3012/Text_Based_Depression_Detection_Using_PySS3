My only real friend commited suicide 2 week ago... Really thinking about doing the same thingI'm depressive since around 2 and a half year, suicidal for pretty much that long too. As I said she decided to take her life 2 week ago. I can't really blame her, her dad was abusive she got raped by him a couple of time. Her mom left her when she was young and she didn't have that much friend. So when I watch myself, good parents and a big supportive family, I found myself even more pathetic. She was my only really friend, of course I have other friend but they come and go. I knew her for arround 15 years now. I did everything with her, I knew all of her and she knew everything about me. I really don't know what I'm gonna do. The idea of going with her seems more and more like a good one. I don't know what to do anymore, even my psychologist don't know what to do with me anymore.
