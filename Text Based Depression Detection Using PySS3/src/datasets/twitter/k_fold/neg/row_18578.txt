Dad hits me almost every day + donâ€™t want to go a shelter suicide is the only optionMy counselor kept dissuading me from going to a shelter, saying itâ€™ll make my mental health worse. Tbh, I donâ€™t want to share a space with strangers too. My dad yells and hits me every day. If I try to retaliate, he hits me more. Heâ€™s tried to kill me with a knife before. He cusses at me on a daily basis. I beg my mom to take me to the ocean so I can commit suicide. But, sheâ€™s on his side. Also, my brother fucking pissed me off. Iâ€™m tired of this fucked up life and fucked up family.
