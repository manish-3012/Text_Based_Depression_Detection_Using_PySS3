Lost and the DoomedHey, not sure if anybody can help but I just need to vent / talk.
Basically it boils down to this I want to die, and have done so for the past 3/4 of my pile of crap life. Not sure if posting the full extent of how battles with anorexia, disability, rape, attempted suicides and finally having been made homeless, then having my identity stolen and some a hole run up about 6k worth of debt in my name . 
Suicide and death just feel so perfect so much more than this. Besides if the daily mail and certain Cornish councilers are to believed my life is worthless anyway

I miss my mum, I want to cry to rage out but that's just not me , 
Anyway thanks for reading

I want to add something here, I've prayed for death allot since I was 13 onwards, I've been through every Health centre imaginable if sombody would just write to me daily even if its hi it would help

Please help me
