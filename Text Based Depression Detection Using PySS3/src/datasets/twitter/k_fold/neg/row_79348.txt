advice pleaseI am in a psych ward due to a suicide attempt
So essentially a police officer detained me and brought me to the hospital.
In the hospital I was assessed

I have been trying to be vague about why I was trying to kill myself and was try to dodge the questions a bit at first
they told me to be honest 
They thought that I was being dishonest
they told me the best way to get out is to tell them  what happened 
As I never had anyone to talk to I only talked to Samaritans once about why I wanted to kill myself
I gave them every detail about my problem, and told them who was involved
I told them I was a bit suicidal at that time

And what happened?

Without any mental illness, I ended up on suicide watch in a psych ward

Every detail I told them was on the psychiatric record
that every doctor and nurse has assess to



I am so ashamed 

It is so personal

I am also worried about being on suicide watch on hospital would ruin my career opportunities and cause troubles in my life in the future
every conversation was recorded
I don't trust the ppl here I need somone to talk to but don't expect me to open up anymore
I'm tired 
I need to get out and kill myself asap


I realised I am just a living sample to be observed
They just want to know: am i going to kill myself after Im discharged or not. 

The problem that made me felt suicidal is so personal and I never told anyone over that problem happened since last few months

And it is so unfair to those involved in the problem even they won't know

Just now someone tried to kill herself, she is on the opposite bed 

she said she doesnt want to be here

But apparently it is just gonna make things worse

You just need to fake it if you want to get out

advice please

I need some advice

I have been suicidal for quite a while already
I thought I got someone to talk to and getting things off my chest at first and was trying to plan what to do to get back on my feet after I get out

But no 
This is too much
