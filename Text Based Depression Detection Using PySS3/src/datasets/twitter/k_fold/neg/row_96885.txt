I'm the worst person I know.I feel so fucking guilty for existing. I need to kill myself before I hurt more people.

I've been planning a suicide for tonight for the past few months, but I can't do that to my family. Not during the holiday season. So I have to wait another week or so before I can go through with my plan. I made plans for the week so I can see my loved ones one last time. But what if I hurt more people during the next few weeks while I'm waiting for the holiday spirit to die down? Maybe I should do it tonight.
