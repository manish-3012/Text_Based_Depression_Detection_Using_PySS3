i'll keep this short,i have ups and downs, ive had them for a long time and i dont know why, since december i've been going to therapy, ive been getting meds too and at first they helped surpress the shitstorm of thoughts that wont let me sleep eat and think, i keep finding myself trying to sleep . in my head i repeat "i want to go home, i want to go home"  i think it means im lonely, but i have no reason to feel so, i keep avoiding friends and family, i dont know where im going. i dont think i'll kill myself, i think im too much of a coward. i just want it too stop hurting.
