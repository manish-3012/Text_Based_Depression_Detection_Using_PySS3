Finding comfort in fantasies of suicideI have lost the major relationships in my life, both romantic and platonic, through a series of unfortunate confluences of mood disorders, bad timing, and bad actions on both my part and theirs. My career as an acrobat and dancer is over due to my fucked up body, taking with it my purpose in life, my drive, and my creative outlet. I'm 27, and I've lived with depression and anxiety my whole life. I fought so hard for the relationships and career that I built; I poured my heart and my soul and years of my life into these endeavors, only to have them pour away into nothing. 

I am tired, and I cannot face building this all back again, not against the current of my own neurochemistry. I am in therapy and on medication, as I have been for most of my life, but I am so tired of battling with my own brain.

The only thing that calms me down enough to let me sleep are fantasies of how I would/will kill myself- drive to my favorite mountain in Vermont, take blood thinners, climb to the peak, and slit my wrists under the stars is the most soothing. The only thing that's stopping me doing it is the impact that I know it will have on people around me- having watched the community deal with suicides in the past, I know that it can damage even people not close to the victim themselves. I do not want to simply hand off pain and trauma to others.

But I seriously suspect that that will only hold me back for so long.
