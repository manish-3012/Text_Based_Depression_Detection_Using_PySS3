Brother suicidal. How can I help?Please help.  Yesterday my brother's girlfriend reached out to me saying that he broke up with her and had her move out of his condo and that he needed some support.  So I call him and he ends up telling me that he attempt suicide (pills) as soon as she left.  No one else knows, just me and his ex-GF.  He is in a really bad place right now, overworked and living alone in a dark condo in a city where he doesn't have friends.  He is 27.  Ou family is dysfunctional, I am the only person that he is attached to.  After hours on the phone I urged him to take a break from work and come stay with me for a week or two (we live apart in different states).  He liked the idea at first but is now backing out.  He said he talked with his boss but I think he lied.  Am I pressuring him too much?  I could fly out to stay with him but I feel like he could use a change in environment.  He has also interrupted therapy, thinks his therapist is at fault.  What can I do to help him snap out without him invading his space too much?
