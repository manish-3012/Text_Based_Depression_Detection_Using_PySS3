Taking steps i guessSo today i went to the garage to see if there's any rope. And oh, oh my, there she is yo beauty. Thank you internet, for teaching me how to do a Hangman's Noose properly. Now i really need some good advice whether to go with this choice or some more, human way, so to say (read: painless). Oh, it's against the guidelines so i don't know if this post is gonna be removed? Anyways i was then hoping for a PM, i guess.
