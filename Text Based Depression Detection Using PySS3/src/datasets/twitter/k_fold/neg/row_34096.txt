Going awayEver since my parents moved to Orange County 12 years ago, I've never felt like I fit in. I really came to realize how fucking inadequate I am. My hair isn't straight, and my teeth are crooked. I listen to music that no one else likes. I come from a poor family. I've never been able to live the life that everyone around me has. I likely never will, no matter what I do. But that's all right. 

I just got diagnosed with Asperger's this year at age 23. I've lost friends because of it. I've lost jobs because of it. I lost a loving girlfriend partly because of it. This affliction is making my life miserable. I'm 23 and I still haven't finished school because I was stupid enough to work full-time jobs while struggling in fucking community college. Therapy and meds haven't helped.

I'm going to go where no one will ever find me. I don't need to keep this up; I've already lost the best years of my life, and the future doesn't look much better. I don't want to have work hard to fight for the chance to be mediocre. I have a shotgun and a full bottle of vodka.

Side notes:  
Fuck you, Adel. You are a fucking dickhead. Fuck you and fuck your store. The least you could have done was giving me a chance to explain myself, you asshole. It's been a year and I still haven't gotten over what you said to me. It's no wonder your people don't have their own state. You deserve everything Israel is doing to your family, you fucking shithead. Go to Hell.

Lisa, thank you for everything. You were the best girlfriend any guy could ask for. You were there for me when I wanted to kill myself. It's a shame I didn't want to keep things going, because I regret everything I did and said to you. I wish I had never taken you for granted and that I had treated you better. I could have been your husband. I hope you and your family do well. If you read this, this wasn't your fault. I loved you, but I was afraid of love.
