12 and don't want to live life anymore...I don't know why I want to die... I just hate my life. I have a very loving father, great friends, and a good life. But I'm autistic, and my mom has no clue on how to deal with my autism. I hate being socially awkward, I hate falling in love, I just hate life. I don't really want to die... I more just want to prove a point to my family and to my mom I guess.
