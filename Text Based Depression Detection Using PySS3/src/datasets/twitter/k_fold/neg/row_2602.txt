I relate to ur feelings, have a playlist or 2Some of you may have seen my past posts offering to build you a playlist (the offer is still open! Visit my profile and find the original post to request one). Anyhow, I thought some people might like to have a couple mood playlists Iâ€™ve curated, just to be reminded that youâ€™re not alone when you feel shitty!! I have personally been in a place where I was trying to end my life and I am still struggling with the suicidal urges every day. I think in the worst of my suicidal times I would have liked a playlist to cry to that showed me somebody else understood how I felt. So, Here they are.
