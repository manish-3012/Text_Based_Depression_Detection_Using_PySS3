Don't know how to stay honest with people who want to help.I do not know to start this. I'm a 28 year old male who has been depressed since I was a teenager. The past couple months I've been considering suicide as an option, I'm just  don't feel strong enough to be able to change my life. I'm jobless and skilless and haven't had a job for over 8 years. I have pretty bad anxiety with people and driving, so I don't interact with people if I don't have to and too afraid to drive.

I know there are people who love me in my life but I feel like I am unable to love someone when I cannot even love myself. The only thing stopping me from killing myself is the chance of failure at suicide. If I was given a sure method I would most likely do it. I've never self-harmed, done drugs and almost never drank alcohol because I don't want even more pain and problems in my life.

In October I was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts for 3 days I lied about my feelings just so I could leave but I still have suicidal thoughts. The beginning of December I was hospitalized again when I broke down in my therapists office and she suggested I should be hospitalized again and was in there for 9 days, the same thing happened I just lied about my feelings again because I just didn't want to be there anymore. While I was in the hospital they suggested I try ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) for depression, which seems like a big step from trying a few medicines to that. Right now I'm on prozac and abilify, I've only tried a few other medicines besides prozac.

I don't know what to do to keep myself honest with others who are trying to help me, I know it just hurts me in the long run but I ran out of fucks to give.
