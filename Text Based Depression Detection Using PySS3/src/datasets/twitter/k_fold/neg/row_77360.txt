What's the point?No matter what we do we die. It's not something that can be avoided. I don't believe in an afterlife, so when we die we cease to be. So someday I will just be gone, no more me, my thoughts, my secrets, everything will just be gone, never to exist again. What kind of cruel universe cursed me with sentience? I should stay here as long as I can for my son, but what does it matter, as soon as I'm gone, I can't watch him anymore, I can't look after him, it's all just gone. Why not leave now, eventually he'll be dead too, and then I really will be gone, as memories of me are destroyed. I might live on a while in historical records, but eventually those will be gone. So what if I give him happiness now, if when he dies he will cease to be, everything that he kept to him is gone, all his thoughts of me that aren't written down are gone. If I die later I'm gone, if I die now I'm gone, in the long run what difference does it make? I won't know the difference in a hundred years, either way everything that I am will cease to be, so why not just get it over with?
