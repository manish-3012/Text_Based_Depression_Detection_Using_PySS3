I am just tiredAlways there was something missing. All the time, I was pushing. Pushing for something I don't know. After reaching every target, I found a reason not to be happy. A big void. I'm filling my voids with new targets. After every target I'm being more desperate. My friends, my family are thinking I have a good life, I'm lucky etc. May be they are right, I don't know. I have no visible problem. I'm graduated from a good university, have a well paid job, pursuing master's degree at the same time. But I am not happy. I have never been happy. Also I think life and death are meaningless equally. Why not just end it now? That won't make any difference. I can't stop voices, thoughts in my brain. I'm always thinking, I can't sleep until I can't stay awake. My brain is like pectoralis major after bench press.
