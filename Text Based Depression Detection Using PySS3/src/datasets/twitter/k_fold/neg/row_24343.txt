I want to commit suicide tomorrowI always promised myself I'd post here if it got that bad and now it has. I have been depressed for a while now but up until this point I've managed. My now ex girlfriend has recently dumped me and stated that if I ever try to contact her again that she will call the police. I am absolutely shattered. She was my longest relationship and I thought it would go on forever. I'm going back to college in a little over a week and she is going to the same one. I don't think I will be able to handle it. I am so scared of going through a school year where an ex makes me miserable again. I have nothing going for me, my job is awful, I feel no motivation for college, and now there's even more of a reason to finish the job. I've purchased something to cutoff my breathing and can get my hands on a gun. I seriously feel like it would be such a relief to not feel anything and to just finish myself off tomorrow night. I would easily be able to do this but I am scared of hurting my close family and I am very anxious about going through with this. I want to kill myself tomorrow but I'm a little scared. I just wish things could've been better, I wish I could've been a more likable person.
