Seems oddI struggle with being around people my age. Iâ€™m almost 16 and unless itâ€™s me talking to one person I canâ€™t talk. Sometimes itâ€™s not even anxiety. Itâ€™s like something takes over my head and for the life of me I canâ€™t get over it. Itâ€™s like U donâ€™t want to be around anyone or even speak. I was bullied for a long time so I feel like shit. I have a lot of self hate that isnâ€™t gonna leave any time soon. I have trust issues but damn I donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m like this. Itâ€™s like my emotions control me. Anyone dealing with anything similar?
