I'm done living.I feel like the world is against me. I was so afraid of asking for help, when I finally built up the courage to, it did work, started helping, started talking to someone, and as soon as I really start talking about my problems, and what's happening in my life, what I really feel, then everything goes to shit, then my concelor told my parents about that crap, they wanted me to limit use of "free will" They wanted me  to keep my door open, that didn't happen, that calmed down a bit, now I'm barely allowed in my own room, I'm barely allowed to do anything anymore, now I'm sitting here having a panic attack, my "brilliant" BITCH mom thinks my room makes me depressed, IT DOESN'T it doesn't matter where I am, in fact, today, I was doing great, was suicidal and depressed in the morning, then I watched some videos, calmed down, went outside of my room, sat down, played a game, I was happy for once, I was actually happy, then she had to come home, start screaming at me and my sister, for no reason, I started feeling depressed a bit, I went into my room, both even a minute later, she yelled at me to get out "your room makes you depressed" No it doesn't, you do, my sister does, things I think about, I think about things that happen to me, that's what makes me depressed, she doesn't care, she refuses to listen, I just want to be left alone, she's not that bad a parent, she's never physically abused me, or purposely abused me mentally, ik she's trying to help, but it's not, she's one of the most difficult people on this planet, I should just die, I don't deserve to be happy, I just want everything to stop. ... I'm sorry... I don't even think anyone cares, I probably just sound like a brat, I should never have been born...
