Would it be wrong for me to commit suicide?I am a 30-year-old sex worker. I find no joy in my work, but I can't quit because then I will no longer have money for anti-aging treatments, and I fear nobody will ever love me if I am not attractive. I am being trafficked into sex work by my body dysmorphia. Furthermore, I suffer from severe insomnia, which makes getting a normal job nearly impossible. 

Nobody likes me. My world is black, the light in my eyes is gone. People find me too negative and cynical to be around, but I don't know how to stifle my anguish. The only person who wants to spend time with me is my best friend, but his company just triggers my grief. He and I met twelve years ago when our lives were very similar. Now he has an awesome career, a beautiful house, a loving husband, and adopted children. His life brings into focus everything my life lacks.

When I was seven, my parents got divorced and my only sibling killed himself. Ever since my family of origin dissolved, I longed to grow up and have a family of my own. I'm realizing this will never happen. As a 30-year-old unemployable hooker, no decent man will ever want me.

Would it be wrong for me to commit suicide? I'm not asking if you think suicide is my best option but rather if you think it would make me a shitty human being. Killing myself will leave my parents childless. I have held on for their sake for two years now. I have been in therapy for over two decades. Nothing is getting any better. There is no light at the end of my tunnel. Only escape.
