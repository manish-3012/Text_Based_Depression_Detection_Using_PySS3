EVERYONE NEEDS TO STOP HATING ME AND RUINING MY LIFEIâ€™m tired of everyone hating me and ruining my life. Thatâ€™s all everyone has done my entire life. No one cares about me, only themselves and their friends. Not even my parents or other family members. No one at any school or club Iâ€™ve been to. No one will even care when Iâ€™m dead. If people say they will, they are liars because they shouldâ€™ve cared sooner.
