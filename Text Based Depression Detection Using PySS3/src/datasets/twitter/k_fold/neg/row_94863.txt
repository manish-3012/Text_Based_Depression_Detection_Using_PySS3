I told my husband I felt suicidal. He said "Give me a break. Just go to bed."So I took 10mg Xanax, 10mg Valium, 35mg Flexeril, and 25mg amitriptyline. I'm going to bed, all right.

Also cut my leg open, but what else is new.

If I didn't have kids, I would have taken everything in the medicine cabinet.

I called my psychiatrist after hours nurse, and she said if I have a suicide plan, call 911. Otherwise call Monday.
