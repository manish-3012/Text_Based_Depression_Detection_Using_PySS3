Is this abuse?Iâ€™m 15 years old my mother died when I was 9 since then I have been with my dad he tries his best and he has been drinking on and off ever since he is always putting me down and making me feel like shit he has hit me before and is usually aggressive when drunk However I never go without food and he leaves sometimes for a day or two Iâ€™m depressed almost all the time however I love my dad and I would never want to leave him he is so nice when sober which is most of the time.
