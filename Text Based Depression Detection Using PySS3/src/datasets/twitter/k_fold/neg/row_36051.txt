extremely worried about my online friend.let me start off by saying i apologize if this is the incorrect subreddit for this, im not the biggest reddit person. also if she ever finds this, just know i love you so fucking much and i just wanted to help you cuz you know im not thr best with wording stuff so i need some additional support and i dont know what to say half the time. i love you so so much dude. stay strong.

so im very worried about my friend. i met her on discord so we arent irl friends. she lives a few states over from me. shes been going through A LOT right now. i dont want to reveal any sensitive info or personal info with her cuz i respect her privacy. but i feel like i have to explain some stuff to give context. shes been dealing with very tough shit at her home, her boyfriend and my best friend has passed away. its been very hard in out little friend group. im very concerned about her and only want her to be alright. i messaged her a few times but she hasent responded. and i dont want to sound annoying to her or constantly messaging her about this. shes one of my best friends fucking ever. shes the nicest person ive met. i just want her to be ok. any thing i can do to help her? or any advice?  i know i should call someone but im so fucking shy and i dont like making big scenes about stuff. 

thanks for you time
