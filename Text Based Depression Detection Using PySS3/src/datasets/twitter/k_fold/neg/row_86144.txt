Mixed MessagesIâ€™ve been unemployed since March. Iâ€™ve been looking since then. Iâ€™ve had a couple of promising leads. Well theyâ€™re all gone as of this morning. Iâ€™m back to square one. No interviews lined up. No call backs expected. Iâ€™m floundering now in my parentsâ€™ house at the age of 30. They want me gone in a couple of months.

Iâ€™ve got them beat. I want me gone years ago. 

Everyone says I can find a job. Are you so sure? I mean really...are you sure? Hereâ€™s my shit. Take it. Take my dumpster fire personal, legal, and work histories. Theyâ€™re yours free of charge. Go enjoy all the employers falling over themselves to hire you. Donâ€™t come back to me if you get a job. Itâ€™s yours, you own it! You can live my life better than me. Grats! Similarly, donâ€™t come back if you canâ€™t get one. Just throw the life away. I donâ€™t want it either.

Regardless of how it turns out Iâ€™m done. Everything in my life is shit and it just keeps getting worse. People tell me itâ€™ll be fine. People say donâ€™t give up. Are you people deaf or just stupid? Iâ€™m trying the best I know how. My life experience gives me the opposite message: you will fail in time. Iâ€™m tired of hearing confusing, mixed messages. Iâ€™m tired of getting my hopes up. So as of today, Iâ€™M FUCKING DONE. People will explain that I felt trapped but explain how I actually wasnâ€™t. Those people are stupid. What was I supposed to do in this world? You say thereâ€™s a spot for me here. Iâ€™ve not seen it and Iâ€™m running out of places to look. Surely if it was a spot for me I could find it...

IDK. Iâ€™m just spiraling from this most recent rejection. Iâ€™m running out of time and Iâ€™m getting nowhere. Iâ€™m tired of trying to better my life and winding up face first on the ground. This isnâ€™t even a life I want! Iâ€™m divorced. 2 hours from my ex and our daughters. Iâ€™m having to re-live my abusive childhood with constant fights and shit. Iâ€™m done with it. Iâ€™m done trying to find something that can make living this clusterfuck of a life have some semblance of meaning or value.

Iâ€™ve already given myself until my birthday to sort it out. Just around 2 weeks from now. At least I can count on myself to keep my personal promise 100%.
