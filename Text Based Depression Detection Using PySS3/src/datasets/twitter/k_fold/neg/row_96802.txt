The endDear humans and bots of reddit. This will be the last thing i talk about today. I have a personality issue ive had therapy on for years. Im at a new breaking point. I dont want attention or comments i just want the last thing i say to be at someone other than myself. Cheers. Hopefully this helps those around me. Celebrate dont mourn.
