My one goal in life is to die from being strangled to death by the thighs of a stereotypical looking nerdy guy.I'm already depressed due to a physical illness and I wouldn't mind dying in this way tomorrow.

I read about a young man who died when 3 stereotypical nerds turned on him in his car and strangled him to death with their thighs. I think of that case and cry because that young man was so lucky to die that way and I don't have a nerd right next to me to dive my face into his thighs and beg for him to strangle me for 20 minutes until I slowly turn purple and die from asphyxia. I used to know a stereotypical nerd who looked like Kevin McHale from glee and every time I was near him the hairs on my vulnerable neck would stand up. He had horn rimmed glasses and buck teeth and everything. I have had this fetish for years and it is only increasing in intensity.
