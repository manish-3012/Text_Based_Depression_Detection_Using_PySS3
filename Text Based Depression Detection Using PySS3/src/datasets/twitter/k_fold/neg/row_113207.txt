i can't even do the thing i was good at anymore. its becoming too hard with the suicidal thoughts.even the things that i used to i can't. they;re sslipping. i'm so sad.

i wonder if this is what alzheimers is like. little things slipping away that you cant remember or quite do anymore.

i'm so tired. someone asked when this big project i'm supposed to do iss happening so they can come, and i had to tell them it won't. because it's too hard now.

i'm so tired. i feel like when i go on vacation in a week i might not ever come back. just one good shot and i'm gone , i hope. maybe then. when not many people willl be as hurt. i'm so tired. i don't even know if i can.
