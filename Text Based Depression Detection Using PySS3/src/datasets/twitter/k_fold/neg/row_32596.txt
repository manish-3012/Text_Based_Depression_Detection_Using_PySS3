Hospital FoodIâ€™ve tried sleeping most of the day. I feel sick constantly, almost dinner time here and Iâ€™m thinking back to the many of other times I had to suffer through a disgusting dinner. Itâ€™s funny I have barely responded to friends and family but I sit here on my thread when I feel strongest and try to write to you guys. I feel like you guys care to know more than the people in my life right now. I feel pricked and poked out. I just want to go home to my bed, to my dog. This feels so empty here, I keep replaying last night over and over again, what could I have changed and done different? What would have made this time the time I go? But no I sit here in a bundle of room temperature, cooled out hospital blankets and the pillows you would expected to have after sleeping on them for 5 years straight, and a mattress no one would care to sleep on. Three different cops Iâ€™ve counted so far today, I donâ€™t talk to them, they try to talk to me ask me different things if I need anything. I always ask the nurse. I was ready to die and a cop now wants to know if I want fucking water, I want my body to be burning to ash currently but we compromise in life all the time. Maybe next time he asks Iâ€™ll say yes.
