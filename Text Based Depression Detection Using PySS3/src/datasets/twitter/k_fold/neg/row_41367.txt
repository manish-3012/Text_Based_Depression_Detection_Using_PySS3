I can't put up with life anymore. I'm really afraid.I'm a fucking loser.  No friends, no family, no one to talk to.  I've worked retail my entire 20s.  I've done nothing with my life because I'm not smart, I'm not capable.  I don't do anything about my situation because I'm petrified of life.  I'm so scared I'm crying.  Anything can fall apart at any moment.  I got a negative review at my job, I could get transferred to pushing carts which would be humiliating for me.  My car could break down.  I haven't been to the dentist in years and I could need expensive surgery or teeth pulled.  I don't want to deal with it anymore.  I get nothing good out of life it's all work and I'm miserable.  The worst part is I can't even sleep.  I haven't slept in 36 hours.  This is fucking torture.  I hate life and I hate being in it.

It's time I finally did something about it.
