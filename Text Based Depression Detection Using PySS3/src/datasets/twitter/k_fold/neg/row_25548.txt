Why would I want to harm myself?I discovered quite recently that I am suffering from CEN (childhood emotional neglect) and that has affected my entire life. I don't have strong relationships, I'm always on the edge, I always feel that if someone is nice to me, they want something from me. I am living with my parents right now because of the lockdown and it makes me angry to see them everyday. I'm mostly lashing out at my dad and avoiding my mom because I feel like they're the reason I get anxious, insecure and depressed so often. I feel like my therapist only wants money from me. I don't feel like anyone is really there to support me even though they are. I just don't feel it. In fact I don't feel anything. 

I sometimes do things that are detrimental to my own well-being. Started from things like starving myself and now thoughts of self-harm as well. I don't know why they're there. I don't know what I like about them. I don't know where they're headed. I don't know, because I have never been this person before. I am very ashamed of myself right now.

Is there a logic to this? 

How do I get myself to see self-harm as harmful and stop gravitating towards it?
