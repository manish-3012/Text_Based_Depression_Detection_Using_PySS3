Chosen the way I want to goI've chosen how I'm going to do it &amp; now I'm just waiting for the time.

I've felt so alone for a long time now and I'm stuck in a place where I'm constantly shouted at &amp; made feel unwanted.

It's been an isolating time for many people and for me it's just gotten too much. I feel like I'm constantly screaming into the void.

There isn't really help. They just lock you in hospital for a few weeks until they can guarantee you're not gonna hurt yourself. Then they'll throw you back in the very same situation that pushed you to breaking point in the first place.

I don't drink but I'm probably going to get some alcohol to numb myself a bit as I'm thinking over things &amp; making my way to the place where I'm thinking of ending things. 

I don't know what else I can do. I've tried so hard to keep going, to keep getting up &amp; getting dressed, feed myself, stay alive. But I really don't see much point anymore. I just want to check out early because I can't face the future where I have all the problems and stresses that I do.

It won't be tonight but it might be tomorrow night. I'm holding out for a phone call with the hope talking might change things but I'm not overly optimistic. I'll probably give the person the same bullshit and act like things aren't as bad as they are, just so I can avoid any drama of people trying to get me better. I guess the phone call is just an opportunity to actually talk to someone cos I just can't carry all this alone anymore.
