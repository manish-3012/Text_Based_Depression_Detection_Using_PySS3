I can't keep runningI feel like my depression is chasing me, and no matter how hard I try to outrun it, by driving, by drinking, by getting high, I can't do it. It always catches up to me, and beats me into the fucking ground, until I'm lying on my floor, feeling as if I'm paralyzed, wondering my limbs dont move. Until I'm sitting in the shower for hours on end, until my vision goes spotty. They say to take it one day at a time, but I can't muster the energy to brush my teeth. I lie in bed and will myself to get up, drifting in and out of a hellish, nightmare filled sleep, until I look at the clock and its 7 PM and I've gotten nothing done. With corona, I no longer have any obligations. I feel myself getting angrier and angrier, distancing those around me, and never reaching out to them, to tell them what's going on, because I dont want it to be brushed aside. I need more than anything, to fucking die already, overdose on my antidepressants that I've been stockpiling, waiting until someone or something pushes me over the edge,  and it's too late for regret.
