Wouldn't it be poetic if I let a train run me over?My blood and guts strewn all over the tracks. It's fucking *metal*, man.

My severed head just laying there on the tracks, the brain inside no longer having to deal with the realities of life, no longer having to cope with the failure of a human being I am.

My bloodied corpse in a heap. It's pathetic, just as my living self was.

Normal people are grossed out by blood and gore, so nobody would speak of it, for my ultimate fate would have been too horrible for others to visualize properly..

Death isn't the end. It's a bridge to something bigger and better. You are only fooling yourself if you think that life is all there is to your self. Why limit myself to the misery and perpetual disappointment of life? Why should I let people constantly tell me that I can't do this, that or the other, when I can be in a place where I can experience not only what I seek on Earth, but adventure into the unknown, tread lands beyond my wildest dreams and fantasies?
