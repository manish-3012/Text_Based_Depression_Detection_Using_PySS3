I am so over thisI am done.I just want out.If this is what 13 years of living are like what will be the next 40,50?
This is damned hell.People don't care even if they act as if they do.Just walking around with feeling bad,without a reason.
How stupid can I be? I have it all..A perfect family,a good education,some talent for the things I love..
But I still feel likw shit.I still hurt evryone around me.I still drink...

Everyone,including me,would be better off If I just went to jump under the soonest train...
