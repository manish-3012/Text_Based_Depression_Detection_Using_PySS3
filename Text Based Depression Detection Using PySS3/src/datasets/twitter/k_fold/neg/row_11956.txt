Please help me.. somebodyI genuinely donâ€™t know what to do.. Iâ€™ve had bad depression for years and because of it my health has suffered including my dental health. Doesnâ€™t help when I have a legit fear of the dentist because of shit thatâ€™s happened and I have panic attacks at the thought of going or actually going.. over the years my teeth have gotten worse but I have put off going in because of my bad fear. I now no longer have insurance and cannot go in even if I wanted because I donâ€™t have thousands of dollars.. and now most of my teeth including one of my main front ones had a big cavity in it. Getting more and more visable and will eventually break I already have a tooth thatâ€™s broken and nasty as hell. They hurt almost constantly and make it hard to eat and Iâ€™m already underweight.. I am literally sitting here debating suicide because of my teeth.. Iâ€™ve already had people leave me because of stupid shit who will love someone with fucked up and missing teeth.. teeth pain is one of the worst pains I could just kill myself and not have that pain...  please guys I donâ€™t know what to do... Iâ€™ve even been trying to brush and use mouthwash but not only is it too late for that but Iâ€™m still really depressed and itâ€™s so hard for me to do things consistently...if I wonâ€™t the lottery I would by teeth implants... I wouldnâ€™t be sitting on my cot at 5 am balling my eyes out wanting to die over my teeth..
