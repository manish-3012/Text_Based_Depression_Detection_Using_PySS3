My mum doesnâ€™t care about my mental health.Iâ€™ve told her multiple times before that Iâ€™m not happy and she just doesnâ€™t care anymore, Iâ€™m on the brink of ending it all. If it werenâ€™t for my friends I wouldnâ€™t be here anymore but Iâ€™m so fucking sad and I canâ€™t think of anything but death

I lost one of my best friends to suicide 3 months ago and not a single day has gone past that I havenâ€™t thought of death.  My friend Jack is one of the only things thatâ€™s keeping me going. I donâ€™t expect any of you to care but this world isnâ€™t worth living in anymore
