I'm just tiredI'm tired of life.  I'm 22 years old and I feel like I've experienced all the good I can experience in life. 

I'm not a good boyfriend, I guess relationships like that just aren't for me.  I'm just so much of a loner.  

To that all off, I have a small dick to boot so sex is nothing great.

I want to be able to enjoy people's company but I can't.  I can't drink alcohol because my heart starts racing, my face turns red as fuck, my eyes feel like they're going to pop out of my head.  New years eve was pretty sad for me.  I just sat at home, what kind of 22 year old goes to a party and doesn't drink?  I didn't get invited to anything anyways.  

Life gets hard and people turn to substances to ease it.  Weed or alcohol for the most part and yet I can't do that.  I have to be sober my entire life.  I have to take life without any help.  

It's cold as fuck.  My job is outside, I hate the cold.  It was around 0 Fahrenheit the other day here.  I was miserable as fuck.  Being that winter just started I'm in for a lot more of those shitty days. 

I'm tired of life.  I'm lonely.  I'm not good at maintaining relationships.  There are a lot of good looking girls out there that I can never have a chance to talk to.  I'm tired
