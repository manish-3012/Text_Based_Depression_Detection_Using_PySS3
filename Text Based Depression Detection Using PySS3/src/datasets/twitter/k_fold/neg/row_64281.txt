Nothing gets betterI've been in and out of mental hospitals all this year.  I am struggling with Schizophrenia and it is really hard.  I have voices tell me to kill myself because I am full of delusions and madness.  Work is unbearable and beyond difficult I am too fucked up to interact with customers anymore.  Nothing feels good anymore.  I used to like anime and videogames but there is no goodfeels.

I'm falling apart entirely.  Thinking about taking all my anti psychotics with some nice alcohol.
