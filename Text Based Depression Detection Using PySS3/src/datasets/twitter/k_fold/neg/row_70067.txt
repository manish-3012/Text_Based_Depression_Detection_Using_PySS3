Iâ€™m going to probably kill myself by the end of this week.Hello. Iâ€™ve been on a downhill spiral since March. It hasnâ€™t seemed to end and itâ€™s just getting worse. I thought my life was getting better around 2018. But the pandemic changed everything. I lost everything overnight. 

I didnâ€™t get a college graduation (as a first gen American and abuse survivor this was devastating). I lost my job, my friends, the life I made for myself these past two years away from my hometown. 

This loss as minuscule as it sounds triggered a lot of my childhood trauma. And Iâ€™m remembering a lot of things and feeling a lot of pain I didnâ€™t feel before and I canâ€™t handle it. I got depressed but at least I still had my boyfriend who I love very much. 

But wait for it. I think I realized Iâ€™m a lesbian. And it physically hurts my soul to think that Iâ€™ll have to live the rest of my life without my boyfriend. Along with a lot of childhood trauma Iâ€™m currently processing, I started getting these random flashbacks to my childhood that made me realize oh shit Iâ€™m probably a major lesbian and never realized it eventhough Iâ€™ve never had romantic/sexual feelings for a woman irl. Like I am probably deeeeeply repressed and I didnâ€™t know. As it feels like my brain finally broke. I canâ€™t handle it. Itâ€™s not even the fact that Iâ€™m probably a lesbian that bothers me. I just canâ€™t handle it. I donâ€™t want to lose my boyfriend. I sound stupid I swear to god. But Iâ€™m not going into details. But my brain officially broke. 

My family canâ€™t take me anymore. I started therapy but I know my problem will never change. Everything of is out of my control. I canâ€™t control this. Iâ€™m losing my shit. I donâ€™t want to process trauma that my own parent inflicted onto me. Iâ€™m tired of fighting. Iâ€™m done. I have no more fight left to give. I fought so much to make something of myself and find happiness and the moment I dared to hope it was all taken away. And I realized my whole life...my whole sense of self was a lie. And that has fucked me up. I canâ€™t. 

I donâ€™t want to traumatize my sisters. I love them so much. I donâ€™t want to fuck up my boyfriend. He has a family member that committed suicide and he deals with depression. But I just canâ€™t. I canâ€™t live without him, I canâ€™t live with myself or my reality now. Who the hell am I? Like what? Itâ€™s just one thing after the next.

I spent two weeks isolating myself. And the suicidal feeling only increase with intensity. It gets more intense. I started testing it out with a charging cord choking myself little by little until I can literally see my own heartbeat. 

I know if I tell the therapist Iâ€™m suicidal Iâ€™ll get sent to a hospital and my life will be more ruined. 

My plan is to kill myself like this...choking myself not hanging myself in an hotel room. But Iâ€™m gonna say goodbye to everyone these next couple of days. I feel really bad for my therapist cause none of his clients have committed suicide. I might just be the first. 

I donâ€™t want my family to find my body. But I canâ€™t just wait to die or to get in an accident. I canâ€™t live anymore. Iâ€™m tired. Thereâ€™s no hope. Iâ€™m always right about assuming the worst case scenario. The one time I dated to hope and form my life it blew up in my face. I just canâ€™t do it anymore. Itâ€™s so painful. Iâ€™m done. Just done.
