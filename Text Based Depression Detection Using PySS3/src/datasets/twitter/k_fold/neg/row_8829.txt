I can't believe I haven't killed myself yet.I am about 15 years old I have had depression for about 5 months now I know I am depressed but am afraid to tell my psychologist about it or my father because they might freak out if I do One day my father came into my room to help clean it up and he noticed scratch marks on my arm he was freaking out and that's why I don't want to tell him or my psychologist so that's why I turned here.
