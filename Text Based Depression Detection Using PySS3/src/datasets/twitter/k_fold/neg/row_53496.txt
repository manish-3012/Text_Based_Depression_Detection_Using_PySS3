I don't think I'll ever fit in.Ive posted before but fuck me I'm done. I thought Uni would be a place where I could find perhaps like-minded people. That was a joke. I feel like I have to battle just to have an opinion. Just little shit like no one likes the games I like. (Context, I'm studying game design). Obviously I'm just fucking mental or they are, but it's probably me. I wish god would just take me. I don't belong here.
