I'm done.Hi, I'm only a sophomore in highschool barely even passing and I dont know if this is normal but I have had ongoing feelings if suicide for the last five years. Currently, everyday and night of life there's a 50/50 chance im feeling either happy or sad , im mostly sad. At school I am always called the weird one, I always ask myself why me why do I have to be this person that they call me? I'm bullied because of it and I am sick and tired of it. I have absolutely no friends and the only friends I had turned out to be your typical backstabbing snakes, causing the whole entire school to turn against me, including the only one who was there for me (my boyfriend) left me because he was simply too embarrased to love me anymore and was in love with my best (fake) friend. I tried talking to a guidance counselor but they only told me to suck it up and move on. I also tried talking to my parents about thinking I might have a problem but they were also like get a life. I even called the national suicide hotline because I was planning on committing suicide but I wanted to give life one last try. The lady said I was wasting her time and told me to hang up the phone. I can't take it anymore, I feel like i have let everyone down and I have no one else to talk to . I honestly feel like if I killed myself my parents wouldn't have to spend so much money on me and kids at my school can finally have one less person to stress about. I want to die but at the same time I dont. I want to give life just one last try before I make a huge decision.  I'm sorry for my grammar. I just really need help. I just want to know how to be happy again?
