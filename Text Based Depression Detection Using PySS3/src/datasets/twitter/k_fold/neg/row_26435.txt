is it normal to suddenly fall into suicidal thoughts?so basically ive had a kinda rough couple of days. ive starting thinking about suicide (like pretty seriously which now that its setting in is scaring me, ive thought about it before but knew i would never do it for the people i love) and also relapsed in self harm and to me it seems all of out of the blue but i dont know. the week before this im remembering having a couple of thoughts in the back of my head about these things but i guess i didnt pay much mind to it and now im here. about four years ago now (when i was 13/14) ive struggled with these things and since then its been a bit off and on but never as intense as this and just now that this mindset is coming back in full force its just.. weird? bizarre? scary? i dont know what to think now that im kind of seeing through the fog as i could describe it. if anyone could just send me some encouraging support and stuff that would be nice. i havent really talked to anyone about it yet and i dont know how im gonna feel about everything tomorrow as im writing this post late at night but hopefully not back to not caring about my mental health. (sorry of any of this was hard to understand, just trying to get my thoughts out)
