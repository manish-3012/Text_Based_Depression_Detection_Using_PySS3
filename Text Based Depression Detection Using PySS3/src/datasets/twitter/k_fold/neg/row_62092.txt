I want to die, but I don't want to hurt the 2 people that would careI've been depressed for almost my whole life. And I've had spells where it's gotten a little bit better, but it always gets worse again. It doesn't feel worth it to try anymore. The longer I live, the more I regret not ending it at 13 or 15, or 17, 20, 21, 22, 24. The longer I live the more I feel like it will hurt my mom. And I have a boyfriend that I live with. We have pets together and he wouldn't be able to afford the rent without me. He also has a fucked up family situation. I just can't bear the thought of doing that to him. But life is also just too fucking painful. I don't know what to do
