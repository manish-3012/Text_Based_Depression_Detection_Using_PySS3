I wish I had stayedLast December I stood on train tracks with a train coming towards me and people yelling and my friend on the phone begging I got off the tracks in time. I spent three days at a suicide prevention place, a mental hospital for a week and during that time I never heard from anyone in my family. End of January I got a DUI and in July I lost my job. My familyâ€™s only involvement has been financial support assuming Iâ€™m sober. Well thanks to my lying coward fake ass sister they know Iâ€™m not sober, and have cut me off. Iâ€™ve been blamed, called selfish and told something is wrong with me. This year has been mostly disappointments, failures, and emotional turmoil. I wish I had stayed on those stupid train tracks and not be where I am now.
