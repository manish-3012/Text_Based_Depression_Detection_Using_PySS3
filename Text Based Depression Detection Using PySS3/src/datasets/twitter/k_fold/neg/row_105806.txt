I am pretty convinced I should have done this in 98,I have been coming around to the idea that I should have killed myself in 1998. The year before columbine. The year before I saw any school in my district do anything about bullies. 

... I was bullied so severely I didn't realize how abusive my home life was until I got to be an adult and realized people with healthy families don't have drug addiction rampant in said family and nightmares about dad aren't normal. 

98 was the first year I thought about killing myself and I just feel like I wasted my chance by chickening out. 

It's likely my mom would have left my dad. My younger brother would be better off and might have gotten help. 

And maybe they would have looked into those bully's lives to see what made them want to and succeed in destroying me. 

They did destroy me. It's just that no one noticed until I got to be an adult that can't function. 

I can't love people who love me back. I only love people that like me enough to fuck me and chuck me. Thus I havent touched anyone in years. 

I have been unemployed for almost a year and a half after I was living with a lady paying her rent for the privilege of watching her kids for her for 3 bucks an hour. I never had the time to get the mythical second job that would have made that worth my while and I ended up moving back in with my mom after getting trapped with this lady who had all my stuff and I perpetually didn't have enough money to get a place of my own. 

Now I live with my mother and she lives in a place no bus comes and I can't get a job anywhere because nowhere will hire me as soon as they find out I don't have a car. 

I missed out on the chance to make my death meaningful and now I will just look like a useless fucking fuck up.
