Going in for surgery soon, maybe its better if I don't wake upI'm thinking I'll rather be dead than having chronic pain. My mistakes made life unfortunate but I can't take really much more physical pain

I don't know how to behave myself. I think that people have busy lives and I don't see myself adding any kind of value to their lives. Friendship is just a weird thing for me.

I mean, I haven't always been this way, or maybe I did. I had pretty awesome friends in my youth but one committed suicide and the other isn't interested in keeping contact. I remember not really knowing how to advance friendships. I have been having vivid dreams about it and I hate myself for my choices. 

I just don't know. Life is bearable of course but the pain of every other suffering in life and the indifference around me is just making me want to escape all my problems.

I'm even rambling here and I don't believe any word I say about myself. I criticize my thoughts to the point that I can only come to the conclusion that I'm a loser and anti-social, even though my reasoning may be right, and it makes me want to cry.

There is no way I can change this world. It is far too late to change anything about the world at all. Why? Simply because everyone is too selfish. And it will kill everything and everyone.
