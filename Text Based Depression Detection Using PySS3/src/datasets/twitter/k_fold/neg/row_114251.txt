Going to the hospital for suicidal thoughts, while being underage?I'm in High School, and I live with a family consisting of both my mother and father, as well as my younger sister. I live with the privilege of having two hardworking parents who care about me a lot, or so they say. I'm very sarcastic and joke a lot however, for the past few months I haven't been myself. I've been even more disconnected and I even let my studies and attendance fall. I feel like I complete failure and waste of life. Because once my parents find out that I did so awful during my second school quarter, they won't accept any excuse. Even my lack of motivation to do anything. 
I talked to my school's social worker back in November, and she thought that it was serious enough to contact my mother about. I had told her that I was seriously thinking of killing myself. She told my mother that she high recommends that I get a mental evaluation or go to therapy. But because I don't show much of what I am thinking, I put on a happy front just to please everyone. My mother never took me to get evaluated. 
Winter break came, and I was feeling slightly better. But once school started, I had 5x the assignments that I needed to do. I felt so trapped. I still feel trapped. I just want to kill myself to relieve me of the stress that has suddenly came my way. However.. at the same time, I'm scared to die. Because I'm scared of worrying my loved ones. I'm even questioning what happens after death.

Getting to my point, I went home early today because I "felt sick" when in reality, I needed to take a mental health day. So my mother picked me up and was pissed. And my mind was spinning but I felt like shit. Every word that she said in her strong tone was hurting me as I was already sensitive. I sat in the car, and since my mother wasn't going to get me help, I know that I need to do this for myself. Before I completely snap. I constantly joke about suicide to my friend, as well as contemplate ways I could die. 
I need to go to a hospital, but how would they even handle a case like mine? My mom would be called immediately, distracting her from her work. And stressing her out, which would stress me out more. And my dad is a whole other story. He loves me and my sister, but he's so damn strict that I can't tell him anything. If he were to find out I was suicidal from a doctor's call, he would blame me for not telling him. 
I feel so trapped, but I want to get myself help. Because I know deep inside, that I need it. Please reply with any advice you all may have. I'm going to go to the hospital two blocks away from my house once my mom leaves to pick up my sister. I'll also have to be fast. And I'll have my cell phone in case she wonders where I am. I want to do something to save myself for once.
