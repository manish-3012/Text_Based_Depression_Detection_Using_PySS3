I'll do itI think I'll do it. I changed my plan from overdose to gasing myself with carbonmonoxide. I have an appointment set up with a "medium", because I am afraid of punishment in the afterlife (which I really hope doesn't exit at all) and if it calms me enough, I will finally do it. That is the last thing stopping me.
