My life insurance would pay Â£500,000 tomorrowI don't know where else I can post this..

I'm sure this will be seen only by a few people but I need to let this out

I'm early 20 year old male with a gambling addiction. Over the past few days I've taken out multiple payday loans to feed my gambling addiction to try and chase the money I lost. I have Â£40 left to my name for 3 weeks until I'm paid again. I'm currently in around Â£7,000 worth of debt and I cannot deal with it anymore. I gamble to try get out of debt which only gets me into more debt and I cannot control this anymore.

I suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts around May 2018 and went to gamblers anonymous and did CBT to help with everything. It helped but only temporary, as I was feeling suicidal due to the gambling addiction in 2018 I decided to take out a life insurance policy for Â£500,000 so that if I were to do it or if something would happen, I wouldn't leave my family in a worse situation...

I am alone, I don't have someone I can call a best friend, I don't have anyone I can talk too openly and freely anymore and I've been single for 5 years, nobody wants me and I just think I'm a failure in everything I do.

As per the title, my life insurance will become active and will pay out for anything, including suicide - I cannot live with this debt anymore and I see no hope of ever clearing it or paying it off even with a full time job..

I am tired of this life and I don't want to live anymore, I'm near the end of the line and I just need it to stop.

If you see this, thank you for taking the time to read - you're a kind person who deserves the best in life
