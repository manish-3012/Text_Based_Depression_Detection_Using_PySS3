i cant go oni am 27, and for the last 7 years i have lived a life of homelessness, in and out of relationships and other peoples lives, never with a secure and safe housing situation. december of last year I started a relationship with a friend of mine, and we moved in together. i really thought he was going to love me forever but I couldn't even make it 11 months. his last girlfriend, he was with her for 12 years. he was perfect. we never had any relationship problems. no fights, everything seemed great.  


but now, he has broken up with me. he doesnt love me anymore. he hasnt loved me since may. he doesn't even think I'm pretty (except some of the time).   


i am broken and unlovable. and i cant go back to being homeless. i cant go back to life. and i have nothing left. I am a trans woman and I don't pass, I'm estranged from most of my family, and I'm tired of being a burden on them anyway.  


ive struggled with suicidal ideation since I was in 5th grade elementary. ive never felt closer to actually doing it. I dont see a future anymore. theres nothing left for me. this was like a once in a lifetime love and relationship. i am incapable of supporting myself economically. so it always seemed like the stars would have to align for me to actually be with someone long term and happy, considering I am trans, unpassing, ugly, useless, and mentally ill. it seemed like they finally had. but no. its all ruined.   


if I do go on, the same things that have already happened would just repeat. even if I went to live with my mom, eventually she will die of lung cancer and I will be right back where i started. and thats how i feel right now. seven years. seven years, and my life hasnt improved a single bit. theres no reason to continue. i am utterly broken.
