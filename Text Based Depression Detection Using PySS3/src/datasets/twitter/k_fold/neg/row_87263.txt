I did everything I was told to doI asked for â€œhelpâ€ when I first had suicidal thoughts as a teen only for my mom to mock me and abuse me

I worked my ass off to move out and graduate school

I went to therapy on and off for seven years and spent half my paycheck on mental health professionals

I have tried 10+ medications 

I sought sex therapy after I was sexually abused in college

All to be here at 27,  spending every day working at a job I despise that makes my mental health worse because itâ€™s the only way to support myself so I can continue waking up every day miserable and wanting to die

At what point can I stop caring about how it might affect others? At what point can I give myself the same compassion youâ€™d give a suffering animal and just make it stop
