College is right around the corner and Iâ€™m more scared than ever(19/M) Hi Canadian here, I messed up a little bit of elementary and a whole bunch of high school. My depression has never been this worse and I have never been more socially isolated. I have been fighting it for 5 years and Iâ€™m pretty much done, other people have had it worse Iâ€™m just weak I guess.

As for courses that Iâ€™m taking currently with the way Iâ€™m going itâ€™s unpredictable which course I will excel in whether I like it or not. I donâ€™t want to keep fighting I donâ€™t deserve everything that I have, and there is no sign of change anytime soon.
