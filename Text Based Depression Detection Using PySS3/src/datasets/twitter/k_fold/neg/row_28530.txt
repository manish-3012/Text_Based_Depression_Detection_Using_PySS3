9 years ago today my buddy hanged himselfIt's taken nearly a decade of going through the motions of grief to reach some semblance of acceptance. I never thought it would be like this.

 The last words he spoke to me and his final actions make sense now. I asked myself a gorillion times why he didn't just reach out.. To me, to our friends, to anyone. But now I know how hurt, pain, and misery drives you away from everything you love and cherish. 

I feel so guilty for hating you for what you did bro. I was selfish. I'm a hypocrite for walking a similar path lately. I feel an emptiness in my soul when my heart reaches out for you. Ironic how little that does to dissuade these ideas that creep and crawl through the shadows of my mind. I fucking miss you dude. I pray you're at rest now. I'd do anything to bring you back. I'd do anything just to let you know you're not alone in how you felt.
