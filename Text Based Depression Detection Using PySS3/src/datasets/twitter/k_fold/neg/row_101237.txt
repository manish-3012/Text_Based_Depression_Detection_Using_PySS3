Feel like I assaulted someone feel like I canâ€™t love with myselfSo a while ago I had a night with a friend where we were both drinking. I got blackout drunk she did not. She had a boyfriend I knew that (both f)

So apparently we talked a lot about sex that night and I told her we should have sex for some fkn reason (Iâ€™m bi but donâ€™t want that) and apparently I kissed her and she let me. (Not forceful or anything) (She said she might have kissed me back but doesnâ€™t remember cause we were both drinking and it was a long time ago.) she went to the bathroom to pee then came back into bed facing away from me. Guess I wanted to sleep with her cause I proceeded to say we should have sex then kissed her back for about a minute or so before she went to the bathroom to throw up and call a ride to go home. 

Things were a bit weird between us after that cause of course they were. But about 6 months later she wanted to get coffee and catch up and we started getting close again. I asked her and apologised about that night which is when she filled the details in for me. She told me I need to get over it and she considers it a weird night but a funny bar story. I feel so terrible about making her uncomfortable. It was so weird and out of character I canâ€™t stop overanalysing it. I think about it all the time and canâ€™t stop. I feel like Iâ€™m going crazy and donâ€™t deserve anything good. Honestly makes me want to self harm sometimes but Iâ€™m not going to. I feel so bad itâ€™s all I tho k about itâ€™s torture
