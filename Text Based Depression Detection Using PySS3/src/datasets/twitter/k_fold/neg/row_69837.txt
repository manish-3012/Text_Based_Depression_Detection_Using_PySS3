I want to dieMy best friend died of a drug overdose last year and I missed the funeral bc of school, shortly after I spiralled out of control and became heavily addicted to Xanax, it caused me to lose most of my healthy relationships, including recently my girlfriend of 3 years decided I was just too toxic and that I wasnâ€™t making her happy anymore. She was the only reason why I havenâ€™t killed myself yet. Now that sheâ€™s gone and I see her with another guy who is in all forms better than me I have no self esteem and feel as if Iâ€™ll never find a girl who will ever love me like she did. I have nothing left, Iâ€™m so close to dying I just donâ€™t know what to do
