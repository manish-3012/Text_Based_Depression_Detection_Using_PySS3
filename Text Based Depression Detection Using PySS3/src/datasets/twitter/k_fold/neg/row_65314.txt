Don't know anymorei thought i would post here as it would be nice for someone to talk to. ok i'm 18 years old and before you think oh just a stupid 18 year old know that i am not like the rest of them.  i have pretty much been depressed for well over a year now, nothing seems to make me happy anymore, i have hardly any friends , i use to have alot. i feel ugly no matter how hard i try to accept myself i can't. my family doesn't trust me. if something is out of place or something has happened they immediately blame me, when it never is, of course, they do not beleive me. it hurts when they do this. some people tell me im intelligent though i fail to see it. i get treated like crap at home and i would sometimes just wish i wouldn't wake up. 
i have rejected every guy(im a girl) that has liked me in the past year or so due to me not being able to handle a relationship because of all this bullshit, i just end up getting angry at them for no reason and fucking it up.
overall; my social life sucks, i feel ugly, i cry alot, sometimes i wish i was dead, i have self harmed myself, i hate my life.
i am good at hiding my emotions so no one really knows about this and i'd rather not tell anyone i know about it. i don't know what to do, and im not going to kill myself, because quite frankly i have not got the guts to do so, i doubt anyones 'help' on here will change my emotions but oh well
