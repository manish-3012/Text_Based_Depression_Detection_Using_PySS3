Reasons To LiveHey I'm not asking for much, I just need some reasons to live. I don't have anything worth living for right now that I know, and I need some motivation. I don't want to sound all clingy and shit. I made a throwaway because I don't want my parents to see this. Please, can someone just list a few reasons why I should keep living right now? I really need it... thank you.
