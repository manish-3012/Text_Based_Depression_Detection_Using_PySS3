Iâ€™m too cowardly to finish the job, but even that might not be enough of a deterrent pretty soonI have been suicidal since I attended middle school, and everyone told me itâ€™d get better in high school, and then that itâ€™d get better in college. Well it never did â€œget betterâ€. I was bullied for years, abused by my parents, and have zero friends or hope for the future.

My only true friend died earlier this year, my family thinks Iâ€™m just acting like a dramatic attention whore as an excuse to be lazy and fail my classes, and I spent most of my day at college sobbing alone in the bathroom or sleeping all day at home dreading waking up. The mental health facilities there at school are atrociously bad, and I live in the middle of nowhere where there is no psychiatrists or anything actually helpful.

I frequently think of the best way on how to end it all and join my friend, but Iâ€™m too terrified of blood and pain to do it. Every hobby or club I try, every self-help book I read, every way I attempt to spice up my appearance, Iâ€™m still the lonely loser autistic girl who canâ€™t make or keep any friends and has never gotten any sort of romantic experience because nobody likes anxious emotional nerds with weird special interests. I have no job prospects because I hate my major (Iâ€™ve been through 4) or motivation, and I just want to end it all.
