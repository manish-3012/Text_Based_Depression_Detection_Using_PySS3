Iâ€™m Really Done With LifeNow I understand, some (if any) people reading this post might wonder what happened to get me to this point of really wanting to opt-out of life; Iâ€™ll be real with you, not a whole lot. Some abuse here and there and then that stopped but whatever, never got help for that. Got extremely suicidal around 3-ish years ago, never got help for that. Family is kinda toxic sometimes but whoâ€™s isnâ€™t. Nothing extremely terrible like a (close) family member dying or anything, iâ€™m pretty lucky in the way of life. I have food and a roof over my head and a (mostly) supporting family who iâ€™m sure if i just talked to would help me. Etc etc etc... Iâ€™m just rambling now, this post is sorta a last ditch effort for something.... Iâ€™m not sure what at this point. I just kinda wanna talk to someone but i donâ€™t know who, i really donâ€™t want to talk to my family. I donâ€™t know what to do at this point. I feel like iâ€™m in limbo, or the calm before the storm... If that makes any sense? I donâ€™t know how to end this post so iâ€™m just gonna remind you to be kind to people and to wash your hands
