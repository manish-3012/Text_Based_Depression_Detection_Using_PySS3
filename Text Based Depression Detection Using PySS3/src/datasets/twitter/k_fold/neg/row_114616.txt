Need adviceIâ€™m gonna kill myself soon (no need to convince me not do it) but basically thereâ€™s this person that iâ€™ve been chatting with for a while and i kind of want to let them know how much I enjoyed talking to them and overall show them my gratitude before i die, Iâ€™m wondering if letting them know that before i die will maybe make them feel worse?? bc they might feel like theyâ€™re the last person i talked to before i killed myself
anyways tell me ur thoughts I donâ€™t wanna do more harm than good but i also donâ€™t want to just leave them hanging
