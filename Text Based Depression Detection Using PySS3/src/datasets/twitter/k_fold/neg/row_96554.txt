selfish...selfish. thats what people think suicide is. selfish.


tell me, what kinda mental gymnastics do people have to fucking go through to come to THAT conclusion?


I'm in pain. I'm in agony. I have no hope for the future. I don't want to live anymore. But because YOU want me alive, I have to stay alive. But I'M the selfish one. Yeah. Ok. Sure.


Sorry...needed to vent...
