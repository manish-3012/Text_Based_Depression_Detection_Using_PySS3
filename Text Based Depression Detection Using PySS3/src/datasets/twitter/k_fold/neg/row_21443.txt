There is no way out of this holeI have tried repeatedly to pull myself out and to improve but no matter how hard I try there is something that pops up and pulls me back down. 

Iâ€™ve decided to give up. Iâ€™m overeating again, Iâ€™m not showering regularly, Iâ€™m ready to stop working and Iâ€™m going to try to kill my self again. 

Iâ€™ve decided. I was relieved to think it. Iâ€™m going to die. It was such a relief and now Iâ€™m stressed to think of what my SO will think if he finds my body. 

Iâ€™m gonna book a hotel and slit my wrists in the tub. I know itâ€™s painful and slow way to die but I have no other methods. I just need to book a date. 

Iâ€™m not going to miss life. Iâ€™ll be happy when itâ€™s over.
