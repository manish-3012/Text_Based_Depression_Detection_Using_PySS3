Suicidal Thoughts?Tonight has been.. not the best. At all. I had been doing so well and hadn't had any thoughts of self harm for awhile but tonight it's all I can think about. I tried calling a hotline just to talk to someone but they've been busy each time I've tried.
I live by myself and all my friends are asleep right now so I don't really know what to do to keep myself occupied and these thoughts at bay. I keep thinking about all the different ways I could do it... if it would hurt... if it did, would it matter... how I wouldn't have to deal with anything anymore... how relieving it would be...
Advice on how to stop these thoughts?
