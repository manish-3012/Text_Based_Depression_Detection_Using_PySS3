I dont deserve anythingI feel like I don't deserve anything. I live a normal life, I'm eighteen, and yet, I feel like I don't belong. I have friends and family that care about me but I wish I didn't. I feel like I don't deserve them. I feel like if they had someone else in their lives besides me they would be happier. I know killing myself would make them sad, but it's all I can think about lately. I've tried to talk to some friends about how I feel but they never take me seriously. I've already tried killing myself once, and when it failed I took a long look at my life and felt like I didn't deserve to live either. 
If anyone I know happens to read this, I'm sorry but I just can't keep going on like this. Even after the happiest moments of my life, the feelings keep coming back. 
Goodbye.
