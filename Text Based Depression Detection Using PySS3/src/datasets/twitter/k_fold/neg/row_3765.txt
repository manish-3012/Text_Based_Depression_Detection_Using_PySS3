I'm so fucking done with everythingNothing goes as I want to. I didn't get into school, I didn't get a job even though I applied for 30 different places.. Nothing! no one fucking needs me or wants me to be around. All I ever really hoped for was this one girl who has been pretty close to me but she doesn't seem to feel the same way for me. 
I seriously want to take my life and I can't talk to anyone about it. Because I would just get put into hospital and I'm never going back there. I can't even think about how my friends would react if they heard about my suicidal thoughts. I've promised to myself to hang on for just for them. Especially for that one girl, even tho I've kinda lost my hope.   I'm tired af... I just need someone to talk about all this hell. But I can't talk to anyone I know.. and thb I'm not sure if I would know what to say.
I don't anymore even know why I made this post instead of writing my suicide note. But I'm not gonna throw this all away. 
Sorry for posting this
Sorry for being here
Sorry for not taking my life
Sorry that I'm attention seeker
Sorry that I didn't die to cancer
Sorry for being me

But I seriously think it's time for me to go
