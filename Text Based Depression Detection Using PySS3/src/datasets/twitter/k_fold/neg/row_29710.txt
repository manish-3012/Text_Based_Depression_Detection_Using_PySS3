What is it that keeps us going???As the title says, I'm wondering what the hell is it that doesn't let me just jump off a building/bridge or just stab myself. I have nothing to live for, my dreams are broken, my body burning. I want to find what is keeping me here and strangle it with my bare hands..

So may I ask you, what keeps you alive? Anything at all that stops you from suicide? 
What has greater power than death?
