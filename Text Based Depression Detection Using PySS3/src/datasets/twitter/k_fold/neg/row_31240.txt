Probably falling into depression. I feel patheticNot sure if this is depression but sometimes I feel worthless and a failure. I feel like Iâ€™m a terrible person because sometimes I use others for my benefit because I just want to have an advantage, probably cuz Iâ€™m short and a dude which puts me at a disadvantage at everything. My grades are shit and only thing that keeps me going is Rainbow Six Siege cuz Iâ€™m addicted to it. Iâ€™m not suicidal but Iâ€™ve had thoughts of it and like one pathetic attempt. (Iâ€™d be dead by now if I didnâ€™t switch to my current school though.) I donâ€™t have the motivation to do anything. I just wanna stay in and play video games. It helps me escape reality. Because reality is shit. I forget about everything and put my mind into this bubble where everythingâ€™s ok, because I feel like feeling like shit in public isnâ€™t worth it because it shows. I just drone on through the day acting like everythingâ€™s fine and get home like a zombie. Dead inside and spacing out on my bed in sadness.
