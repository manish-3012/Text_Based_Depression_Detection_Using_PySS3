I have an exam tomorrow I didnâ€™t study all week and Iâ€™m freaking outGot a bio exam tomorrow and despite having all week to study I didnâ€™t. Iâ€™d wake up early in the morning everyday staring at my computer not doing anything. Then Iâ€™d head to bed late and tell myself to do it tomorrow. Iâ€™ve done this all week I had work today and I canceled so I could study and I havenâ€™t done shit. Iâ€™ve barely slept this week, Iâ€™m tired, depressed and anxious. I have a 1.77 GPA after 45 credits and Iâ€™m failing my classes I just lost all hope and Iâ€™m losing my mind. Instead of studying Iâ€™m getting depressed over how dumb Iâ€™m being and how Iâ€™m never gonna be successful in the future. Iâ€™m dealing with so much anxiety that Iâ€™m terrified what my parents will do if they find out, Iâ€™m terrified what Iâ€™ll do if the school kicks me out since I was already kicked for a semester. Iâ€™m so tired I want to sleep and give up but Iâ€™m so scared of failing so Iâ€™m staying awake to try and study but Iâ€™m not even doing that.  Nothing makes sense and just wanna stop existing
