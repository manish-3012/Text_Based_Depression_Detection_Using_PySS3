undecidedI've been feeling like this for a while now. 
I cut my wrists (small cuts) at least once a week and every time I do it it hurts less, makes me dream about deeper cuts, I'm just afraid of doing it. 

Nobody seems to understand what I'm going through. I''m tired of hearing the ''what's wrong?'' or the infamous ''there has to be a reason for you to feel like that'' and sometimes there's no reason, others I just forget it. 

9 months ago I was abused by a drunk guy in a party and for months I did like nothing happened but now i cannot forget it. 

Instead of trying to get better, I got my support from an impossible love (for now) and I can't talk with him now. I don't feel like I have friends and my parents do not understand... I want to go to therapy but always feel like something won't let me go. 

I want to kill myself, stop breathing and let people cry over my grave and forget about me a month later. 

I don't want to feel empty anymore.
