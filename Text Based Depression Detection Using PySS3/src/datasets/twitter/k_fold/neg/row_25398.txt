This is probably my last reddit postWell, this isn't my first post on this sub, but it'll definitely be my last. I don't even know why I'm bothering to write this, and no, it's not because I want help. I'm writing this because... I feel like it? Anyhow my first post was too long so no one save one person read it, and I've decided that life just isn't worth it. It's not anyone's fault that I'm doing this, not even mine, it's just how things happened to end up like. Ah I don't know what to write anymore so bye I guess- in more ways than one ahaha
