just a little ventingI know I have privileged life, I should be grateful of whatever I have or accomplished, I only wanted two things in my life, one was having a home of my own, and another to have a partner to share it with. I thought those were simple, and doable requests. and never made myself other goals or wishes, I thought that, once I had them I could, sit and enjoy the rest of my life. but I always fail at my relationships, I always make so much mistakes, I end up alone, I pushed away friends and family, I have no other meaningful or fulfilling relationships. I know my family loves me, I know they might suffer. But I don't care much about that at this point. I feel so alone, and abandoned. I don't have the balls to kill myself. But life seems so worthless, I don''t have the energy, the motivation, the will, to do anything anymore, I don't enjoy anything anymore. Everyday is just as numbing as the previous one. I don't want to make more efforts, more sacrifices, I have given up on life. and yet I don't have the balls to end it. I am afraid I don't succeed. I don't sleep, or eat. I stoped enjoying everything. I think I have a way to hang myself, maybe I seek just that little push to finally do it.
