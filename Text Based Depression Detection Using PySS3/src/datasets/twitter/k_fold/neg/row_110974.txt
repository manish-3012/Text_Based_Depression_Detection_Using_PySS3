First College, then end it.I have a plan to kms as soon as I move into my college dorm. I found the most effective/peaceful/affordable way and Iâ€™m just waiting to get to that one last life goal (going to college). 

Iâ€™ve had so much chaos in my life and recently Iâ€™ve been thinking Iâ€™d rather end things now than have to go through the next few years of pain to get to what will hopefully be the â€œgood partâ€(which isnâ€™t even guaranteed). 

A lot would benefit from it anyway, my brother could go to college without any debt if he got the money my parents saved for me, and I donâ€™t really have any close friends Iâ€™d be leaving behind. I wouldnâ€™t have to see my grandparents die, and I would die in a good light cause Iâ€™d be gone before I had the chance to fail at a career or college, which I donâ€™t think I could really succeed at. 

I just donâ€™t know how to tell the people I really care about, mainly my boyfriend who has been my biggest supporter. A part of me wants to just break if off and hope he doesnâ€™t think about me again and then he wonâ€™t have to deal with the aftermath. I could write a note but I have no idea what Iâ€™d even say. 

I donâ€™t want to tell anyone I know because I donâ€™t want to be put in a mental hospital or be pitied by the people around me who I know wouldnâ€™t give a crap otherwise.
