Iâ€™m tired of having to pick myself upThe title says it all. My life consistently feels like every time I begin to pick myself up from one event, something new happens. It feels like I committed a great sin in a past life and this current life is my punishment.

Iâ€™ve reached my absolute lowest point. I was recently dumped after spending almost 4 years with the man I truly thought I would marry, and shortly after that found out he had been cheating on me near the end and is currently dating the girl he cheated on me with. I saw them out of a date the other day and it sent me into the worst panic attack of my entire life. Through all of my ups and downs he was the one person I always trusted to never hurt me, and he left me for a girl he barely knows.
My grandma died last week, my moms health has progressively been deteriorating and Iâ€™m fairly certain she has late stage cancer and just wonâ€™t tell me since sheâ€™s ridiculously secretive about her health and afraid for my mental health if I know the truth, and if she dies Iâ€™ll be an orphan at the ripe age of 21 since my dad died when I was a child. I only have one other family member and they live several states away. My closest friends have all moved away. Iâ€™m doing terribly in school.
I feel so lost and directionless. I tried to get in with a psych but the only place in my town that takes my insurance has an almost year long waitlist. The best they could offer was to give me a call if someone cancels. I feel like I try so so hard to use the coping skills Iâ€™ve learned in therapy but there comes a point when itâ€™s just not enough. 
This post is a mess but life just feels like an unending nightmare where I bounce from one trauma to the next scrambling for some sort of foothold but this time I have none. I have nothing to keep me going. Thoughts of dying are in the back of my head all day every day no matter what Iâ€™m doing.
I donâ€™t know exactly what my point is with this post, itâ€™s a mess, and Iâ€™m a mess, but maybe I just need people to talk to.
