GoodbyeThis is it, all I have to do is prepare myself. I've got nothing, I'm constantly being told to look at some great future which doesn't even exist, I'm losing friends, pissing everybody off I can't even make my fucking girlfriend happy, I love her to bits but all I do piss her off, the exact same goes for my family. I don't want to do this anymore, if somehow you know who I am, I'm sorry. Goodbye
Edit: I slept on it
