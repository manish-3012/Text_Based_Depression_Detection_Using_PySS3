Not doing wellIâ€™m currently off my medication due to not having insurance at the moment, and I am doing horribly right now. I got to the point last night where I genuinely scared myself into thinking I needed to go back to the hospital. Iâ€™ve had an attempt back in December, and spent well over a week between the ICU and BHU. However, I started a new job and Iâ€™m afraid they wonâ€™t be understanding if I seek help. I feel so scared, and helpless, and alone. Either I risk losing my job and getting help, or losing my life. Iâ€™m at a loss.
