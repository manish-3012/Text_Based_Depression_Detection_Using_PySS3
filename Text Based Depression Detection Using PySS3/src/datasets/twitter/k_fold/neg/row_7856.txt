Surrendering. I've been fighting depression for as long as I can remember. I feel like I've reached the point where I just want to stop fighting and give up. I used to be the kind of person who would give reasons to keep fighting, but now it feels like I'm just lying to myself. I used to be against suicide but now I feel like it could actually be a good thing. The battles been too long. I feel jaded and I just want to close my eyes and let it all be over.
