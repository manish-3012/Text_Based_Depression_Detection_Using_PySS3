If you're reading this I'm moste likely deadIf you are reading this I'm probably dead. I have a few more goodbyes to say after I type this out, but this will probably be the last thing the internet ever hears from me. I've been scared to kill myself for a while but I've finally gotten over being scared now I'm just a little nervous. I've read a lot of post on r/SuicideWatch and r/Depression and they have helped me stay alive this long but today is the day. I know longer wish to live and my mind is made up.

Thank you, 
Luke
