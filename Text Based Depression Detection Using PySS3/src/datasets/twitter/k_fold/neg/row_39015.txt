Trying to stay in check.Been suicidal since extremely young, my childhood wasn't the best but wasn't the worst. 


I often go thru periods of being extremely optimistic for a few days- drawing pages of art, cleaning the entire house, setting goals for myself, finishing books, so on so on. However, I also have extremely long and depressive "episodes" (as me and my family call them) that can last a week to a few months. However, no matter how happy I am I will always feel suicidal- I've been trying hard to get myself back in check and pull myself out of whatever depressive "episode" I'm in but it's easier said than done. I've been putting up happy messages for me to read every morning, been waking up and telling myself it'll be a good day, been forcing myself to go outside, so on so on. So far, it's not really working and I feel like I'm sinking further and further down.

Been to a therapist but was just sent to a hospital and doped up for a week before being sent back home. Shit ain't fun and I don't wanna deal with that again. I've spoken to family but by now they only make empty plans and ignore it. I've been called selfish for my thoughts and that hurts- the only thing keeping me here is the fear of hurting them. I don't fear death, I just fear hurting them. 


How do y'all cope and what helps y'all stay away from actually sealing the deal and going thru with it? It seems to get harder everyday for me.
