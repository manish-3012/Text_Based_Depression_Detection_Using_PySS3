I canâ€™t live with myselfI messed up majorly. I hurt one of the few friends I have that cares about me. I lied to them and I did it in such a stupid way. I canâ€™t even be mad at myself Iâ€™m just disappointed that I did it. In the process of this I may have ruined my life and Iâ€™m only 23. I just canâ€™t live with myself
