Trying to save my friend has me feeling like the bad guy.I've spent the last few days staying with my friend (we'll call her Princess) to make sure she engages with the mental health crisis team. They're visiting daily since she disclosed her plan last Friday.

I'm not really making an effort to change her mind, just being there for her, offering positive things as and when appropriate, giving her space to talk through her options, making sure she eats, etc.

She's just so pleased and happy about her plan. And I can't say I don't get it. She's been through so much trauma and fought to even be able to do basic things for so long.  Wanting her to keep going and keep trying when she's suffering so much just feels... I don't know. I'm still going to support her in trying to survive, and looking for alternatives to suicide, and I firmly believe that there is hope that she will be grateful for still being alive given enough time and support.  I just don't always feel confident that I'm doing the right thing. I just want her to be ok.
