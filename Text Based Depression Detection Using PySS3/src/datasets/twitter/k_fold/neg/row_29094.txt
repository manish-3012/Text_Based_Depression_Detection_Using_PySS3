I'm done(I'll be simplifying this for security purposes or whatever the fuck)  


i live in a shitty broke country which is in the opposite direction from where i was born  
i have no friends that i truly trust  
everyone that i did trust abandoned me  
i don't really have any talents  
i'm in treatment but nothing has worked for 1-2 years  
i have a therapist which haven't helped much because i don't think they are really qualified to understand specifically my situation  
i've been bullied for 4 years, left the school and i never have trusted any classmates since  
i've lost interest in a lot of stuff i loved  
i've been rejected too many times and even 2 girls i liked decided to turn to guys  
it's gotten to the point that i have to talk to assholes on the internet to vent to which lead to me being banned from being sad in a server i frequent and a guy making fun of my problems and some other people just politely telling me to fuck off and get a therapist because "venting won't help here"  
i've tried to look for solutions but i haven't found anything  
my mental age is far more older than my own age which means that i wanna work and actually make a living and have a carrer but can't  


might not stay for too long and i'll probably delete this post after a while

nobody can help me and i have no interest in living anymore
