I think this is itYou know, I loved her so much. She has carried me through an entire year and I owe her so much. 


I tried to commit suicide last month, I took a lot of pills. I've been called paranoid ( and blamed it on my bipolar )  for suggesting some "friends" knew something I didn't, but I know now I was right. She has been seeing a guy, but they lied and encouraged me anyway. 


A friend I told just now about last month said that if I ever did something like that he'd personally beat me to death, but what do I care. 


Her and this false hope kept me going, but now that it's gone then so am I. I still love her, and always will because she has given it all for me, but since I am not worth it then now I think it's the time. I love her and would never ever blame her, she kept me alive for so long.
