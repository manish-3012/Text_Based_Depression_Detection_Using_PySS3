No reason to stay44 trans woman, I have no reason to remain upright and above ground. I'm alone. I reach out to people only to be ignored or ghosted entirely. Finances are an utter wreck. My dog got cancer and I had to put her down. My physical and mental health are suffering despite my best efforts. My job is way too hard for me to manage.
