Iâ€™m only alive today because I didnâ€™t have enough pillsI sat on my bedroom floor last night counting all the pills I had. Unfortunately I didnâ€™t have enough to actually overdose and die. Iâ€™m thinking when I get my prescription refilled I can finally do it. 

Iâ€™m tired. This world was not meant for me, and I was not meant for it. 

Best wishes to all of you â¤ï¸
