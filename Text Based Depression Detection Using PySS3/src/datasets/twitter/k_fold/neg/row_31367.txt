Today reddit made me want to kill myself.I've been tipping over the edge of wanting to, and actually attempting suicide A LOT lately. Have completely lost faith in humanity and dont want to experience this world anymore. [This interaction](https://imgur.com/gallery/hsmk7) really set me off tonight. I just can't seem to shake off life's injustices the way others can.
