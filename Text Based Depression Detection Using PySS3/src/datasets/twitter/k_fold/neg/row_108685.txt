How much longer?I just had a mental breakdown and I feel sick. It's just a burden to be here. My friends circle doesn't exist and I don't find interest in anything and it's all just coming downhill. It's been like this for a solid 2 years and I just hate everything rn . Any person you meet they all tell the same clichÃ© thing that it gets better and it's just total bs at this point. I don't like it here anymore
