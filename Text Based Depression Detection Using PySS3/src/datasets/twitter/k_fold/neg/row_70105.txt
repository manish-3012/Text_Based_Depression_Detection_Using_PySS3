Trying.Iâ€™ve come to terms that Iâ€™ll probably never be in love. Or have real friends. 
I find more comfort in front of my pc than I do anywhere else.  
Iâ€™m 25 and never had a real relationship. 

This has been getting me so down last few years. Where girls just seem to loose interest. But i think itâ€™s me just having no self love. Just wish that I could be a better me. But subconsciously I think I always want to be like this because ill fear change? 

Basically I donâ€™t even know where I am. And all I do know is that I am becoming so tired. 
I feel like Iâ€™m becoming lost to the mass population. And would anyone even realise if I just faded away. 

I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m even Writing this to a fucking page on Reddit. I just typed in suicide and thought maybe someone here will relate and tell me itâ€™s worth it. But does that even matter? 

The only constant in my life is the thought of death. Where Iâ€™ve even reviewed the plan so many times. I wonder how long it would take someone to find me
