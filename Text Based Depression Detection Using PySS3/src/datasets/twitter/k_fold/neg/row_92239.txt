July 12So I believe I picked the date I will finally depart. 

I've been taking sleeping pills with alcohol, breathing in hand sani, staying underwater for a while, burning myself all in preparation. 

I have tried everything for the past 20 years and nothing is getting better, nothing anyone says can help, no anecdotes or homilies, I know far more people who are dead that I can talk to than alive. 

The final straw was an old friend saying I was a bad person, a stalker for reaching out to them and manipulative. I have been taking responsibility for my part in our falling out for months and they have not.  I had been trying to make amends and they took a long time to get back to me, instead of nipping it in the bud.

I am on medication, supplements, therapy, I meditate, work out, I have had reiki treatments, sound baths... nothing is working. 

&amp;#x200B;

I reach out to people and no one gets back to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I am done, I imagine it will take a miracle for me not to do it.
