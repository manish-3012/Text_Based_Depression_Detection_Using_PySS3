I want it so bad but Iâ€™m so afraid of being caught again.Iâ€™m a complete fuck up. I disappoint my parents. Iâ€™m miserable. I have no friends. Iâ€™m a rape victim and my ptsd controls my life. Iâ€™m constantly dissociating. I feel out of control and I feel like suicide would put me back into control. September 28th, 2019. Seems like a good enough day. Gives me enough time to say goodbye to everyone. If I control when I die and how I die, I am the one in power over my life. I want to be in control.
