Everyone has their shit, everyone is struggling with something. How do you all deal with your emotions and shit? Because I am not able to live with mine anymore....This is my first attempt to reaching out to anyone about my mental condition. Typing this out seems surreal; if I actually submit this I will be surprised. I know everyone has their shit. My shit is most likely less important than most other people's shit. But I am so fucking unhappy. I am fairly sure I have been depressed since before I was even aware there was a term to describe such a condition. I am halfway through writing my suicide note- PLEASE know that it is extremely unlikely that I will kill myself in the near future. I would never want to subject my family and friends to something like that; don't want to cause them trouble. I just don't know what else to do, because I cannot stand living with myself. I was just hoping there was someone I could talk to about my depression, bipolar tendencies, eating disorder, OCD or anxiety, or if anyone could give me tips on how to distract myself from these feelings so that I can try to live my life helping others and not bothering people with my emotional instability. Sorry for wasting your time, and thank you if you did take the time to read this. 

This is also my first time on reddit- I've been a long time lurker, and decided to make this account as a first step to deal with this kind of stuff. I have friends who are depressed and in really bad places, and have talked and tried to help them through their feelings, but I have never alluded to anyone about the insanity going on in my head. As a result of that, I am really unsure of how to talk about this.
