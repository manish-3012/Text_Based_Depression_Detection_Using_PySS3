Trying againIt's been one hell of a week, attempted on the 20th...  Failed and was sick for a few days, I took an overdose tonight, not much... Should make me loopy enough to not struggle with the scarf I have handy.  I feel like a failure for the last attempt gone awry, here's hoping I don't come to this time.
