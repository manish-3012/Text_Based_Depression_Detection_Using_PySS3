What could I do?Hi, everyone, thanks for clicking on this link. I'm a nihilist as you may have seen on my name
I've thought about killing myself a lot of times lately, I know that life is pointless, every human being is just dictated by its conservation and survival instincts as well as their personal pleasure, I know that killing myself would be painless as I know some fast and good methods. I also don't care much about what impact it would have on my friends, family and society as I won't be there to regret anything (I don't believe in gods or afterworlds, to me these are just stuff that humans invented because they couldn't believe that we are pointless and just a complete coincidence)
I was wondering what could I do before I decide to take my final step towards death, I am ready to die anytime, it doesn't matter a lot to me anyway but I'd like to have a little fun before that happens.
I've been watching a lot of anime, playing some video games and making stuff lately, however, I feel like I haven't experienced something that make people want to stay alive longer
I've already kissed a girl but I never had a girlfriend, nor have I ever had sex, I failed my last two trimesters at school, I could get good grades if I worked a lot but I feel like it's not worth it, I feel like if I work hard or not, it won't change anything, I'm still going to die, I just want to have fun, to do what I want but there is no way I could live by doing the things I want.
So, can you think of anything I could do before I kill myself? (except watching dank memes all day, I've already done that)
