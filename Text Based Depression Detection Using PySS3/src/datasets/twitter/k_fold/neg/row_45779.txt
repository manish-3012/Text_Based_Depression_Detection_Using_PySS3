How do you live when you feel like you want to die all the time?I go through several suicidal phases throughout the year, every year, and I know this one will pass...but I still donâ€™t truly know how the fuck to live when I feel like I want to die every day. Itâ€™s just so much fucking effort and bullshit to get through life and sometimes I just want out. I donâ€™t want to deal with it anymore. I know Iâ€™ll feel better again but I also know Iâ€™ll feel just like this again and it makes me wonder why bother with any of it.
