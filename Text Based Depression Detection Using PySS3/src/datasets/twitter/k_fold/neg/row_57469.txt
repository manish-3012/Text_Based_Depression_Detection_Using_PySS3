One more weekI apologize in advance for the shitty title and unformatted ramblings but tl;dr I am giving myself one more week to kill myself. I'll keep it short. Your time is much more valuable that my life.

Anyways, I suppose this is where I complain now. Me - 21, mtf trans, unable to get a job, single, ugly, no money, no friends, etc. I literally have NO future. I have thought of countless things I can do but it mostly results back to money. I cannot get a job and I'm on the verge of getting kicked out. In fact, I am getting kicked out in a week. And not like "oh I will go to a friend's house and live." I don't have friends and I have no place to go. The only thing I am spending money on is hormones which I pretty much need in order to be sane now. I have previously gone to one year of regular college only to fail, wait a bit, go to community college, and fail that. I am a huge idiot. And unlike most posts on this subreddit, I am absolutely serious. I have the rope right next to me, all set up.
