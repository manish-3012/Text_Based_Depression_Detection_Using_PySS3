I think I'm losing my only hopeIt's not like it's especially a good one, wanting a friend that doesn't want you is probably more unhealthy than anything.
But it's the only thought I had when I took pills and before I could take more I thought that if I could have another chance with him I'd be making a grave mistake.

I'm starting to think my mistake was to choose to stay alive. My mom is being a bit more supportive but only because she saw what happened but I still have no reasons to live in this life that I hate so much. If it's not now it'll just be later anyway.

I want to get help but I also want my friend back, my last friend. I can't imagine just "moving on" even if he's the worst I believe in him and I know he can change like he said he wanted to back then.
But I guess it's the rule of my life being abandoned even by relatives, I'll probably make some people sad if I died but there definitely won't be that many people at my funerals anyway and yes it makes me feel better to be able to keep the damage at a minimum and it's why I didn't feel bad attempting.

But now my friend is questioning it and is saying I'm faking it to manipulate him but with all I've done before I guess I deserve it.
