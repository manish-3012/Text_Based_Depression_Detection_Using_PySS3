I need help.  If I don't kill myself, I'm probably going to die on the street anyway.  Everything is hopeless.About 4-5 weeks back, my husband hurt himself at work.  Achilles tendon injury.  Compo is heavily delayed, and might not even go through, because husband's company is saying he's lying.  

We're losing internet on the 1st.  We run out of food this week.  I can no longer pay for my thyroid meds or my depression medication.  I get paid this week, but I'm minimum wage and every cent is probably going to rent.  If nothing improves, we lose our home in March.  If we can no longer feed our pets, we have to re-home the rats as well.

I've been applying for a second job/extra part time work.  Over a hundred resumes and I haven't heard a peep.

I've cried and worried so much that I'm starting to go numb.  I've been on the street before and I don't want to go back to that.  It's such a helpless, hopeless feeling.  And without my meds, I'm pretty screwed anyway.

I just want to die, but I have to be here for my husband.  I don't know what to do anymore.
