FatIâ€™m fat. Iâ€™m 5â€™3 and weigh around 190 pounds. I want to lose weight but I have zero willpower when it comes to sweets, and exercising is agonizing for me. I donâ€™t know how to breathe correctly when exerting myself, so I feel like Iâ€™m on the brink of hyperventilating. 

I also have a history of being sexually abused, including being trafficked, and I HATE sweating. In those days, I was thin, probably due to being malnourished, but I just donâ€™t like sweat, my own but especially anyone elseâ€™s. My body has become so gross that I gaslight myself about it to diminish my experiences. Just today, I bitterly remarked to my therapist, â€œNobody would pay someone to bang me now.â€

Iâ€™ve been begging my husband for a gym membership and to work out with me, but he wonâ€™t do either. I have a family history of diabetes and I donâ€™t want to fulfill that lineage. I donâ€™t have a workout buddy for any accountability and I donâ€™t have the first clue of how to tackle this issue. And yes, it does make me want to die. The world isnâ€™t kind to people of size. 

I do carry my weight well, well enough that most people assume I weigh about 40 pounds less. But it still takes up too much space. I hate my body and Iâ€™m stuck with it, and it isnâ€™t worth living in.
