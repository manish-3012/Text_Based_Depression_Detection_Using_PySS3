It's always the same thing.I can't handle the smallest bit of conflict in my life without these stupid fucking thoughts coming back to my brain. Images of me hanging from a noose, images of a blade digging into my skin. Thoughts that swirl in my brain. 

"You don't matter." 

"They'd be better off without you." 

"You don't help at all." 

"You should just disappear." 

It's been so long since I've given into any sort of self harm, but I'm scared. I hate that the urges are still so strong, getting stronger. I hate the things that pop into my brain for no reason. I hate myself, and I just wish I hadn't been born so I wouldn't be dealing with all of my own shit.
