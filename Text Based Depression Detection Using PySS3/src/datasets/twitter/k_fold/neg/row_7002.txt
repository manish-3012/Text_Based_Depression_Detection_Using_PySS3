Itâ€™s been 1 year since I attemptedIâ€™m supposed to be making pies for my families food swap later today and I canâ€™t get up. I just keep thinking about how much different this holiday would be for my family if I was successful, and how different it ended up being last year. I got out of the psych ward the day before Thanksgiving. 
Iâ€™ve worked the past 3 years on both Thanksgiving and Christmas Day just to avoid spending time with them. Iâ€™m an only child and my dads still around. He loves me but he doesnâ€™t like me and Iâ€™ve accepted that, but with covid Itâ€™s really jarring how much I want to spend time with him today, now that I canâ€™t. 
He was there the day I attempted; he left me alone in my grandmotherâ€™s empty house after he made me cry to go drink with my uncle. 
Iâ€™ve never felt important enough to talk about how I feel with anyone, and I havenâ€™t found a helpful therapist yet. 
Thereâ€™s still some part of me that wishes I was gone right now, like I think I havenâ€™t improved my life at all and donâ€™t deserve to be here. 
Itâ€™s been really challenging to imagine what my family and friends would be going through until today. I just want my dad to hold me and tell me how much I mean to him, but realistically thatâ€™s never going to happen. I canâ€™t find enough within myself to validate my presence like Iâ€™m suppose to. 
Finally thinking of how this holiday would have changed for everyone I know if I had died is bringing me a lot of emotion. I canâ€™t tell anyone close to me about this so I came to reddit. 
Iâ€™m going to continue to stay sober and act happy for my family and video chat my dad today. Happy thanksgiving
