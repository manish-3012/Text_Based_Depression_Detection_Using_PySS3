It's no ones fault I wanted to be an artistHello Suicide Watch,   
  I am 25 years old and still living at home.  I had moved out previously but that only lasted a couple years as I couldn't afford it.  I feel like the life that i have chosen has been a blessing and a curse.  On days where I am not plagued by depression I do enjoy playing music and painting.  I was working as a house painter for the past five years but then I faced the reality of not being able to follow my dreams as I would like to so I've been trying to do it with little to no money picking up jobs scarily.  I do not produce enough art work to sell and I also don't learn a lot of covers to play out and make money, which I know I'm shooting myself in the foot.  I just genuinely want to make something that I can call my own.  When I was younger I felt that I had the potential/work ethic to be someone but I never hit my stride and I feel like I am becoming a loser despite my efforts.  I don't have many friends and don't really know how to make friends being out of school for so long.  I'm practically unemployed and every time I think of applying for one I'm held back by thoughts of having little to no social skills.  This also adds a sense of shame because I can never create without thinking that I don't have a real job so it adds some guilt because what I consider working(art/music) isn't physical or a means to a paycheck.  I was in a really bad episode a few months ago where I couldn't make myself get out of bed but I currently write this as someone who is drifting.  As I grow older I realize that my world view is getting more limited and I can't seem to leave my childlike perspective.
