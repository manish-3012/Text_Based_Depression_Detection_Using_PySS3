Only because Iâ€™ve thought about it will I post hereMy ex dumped me at the worst possible time in my life and I canâ€™t stop thinking about her every minute of every hour of every day. I love her and I would still do anything In this world to make sure nothing happens to her and to make her the happiest she can possibly be.

When she told me she needed to figure herself out and not date me anymore it ruined my life. She was the core to my happiness and now she left, with my happiness still attached to her.

Everything in my life is going downhill right now and I just want to end it all because I know all the pain, suffering, unhappiness, depression etc would just go away and thatâ€™s all I want

I gave everything and sacrificed everything I had to make her happy and to be the best boyfriend that I possibly could, I focused all of my attention and all my resources to make sure she was happy and could do what she needed to do to take the next step in her life, which I suppose doesnâ€™t involve me anymore.

Itâ€™s been almost 2 months since she left me and I CANT get over her no matter how hard I try. I canâ€™t get her off my mind even though I know sheâ€™s probably moved on by now.

I canâ€™t imagine a life without her and my happiness has abandoned me completely, my confidence shot, my depression rising, knowing no matter how hard I tried I couldnâ€™t make my baby girl, my princess, my queen, the first girl I truly felt I loved and loved me back, I couldnâ€™t make her happy after giving her my all.

Thatâ€™s why I want to end it all
