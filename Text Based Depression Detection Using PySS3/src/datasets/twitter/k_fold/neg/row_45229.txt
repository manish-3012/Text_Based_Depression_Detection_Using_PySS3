My heart is breaking and I feel like I'm dyingI'm suffering the biggest heartbreak I've ever been through. I can't get them out of my head. I lost the only thing that has ever made me happy in a long time. I don't have anything left. How do I prevent myself from acting on impulse. Please help me, I can't stop crying.
