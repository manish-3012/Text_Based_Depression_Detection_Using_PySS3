Iâ€™m guilty.This isnâ€™t my first time posting. Just a new account and itâ€™s been a long time. Iâ€™m guilty. Iâ€™m guilty of lying. Of being annoying and worthless. Iâ€™m never enough and Iâ€™m guilty of thinking I ever would be. All day Iâ€™ve thought about dying. It wouldnâ€™t be the first time. I attempted not that long ago. I failed at that like I fail at everything. I love my boyfriend and all day I lied to him. What king of girlfriend does that. He was just trying to check on me. Heâ€™d ask if Iâ€™m doing alright and Iâ€™d just smile and lie through my teeth and say Iâ€™m fine when in reality I was just trying to make everything okay because I planned on it being the last time of everything. I at least wanted my last moments. Our.. last moments to be something happy. Something he wouldnâ€™t look back on as bad. Something that wouldnâ€™t be his fault because itâ€™s not. Heâ€™s amazing. Iâ€™m the failure. I plan on dying. But for real this time. Iâ€™ve tried overdosing so itâ€™s time for something new. I already called suicide hotline. That was pointless. I feel pointless and worthless. Actually I donâ€™t feel it. I know it. Iâ€™m a shitty person. He deserves better. And he should know itâ€™s not his fault.
