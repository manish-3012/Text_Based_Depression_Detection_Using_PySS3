I've been played too many times.It just hurts so much when you feel like someone really likes you and it turns out that he was just using you.

I've lost a lot of weight, and I thought I was done with guys like that, but obviously I'm not.  Let me give you context:

He took me out to dinner, and then he took me downtown and showed me his favorite spots.  He showed me where he goes to calm down and where he feels the most tranquil.  He held my hand first.  He hugged me first.  He kissed me first.  ALL on a first date.  I felt really special, but obviously, I wasn't.  As usual.  It really hurts deep down in my soul.  So either I don't talk to anyone ever again, or I end it right now.  I vote the latter.

I'm tired of being taken advantage of.  I'm tired of being me.
