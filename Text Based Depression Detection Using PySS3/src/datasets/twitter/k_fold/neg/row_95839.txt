Sorry. This ended up being a bit long.I'm sorry if my writing is incoherent. I've never written this out before and I don't really know how, but I feel the need to. Every fibre of my being feels like it's screaming out to die.

Ever since I was 6, I've displayed tendencies of depression. My childhood wasn't exactly normal, but I don't think it was that bad. I feel strange talking about this so normally, but I've kind of come to terms with it at this point. All I can remember is wanting to disappear - I don't know anything different, and I have no hopes or ambitions. I do everything out of pure convenience to make my life easier so I have to do less. My whole life, I've felt as if I am trapped in a dark cloud where time is moving slowly yet all at once at the same time.

I'm 16 now, and I think that when I have to become fully responsible for myself, I will die. I procrastinate constantly and the start of every new day makes me want to cry. Death isn't really that appealing honestly - I don't want to hurt people through my suicide but sleeping forever seems to be the only way to rid myself of this responsibility. I don't want to be too selfish, I'm a shitty enough person already. In primary school the concept of time was so foreign and blurred to me that I could just stare at a wall or sleep to do it, but everyone wants too much from me now. 
Procrastinating used to make me feel better as it put my mind off how shit I felt, but not anymore. I thought that not being sad was happiness, but it's really not, it's just indifference. If I lived a life where all I had to do was sleep, that would be heaven. I do want to be responsible for myself, but the very idea of work makes me break down and lose all energy. I guess I've given up.

I suppose it's a little bit beside the point, but I've started starving myself too. Not completely on purpose, sometimes I do it because emptiness gives me something to feel, but sometimes it's just because I just don't have the energy to eat. I don't think I have an eating disorder though, because there's no real reason behind it, I could probably stop at any time if I wanted to. I mean, I displayed similar actions as a kid as I'd eat 5 chocolate bars at once just for the hole it seemed to fill and I guess I still get the tendencies but I stopped that. I just want to feel something real again and even though I know this won't solve the problem, it makes me feel... something, at least.

I'm afraid to tell someone, not because of any possible stigma, but because of my own self-doubt. I am afraid that if I try to get help, I will be told that everything I am feeling is normal and there's nothing I can do about it because I've been forcing myself to appear normal for so long. Sometimes I wonder what would be worse - finding out there's something wrong with me or discovering I've been wrong all along. Every time I gathered up the courage to try when I was younger, all I could think about was all the adults who told me that because of my age, I couldn't understand real problems and that led to a real fear of being labelled an attention seeker. It's been 10 years since this started but I still feel like I'm stuck in the same place I was then, and I haven't advanced at all. At 10 I barely stopped myself from stabbing myself, and I honestly don't think I'll be able to stop myself now. I wonder if I'm still in the same mindset as then, really.

Apart from telling others to try and get professional help or whatever, it's not like I haven't tried to fix this. I've tried lots of methods but none of them seem to work. I just don't have the energy or patience. 

This was a bad idea to write. I feel worse than I did before now I've thought about this more, as if I'm just wallowing in self-pity. I'm sorry if you read this far, because I really don't think I'm strong enough to help myself.
