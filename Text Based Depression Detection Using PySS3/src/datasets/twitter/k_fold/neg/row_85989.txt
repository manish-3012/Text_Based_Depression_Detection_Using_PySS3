What is this life, not worth living imo.This is like the third post I've made on here and it seems I'm just too much a little bitch to go through with it - or maybe I feel like there might be something holding on to. I'm graduating, with two honor chords in less than a month. I have a boyfriend, that I think is good and complimentary to me. Scratch that, he is. 

But hey, then again. I thought that of my last boyfriend who ended up beating the shit out of me and that's still an ongoing case. I'm bipolar, I'm on medicine. I have severe anxiety (to the point where I stutter) and I'm on medication. I don't like being heavily medicated, so I try and go without sometimes. My twitch and stutters get worse and I can see how awkward it makes people feel. Well that's rambling.

Anyhow. I'm pretty religious about taking my medication for mood stabilizing three times a day. But I can't stop hating myself, hating my life, hating my body. I disappoint everyone around me and I'm a waste of space.

Honestly, all I want to do is to move to a place where assisted suicide isn't illegal. I didn't choose to live here, and right now - most of the time - I would choose not to. I don't want to anymore. I have means, I have methods, I have time, and no one would miss me if I were gone.

The fuck am I still here for.
