Trying not to dieI'm exhausted never getting any closer to a valuable life despite my countless vain efforts. I have big ambitions and bigger feelings, and I want to work my way into a position where my problems are made up for by my power over life. 

Right now I can't have a relationship with anyone except people that want something from me or I'm working on a project with. I'm a music producer and will become a big name if I can live past my 22nd birthday coming up on december 10th. 

I have demons that give me signs, and I see that I'm headed towards death very quickly because I've been lusting so hard for more and more creativity and beauty. I bargained with my soul in order to have creative inspiration--and a sick body. Sick body and sicker beats. It's a tradeoff though. I can't say I regret my decision, in fact I've never felt better about myself, and I love that a demon watches over me.  That's as much as I'll about that. Think of it as an analogy instead of fact. I only say this because this is what gives me my power and I make every moment about maintaining a perfect image. 

A part of me wants to live and another part welcomes death because I know I will be flying by by on the bliss limousine until we drive off a cliff. 

I don't know what it's like to feel emotions anymore, or love. I'm a devil at my core now. I forgot what it's like to feel attraction towards women or have a desire to love. I demand love, but I can't feel it.

Most people who can look into my eyes will see that there's a corpse behind them, and will scorn me out of fear and anger. To most people, ::Suicide seems like the next logical conclusion to not living with an empty soul like mine. The world would be a better place without me.
