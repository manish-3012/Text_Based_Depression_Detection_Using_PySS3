Am I just weakAll Americans and others with an excessive access to firearms and hard drugs, how tf are u alive? I feel like the only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I'm too f'ing weak too do anything about it. So many times I've ended up in jail, forcefully admitted to psyche wards, stitched up in intensive care, and still I'm here. I just want an out but I'm too f'ing afraid of failing at this point. I don't want to traumatize anyone.
