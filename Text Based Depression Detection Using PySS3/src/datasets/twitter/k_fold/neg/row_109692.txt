This ever present suicidal ideation is a constant weight on my shoulders. Help isn't coming quick enough just because i don't really want to die...I don't take any depression medication or anything like that so that might be partly to blame but still even if i went to my GP and got suitable antidepressants for suicidal ideation then what? I have to embrace that unfamiliar path rather than my already very familiar path of half and half suicidal ideation? Half passive suicidal thoughts and half intense almost active suicidal thoughts? I am tired right now and yet this is when it is all at a manageable enough level with the passive suicidal thoughts and the depressive mood...

I just don't know what i want guys in anything in my current life really. I sorta feel like i am stuck in the middle seeking help as i never feel very ready for change due to various reasons such as my autism and when i seek what i am comfortable with, i can't seen to get it before i deteriorate and i am back at square one...

Everything i do different from what i usually do hardly ever works out so will antidepressants really be an assistance to me in this crap? Sometimes i feel i am much too weird for mood stabilising things (i think antidepressants are seen as mood stabilisers but i might be wrong :P) to be helpful even if i find the right one/s for me.

A big part of me wants to wait for an assessment session from one of the 2 talking therapy waiting lists i am on before i try out antidepressants but then that same part of me feels like its my fault i keep feeling this way since i don't take what is offered to me (in this case drugs).

**Oh by the way you can read this for more on my life and/or if you like how i write when i post on Reddit:** https://www.wattpad.com/546209549-sigh-6-months-in-the-life-of-a-sucker-suffering-of (by the way this link is for my most recent update which is part 18 of my journal/rant compilation).

Honestly though i am unable to be helped as i can't even help myself... So yea read my rants/writings on wattpad if you feel like it, i kinda want someone to comment on my writings but i think the subject of it all is a bit heavy to encourage someone to do that :P
