Losing MotivationI donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve had issues in the past with procrastinating school work and even failed a year because of it. I thought I was over that period and actually enjoyed school my sophomore year. Iâ€™m now a junior and having to take double math classes to make up for my freshmen year failures on top of 5 other hard classes. I used to love doing school last year and I loved the feeling of accomplishment it gave me. Now I just work all day and end the day feeling disappointed because I feel I didnâ€™t get enough done. Itâ€™s making it to where I just canâ€™t anymore. And Iâ€™m scared because I donâ€™t want another repeat of freshmen year but I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve told my parents about my anxiety, depression, loneliness etc and we were supposed to start looking for me a therapist and medicine but a family emergency came up on my moms side and she had to leave to go to a different state and is stressed and I feel bad bringing it up now. I just donâ€™t know what to do. I feel like Iâ€™m about my breaking point which Iâ€™ve told people and they just fed me the â€œwere get it figured out lineâ€ but Iâ€™m a ticking clock running out of time and I donâ€™t think they really grasp that. I wanted to be on good medicine to help my anxiety before midterms really started but that doesnâ€™t seem like itâ€™s gonna happen. I still have so much school work due today but it feels like thereâ€™s weights on my limbs. Everyoneâ€™s whoâ€™s here is asleep and probably tired of my shit anyway and I feel I have no one to talk to or distract myself with and I feel like giving up. Iâ€™m tired.
