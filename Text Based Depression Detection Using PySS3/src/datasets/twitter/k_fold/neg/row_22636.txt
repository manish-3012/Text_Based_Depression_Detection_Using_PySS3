Shit sucksI really canâ€™t remember a time in my life where I was depressed. I acknowledged the possibility of suicide at age 6 when the person who sexually abused me mentioned that he could end my life with some incredibly easy to obtain items. Iâ€™ve struggled with the idea since. 
My entire childhood was abusive, as an adolescent my father died from an OD, mother was addicted to pills and just wasnâ€™t there, the city I grew up in was rough to say the least. 
Around age 11 I started doing risky shit I wonâ€™t mention specifically here with the hope that I wouldnâ€™t wake up, by age 13 I was doing those things literally every night with the same hope. Along the way I am positive I have caused some brain damage as I am just 300% dumber than I was. 
Went from that star student with every college on deck to a 5th year college senior who is on a â€œbreakâ€ and has been for a year. Donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be able to handle going back but I really really want to. 
Had a miscarriage two days before Christmas. I wanted that baby more than anything I could even try to imagine and it was just ripped from me. Unsure if Iâ€™ll ever be able to carry a baby to term now. 
I havenâ€™t been to work since June. Got hurt at work and need surgery before I can return. I am in constant pain and the doctors are taking fucking forever to get everything sorted out. I do nothing all day long. Canâ€™t even clean the house because I am either too depressed or too lazy and I canâ€™t really figure out which. 
I have lost literally every friend Iâ€™ve ever had. For a long time I did that shit where i blamed everyone else but today, after being ghosted by the fourth person in the last 6 days, I realized that I am the fucking problem. 

I have always wanted to die but I have also always seen SOME type of â€œlightâ€ at the end. I see nothing now. I am 23 years old and I am struggling not to self harm like Iâ€™m fucking 12 years old. I am pathetic and I donâ€™t think I have ever wanted to die as badly as I do right now.
