I'm lonelyIâ€™m lonely. Iâ€™ve desperately wanted to be in love my whole life, and I was, but I blew it, and she turned out to be a lying cunt. About a week after she dumped me, she decided to, in a depressed and probably inebriated state, tell me how everything in our relationship was a lie for the last several months, and how it was my fault. Granted, the relationship was awful, but I couldnâ€™t handle her telling me that at the time, so I turned off my phone. When I turned it back on, I had no less than eight messages from her, confessing every lie, things she knew would have ended the relationship if I ever found out. She knew the thing I cared about most in a relationship was honesty. Apparently she didnâ€™t feel the same.

She told me about her plan to kill herself, she had even written a note the night after her birthday, which was one of the best days we spent together. I loved her. I wanted to die. I wanted her to jump off that overpass with me, so I could die with her, like Iâ€™d always assumed I would. The overpass was her idea. She told me it was how she planned to kill herself.

I havenâ€™t actually attempted suicide, but Iâ€™ve thought about it a lot, even planned it several times. I know exactly how I want to do it. The only reason I havenâ€™t yet is that I couldnâ€™t imagine my mom or sister finding me hanging from my closet. I donâ€™t have a problem with the idea of them knowing I killed myself, or them having to live with the feeling that they could have prevented it. Itâ€™s just the thought of the shock and horror theyâ€™d feel finding me like that. I havenâ€™t found a way to make it look like an accident yet.
