They need to stop following meI know rationally nobody is going to hurt me but whether I'm at work or walking outside I get an overwhelming feeling that someone is following me and going to hurt me. It is worse at night and is really starting to limit my life. That, on top of my hallucinations that just won't go away, I'm tired. I'm so fucking tired. If I hadn't gotten sick I'd be making triple digits right now, but instead I'm looking at disability. I lie to my parents and tell them I'm alright but I'm really not. I've tried so many treatment options, been hospitalized so many times, I have a great team and I work hard to have a healthy lifestyle but it is never enough. I just want my brain to stop playing tricks on me. I get suicidal urges even when I'm not actively suicidal. I'm just really starting to lose hope.
