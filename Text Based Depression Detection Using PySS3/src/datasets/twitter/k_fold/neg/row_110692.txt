I need helpI find myself thinking nearly every day, "Kill yourself."  It happens when I say stupid things and think about them later.  It happens when I think about past mistakes.  It happens when I wake up in the morning.

I have a job, a wife, a house, and otherwise am doing well in life.  Better than most, but it feels hollow.  I am not happy and don't know how to be anymore.  I don't seem to get much enjoyment out of anything.  Nothing excites me or draws me in.  The future is bleak and I don't even know what I'm moving toward anymore.    I'm afraid eventually I'm going to put a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger.  

I just don't know how to be happy anymore.  What is the point of living if you aren't happy?
