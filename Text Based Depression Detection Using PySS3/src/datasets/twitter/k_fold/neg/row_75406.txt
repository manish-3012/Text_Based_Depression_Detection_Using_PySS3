I Wish I Would Have Died Instead of Going to the ERI was stupid while making dinner and cut my finger. It was bleeding really bad but I wrapped it up and went to work. I went to work and the bandages got dirty. I went to change them and it started bleeding again, just as bad as before. I wanted to get it stitched up the first time but I knew I had shitty insurance and that it would be super expensive. My boss recommended that I go to the urgent care when she saw my wound but I reminded her it was closed (night shift) so she told me I should go to the ER instead. They all seemed supportive there in thinking it was a pretty serious cut and I got four stitches and a tetanus shot.

Now itâ€™s weeks later and the cut has healed really nicely but the bills are rolling in. $2000 for the ER. $600 for the ER doctor. $200 for the follow up visit. This is after my insurance, before it was almost $6000.

I make a good amount of money but Iâ€™m also drowning in debt from an irresponsible time in college. Iâ€™ve been working really hard to pay my debt down and get out of it and in one day I set myself back to square one and then some.

Whatâ€™s the point of even trying? Iâ€™m not even enjoying my life while Iâ€™m trying to pay off my bills. This is all fucking pointless.
