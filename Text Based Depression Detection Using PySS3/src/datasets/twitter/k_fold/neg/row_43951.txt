I have an idea.I know lots of people feel like "foreveralone" myself included. I think for many people like myself, it's difficult when we're alone...but many of us... (depressed/suicidal folks) have anexity problems...or just seem to be down on their luck with making friends...or maybe their in a new situation and are just having a rough go with it....

so my idea is this:
(I don't know how this will be received I'm just suggesting)
What if we had like a friend4friend program or subreddit...or on this subreddit...
where people who are depressed can find other people to talk to via skype, or msn to keep them minimal company. 
I mean I know there are other ways to find people to chat...but what I'm saying is a way to find people who are also depressed (because they can understand or they don't mind if you are) or just people who don't mind talking to someone that is depressed.
Like people can unite in their rough times.

I don't know..I'm just personally having a really rough go at it...and it's just hard pretending that I'm happy all the time, you know? I'd love it if I could just hang with someone that would be ok with me being sad...and we could share stories and cheer each other up...

Would anyone be interested in this?
I'm sorry if it's a bad idea...or if this is the wrong place to post this...

EDIT: Well for now...um if you'd like to talk to me! Please go ahead and send me your MSN or Skype. Maybe I can work out some sort of chat room? Maybe I can pair people up? (I wouldn't mind that) Or we can just post s4df=searching for depression friend on our own. OR!! You can just post your addies here! Let me know what you think would work!

EDIT 2: Also maybe we can team up with /r/depression

EDIT 3: So I think we should just try to work this into /r/suicidewatch and /r/depression and if there is a problem I'll make a subreddit. So I guess the terms we could use would be **s4lmc= searching for like minded companion**. We'll assume it's mostly online unless the person says otherwise. I'll try posting with this in a minute and I guess we'll see how it goes! All of you please feel free to pm me as well.

**EDIT 4**: Not sure if anyone is around but a new subreddit has been created. [/r/hardshipmates](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardshipmates)
