My only goal in life is to kill myselfThat's it! I'm not longing for friends/a partner/a career anymore. I'm not able to make meaningful connections with anyone because (as cliche as it sounds) nobody understands how i feel; I'm tired of surface level bullshit. And no I dont start talking about how depressed i am as soon as i meet someone new.
I'm not planning to work my ass off and find a better job like yeah I can fill my emotional void with material things but that satisfactory feeling doesnt last that long anyway, I can survive with my current salary and that's all that matters to me.
I've been through enough trauma and abuse I'm not curious about what life has to offer anymore if the price i'll have to pay is even more suffering I dont wanna deal with my depression and chronic illness that puts me in pain almost every single day anymore.
I have no sense of purpose or dreams besides dying that's the only way out for me
