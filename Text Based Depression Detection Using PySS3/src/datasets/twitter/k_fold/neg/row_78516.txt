It hurtsI wish I didnt exist. Peace. I was brought here coz two humans were horny and wanted happiness for themselves in the form of a family. Brought here just to suffer and hurt and get false hope and suffer again...I hate life. From my core. Its been 6 years. Tired. Of. This. Shit. Fucking depressing and boring.
