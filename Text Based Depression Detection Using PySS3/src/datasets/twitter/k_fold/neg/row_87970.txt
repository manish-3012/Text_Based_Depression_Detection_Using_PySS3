I miss my old life. It's broken and I want it over.Sitting here looking at the house, all the pictures, all the trinkets and memories.  A life we built together, the moments.  She says they aren't good memories anymore.  I always thought they were. "What was so great about you that I had to be miserable for 18 years?". That's what she says to me.  I always thought we were happy.  I was.  I thought she was, too.

I know she'd already be gone if not for the money of it all.  Eventually that wont matter.

I'll make it better, though.  I cant do this alone, I'm too old and too tired and too afraid.  I want my life back but I know I'll never get that.  I cant start over, not at my age.  I'll make it better.  I'll be gone and she'll have my life insurance and sell the house and have a better life.  One free of me and this place.  I'll die knowing I did the best thing I could, the only thing I could, for the person I love.  

I just miss my old life so bad.  Her laugh, the dog running around the house, walking down the street together, just us being us and living our life.  But that's all gone.  It'll never come back and I can't move forward.  There's nowhere to move to.  I just want to be done with this.  I'm tired of being sad and afraid all the time.
