I wish I could just slip awayI'm really sorry if this isn't the right forum - but I just needed to let it out, even on a keyboard. I feel so inadequate, such a waste of resources and an annoying, useless burden. I feel stupid all the time, and then feel selfish and guilty and vain because there are people situations far, far worse than me. All I would love, is to sleep and never wake up - or maybe hire a hitman so my family wouldn't think it was intentional. But I'm too scared to go through it, and then I feel even more selfish and vain. I really don't know what to do, I feel like my brain is eating at itself.
