Here to Help!Hey guys! 
It may not be much, but Iâ€™ve been in this position before. I have dealt and struggled with severe anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. If ANY of you need to talk, PLEASE PM me and I will send you my cell phone number. Youâ€™re more than welcome to text me. I have recovered and although Iâ€™m not here to tell you how to â€œfixâ€ any of your feelings, I do know the importance of having someone to talk to, especially someone with a completely unbiased opinion. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Thatâ€™s the one thing here I can ASSURE you. Texts only, so I can respond to as many people as I can who are willing to talk. Itâ€™s confidential of course. I am not a professional, but I do come from a social work background.
Just remember, life is one minute at a time. Iâ€™m here.
