The best thing I can do for the people I love is dieSo i'm planning to end my life on the brooklyn bridge on sunday. Dying will be my ultimate "I love you" to them. They won't have to deal with my consistent and pressing depression. No more spending money feeding me or providing a place to live. After the initial shock of my dying, they'll realize that it was for the best and not having to drag my deadweight around is a net positive.
