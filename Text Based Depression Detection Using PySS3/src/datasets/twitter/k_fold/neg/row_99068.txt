I can barely hold on to life anymoreI am no longer fighting my suicidal thoughts, I am considering putting my plan into action but I'm holding on, barely. It's not safe for me to be alone anymore. I don't even know why I'm writing this like it matters I'm sure everyone would be happier with me gone. I'm seriously considering ending it. I grew up getting abused and bullied. Someone has branded their name into my skin with a knife. I've been suffocated, I've been electrocuted, cut, burned, everything. I am 15 and have been self harming since middle school. I recently went in patient for being suicidal and am now in out patient therapy. I suffer from severe anxiety and depression and I even see things that aren't real.

 I'm convinced I am going crazy. I absolutely hate myself. I don't even care if anyone believes me know one in my real life is going to know. It doesn't matter. My life doesn't matter. I cut my arms up today and light cuts on my wrists with glass from a window my brother broke. I am barely holding on. My flashbacks keep getting worse. I don't want to talk about all of my trauma because thinking about its just unbearable. So please don't ask I can't live through it again. I've been isolating myself from friends and family. I feel so alone. I just want to stop hurting them. I suppose this is a last ditch cry for help. 

These flashbacks have only been getting worse and I just get live with them anymore. I don't even know how to describe it. It's like its constantly there, looming. Sometimes they happen for seemingly no reason. I've already made the suicide note. I'm tired of crying. I just want to have some peace. But part of me thinks I deserve to just continue and suffer. I am torn.
