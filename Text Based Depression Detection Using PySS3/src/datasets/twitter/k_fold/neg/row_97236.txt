I give myself until my 21st birthdayIâ€™ve constantly dealt with suicide with the majority parts of my later years. I tried it once but sadly wasnâ€™t able to actually die. So in light of living a life suffocated by this feeling Iâ€™ve decided that if I am not able to shake these idealizations and achieve happiness by October 29, 2019 I will make sure that I die. This isnâ€™t really a post that requires condolences or anything as itâ€™s more for myself then anyone else but if you read this thanks and hey donâ€™t be sad for me I hope that Iâ€™m able to live but if not itâ€™s ok thereâ€™re probably millions of people in worse off situations than me so this is really my fault and if Iâ€™m not able to find happiness thatâ€™s also on me.
