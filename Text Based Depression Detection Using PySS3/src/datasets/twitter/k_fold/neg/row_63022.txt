Got diagnosed with cancer, too young &amp; weak for this, just want to dieDon't feel like I'm a normal person anymore.

&amp;nbsp; 

Future is pretty much robbed from me.

&amp;nbsp; 

Chemotherapy is too torturing. Even if I make it till the end, can't live like a normal person anymore (e.g. those who've had cancers are more likely to get more cancers in the future compared to those who haven't).

&amp;nbsp; 

Wish I could die painlessly some way, and if possible, start over life (a more normal life).
