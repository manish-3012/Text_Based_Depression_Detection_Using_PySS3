I feel disgustingIâ€™m not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I really needed to vent.

My parentsâ€™ relationship is complicated. Theyâ€™re not divorced, but theyâ€™re separated. Romantically and physically. My dad lives in another country with my siblings and I live with my mom and little sister. My parents relationship wasnâ€™t the healthiest. I remember them fighting ever since I was little.
Iâ€™ve noticed that my mom has been seeing other men. I want to tell my dad since he deserves to know, but at the same time, Iâ€™m scared. I want to keep quiet to protect my mom from his wrath. Either way, I feel like a disgusting traitor.

I isolate myself from people for reasons I donâ€™t completely understand myself. I hate how she thinks Iâ€™m incompetent and naive. I hate how he is ignorant and harsh towards my mental health. I want to scream and yell at them for making grow up with such pain. I feel like a burden. I feel like itâ€™s my fault that theyâ€™re like this. I hate myself for caring, I hate them for giving me a life I never wanted. Itâ€™s emotionally stressful. I just want to end it all.
