I'm fixing a dateI'm fixing a date to end this all. September 25. Exactly one month. In one month, I will dress up as a bride (since I always wanted to get married), overdose on barbiturates and go to sleep forever.

This one month I'm going to spend my life in a happy way. I'm going to watch all the movies i want, I am going to make a closure basket for the few people who care about me. Letters, mementos, Live castings, audio clippings of me singing, video recordings of me doing happy things because its going to be hard for them to go through it.

It's strangely liberating.
