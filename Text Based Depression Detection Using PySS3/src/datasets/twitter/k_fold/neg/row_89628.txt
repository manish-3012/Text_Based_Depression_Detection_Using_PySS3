Iâ€™m happy for my parents for having a kid that they wanted, but I wish I was never born.I just hate everything about myself and everyday it gets worse and worse. Iâ€™m so tried of being alive. I wish I was fucking normal. Iâ€™ve lost all motivation to do anything like school or even working out. Iâ€™m always nice to everyone and respectful but no one does the same for me. Iâ€™m so tired of everything. I want to be gone and donâ€™t ever want to come back.
