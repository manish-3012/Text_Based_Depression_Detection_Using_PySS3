Wife told me she resents me and the childrenSo, I'm working third shift temporarily so we can train a new person to take over third permanently. I sleep quite a bit during the day and my wife doesn't seem to understand that third shift sucks. We haven't been getting along that well lately. Yesterday at 4:28 pm she sends me a text telling me she resents me and the children. I didn't see this until after 11 pm when I got in to the office. She said she isn't leaving, and she does love me. Why the fuck does someone stay around when they resent everyone in the house??! GODDAMMIT! I fuck everything up. Give me time and I can fuck anything up. We've got 4 children. The oldest two are mine from a previous relationship, and the youngest two are ours together. If she does leave, she'll go to Texas. We live in the northern states, and I don't even know how I would handle losing my babies. If I had a gun I'd make the bitch watch me die. I'm so fed up with this shit. She sits on her ass all day when she isn't driving the babysitting kids around. I work, do dishes, do laundry, clean. I'm not good at the last two, and she jumps on me for not having the house spotless or all of the laundry done. Oh by the way, she has told me MANY MANY times before that she would fold the laundry. Guess what never gets done. Then she screams at me because its not done. I ask her for help, she says she'll help, and never does. I guess I just want to vent. I'm so lost. I think I'll start sleeping on the couch so I don't bother her.
