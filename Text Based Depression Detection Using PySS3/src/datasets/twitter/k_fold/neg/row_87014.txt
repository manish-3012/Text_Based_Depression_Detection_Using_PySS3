I think I'm going to kill myself tonight.I'm feeling REALLY bad atm. Have been for the past few years, but tonight I'm feeling the shittiest I have ever been. I have nobody who cares about me, except 4 friends. I dont trust 2 of them anymore and I cant talk to the other 2 about my problems because they just wouldnt understand. I just want someone to talk to for a moment because I'm considering suicide right now. Please, I'm desperate.
