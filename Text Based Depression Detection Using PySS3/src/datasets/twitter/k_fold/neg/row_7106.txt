Today I decided that nothing is worth living for  my mom has been gone for almost two years and I don't know what to do I can't cry I can do anything I feel so num my brain and heart still believe she's still alive when I know she's gone I'm wanting to go back to the hospital but people think it's something else wrong no its my meds I want to die I want to cut till I can't cut anymore what's something that I can do because right now there's nothing because I live in a damn homeless shelter at m trying to save up money and I can't do anything please 
JUST LET ME DIE!!
