This year I fell in loveHe's the kindest, warmest, most wonderful and amazing person I've ever met. He defied my preference for women, and my feelings for him have overtaken all else that exists in my life, with a strength unlike any love I have felt before. I gave my first kiss to him. My first date. He was to be my first for many other things.. and he felt similarly. Though he was never quite sure if he was in-love with me, he claimed to harbor strong romantic feelings. He is the only person I have ever been able to envision myself building a life with.. 

I never wanted those things before him. 
He is everything to me. I can't help it. 

Recently, something tragic occurred in his life and..he became emotionally numb. Rather than it drawing us closer, he now says he doesn't know if he still loves me as more than a friend. He has suggested that..he may never feel the same again. I believe him. He believes that no matter what happens, we will be friends to the end. 

He doesn't understand how far gone I am.

Rather than suffer through the inevitable pain of loving unrequited, I choose death. 

Death over being alone.

I'm sorry. I want him to know that I'm sorry I'm not strong enough. That I'm so selfish. That even now I think only of myself. 

But the pain is unbearable. I don't want to live anymore:
