Nothing makes me happyI'm not sure what the fuck I'm supposed to do at this point, any achievements I've done and I feel numb, going on holiday and I feel numb, talking to friends and I feel numb, walking and I feel numb, see something super rare and I feel numb.

Nothing makes me happy, every professional I've been to hasn't been able to help at all, I try every suggestion people give and I still feel numb, at least when I cut myself I feel something for once, what's the point?
