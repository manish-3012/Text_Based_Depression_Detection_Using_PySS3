I feel suicidal because I can't afford stuff I need or want. Why continue living?I am a 22 year old, still works in retail, have $1k in savings, and no debts. However I don't have any retirement savings yet. I would need to go to college for four years to get a degree that would give me a marketable skill or do a trade but I don't feel comfortable doing dangerous Jobs. I feel like I can't afford to travel the world, buy a new car, buy a new computer, buy new clothes, and still have emergency &amp; retirement funds. 

Why continue living this miserable life? Does anyone have advice that would get me out of this situation?
