I don't know what to doI'm so overwhelmed.


 I'm a college student living at my parent's hoe with 2 jobs but I still make almost nothing. I'm always broke, all the time.


 I have no friends, and the ones I used to have completely forgot about me.


 I have almost no relationship with my family anymore. They all just seem to not care or never make an effort to be apart of my life, but are eager to demand things of menor criticize me. 


 I have a really wonderful girlfriend, but I fear that I'm being left behind and that she's losing feelings for me, since shes now a few hours away at her college. She's older and her life seems to keep advancing and she always has something to do with friends or at the club, but I don't.


I don't know what to do with myself. I'm always tired. I'm always lonely. I've gained back almost all the weight I've lost, and I feel like I'm addicted to porn. I can't control my habits anymore.



I have no direction or desire anymore
