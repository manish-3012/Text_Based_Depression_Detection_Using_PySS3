It's not fair at all.I'm sitting here crying after puking my guts out from getting hammered after work. Work was fine. Nothing happened. But I think I'm starting to actually resent one of my friends because she's completely happy being with her boyfriend.

Why the fuck can't I have that? Was it so hard to just get the right mix of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine? I used to believe in God, but why would he make this shit a thing. Why is depression a thing. We're supposed to love our lives, we're always told that life is precious, but why is it precious? What the fuck is enjoyable about this piece of shit? Why can't I feel fucking happy playing in a band, working out, hanging out with friends, playing video games, eating good food, singing. Just fucking why?

It's not fucking fair and I hate it. Is there even a chance that I'll be better? Some day will I ever actually be happy, or am I going to wrestle with the thoughts of ending my life for the rest of my life? If I don't get better, why am I even bothering with this?? What kind of life is that if you constantly want to end it?

I'm going to therapy and taking antidepressants, but it doesn't seem to be helping at all. I just want to die, and no one seems to understand that.
