Iâ€™m Having a Severe BreakdownIâ€™m in the middle of a severe breakdown right now. I really would like someone to talk to. My nerves are shot and I canâ€™t stop shaking and Iâ€™m sobbing. A couple weeks ago I had a suicide attempt and went to the hospital and I recently saw a therapist but right now I feel like pure shit. Please help .
