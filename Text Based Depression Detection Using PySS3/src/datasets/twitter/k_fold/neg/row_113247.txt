My life is turning to shit and I'm becoming bitter.I'm just jealous of everyone's perfect life and I keep telling myself why did this happen to us. My dad's dying, my moms was diagnosed with breast cancer. I think about my friend who has everything and ends up being such an ungrateful person. I have to pitch in on what any 19 year old with a stupid seasonal job has and its very little. I just want to end it. I don't go to school although i want to so i literally have nothing to lose so i if i do it now I won't have to wait until everything just decides to fall on top of me. FML.
