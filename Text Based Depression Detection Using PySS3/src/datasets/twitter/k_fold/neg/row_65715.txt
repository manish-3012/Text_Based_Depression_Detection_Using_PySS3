What's the Point?I just want to know what the point of life is if you are terrible in every aspect of being a human being. I know I'll never experience love. I'll never be good at something. I'll never have real friends. I'll never get to experience wonderful places. So what's the point in living? Wouldn't it just be easier to shoot myself and get it over with?
