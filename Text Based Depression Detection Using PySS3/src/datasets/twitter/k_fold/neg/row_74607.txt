I'm getting a help.I got depressed since moving into parent's house, plus missing someone I loved from suicide made it even worse. I've been thinking about killing myself so I can be with him, this emptiness is killing me.

I'm fed up with my life but I'm trying to keep on living for him. 

Fuck with all their judgements, I'm getting a help.
