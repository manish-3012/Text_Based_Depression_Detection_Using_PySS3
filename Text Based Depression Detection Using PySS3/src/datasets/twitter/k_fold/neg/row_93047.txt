I can't handle realityI don't know why I'm writing this. I've never had such a low point in my life. Every day I have countless thoughts on how I want to kill myself, why I want to kill myself. I just want to silence my thoughts. All I ever want to do is sleep because I don't have to face the truth of the situation I'm in. I'm constantly lying to myself. 

The only reason I don't put a rope around my neck is because the first woman I've ever loved left me, And it would break her heart if she thought she was responsible for it. I can't do that to her. I'm constantly lying to myself. Telling myself my relationship with her isn't over and she'll come over tomorrow and everything will be okay. When I met her I was in such a dark place and she pulled me out of it but I put her on a pedestal and convinced myself she was the only thing making me happy. And I still believe that. 

Nothing in this life truly matters. It's all just chemistry and biology and none of it happens for a reason, none of it means anything. I just don't see the point of trying so hard to keep going.
