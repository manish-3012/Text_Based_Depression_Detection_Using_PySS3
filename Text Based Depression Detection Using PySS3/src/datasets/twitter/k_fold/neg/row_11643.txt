It's bad but it gets worstI'm becoming numb to the feeling of sadness I've stopped crying every night and have just been at a state of constant anxiety. Unsure where to go or what to do it seems nothing will get better. I feel unsupported and alone. I wish I had a friend. Someone I could just go over to their house and hang out. I don't have anyone. I feel alone. It feels like I'll always be alone. I feel trapped in my own head. Reddit doesn't even support me. Every small thing pushes me over the edge because of how unstable I am right now. A game doesn't go right I freak out, someone says something negative on Reddit I freak out, I don't have anyone to talk to and when I reach out and receive a red hand it feels like more reason to stop trying. I don't know what to do anymore. Everytime I post it's worst but I feel like I'm saying the same things. I make different accounts worried someone will figure out who I am but what does it matter. No one cares anyway. I could go on my main and proclaim I'm going to kill myself right now and no one I know would care, they probably would never see it. If I posted on my family Facebook they probably wouldn't care. I wish I had parents. I wish I had a family. I feel I haven't grown up and I don't know how. I wish I had soemoen to guide me but I never have and never will. I'm alone in my efforts and I wonder if it will ever be worth it
