it's all gone./ninja no one cares. i don't even deserve to rant. sorry to waste space.

Edit: Wow, you guys are really awesome. Seriously. I attempted an overdose last night and woke up throwing up violently. It's about thirteen hours later and I still feel sort of dizzy and such, but I'm staying hydrated. I researched the toxicity levels this morning and basically found out that what I took won't do anything more than this. I'll be laying low for the next few days until my eval with another hospital.

I really appreciate it, Reddit.
