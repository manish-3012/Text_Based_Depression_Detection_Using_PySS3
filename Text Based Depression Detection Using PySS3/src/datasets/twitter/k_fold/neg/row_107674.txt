Id rather be found dying than ask for helpYeah so I'd rather my family found me probably bleeding to death than tell them I don't want to be alive anymore. I guess I'm scared of being vulnerable and open and then not getting taken seriously. It's not that I don't think they'd be supportive and get me help but anxiety is a bitch. I just think they'll think it's a phase becasue I'm the typical afab teenager.

I'm struggling I get big mood swings from sad and unmotivated to angry to over working myself and stressing about school. I'm the top of the class but everyone thinks it's easy for me it's not I can't sleep nights before even small tests. Recently I don't even care about school anymore I just want it to be over. I have nothing and I mean nothing to be sad about like I just over think and get anxious. 

I don't know who I am any more. I don't want to be anything. I just want peace. I cut and it helps but it shows me how easy it would be to just go. 

I havnt been myself for awhile hiding my feelings from everyone. So like I think I'm non binary and I'm struggling to accept myself and see why I should care I don't deserve to be this much of a hassle to my family. I also don't wanna be a burden to them. 

I don't deserve the air I breath or food I eat and yet I have it and am so ungrateful I just wish it to be over. As bad as it seems I just want to die and even if it fails atleast my family will take me seriously. Yeah so am I alone? Kinda feel pathetic not being able to talk to people.
