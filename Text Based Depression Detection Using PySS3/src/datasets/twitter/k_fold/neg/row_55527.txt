The View From Halfway DownThe weak breeze whispers nothing.

The water screams magnificence.

Her feet shift on uneven and unsteady ground

deep breaths, stand back, itâ€™s time.

Her toes overlap the edge

and soon sheâ€™s water bound.

Eyes locked shut but peak to see

the view from halfway down.

A little wind, a cold sun,

a river lavish and opulent,

a flood of fond endorphins

brings a calm that knows no equal.

Youâ€™re flying now,

you see things much more clear than from the ground.

Itâ€™s all ok now, or it would be

were you not halfway down.

Flounder from gravity

for what now could slow the drop?

Oh, all I would give for toes to touch

the safety of lurking over the edge on top.

But this is it, the exploit is no more and forgotten.

Silence drowns the sound.

Before I relinquished my stand on the edge, I shouldâ€™ve seen

the view from halfway down.

I shouldâ€™ve pondered about

the view from halfway down.

I wish I couldâ€™ve known about

the view from halfway down.

Thereâ€™s no going back after you see

the view from halfway down.
