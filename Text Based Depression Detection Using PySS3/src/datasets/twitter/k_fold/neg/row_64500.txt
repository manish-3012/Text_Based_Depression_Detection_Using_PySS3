feel.Nobody fucking understand, how long I've been feeling this. Ive been keeping this all to myself for years now. The things that I know is true but no im "over thinking" or "over reacting". I deserve to be dead straight up. Idgaf, it's the truth. Friends are overrated ass hell. Family is fake &amp; will always talk shit behind your back. I've been dead for a long time. But nah it's all bullshit. Which piss me off. I literally can't think of one single thing. I feel like I can't even feel anymore, but just angrier.  Fuck it, I'm ending it.
