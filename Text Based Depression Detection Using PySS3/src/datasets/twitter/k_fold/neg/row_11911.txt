I'm not enough. I'm never enough.I'm always second rate. My friend who moved in? My parents, sibling, and niece enjoy him more than myself. He gets all of the social attraction and I'm left alone even while I'm surrounded by a sea of souls. I thought I still had academia but that ship has sailed and went over the edge already. Another friend scored 4 points higher on his ACT and it's the talk of my school. I only have music left. My lone island. My only refuge. But it has recently come under siege. I feel like I have nothing else. I feel like I have nothing to lose if I end it here. I don't understand what's wrong with me. Why did I have to be born broken and scarred? Why did I have to be born? I'm just a waste of space. I'm second to all; even myself.
