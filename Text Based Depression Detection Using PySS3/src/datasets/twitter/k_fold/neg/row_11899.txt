I've never wanted to die as much as I do right nowI'm been suicidal for just over 6 years now and I think I have finally reached my breaking point. Currently next to me I have a half full bottle of Benadryl, a full bottle of advil, and some kind of anti-biotic I took from my bathroom cabinet. Right now my intention is to just take all of it and wait for my body to fail me... I've been to counseling and it just makes me feel worse. I feel like my life has been a pointless waste of time. I don't even know how I've made it this far. I've gone through so many just fucked up situations and have no one to talk to anymore. That's why I turned to reddit. Is there any kind of hope for me? or am I just better off dead?

EDIT        To everyone who read my post and left me a reply I just want to say thank you for all your kind words. I made me feel good to see that there are people out there whom I don't even know that believe in me and don't want me to give up.. I called one of the mental health clinics here in my town and they found a psychologist who will see me for a reduced fee. I never would have taken that step if it wasn't for you guys. You all helped save my life and helped me to see that even though times are hard on me right now, I still have so much to live for. If anyone still wants to talk to me feel more than welcome to send me a PM. 
Thank you for being in my corner when no one else was redditors, I wouldn't be here right now if it wasn't for all of you.
