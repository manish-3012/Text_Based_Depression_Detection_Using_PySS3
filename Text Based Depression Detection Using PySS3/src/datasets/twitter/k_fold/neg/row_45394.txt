Feeling like a prisoner in my own mind.Situation: intrusive thoughts of homicide/suicide/violence and other really not great things. Started at least 11 years ago. Usually lasts all day unless I'm asleep, drunk or massively preoccupied. I have contacted the suicide hotline and already went in for all me pre evaluation paperwork. I have an appointment on the 6th with a psychiatrist who may be able to help me.



How do I make it until then? This morning I sat on the railing of a building by my SOs house, and just waited for someone to push me. I don't want to die. I don't want to lose everything. But I have such horrible thoughts.

I love my life, and everyone in it. When I look at my partner, I see love and care and I also see hurting him or saying terrible, scary things to him. When I look at my friends I see fun and caring and memories and I also see hurting them and saying terrible, scary things to them.

I love my job but I have these intense vision like thoughts of burning down the whole building with me in it. I have these vision thoughts about running into traffic, jumping off buildings, hurting and killing ANYONE, hurting and killing myself, doing terrible things for now reason. 

I have horrible headaches, can't sleep, can't eat. My SO and I have had numerous break up talks because of this, my family has cut contact with me out of fear in the past, my boss has told me I am on thin ice.

I don't know what to do. I have never acted on anything regarding this in the past except for a few suicide attempts.
I don't want to hurt anyone. I want a normal life finally.

How do I make it until they can fix me?

I need help. From anyone. I need anything. I don't want to hurt anyone.
