Release                                                                                                                                           I've been contemplating suicide the past few days. Looking back on my life, I've realized that I can't remember a happy memory. Every single day feels less real than the previous. I can't avoid feeling how hollow everyone around me is. There's just this soulless, empty notion about all of my friends. I don't have family. I used to think that I would find meaning in my life if I found love. I thought I found the perfect girl; beautiful, intelligent, successful. I even got her to like me. As it turns out, she's just as cold and empty as everybody else. 

I don't want to live like this. I've been feeling more anxious than usual and self medicating with weed and alcohol has made it worse. I've started having auditory hallucinations which have made me even more on edge than normal. Life's starting to feel like a sick illusion with opportunity and ambition hiding the true slavery of it all. 

I'm considering dousing myself in kerosene, lighting a match and letting the flames envelop me. I initially thought about jumping or overdosing but I really want to feel the wholesomeness of the heat and savor the feeling of leaving.
