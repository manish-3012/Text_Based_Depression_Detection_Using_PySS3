I donâ€™t think this world is for meThatâ€™s a stupid thing to say. I know this world isnâ€™t for me. Iâ€™ve spent twenty one years of my life trying to fit in, trying to do things the way Iâ€™m supposed to. The way that someone with a normal brain is supposed to. But my brain isnâ€™t normal. Iâ€™m not normal. Iâ€™m damaged and broken and shattered at the very core and I think Iâ€™ve finally come to terms with the fact that I wonâ€™t be able to pick up all the pieces. In fact, I donâ€™t want to pick up the pieces. 

I have no friends. No one who really cares about me. My parents will move on, my animals would be taken care of, everything would go back to normal. Iâ€™ve pushed people I care about away, and theyâ€™ve finally left. I canâ€™t blame them. Iâ€™m irreparably damaged. Trauma has shaped me into a pathetic shell of a person. Was my trauma even that bad? Or am I just.... too sensitive? Is this all because Iâ€™m too sensitive? Is this all some sick little cosmic game to see how much the universe could possibly fuck up a person before they finally snap? Because damn, it took the universe 21 long years but Iâ€™m finally at the tipping point. 


Iâ€™ve numbed myself with alcohol, drugs, self-harm, every possible thing I could think of. Iâ€™ve tried to numb myself into the person that society wants me to be. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I think Iâ€™ll just keep taking these pills until I feel like Iâ€™m floating away into outer space. Maybe Iâ€™ll find a place among the stars. Thatâ€™s all I can really hope for. Maybe things will be better up there. Or maybe itâ€™ll be empty, and Iâ€™ll just cease to exist.
