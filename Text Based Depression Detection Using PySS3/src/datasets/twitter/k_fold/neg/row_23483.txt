Iâ€™m ashamed I even have to write this nonsense. 36/M still being bullied by my younger 34/M brother, he told me i should kill my selfI love my brother and his little family to death. Weâ€™ve always had a great bond while growing up but he gets on these anger spouts out of nowhere and it pisses me off. Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression for many years, he calls me emo and I just shrug it off and forget about it. We all went away for the holiday weekend and now on the way home, heâ€™s driving and Iâ€™m in the passenger seat, while sitting in traffic out of nowhere he decides itâ€™s going to be funny to smack my phone out of my hand and then smacks me in the face. I get pissed off and try to smack him back and fail so he punches me in the side of the head so I grab the steering wheel and move it (we were sitting in traffic not moving) and he says nice you tried to kill all of us and I said no but it made you stop from acting like an idiot. So then he proceeds to call me an idiot and a piece of shit and tells me I should kill myself. Iâ€™m glad heâ€™s finally came out and said it all these years. So as soon as we get back to his house, Iâ€™m going home and cutting all ties. Dunno what else to do. I feel like shit.
