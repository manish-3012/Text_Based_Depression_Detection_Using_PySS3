I can't stop crying and it's been long enoughMy depression has finally gotten the best of me. I have always known that there was something about me that caused me to feel like I want to commit suicide but for the longest time I couldn't figure out what it was. The answer i realize now is that I cannot forget a single had thing that had ever happened to me. 

I am constantly tortured by these traumatic memories and remember them down top the smallest detail, even from 30 years ago in one case. The thing I can never forgive myself for is the amount of regrets I have about how I lived my life in my teens and 20s and early 30s. Those years were just me crying alone at night by myself with nobody to talk about it with. No girlfriend for me, friends stopped coming over once they got gfs. I'll never get those years back. Going into my forties next year i know things will not be good. I can't bear being so fucking worthless which is why I am going to kill myself tonight. There are things in my life that should be worth living for but everyone would be better off without me.

I've put myself through the pain way too long.
