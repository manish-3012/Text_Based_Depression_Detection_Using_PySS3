I can't handle this anymore.I have to be vague I've learned my lesson.

A week ago, a dear friend found a post I had made to vent about their actions from last year. This friend had angered me back then and I wanted a safe place to vent where I felt anon. and without judgements. I don't know how or why but two friends discovered this post and an onslaught of texts came to me. 

We have resorted to waiting two weeks before calling to talk about the issue but I can't get myself out of this rut. I knew I was in the wrong for making a post about this friend but I feel like they are in the wrong for taking my old post and invading my privacy. I am just scared now I don't want to go to school and I don't want to see people anymore.

texts were sent from them saying they don't need to turn our friend group against me because everyone knows how I act and I was only her friend for some time which excused the other bullshit I did. 

I didn't know my friends didn't like me like this. I feel like my 4 years have been a lie. I feel like nobody cares for me anymore and everyone would be better off without me. I can't stop crying and wishing I could go back in time and change something. I just want all the pain to go away.I want to be happy again. I'm sorry for the long post.I don't wanna be here anymore.
