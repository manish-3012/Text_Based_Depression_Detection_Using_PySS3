Iâ€™m destined for a shitty lifepeople always talk about having a path in life. for me, i can honesty only see myself being a fuckup and eventually killing myself. Iâ€™ll become a drug addict, live on the streets, go to jail for some stupid reason, and kill myself. thatâ€™s the only way i can see myself going. i have no motivation for actually doing something with my useless life and the thought of graduating school or having a career or starting a family and getting old makes me sick. life just isnâ€™t worth living for me. everything is just so pointless. iâ€™d rather be a suicidal crackhead than successful. fuck that. most of the â€˜successful peopleâ€™ arenâ€™t even happy anyway.
