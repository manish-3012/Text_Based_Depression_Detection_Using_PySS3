Yeah so I'm pretty boredSo I am fresh out of highschool, and I can't help but feel like I'll probably never have a good time here. I don't really feel like ever having a job, and I certainly have no interests. Seems like I'll grow old and die, and all this internal struggle will be in vain. Like, there doesn't seem to be any reward for anything- I'm certainly not counting on an afterlife.

I just don't see how anyone actually cares about anything. My indifference has led my family to resent me, and I'm pretty tired of letting everyone down. I don't really feel like going to college either, at this point I think I should kill myself. Being born sure is some kind of trap, guys.

Sometimes I cry a lot, ...for no reason. I think I may have aspergers or some kind of other robotic disorder.
