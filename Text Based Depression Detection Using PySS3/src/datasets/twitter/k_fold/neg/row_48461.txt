I think my birthday must be the worst day of the yearIt's not the fact that I'm by myself, that's been like that for most of my life and I'm already used to it. It just remind me that years ago this big useless mistake was brought into the world. It reminds me of how I fail to accomplish every little thing I tried to achieve. And when I tell my mother I just don't want to celebrate it and just spent it as a regular day,l and don't want any gifts, she gets mad at me and calls me ungrateful. I just want to stay all day in bed and cry myself to sleep until this awful day is over. Anyone else who just can't stand their birthday?
