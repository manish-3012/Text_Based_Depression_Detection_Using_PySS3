The quickest and easiest solutionI know what will happen. This is a repeat of 2013. It may be even worse this time.

We will lose our health insurance, the car, and our apartment. I will lose my cat. We will lose all of our possessions. 

Without medicine, a doctor, and a hospital, Mom will die. 

Getting government assistance is too hard and takes too much time. 

I could find some abandoned place and squat there. And then just try to put my life together. 

I donâ€™t want to die. I want to go to nursing school, work, travel, and have a good time. I want to give my mom a fabulous retirement in Nevada. 

Or I can kill myself. The easiest, quickest solution. It will have to be after my mom is dead though. 

The biggest thing that I am worried about isnâ€™t my mom or me, itâ€™s my cat. I feel like it should be my mom that I worry about the most, but itâ€™s the damn cat.

Fuck. Iâ€™m a fucked up person.

I can try to fix my crumbling world before it crashes. Or I can live in my world after it crashes and try to clean up the mess and rebuild. 

Or I can exit.

Idk if Iâ€™ll do it or not.
