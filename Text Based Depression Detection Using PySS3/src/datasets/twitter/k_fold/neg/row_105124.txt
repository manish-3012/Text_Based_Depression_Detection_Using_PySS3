Not Sure but need peopleim not sure if Im a total suicide watch but uve recentky had extremely hard times upon me. at 14 I lost my biological mother to Huntington's Disease. This was tough, and my father helped me through it and really shown through. I'd die for that man kinda relationship. Anyway, fast forward I start college and have a tough time and get depressed but dont treat it for 1.5 year. That was until I found out my dad had been diagnosed with Stage 4 Brain Cancer. I didnt believe a god damn second. What kid ends up with both biological parents being so ill and eventually passing, which my dad did in October of 2016. The three prior months are still haunting to me. cancer patients often start spending the whole day in bed. eventually you lose speaking. then you lose some motor controls. you cant control bowel movements. The amount of respect I had for my dad every time he stood and managed to do a dance to a song from pandora is inexplainable. I cant believe how strong he was, but I cant escape the memories of holding his one moving hand while we suctioned flem out of his mouth and inserted medical marijuana oil and he'd just squeeze my hand tight because it tasted nasty. And i cant describe how powerful and magical that grip on my hand was. it communicated his emotions and thoughts and strength and weakness all in one movement. And I fucking miss how magical he was. I miss it so bad i am up til 4 or 5 having laid in bed staring for 5 hours. I cant escape and ive had counseling, i take antidepressants, i smoke weed, i exercise. I cant think if what else can help me escape from that other than obviously not existing and so I am scared. I try to immitate my dad and remember his calming "everything is gonna be alright pal". I just need him so bad in my life right now.
