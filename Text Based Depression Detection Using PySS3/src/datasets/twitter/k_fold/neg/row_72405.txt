Hindsight after my failed attempt.I can't stop thinking about it.

Yesterday I attempted suicide by tying a padded noose to the bar that holds the shower curtain in my bathroom. I used the ribbon from a yellow dress I own.

When you're up there, on that chair, pushing your head into the noose, about to die, a fear just strikes you. There's no going back after this, and if you survive, you'll most likely wake up with permanent damage.

But, there's something that in hindsight has been making me feel very anxious, maybe even just a little lucky.

When I was up there, I kept having to adjust the length of the rope to make sure it would work okay. Pulling on it a little bit, tightening it around my neck, etc.

But at one point, it got stuck. The noose was wrapped horrifically tight around my neck- not tight enough to stop my breathing, just tight enough to heavily restrict it.

I was in a position where I couldn't look to see how to untie the noose, and my legs were stuck in a position that made breathing painful. If I moved, my breathing would only be more restricted.

I had to desperately and blindly reach up to untie it to stop the pain. In the moment, I wasn't too scared, as I knew I'd be able to reach it, even if the process leading up to it was painful.

But I can't stop thinking about my feet. I was so focused on the noose, that my shakey legs weren't concerning me at all. One wrong move, or wrong step on that wonky chair, and I would have died. I was so close to dying, and looking back to it, it's really scary.

Maybe what I'm saying is stupid.

It's just, scary.
