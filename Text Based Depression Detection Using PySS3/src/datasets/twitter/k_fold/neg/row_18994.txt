Newsflash: Suicide Hotlines don't work for the clinically depressed.Sure...they're great if you had some trauma or are just feeling overwhelmed. Sometimes you just need someone to listen to you and these are great tools for that.

But if the person on the other end of that line isn't a PhD certified psychiatrist...there's not a damn thing they can do if you have depression.
They aren't equipped to deal with the issue of your own mind telling you you're worthless, or the fact that you can't keep a job because you literally can't get yourself out of bed in the morning, or that every little thing that happens you blame on yourself

What are they gonna do?
Tell you to stop it?
Tell you it sucks?
Tell you to see a professional that costs hundreds of dollars per session?
Yeah...super helpful.

Half of the population here in America doesn't even believe in it. And the other half will charge you an insane amount to deal with it.
Then there's some who are both.
