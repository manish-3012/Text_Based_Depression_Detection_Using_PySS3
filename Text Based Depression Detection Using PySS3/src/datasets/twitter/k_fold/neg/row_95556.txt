Can anyone help me please?I feel like I might commit suicide soon. Iâ€™m scared of myself. Iâ€™ve been in a very abusive relationship for the past few years. I have a daughter. My head is turning against me. I feel like I deserve everything. He turns every sentence or emotion against me. Itâ€™s making me doubt everything. Today, I had a complete breakdown. I hit myself everywhere. My head has a bump, my legs are full of bruises and slaps. I canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™m crazy. Who would do this?! A crazy person! Heâ€™s right when he says Iâ€™m crazy, Iâ€™m a fucking slut, Iâ€™m a disgrace to this Earth. 
What if I am? I learned a few days ago that my mom has cancer. Iâ€™m stuck with this pandemic, this man who makes everything harder. Why did I have a breakdown? Because Iâ€™m crazy. Iâ€™m not strong... 
I deserve to die. I canâ€™t take the pain anymore. I want it to end but I canâ€™t do this to my mom or my daughter... What if all the abuse Iâ€™ve endured is because I deserved it, because Iâ€™m crazy and itâ€™s the only way people might be able to tame me. What the fuck. I want to die!
