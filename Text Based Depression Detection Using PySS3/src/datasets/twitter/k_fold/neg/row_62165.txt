how many more times do i have to scream for helpi ran away from my abusive family but i only managed to get away because i guilted my friend into helping me by telling her i was suicidal so she would act. I mean I'm fed up with everyone abandoning me. No one answers my texts or emails anymore. No one checks in on me. My therapist is fucking useless. It's like I've been stuck in a hole and for years I've been making attempts to get out on my own and when I finally yell for help everyone is like "yea sure I'll help" but no one does anything. They just stare at me and say its not so bad down there you'll get out one day hang in there. I'm fucking tired of it. And I'm the asshole. For asking for help. It's pathetic I can only get people who care about me to act by revealing that I don't want to fucking live anymore. I'm done with this "you aren't alone I'm here for you" bullshit. Where are you. Where were you yesterday where were you 3 years ago where were you on my good days, my ok days, my not so bad days? this quarantine and self distancing shit isn't helping either. I really cannot imagine survivng another few weeks like this. I never wanted to live past 30 anyways. All people do is get my hopes up then let me down. Why do they tell me to hang on? What for? How could my staying alive possibly benefit me? Everyone always says no don't kill yourself and throws out stupid hotline numbers, but why?  Just so you don't have to feel responsible? You'll get over me. You're not here now, you never will be. I wish everyone would stop lying to me. Give me one good reason to go on like this.
