Pls don't question people hereIf someone is talking to u about their struggles and stuff here pls don't question the credibility of their story. There is a million reasons why a story might feel like a troll or just someone who want attention but pls just go along with it especially if u don't have any solid proof. If u do have solid proof then u can ask questions about it but don't sounds like u are questioning the credibility of their claims just sound like u are curious.

I have had that happen so many times where people think i am lying about my life while they have no proof other than the fact that "it's too awful to be real" said a dude to me! 

So just pls beilieve people even if they are trolling i think most people here wouldn't wanna risk accusing someone who is innocent and i have been accused so many times and it's hurt a lot so pls just beilieve people more!
