Struggling due to being good for nothing ?Hi,  this post is a little long but I'm not good at communication and this  post comes from the will of taking the big step: I'm planning to hang  myself tonight after my mom falls asleep (for many other reasons besides  what I try to say in this post). I'm 25 and basically a good for nothing, my entire life I've been  told (by my parents and relatives) that I'm useless and can't do  anything well and it seems like I can't indeed, I admit I'm very clumsy  and maybe I have some attention issues. The only thing I barely know how  to do is coding and I haven't been able to land a job because I'm not  good enough even for a junior position.

Now, **the purpose of this post:** I would like to read if there are others who feel their lives are meaningless beacuse they also are *good for nothing*.  What can you do to be a functional adult when you have 0 skill and do everything wrong? What could become of a person like this? I mean, what future could you have? Do you feel  like this?

I think my family kind  of let this pass when I was younger but I have to man up and make my own  life, but it seems I'm physically/mentally unable to do something for a  living. Plus, I live in Venezuela, even a good job doesn't pay rent or  food so I'm kinda stuck living with my mother while listening to her  calling me useless occasionally.

I  feel in a good mood right now, I stopped caring about literally  everything, just want to spend my hopefully last day reading some  comments. Maybe this is my brain wanting to talk before doing it. So, **I'd like to read if there are others good for nothing out there and how are you coping with it?** :)
