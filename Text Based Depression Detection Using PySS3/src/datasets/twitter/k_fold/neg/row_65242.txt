Falling to pieces but trying to stay strongLast night I had a dream I was about to finally commit suicide. Even my unconscious self reminds me. This is probably just a ramble of thoughts like my pathetic life.
Iâ€™m disabled by a lung disease, finally got a new babysitting gig to pay the bills and something came up with one of the kids so now Iâ€™m not needed. Every job I interviewed for went to someone else either who lives closer or would take less pay. 
I canâ€™t pay my bills, I have no job, my life is going nowhere, I donâ€™t see the point anymore. Lots of people dying by jumping in front of trains these days...Wondering if thatâ€™s the way to go....
I probably will chicken out and not do anything too drastic but after a couple years of not selfharming, I think Iâ€™m going back in that direction at least for tonight. 
Iâ€™m just trying to think of reasons to stay alive. I have friends. My sister is having a baby, I really would love to see the baby. But I just donâ€™t know if I can handle this life anymore.
