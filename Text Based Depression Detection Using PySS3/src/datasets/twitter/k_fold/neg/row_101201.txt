Im not sure if im suicidalI don't really want to kill myself... but i think im ready to die. Im just the point where it makes sense. Its like every poor choice ive made was because this is what I needed to realize is that death is my choice.  It is all clear now. Haven't been in legal trouble for almost a decade. But this... this is what want. I will not take my life. But i sure as hell welcome it with open arms.
