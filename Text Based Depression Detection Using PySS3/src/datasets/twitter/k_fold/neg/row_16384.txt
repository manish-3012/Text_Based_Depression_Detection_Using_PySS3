I truly wish to dieThat's all I can think about lately. I had an extremely abusive boyfriend that I recently split up with and had to get a restraining order on.

One of my friends was the victim of rape and committed suicide earlier this week. 

Another of my friends deactivated their account so I have no one to talk to anymore. 

I'm a FtM trans person who has no support from their family. My father said "in the golden ages people like you were hung".

I'm a college washout. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything, and I'm losing interest in the things I had previously been able to do amidst my depression. 

I've lost everything and everyone that actually mattered. What am I supposed to do now? Jump off a bridge. Overdose. That's the only thoughts my mind can turn to right now. It's almost like a comfort.
