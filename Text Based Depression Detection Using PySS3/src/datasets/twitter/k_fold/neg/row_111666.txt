I've been thinking about it a lot. Don't know if I'd actually go through with it...... But the amount I think about it is starting to worry me.

I've already spent a night in a crisis ward, locked up because there was a thought I'd cause self harm after an anxiety attack.

I've felt this way ever since my ex ended it. I seriously thought she was the one. I work a job where I'm alone in my car all day, so I'm sitting there stewing in these thoughts, missing her, and just not able to stay distracted for extended periods of time.

The biggest reason I'd do it is to just get away from all these thoughts, all these feelings. I couldn't do it to my friends and family, but I just.. I feel like giving up.

I know a girl isn't the end of the world, but my life has changed a lot within the last few months, and I don't feel like myself anymore. 

She dating some new guy I found out today. And since I've found out I just can't decide between crying, puking, or punching a hole in my wall. I also don't feel anything and feel like giving up.

This is one of the worst days I've ever had.
