Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion I will have to kill myselfMy life sucks. To the max. And nothing EVER gets better, only worse and more difficult. Iâ€™ve been on a downslope the past 2 years I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold on. 

Iâ€™m a 23 year old female with drug addiction problems, with an extensive juvenile and adult arrest history. And due to that I am not allowed to drive period until 2025. A super long list of mental and physical health problems always getting worse. I have 0 friends literally havenâ€™t had any in years due to my baggage. Found out I was pregnant by my cheating boyfriend and managed to get sober and had a baby whoâ€™s now 2 years old I got a degree while pregnant and semi got some shit in my life together, but my childâ€™s father is a narcissist and very controlling so I became severely depressed living with him and relapsed. I got caught and kicked out of my home with him bc my name wasnâ€™t on the lease, moved back in with my parents and have been so isolated and hopeless since. Itâ€™s just always getting worse. 
Since relapsing cps has been involved and Iâ€™ve only been getting supervised weekly visits. Iâ€™ve been doing everything asked of me by them. My childâ€™s father has also recently filed for custody in court and has the best lawyer money can buy because his family is rich and will pay whatever. Iâ€™m broke working a minimum wage job in my field because Iâ€™m just starting out. I have no lawyer yet. My depression is just sinking so fast idk how much longer I can do this shit. I feel like realistically my child would be better off if I was dead I mean what if I ever relapsed again ? I donâ€™t wanna put them through that shit when their old enough to know whatâ€™s going on the guilt I feel for being such a drug addicted pos is unbearable. I have no way to drive my child anywhere they need to go school doctors etc. I would rather lay in bed everyday than do anything else. I hate myself my life everything. I love my child but they deserve so much better than me. I donâ€™t even support myself. My childâ€™s father has a good paying job with benefits. He has his own place for them he drives. And Iâ€™ve recently found out heâ€™s been â€œdatingâ€ an ex friend of mine. 

No one would want to be friends with someone with my past let alone date or marry or start a life with me. I seemingly have no future.
