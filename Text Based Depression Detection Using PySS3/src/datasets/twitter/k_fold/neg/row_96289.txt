Trains are beautifulI have been facinated by trains from my childhood,  I guess they are the best, modern day guillotine. I am just formulating my final plan. No, It wont be a Passenger train I dont like wasting others time. 

Just a bit of backstory for curious people out there. tl dr  23 year old from India, forced to study something that I dont like(poverty, social issue), got to know about stock market, finished CFA l1 (had someone to sponsor me from USA). But I realised I need a lot of money to do an MBA to break into this industry. Cant live my life everyday knowing I can never be successful doing something I hate.
