I want to end it allLong story short I broke up with my 8 month pregnant girlfriend cause I wasn't sure about if I loved her. Fast forward our son is now 6 weeks old and I hate setting up times to go see him when all I want is to just spend every minute with him. I know I shouldn't kill myself because of him but I'm so depressed about missing most things in his life that I just want to say fuck it all and kill myself. I feel like an empty shell and I hate putting on a "happy face" in public. I just want this entire world to leave me alone. I work a dead end job no college degree and I'm 30. And to top it off I'm being evicted from my apartment this week. 

Anybody have a tips on a quick and easy way for me to end it all? I don't have a gun so I'm thinking I can either jump in front of a train or off the building where my ex lives. I'm pretty sure the fall will kill me I just have to land on my head. Any other advice on how to kill my self would be great!
