It's always minor inconveniences that make me realize I'd rather be deadSmall, mundane inconveniences make me realize how pointless life is and that nothing would change if I was dead, I don't want to be a part of this world anymore, things like tough homework problems or being late for class because the bus is late just makes me realize I don't have the competence or drive to live.
