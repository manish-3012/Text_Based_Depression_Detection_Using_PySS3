Iâ€™m getting overworked by my job and I still canâ€™t afford to liveIâ€™m the â€œyoung guyâ€ in the shop so if anything comes up they just have the kid do it. Iâ€™m scheduled back to back 10 hour shifts closing then I have to wake up and open at 7 am the next day. Itâ€™s taking a huge toll on my mental health. I wake up, go to work, come home, go to sleep, and repeat. Iâ€™m too tired to enjoy video games im too tired to enjoy spending time with my girlfriend I just sleep and work and I donâ€™t think I can do this forever. No matter how much I work itâ€™s still not enough money to move out on my own so I can get away from the apartment complex my brother committed suicide in and Iâ€™m constantly reminded of him every single day I come home from a long day of work. Life is dumb
