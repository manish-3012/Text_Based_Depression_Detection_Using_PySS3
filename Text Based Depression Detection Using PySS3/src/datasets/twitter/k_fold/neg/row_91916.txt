Nobody cares unless I die?I'm surrounded by people who supposedly care, but when I need someone, they say fuck off. I need someone... Anyone to care... And no one does, Im so tired of life but I don't want to try to end it because I know I'll hurt the people I care about...I know they'd care if I died, but why can't they care when I'm alive. I just need someone who cares, even a little bit
