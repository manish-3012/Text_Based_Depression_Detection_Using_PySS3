I'm useless. Life is useless.I want to kill myself. I think about it every day, and every night. Life is pointless, and stupid. You have to do the same thimgs over and over again, every day. It never changes. I'm tired of it all. School is pointless, it doesn't help with anything. I'll never be able to get a job anyway, who needs years, of education for nothing? If I go nothing will change. Everything will go on without me. Just as it was before. Its going to end anyway, so why not now?
