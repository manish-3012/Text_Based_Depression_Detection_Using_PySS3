Rest would be nice.I donâ€™t sleep. I live in a one-room bedsit. My mother hates me so I canâ€™t live with her. My stepmother seems annoyed by my very existence (which caught me off-guard as sheâ€™s usually pretty affectionate) so I canâ€™t live with my dad. I canâ€™t drive, hand few marketable skills and the ones I do have are for things that are difficult as hell to get into; so what chance does a luckless twit like me have at any success?
 Iâ€™ve attempted suicide twice since September and Iâ€™ve lost friends because of it.
 I have no prospects and no hope, not that hope has ever done me any good before.
 That probably sounds self-pitying but I donâ€™t really care.

Itâ€™s not even that I necessarily want to die, I just want some peace for a while - sleep would be peaceful, if I could manage it ðŸ˜“.
