Too lazy to dieHey, depressed guy #80000000 here. Honestly the only reason why I haven't killed myself is because I'm too last to write my suicide notes. I guess I still am kinda holding to that last bit of hope that maybe tomorrow will be better, but it never is. I came here as kinda a last resort for some advice or like some recommendations of movies or books or songs that have changed your guy's lives. Thanks, anything helps
