Failed todayBelt, doorway. I messed up by having the belt too tight and my pulse instantly skyrocketed while I was gasping for air and was unable to push the chair away due to survival instincts kicking in.

It's an un-describably miserable feeling at even failing to end your life. I've literally failed everything I've ever done. This just brings this to a whole new level.

Oh well, another day, another chance. Stupidity should be rewarded with suffering, after all.
