just need a little space. thought maybe i could find it here, if that is ok. Tl;DR  It's not worth anyone's time

6 hours.10 minutes.  ((hugs))

Thank you.  Appreciate you.  I truly do.  you are good hearted, kind, gentle people. and i hope life will be gentle and kind to you.  Gentle hugs from me to all of you.  Please be gentle on yourselves.  Be easy on you.  you deserve only the best.   I know at times the universe can be harsh, but try to hang in there.  I hope your lives improve and happiness and joy comes your way.  Much love to all of you.

i find myself running into similar issues my friend had.  It took a couple trial runs to finally pull the trigger.  kind of making sure everything is ready, set up, no mistakes etc.  Seems going to the place, being familiar with it, feeling it, getting into it, is important on some level.  Spent the night at one potential place last night.  sure didn't help i was running a fever and it was cold..  It did  help with my comfort level.  i'm still leaning toward the water i see from where i sit.  looking out the window i can see the water, it's close, doesn't take much energy.


Edit;  Note to those contemplating killing themselves.  No.  We survivors never get over it. NEVER.  i've lost several people, a couple were years ago, a few more recent.  It NEVER gets better.  I just want you to be aware of this.  I'm leaving too.  I cannot bear the pain any longer.  I'm biding my time, waiting for my date, and I will leave as well.  I'm trying to bide my time...i have moments where i feel impulsive and ready to just go but i don't want to mess it up and it's far better if i stick to my plan, but who knows as i am teetering on the edge and my way out is always nearby. 

edit; obviously writing was a poor idea so i've junked 
it can just stay in my head until my head is gone
