I donâ€™t wanna die but I wanna dieIf I could have a remote control switch that let me reverse my birth, Iâ€™d do it.

I really do want to die, I think. Sometimes thereâ€™s an inkling of hope, but it gets dimmer and dimmer every day. Almost nonexistent. 

Iâ€™m only here right now because I cannot imagine the pain it would cause my family. But I donâ€™t know how much longer that can hold me back...
