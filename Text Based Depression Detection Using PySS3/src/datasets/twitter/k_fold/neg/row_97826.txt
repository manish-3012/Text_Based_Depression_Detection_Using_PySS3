It gets worse every dayI'm only 14 and have attempted suicide about 7 times. It's getting harder to tell myself to keep going, it all feels like too much. Maybe it's teenage angst and I'll grow out of it. Maybe not. Probably not. I want to damn my stepdad and his friend to Hell, they don't deserve to walk on this world. But nor do I. At this stage of my life, all I want is to die. To pass into the void. I don't want to be here any longer.
