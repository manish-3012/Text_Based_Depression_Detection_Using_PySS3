Trauma: before and afterIt's not the same; I could tell myself to remember the good times and use them as a source of hope but it always results in increasing despair and regret as if this one thing hadn't happened then I wouldn't be writing this, I wouldn't be miserable, I would create good memories instead of wasting all my time. I've looked into Post Traumatic Growth but it's too hard. I just which the annihilation of my self for all eternity to come.
