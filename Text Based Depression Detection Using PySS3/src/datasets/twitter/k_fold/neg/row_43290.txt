Scared of myselfIâ€™m 22. I started self-harming as a teenager. For a couple of years I managed to stop cutting for the most part, even though I was still stressed out and would find other ways to hurt myself. 

Now Iâ€™ve slipped back into cutting again. I hate that my body is covered in scars and Iâ€™m always scared about how badly Iâ€™ll hurt myself the next time, but it doesnâ€™t feel like something I can stop right now. 

Itâ€™s scaring me. I am suicidal. I donâ€™t feel like I deserve to be alive and I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ll ever be in any decent relationships. But I havenâ€™t fully wrapped my mind around the concept of being dead. My self-loathing is at an all time high, but nothingness is scary, and even though Iâ€™ve never believed in hell I know if any such concept was real thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d deserve and thatâ€™s terrifying.

Iâ€™m just scared. I canâ€™t picture myself in the future, and the right thing to do would probably be to give up now, but I canâ€™t fully let go and donâ€™t understand why. 

Edit: Iâ€™m broken. Iâ€™m too fucked up and no one can save me now. I know that, so why canâ€™t I just let go? Iâ€™m such a loser.
