I feel like I'm on the edgeI just want to get the courage to kill myself and end this suffering once and for all.

I'm 22, I've been diagnosed with depression about 7 years ago, and taking meds since then.

There was some moments where I kind of felt better, but lately everything seems to be going downhill.
