I'm just done. I'm over it.Sorry if I do anything stupid or whatever, but this is my first post on reddit.

So far this year has been awesome for me.
My parents who have been together almost 30 years got divorced because my mom cheated on my dad.
She decided it would be even better to bring him over to stay the night a few weeks ago. She's actually up north at his house right now.
Then my grandpa died, I was pretty close to him. so you know, there's that.
My sister just got into a car accident and totaled her car. She was okay though.
I feel like I either annoy the shit out of everyone I talk to. My friend since 3rd grade stopped talking to me for no reason, or at least wont tell me why. I just let everyone down that I talk to or promise anything to. I don't mean to.
I'm done and over everything. I don't care about really anything anymore. I feel like my sister judges everything I do and generally doesn't care about or want to be around me. My brother is a drunk asshole, my mom is a cheating whore, and whenever I see my dad it's nothing but "here fix this, do this, clean this" at a house where I go to maybe once a week.
At this point I think the only reason I haven't killed myself is because I don't want to be the next flavor of the month. I don't want to make a huge deal out of it. I just don't want to be alive anymore.
