I'm worried about a fellow RedditorHello everybody,

During an inane discussion on AskReddit, I got an answer by someone that worries me, talking about his suicidal thoughts.

I tried to give him advices, using my own situation, but I'm worried about him.

Here's a link: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/53mzet/what_is_something_you_were_once_embarrassed_by/d7us41l

I have no idea what to do other than what I did.

Thanks.
