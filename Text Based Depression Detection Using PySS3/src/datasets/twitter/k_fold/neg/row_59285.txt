I don't deserve to live anymoreLots of people have it worse than me. I dont deserve to complain when I have a home and family. Some people dont have that. I know some people get beaten, or raped, or yelled at, but I dont have any of that. For some reason, all my depression comes from myself. So I have no reason to feel this way. If I'm just going to whine and sit here with my hands shaking, I... I'm not sure what I was going to say, but the point is everyone else would be better off without me as soon as they come to terms with my death. They can support themselves better, they wont have to worry about me, I wont be there to annoy or screw things up for anyone again. 

I've already got the noose tied. All I have to do is get in it. Suspension hanging would probably be best for me. No one will be home for a while. I'm just leaving this here so when it posts, my family will see this when they find me.
