i've lost.. everyonei dont know what to do. i had a great bestfriend that i had previously dated and now they're gone. they don't care. they show no remorse. they forgot about me so easily. my actual girlfriend (i'm a girl) i have trouble showing feelings too. i just brush her off and i feel bad but that's exactly what he did/does to me so maybe i think it's okay. 

i've never felt this low. yeah i've felt lonely but i've never felt this without people, i can't take it. i'm lying in bed right now crying because i can't take it. 

he uses reddit but i know he won't see this because he doesn't fucking care. nobody fucking cares. if i didn't show up to school tomorrow, or didn't talk to anyone else forever, everyone would be okay 

i'm drunk right now and usually that makes me happy but right now i'm so fucking upset because of it and everything that i dont know what to do

i might sound dramatic and dumb but living in a life where you survive on people and then suddenly you have none it really fucking sucks. i'm sorry. 

i have a real fucking urge to cut myself and drain out in my closet and i know that's a fucking boost but, go ahead and call me a boost if that's what it takes 

edit: i can't stop crying, or cutting. god damn i'm dramatic. he's gonna see this and be like wtf
