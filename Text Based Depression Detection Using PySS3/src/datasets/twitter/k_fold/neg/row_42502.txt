Iâ€™m a 20 year old loser who has no future so why should I keep living?I canâ€™t get an internship Iâ€™ve applied for over 60 and I need it to advance my career but itâ€™s going nowhere I canâ€™t get a date because Iâ€™m fat and ugly I canâ€™t lose weight because my metabolism is garbage I know I have no future so what reason is there to live anymore? Every day just gets worse and worse and all I want to do is curl up and die but thereâ€™s no way to do that
