4 Reasons to kill myself1. It's my life. I own it. To live would be to allow others to think they own it. They don't. It's mines.

2. Since u was 14, life has been hell. Since before that, life has been an existence filled with short lived joy and long lived hate.

3. I don't love or care about people the way others do. I am a loner by choice and use to be a loner by choice and circumstance. I still hang with people but they disgust or don't interest me at all. Holidays are pointless, work is pointless, everything feels pointless. I can make goals but I have no passion for them. I have no passion for life. Even my once obsessive hobbies (reading, writing, debating, etc) no longer interested me.

4. To prove a point. To who, I don't know. But its my life and I enjoy the thought of finishing it on my own terms..

Please keep your cliches to yourself. I'm smarter and more cynical than most.
