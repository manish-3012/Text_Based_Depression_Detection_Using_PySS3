A humane death is all I wantSince I was 13 I wanted to die. I'm 32 now. I've been in and out of therapy for the past 4 years...but the drugs, the therapy....nothing really helped. Last year I had a psychotic episode and had to be in a psych ward twice. Since then I have lost what little will to live I had left. I want this never ending charade of having to pretend to come to a close. Life is just a run down theme park in my mind. I am hopeless, have no motivation and no real interests anymore. Nothing makes me happy and I am just a burden to society. There is no magic left, everything is transparent and stale, I keep myself alive with pure escapism, playing video games until the day comes. I don't want a 9-5 job that will break me. I don't want kids who will hate in the end. I don't want to get old and sick.

The methods I have in mind for ending my life without the possibility of being saved and/or crippled all involve significant violence dealt upon my body. I just wish I had more humane options where I could just fall asleep ina comfy bed and never wake up again. I wish my loved ones would understand and support me in what is ultimately my decision. I even wish they could be there so I wouldn't have to be all alone in my final moment. How nice that would be. I know I am selfish, what's wrong with being selfish anyway...
