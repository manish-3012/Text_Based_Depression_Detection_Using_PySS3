totally listlessi attempted suicide a few months ago and iâ€™ve never told anyone in my real life, and now iâ€™m thinking about killing myself more intensely everyday. i went to a concert yesterday and all i could think at some points was how empty i felt, like nothing is enough to make me feel like i WANT to live. iâ€™ve been suicidal for about 7 years and itâ€™s honestly tiring, i just want to give in.
