I don't think I need (want) your help , but I just want to let y'all know.I know this subreddit for awhile, but I had not felt like doing anything lately. However, I felt a little motivated today, so here it is. 

 I'm a 19 years old college student and I live in Texas. I've been thinking about disappearing from the world, because I feel like this life is not worth living. I know my family and my friends love me, but I can't feel anything about them at all. I (think) have depression, I don't feel like doing anything lately, I fail in school, I skip work frequently, and the worst is I don't even want sex anymore , and all of them have been happening for months. The only two things that stop me from killing myself right now are: I don't have enough motivation to kill myself, and I don't want my family to waste money for my funeral. 

The only reason my parents have to work hard is to pay for my school, and it broke my heart to see them like that, so if I die, my parents don't have to work hard like that anymore,and my two brothers can take care of them. My family used to be wealthy enough to send me to private school, but then everything changed when my parents' company went bankrupt. (Sorry, I love Avatar)

Thank you and sorry for wasting your time. And I'm sorry if the message is hard to read, I just write down what are in my head right now, and they're not pretty.

P/s: Another reason for me not to kill myself is that I'm still looking for a method which doesn't make a mess or result in organs failure, so I can donate my organs, and be useful for once in my life. I wish I can just go to a hospital and ask them to take all my organs.
