Nothing interesting on thisI been thinking of doing it... let me start by saying that I been in panic mode since de end of 2019 with thoughts coming and going to my mind and my sleeping is gone, not much rest since then.... Iâ€™m 31 socially awkward and for a better description â€œshyâ€... I meet my wife a few years ago and married her last year... we couldnâ€™t last more than a few months and at the end of 2019 she told me she needed time off... like anyone in that situation I tried to â€œfix itâ€ but ended up just annoying her... she left and when she did my whole world stopped... panic attacks anxiety and insomnia became the new normal... the world outside is dealing with Covid19 and that doesnâ€™t bother me, Iâ€™m not afraid of that... my mind is fucked up and theres no escape from it... I tried to talk to people I knew and ended up much feeling worse after talking to them... my mom passed away a few years ago, my brother is busy with his family and thereâ€™s not much talking between us at the moment... Iâ€™m alone, no friends and the only person I think 24/7 is her... I know this shouldnâ€™t be the reason, I know this shouldnâ€™t matter and that thereâ€™s millions of people out there to meet but I just feel lost, I donâ€™t get rest and even tho I try to keep myself busy during the day is time like now, in the middle of the night where I canâ€™t escape my thoughts... I just needed to let it out, Iâ€™m not asking for help cause no one can help me from my own mind, Iâ€™m just tired and want to rest.... I been thinking of doing it and get over with...
