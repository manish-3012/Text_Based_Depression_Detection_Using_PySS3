So, here I am with a belt and a couple of necktiesI want to hang myself tonight. It's really been stressful, you know that kind of story. It's not like I'm helpless, I am truly squeezed by the balls though. College getting rough but that's only one more factor. 30sec and I will become unconscious, then hopefully death by asphyxiation. Will it work? I'm really scared. I don't want to fail, I don't want brain damage. Suicide should be easier than this... euthanasia should be more available. Anyways, I don't want advice or help, I just want to know whether it will work. Suffocation works properly all the time except for rare cases, is that true? I hope I don't survive.
