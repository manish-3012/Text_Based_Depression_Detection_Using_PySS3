My PlanSo, I'm financially boned right now. If my worst fear has come to pass, and I can't afford my apartment this month, I'm leaving  everything behind, and hittin' the highway straight to Pembina, ND. It's a border town, just south of Canada. I just want to look at the place I never got to go. It was my long term goal to go there. Become a citizen. I could've have a better life there. At least I could afford treatment, even if I *didn't* have insurance (which I wouldn't for the first 2 years). After a while, I'd slit my throat. My last memory, staring at what could have been.
