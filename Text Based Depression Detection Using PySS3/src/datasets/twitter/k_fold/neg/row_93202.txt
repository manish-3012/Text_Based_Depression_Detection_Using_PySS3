I donâ€™t think anyone would miss me if I were gone.I donâ€™t know anymore. Iâ€™m always as an option, never a priority.. Iâ€™m no oneâ€™s â€œbest friend.â€ yeah, I have friends and people know of me, but no one actually knows me.. the people who have taken the time to get to know me, my childhood, and my past traumas have all left my life for one reason or another. Iâ€™m at a point where all of my friends would rather spend time with other people besides me. itâ€™s selfish as hell to think that they owe me ANY of their time. but man. itâ€™s so fucking lonely.

I just feel so empty. I go to therapy. I take medication. I do the homework. why do I still feel so shitty all the time and do I really have to spend the rest of my life like this? this canâ€™t be healthy. 

I want to die.
