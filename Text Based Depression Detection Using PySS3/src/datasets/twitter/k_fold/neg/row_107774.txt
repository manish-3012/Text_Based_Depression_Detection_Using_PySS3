I triedI'm so fucking hurt deep down inside. no one is even there to listen, they only say that they are to make it seem like they care. no one in this world gives a single fuck about me. i try to love life, I'm not saying my life is a shit hole because it's not. I just can not be happy. I am broken down, I'm useless. While the tears roll down my cheeks, I realize more and more how much of a disappointment I am. I'm Aaron, I've always tried to be happy, funny, and make people laugh. that's just all to remove me from the pain. and when I'm alone I just realize how much of a nobody I am. I cry, I'm in pain. I just wish I didn't feel like this. and I'm fucking conflicted as fuck. Im a coward for thinking of killing myself, of coming close, for not telling anyone my issues. yet I do not want anyone to know how I feel. it really hurts to keep it all inside and some days I cant handle it anymore and just let all the pain out with my tears and sobs.
