I can feel myself slipping awayThe last two years have been the worst and the only good in my life was meeting my partner. He isnâ€™t who he had led me to believe. I donâ€™t know if I can trust myself because he showed me he isnâ€™t trustworthy. I have shown how I feel and still he just tramples me even more. We agreed to stay together and see a therapist. But I donâ€™t know if that will make anything better. I am grieving the loss of someone who didnâ€™t even exist. I feel so alone and disconnected from this world. I wish it would stop. I love my deadpan sense of humor but I want that zest for life back again. Iâ€™m just incredibly hurt and struggling to get by day to day alone.
