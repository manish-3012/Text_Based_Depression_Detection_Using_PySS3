The girl I loved left me and now I feel I have no purposeShe left me for a coworker out of the blue. Kicked me out like I was at fault. I loved her and realize now that she was my life. I canâ€™t stop thinking about her being with him and I just want to stop all the thoughts in my head once and for all.
