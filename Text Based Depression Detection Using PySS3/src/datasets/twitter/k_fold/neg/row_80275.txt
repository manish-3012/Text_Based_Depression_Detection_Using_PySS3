I feel like there is no hope in lifeI already see a therapist. It hasnâ€™t done anything for me. I feel disconnected from my old best friends. And someone I thought was going to be a lover to me told me they donâ€™t care about my feelings. What is life where you have nothing. You have no love. I have stress from work, I have stress from being alone without any real friends with real connections. What is the point. 

Please donâ€™t tell me
Something stupid like pray and please no teenagers commenting with stories. Iâ€™m a full grown adult.
