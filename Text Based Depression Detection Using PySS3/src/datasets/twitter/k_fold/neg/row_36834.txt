At it againHere i am. Back. My first post for reference: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dh19ld/about\_to\_die\_hopefully/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dh19ld/about_to_die_hopefully/)

So...what happened the last time: i took 120 loquen 25mg and 10 sertraline 100mg. Then i felt asleep. Like a baby i must say. No pain just sweet embrace of my bed.

After that i can only tell what i heard. After about 7 hours my father tried to woke me. Couldn't. Ambulance was called took me to the emergency room after that they took me to intensive care where i was in comma for 2 days.

Waking up was a pain i can tell you that. I had that hose up my throat and wanted to caught soo bad. Was tied to the bed too as they were afraid i'll rip all the things attached to me. After i was ok to talk they asked all kind of weird questions and told me it was just a matter of a bit more drugs or a little more time. I failed by the thread. After two more days in clinical center i was taken to psychiatric hospital.

Boy i had good time there =) Met a girl dated her for a while even when i was released. One of the best f\*\*\*s ever. Got put on some other medicine. Mainly lithium.

Diagnosis: border personality disorder.

While still in hospital applied and got a much better job with amazing pay. Moved to the capital living with friends in a big house. Quit the job tho not long ago. I ain't good with living in this weird society with all these rules and expectations. Lost the girl too, not surprisingly :( Currently living on little money i have.

And there it is.

Now i'm at it again. I really really see no point in being attached to this planet by the force of gravity in the form i am currently in. For all i care let my atoms be used in some other matter.

At this time still working on a plan but the things i know now i have: a big time window, access to loquen and some other more or less legal drugs.

Dont know about the date tho; currently enjoying one of my probably last redbull vodkas :) In a few more days its bye bye whatever you wanna call this state we are all in. Wish me luck again :)

&gt;creating life under the baton of the living  
&gt;  
&gt;surviving untill death in agonizing expectation  
&gt;  
&gt;life as a gift with condemnation without escape  
&gt;  
&gt;after death no hell bellow or heaven above  
&gt;  
&gt;living is suffering amongst a pieces of paradise
