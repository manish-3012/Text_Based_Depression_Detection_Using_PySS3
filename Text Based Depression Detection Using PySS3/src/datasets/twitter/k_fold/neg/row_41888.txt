i cant take itmusic doesnt mean anything to me . even my friends canâ€™t distract me anymore .  everywhere i look iâ€™m reminded of the girl that fucking sexually abused me and it feels like nobody cares at all . everythingâ€™s slowly falling down around me and iâ€™m the last thing to go . tonight all i want to do is cut as deep as i can go and intoxicate myself enough for it to be okay . iâ€™m sorry to everyone telling me to be strong but i just canâ€™t do it anymore
