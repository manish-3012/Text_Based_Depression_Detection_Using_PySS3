They never respond back to any of my textsNext week is her birthday and their exams. I want to wish them good luck and happy birthday but I canâ€™t. Theyâ€™re scared of me and I make them uncomfortable. Do you know how that feels like? To know that they are afraid of you because theyâ€™re worried youâ€™ll hurt them? That because of what I did, they canâ€™t trust me and donâ€™t feel safe? It hurts. The loneliness already hurts but this hurts too much.

And my remaining friends that were willing to give me one more chance, they promised they would sit with me during recess but I was almost always alone. Can I blame them? Iâ€™m not funny nor am I good at talking to others. They say they want to help me but when I message them when Iâ€™m in pain, they donâ€™t say anything. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.

10 years Iâ€™ve been trying to get away from people who have tried to hurt me and when it finally ends, the first thing I do is hurt the first people to extend their kindness towards me. Why am I such a mistake? Whatâ€™s the point?
