I feel inferior to everyone.title. I can't do anything. 

I have no talents, no dreams, no inspiration. I have severe ADHD so I can't focus hard enough to learn things. I try to do my best but the days keep piling up one after the other. I was fired from my job right after I renewed the lease on my apartment, so I moved in with a roommate but I still haven't gotten another job. no partner, never had one and I can't see myself being with anyone anyway, but all of my friends have relationships. Some of them are getting married, a couple for them have moved in with each other and then there's me, just feeling like it's an unattainable goal.  

I feel left behind when everyone else started growing up around me. I'm only 20, sure, but I  still feel like an outlier... The only reason I'm still alive is so I can help my roommate out with bills. come september I think i'll just disappear.

I even feel pathetic making this post, it's so obvious that I just want people to pay attention to me. "ohh help me i have depression please talk to me" don't feel the need to reply to this, i'm okay if people just read it. I'm gonna go see a movie now. i hope its good.
