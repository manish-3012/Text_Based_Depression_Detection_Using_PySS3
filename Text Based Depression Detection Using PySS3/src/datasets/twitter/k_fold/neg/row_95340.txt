I am giving up on this lifeI have tried everything to love myself but I got nothing. I basically wake up with the idea of jumping off of the building every day. I won't be anyone's first choice in this life. I won't even be my first choice. Fuck this life. I am too suicidal and I am self-hatred. I don't deserve any kind of happiness at all. Whether short term or long term. It doesn't even matter. People would become happier if I take my own fucking useless life. You will advice me to take therapies, which, at this point, will be very meaningless, because I have been on meds and therapies for 16 fucking years. Since I was 7 years old.  I am sorry but I cannot keep living and being a disappointment to other people anymore. I am sorry for everything that I have done to you guys. I don't deserve existing anymore. I don't even know what is my purpose in this life. Everything seems pointless in my eyes. Everything is just about black and white. No other colors.
