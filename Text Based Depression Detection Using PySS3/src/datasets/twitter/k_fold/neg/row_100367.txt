Iâ€™m slowly building the doses up so I will dieThis night I took 200 mg of Fluoxetine. Next month, on the same night, itâ€™ll be 300. The next 400, the next 500, then 600, 700, and so on. Iâ€™m hoping Iâ€™ll be dead by January, since once I reach that point Iâ€™ll also start mixing it with alcohol. One month or the next, I will, finally, die.
