Is it selfish to stay alive?ðŸ¤”I have some serious disorders, most prominently narcolepsy. I'm 17 and I felt so lonely I started to open up to people, and make friends. I also have some pretty close friends too. My problem is that I'm just such burden to have as a friend, propably more to have as a boyfriend( the reason I don't want to get a girlfriend). While I can get better at controlling narcolepsy it will never be cured. I just want to defend people from myself, but I can't be lonely anymore. I thought about suicide, but I'm afraid it could cause trauma in the very people I want to protect. I'm too weak to just cut myself from people. Wtf should I do?
