Please helpThis might not sound serious, but I feel totally alone...

I never had any good in my life. People always treated me as a dumb person (foreigner kid from unknown country, perfect target for bullies). My mom moved out half a year ago, my father doesn't care, my siblings ise me as a slave. Nobody ever really asked me, if everything is alright.

I go to an only boys school now, but there is a programme with an only girls school. Well, I fell in love with one of those girls, but she doesn't really care about me. This makes it so hard, I can't think of anything else but her, she is the only reason why I'm still here. Two days ago, she called me a selfish asshole. The reason was, that I askes her, if she considers me as her friend. I think she just hates me. That leaves me with only one friend, who is really supportive, but can't help though.

I don't want be hated anymore. I just can't seem to find any other options, but suicide.

I can't live anymore, because I'm stuck with the only thought, that my only loved one can somehow still be my friend, eventhough she hates me. Why do people hate me? Why don't they want me as their friend? What can I do?

Someone please help...
