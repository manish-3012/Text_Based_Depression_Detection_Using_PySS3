My boy friend is having a serious case of suicidal thoughts. I'm begging for helpMy boy friend, texted me he wants to "pause time". after much discussion i found out he wants to disappear, to commit suicide. this happened only an hour ago, i am at work and barely can handle this, he's completely gone insane.

I started with the usual "How are you sweetie" when he told me he was doing bad, we talked about it for long, he is completely dead inside, any kind of advice i give him doesn't matter to him, he instead pulls out a way to harm himself with it, i told him to go out and run at something like 4 am, he told me he'll wear black and run in streets so he gets run over.

he's gone to the point where even stuff like "If you die i won't live without you" doesn't even matter to him, he genuinely doesn't give a fuck it i killed myself, he is completely outrageous.

what's wrong with him is that he feels worthless, he feels like the world would not change if he wasn't in it, i told him i couldn't live without him because he changed my idea of "not needing to love" he taught me to love, he handled my worst mental breakdowns, he cooled me down on my periods, if not for him i would've definitely been cutting or even killed myself. he didn't care about that, i told him he feels that way because his life is an endless boring routine, wake up, go to school, get home, play video games, edit his videos for his channel, eat something, and go back to sleep after talking with me for a while on the bed. that's a horrible routine, i told him to take a hobby, he accepts the idea, the proceeds to ruin every single suggestion i give him, it's like he doesn't even want to be helped. i asked him why he wants to die so bad, he said he's not afraid of dying, because he's an atheist, i am some part of an atheist, i believe in god, hell, heaven, but im not a muslim nor christian nor jewish, i do not worship anyone. anyway i tried convincing him about hell so he atleast gets scared of dying, stop being dead inside, he just shouts at me to stop forcing him to believe such bullshit, and threatens me to block my number if I don't stop. i stopped.

then i started talking deep, i told him i want to disappear with him, to come over and hug him, forget this whole world exists and let our souls touch, he liked that idea, then i talked about hell again, still trying to make him scared of dying, he doesn't want to, and interrupts me, he got really angry, i decided to go back and talk about hobbies or a change of routine, i told him to sit at the doorsteps and watch the stats at morning, before the sun even comes out, breathe fresh air, relax.. He just says "No". I started shouting "Why does this have to happen, why do you have to be sad, why does your perfect smile have to be buried under all that?" he didn't reply, instead he said "I liked it when you told me to forget about the world and let our souls touch, don't use that often, if you do it'll lose the touch of it, and become plain and boring" i said okay and then we stayed silent for a while, then i asked him if he could promise me something, he said he will not promise to stay alive, i told him to promise me to not harm himself, he said okay, then said good night, i said "I love you" he said he loves me too, i said i love him more, he said be loves me most and then immediately said gn after, i told him i love him more, he said false and said gn after again, i said i can prove it, he told me to go on, i said i would carve his name on my thighs since he likes them so much, he told me not to, then i told him I'd carve his name on my arm, he told me if i harmed myself that way he will "carve his bloodstream out" then said let me sleep, i told him i don't want to, he told me to let him, i said no, he said "Jennifer, i want to go to sleep" i said no again, he said he's blocking me, i pleaded not to, then i said please dont leave me, please don't cut yourself, please don't kill yourself, please don't leave me that way, he shouted "jennifer let me fucking sleep" and that im killing his sleep schedule, which will make him do bad in school, and if so happens he's stabbing himself in the stomach, i said please go sleep, please dont harm yourself, im sorry, he sighed and hung up.

What i think is wrong, is that he feels he doesnt want to exist of something that happened with him and he wont tell me it, he's been really stressed, we've been together for quite a while and I've never seen all that from him, im really worried, he's always been cold or cruel, sometimes he would ignore me for days because he wants something from me, but he's not a bad boyfriend, he's my everything, and that's out of many situations we've had before, i cry alot to him, i vent alot to him too, he solves alot of my issues and problems, he's always there for me, he's sweet and loving, i need him.

i am not a smart person, i need this help, im literally retarded. please help me, what do i do? this is a hard sitatuon, i don't know what to do.
