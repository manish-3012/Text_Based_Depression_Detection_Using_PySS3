I really wish I wasn't an atheist.This whole week has been a self pity party. I've been undiagnosed with a random illness, which everyone thought was Celiac. Except, now my problems are coming for no reason at all. A new lovely symptom is my hands and feet sweat non-stop. It's disgusting. This, on top of being tied to the toilet all day, is really killing my self confidence.

It doesn't help that my girlfriend and I broke up a week ago, and she's been with someone new every night. I know we're broken up, and she's not cheating on me, but god it hurts to think about. So much. She even tried to make out with one of my best friends, which is apparently ok because they're both girls.

I'm starting college on Wednesday, about 3 days from now. I'm really not finding the motivation when my health issues might cause me to drop out. Yes, I'm seeing a doctor. No test can find anything yet.


I just wish all this suffering had a purpose. I don't want to just suffer and die and that'll be it. I want to know that there's some meaning to it all -- that everything that's happening to me will be built up on some karmic exchange and soon I'll have a good day. But no matter how much people shit on me, I never seem to get a fucking break and all my problems get worse regardless.


Most of my day I spend in bed and in misery. I keep looking up suicide bags. Some people just have shitty lives and die, and I think I'm probably going to be in that group.
