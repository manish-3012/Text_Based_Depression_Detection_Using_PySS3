Really tired of ups and downs, too proud to medicateSo I'm pretty sure that I suffer from bipolar disorder and have a family history of it. I also have absolutely no desire to seek medication for it, because I've seen some really awful examples of people who go on to live empty lives, dependent on an artificially-engineered drug to dull their brain into a stasis.

I'm also suicidal, and have been ever since I was 12 or 13. I've never attempted anything, mostly because I chicken out. I have a girlfriend who knows about my problems but doesn't really help me with them. She thinks I'm being dramatic and doesn't want to baby me. I'm also emotionally dependent on her and can't really function without her - she's basically my only friend, knows too much about me, wouldn't leave me alone if I broke up with her. 

So, I guess I'm just asking for some nice words, or something. I dunno. Similar experiences, someone I can talk to. I really want to see a therapist, but I can't afford it, and I don't want my parents to know about my problems because I don't want to burden them. Yes, I understand that committing suicide would burden them quite a bit more, but. I'm capable of a lot of cognitive dissonance.
