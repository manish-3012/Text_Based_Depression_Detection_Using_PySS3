Job search is opening old woundsSince I dropped out of college about four or five times now, Iâ€™m stuck working a dead end job. I work pretty much 6-7 days a week overnights.
I asked for one weekend a month, my manager told me, I donâ€™t deserve weekends.  The job makes me feel miserable, jaded and hating life and I have been there for a number of years. I want out.

So, the suicidal tendencies are not about the job, I came to the conclusion that I needed to find new work outside of this hell hole.

Iâ€™ve been applying to jobs over the years but never in such a dedicated manner like this summer.

Iâ€™ve been on 32 interviews. I average one to two in person interviews a week, with a few phone interviews every now and then. Iâ€™ve had some amazing interviews for positions I definitely did not deserve a chance at. Iâ€™ve also had some shit interviews.

Iâ€™ve been rejected by them all. I guess I didnâ€™t know it was impacting my mental health until around interview 15. It went from â€œoh, it will get better, more opportunities and the economy is strongâ€ to thinking of a means to an end. Today was rough after leaving an interview and getting a personal rejection email from another job where you eventually start thinking, there is no hope.
