Fed up with things, need adviceSo for the record, I'm in community college and I'm living at my parents home because of convenience for all parties involved. Ever since I was a kid my dad and I have never gotten along. He always accuses me of lying to him about things in general, always assumed messes around the house are my fault, and seems to think he's God's gift to mankind. He constantly belittles me, calls me entitled without ever explaining why he thinks that, and verbally abuses me. This has occurred ever since I was 14. He also is emotionally abusive, and I have consistently thought about and considered suicide. However I do not possess a means to commit suicide, and I always stop myself from attempting to kill myself because even though I absolutely fucking despise my father for the way he acts, I still care about my mother and my dog. I absolutely wish I could end my miserable life, but even I don't have a means to do so or a plan of action. I'm going to sleep on things and check back here in the morning.
