I just want to dieI was diagnosed with BPD and broken up with all in one week and I see no point to living anymore. I feel like Iâ€™ve always got the short end of the stick I donâ€™t know what I did to deserve the childhood abuse and neglect I was only an innocent child I didnâ€™t ask to be born to then be abused for years leaving me with an awfully painful psychological disorder..

I met my ex at a bar who has so many narcissistic traits, I donâ€™t know what I did to deserve running into him on that night out and us being attracted to each other. 

I donâ€™t see the point of going on because this diagnosis probably forever, the only reason Iâ€™m not offing myself is because itâ€™ll destroy my family and my sister would go into such a horrible depression she wouldnâ€™t be able to look after her young kids. It just feels like Iâ€™m continuing to live to keep others out of depression while my own pain and life is getting out of hand. Iâ€™ve been in bed for weeks now, takin antidepressants and anxiety medication so I can go to work but been missing so many days of work while my ex seems to be doing just fine, hasnâ€™t checked on me once even though I ended up in the hospital the day he broke up with me heâ€™s on his merry way after triggering the fuck out of me and at this point all I really want to do is just fucking die thereâ€™s no point to any of this
