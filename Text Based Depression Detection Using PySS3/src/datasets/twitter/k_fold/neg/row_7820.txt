Iâ€™m caught in a depressing vicious cycle between wanting to kill myself and not doing it because I believe itâ€™s selfish and unfair to family/friends.To make it worse, I have nobody to blame but myself. My thoughts dwell on missed connections, opportunities, and romances that have left me a single 25 year old male who wasted the best years of his life. Iâ€™m not encouraged that life will get better. 

Iâ€™ve got a college degree, great job, friends, and family but aside from how nice that looks on paper, itâ€™s a degree I coasted into without much effort, a monotonous job that doesnâ€™t pay enough, a friend group where everybody lives/works in different cities, and family that Iâ€™m connected with yet uncomfortable in emotional moments. 

Thatâ€™s the reality of my perception but everybody else probably sees a completely different story.

Iâ€™m starting to take back my life in a sense that Iâ€™m stepping out of my comfort zone. Iâ€™ll be moving far from home shortly, driving across much of America, transferring with my company, and living with some of my friends. I have optimism Iâ€™ll find some success and turn things around mentally.
