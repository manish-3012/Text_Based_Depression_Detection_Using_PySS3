"so many good people in this world die, why don't you die?"
Those words came from my very own mother, I hear them more often than you'd think. I don't know when or how, but I just want to die at this point. I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for years. They are scars in my head that I know will never heal, and hearing these words from the person who dumped me in this hellhole frustrates me due to the fact that suicide is much easier said than done. It frustrates me so much so that I feel like grabbing a knife and stab myself to death, that's no exaggeration. She's chosen to yell, mistreat, and abuse me rather than seeking a different way of dealing with trouble or some small mistakes. And that has made me so violent. This world only cripples over time, there's nothing worth living for.
