Why do I keep trying to live?After all sorts of drama I think depression has just about caught up with me. I'm done, I can't keep this up anymore. I talk to friends who end up abandoning me because I'm too pathetic to get help. My mother didn't take me seriously when I tried to tell her what was going on. I hate who and what I am, and I become envious of almost everyone else. Maybe finally I can end this useless path.
