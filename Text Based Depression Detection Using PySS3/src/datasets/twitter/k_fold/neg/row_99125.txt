I've been fighting this for too longI've had major depressive disorder (or bipolar, or general anxiety, or avoidance disorder...the fact that I get a different diagnosis every time info to a new counselor/psychiatrist does not help me to trust mental health professionals) for over 10 years. I'm tired of fighting it.

I've tried everything, and I've never been able to break free. I don't have the money for a real therapist, and I've given up on counselors. Sometimes I can go a while without feeling actively suicidal, but it never takes much to put me back down. 

A lot of the most common advice you hear about depression/suicide/etc is "Just hold on a little longer, it gets better." It doesn't. At least not for me. I don't have the worst circumstances, some shitty things have happened, buy nothing that compares to some of the stories I've seen here. I'm aware of that. That doesn't get rid of the problem though, not sure why people that say those things think it will help. 

Anxiety prevents me from enjoying myself, from connecting with people and having real human relationships. The only friends I have I worry about driving away with my problems, it's happened before. 

I wonder if it's even my circumstances that make me feel this way. It seems that way from my perspective, I can look at events in my life and see how each one broke me a little more. But maybe I'd still be suicidal, even if everything in my life was perfect. Maybe, deep down, I'm just fundamentaly damaged.

I'm lucky now if I get even 1 good day a week. Of the bad days, more and more are as bad as they get. I've gotten good at telling when it's coming, like having joint pain before a storm. I notice music no longer sounding like music...it's just noise. My thought slow down, I get tired. Twitchy. My anxiety makes me itch, everywhere. It gets harder and harder to pretend. I can't focus. A loss of lucidity, a loss of self. 

Rationally, even when I'm not actively depressed, I don't see much point in going on. I'm a failure, and in more than a few ways. College drop out, couldn't handle my mom getting sick. Then I got fat. Pretty sure I've got a full on eating disorder at this point, so that's great. I can never finish anything, so even the stuff I am most passionate about...writing, juggling, comedy...at best I become a mediocre amateur, never good enough to make a living doing the things that I actually enjoy.

Used to enjoy, that is. Sometimes, in the moment, or even in one of the rare stretches where I have a spark of hope, I begin to feel those interests stir to life again. But it's fleeting. Most of the time, I feel little or nothing. Going through the motions, just drifting on the momentum of a time in my life when I wasn't dead inside.

I'm pretty disgusting now. Probably no shot at having another real relationship. Not that I should be looking, as screwed up as I am. Connected with a girl, we tried going out, but she just didn't find me physically attractive. Not that I can blame her. Still, I took it pretty hard. I didn't say anything I regret, but I shut down, cut off all contact, tried reaching back out once I felt I could, nothing. So that's another friendship I ruined. 

It takes so little to send me down now. And so many things lurking on the edges of my consciousness, ready to throw me over the edge. Twinge of tooth pain, meaning I probably have to go to the dentist, a painful experience my uninsured ass can't even afford. My addiction, I can't stop eating and drinking soda. So much of my money goes to junk food, but most cooking is beyond me when I'm depressed, I can barely boil water. My car, I got by on the clunker my mom left me for ages, it finally gave out and I had to get a new car on short notice with terrible credit. I can barely afford the payments...and I can't afford the sales tax I'll need to pay in a month when my plates expire. I haven't done my taxes since 2008. Which is hilarious, considering all but maybe one of those years I would have gotten returns. I'm sure I would have found a stupid way to throw that money away regardless.

Even at the best of times I can barely function as an adult. And my failure in even the simplest of things just adds to the exhaustion I feel all of the time. I want to sleep. So of course, I'm a chronic insomniac. It's not too bad, though it's what I use to get out of work, since people believe you not sleeping easier than anything mental health related. 

I'm so tired, all of the time. I wanted to wait until my cat passed, it's honestly the only thing that kept me going. I'd be dead a dozen times over if I didn't feel obligated to keep him happy, being my mom's cat I inherited. But I'm slipping, and I think ultimately it doesn't matter, just another failure.

I ordered a packet of pure caffeine. Heart attack in a bag, just a couple of spoonfuls. Maybe not the most pleasant way to go, but it beats trying to jump or hang myself, and I won't risk killing innocent bystanders. 

It's been sitting on my pc desk for weeks. I don't know if I can stop myself from taking it. I just want peace, even if it takes oblivion to get it. Maybe drive somewhere nice, enjoy the view.
