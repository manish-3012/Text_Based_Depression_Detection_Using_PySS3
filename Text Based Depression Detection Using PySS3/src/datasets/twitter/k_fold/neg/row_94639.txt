ResearchI just got out of therapy where I talked about how I can't connect with people.  I don't have any plan of how to combat this, but it sure makes things hard.

Yesterday I was looking up information on the method of suicide that I'd use if I were to actually follow through with the ideation I had two weeks ago.  

I'm just feeling really sad right now.
