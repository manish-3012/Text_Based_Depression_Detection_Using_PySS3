A formality at best.So, here I am yet again, contemplating suicide, as I do from time to time. This the final one.

This time is different though, so much has compounded recently I dont know how much more I can bear.

So mum has cancer now, and has less than a year to live. My brother has muscular distrophy, and he has about 5 years to live. My sister has leukemia, the final stage and soon will leave this realm too. My step father is dead, died last year. My best friends leave to Washington in a week.

I used to look after my brother and mother, till last year it became too much and I had to let them go, mum to a nursing home and brother to a disability group home. 

My sister lives in another country and is supported through their health system, as best as can be.

And heres me the healthy one, I wish I was dead, wish I had a terminal disease.

I'm currently indebt, student loans are &gt; 100k, I have so much credit card debt, and I just lost my job, again. I cant handle this, its too much. I no longer can afford to make any payments, I dont know how I will pay rent this month, so will be on the street in less than a week. I have no one to ask for help, and no where to live.

I want to end this stupid existence, there is soon no one left for me. 

The love of my life, isn't the love of my life and never will be, he only likes fursuiters, and since I dont have the money for one, I will never be able to have one.  Plus I'm too old for him, too ugly, too fat.

I try looking for a mate elsewhere, but to no avail, no one is interested in me, how can they be, I'm old, fat and ugly balding creepy man.

I no longer want to handle life, I want to be gone, dead, I've thought about ways to do it, car accident, electricution, etc.. I'm nearly there with my planning, it will happen today. 

This is merely a formality, not a cry for help, more a last moment to say goodbye to the world.
