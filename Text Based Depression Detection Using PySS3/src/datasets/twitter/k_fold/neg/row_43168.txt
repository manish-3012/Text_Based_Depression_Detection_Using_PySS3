its getting close!! hype!im close of not caring anymore about the people around me and finally kill myself. i always get anxious when i think that ill make people sad if i kill myself, its been 10 years of this now. every time im about to jump or make the cut i think of my racist, homophobic, transphobic, religious cunts parents and how they would be sad and i really hate it. i cant bring myself to just not care and hurt them because i know how feeling like shit is BUT!!! im close now babeey!!! havenâ€™t had one fulfilling relationship in my life (im 22 now), im fat as fuck, closeted trans, an immigrant and never had any friends!! havenâ€™t cried in like 3 years now no matter how hard i try, i can feel everything boiling up and i cant wait. if anyone can push me id be grateful xoxo
