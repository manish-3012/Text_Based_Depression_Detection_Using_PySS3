I think about it too muchI'm a pretty normal  guy aside from the fact that my body is covered in a nevus which leads me to not only have abnormal skin diseases but also suffer from the mental disease it brings me. What pains me the most in life is that my family thinks nothing of it. I've gone through hell and back with my parents and still they have no clue what it is that drives my aliments. Yes I have suffered from drug addiction been in and out of rehab for using marijuana and dabbling in others. But I have more than enough of a legit reason for using the plant for my painful cysts that I get everywhere. That's not the point though what really makes me want to just die is that my own flesh and blood parents have zero sympathy for it. They act like my drug use has been just another teenager smoking pot to get high. I know I can but I shouldn't have to get a medical card. I just want them to come up to me one day and hug me and tell me they are sorry for me. They think my medical issues are bullshit and that's the reason I feel like just offing myself just to write that note and maybe they'll get it after that.  I've dropped out college because it wasnt for me someone who has no confidence or social life. I am finally getting some mental health help with meds to keep me sane. I just got a job and plan to just get the fuck out and smoke that plant that god put here for people like us. But shit man I think about just ending it to show them how stupid and oblivious they are to their own son :(
