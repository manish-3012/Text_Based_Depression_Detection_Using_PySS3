Writing it down for the first timeLately I have been wishing I was dead. It comes and goes, and no one knows I feel this way. I haven't felt the urge to kill myself, and I don't have a history of self-harm, but recently when I feel down I often think how easy it would be to make it all go away by going to the bathroom and slitting my wrists or walking in front of a bus. I haven't told my therapist because I am afraid what would happen - I know, what might happen if I don't tell someone could be worse. 

An ex who completely abandoned me came back into my life recently, but after a short stint she said that she found someone else with whom she "sees potential" and now she is no longer in my life. This, coupled with strained relationships with my family exacerbate things. My overall unhappiness and underlying depression are definitely deeper, stemming possibly from adolescence. My hopelessness is growing and I am getting tired of coping and pretending like I things are okay.
