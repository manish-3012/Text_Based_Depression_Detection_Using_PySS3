Just want to be at the end of my rope alreadycan't take much more of this life. at least 45 hours of my week is spent being treated like human garbage by users that i support and being stressed out on an understaffed team that keeps shrinking. i had a way out of it though by working hard and giving up my lunches to get moved to another department until that headcount got cut because working in IT for a company isn't profitable to the company so the budget cut all open headcount for non sales jobs. i can't manage my stress and i bring it home and i feel like shit after being destroyed by users yelling at me and calling me an idiot and that our team sucks because we don't help soon enough. i come home and then feel like im just a pile of shit there feeling like im always in the way with my wife and if im sad it ruins her day and i have no reason to be this way because she has so much more stress with school and there are people that are worse off. i admit im lucky to have a job and roof over my head and food in my belly but its getting fucking harder and harder to deal with it all.
