I shouldn't feel like this but I do... And it feels, so right? (Ready to end it all)Very jumbled thoughts and emotions. Breaking point right now.

I don't like living anymore. I hurt the people around me whether I mean to or not. I ruin all the wonderful chances I have to fix things and start over. I lie to everyone I can't help it. I have thoughts of suicide a lot. I'm a horrible person of what I think of doing to other people. I might as well be completely honest. I think of people I find attractive and have thought of raping them. I know very much this is morally wrong and terrible. Why do I think it often then? I don't mean to hurt the people I care about. The thought of death is so tempting. What's on the other side. There's only one way to find out right? I just want to be happy for longer than five minutes. I only feel alive and like I have a purpose in this world when I do something to risk my own life. The adrenaline flows and natural instincts kick in and its wonderful. Then it all wears off and I'm just me. Useless in the world. I could end it all. It would affect less than 50 people. I really am just ready end it all. I am a horrible person and I don't deserve to live anymore. What sane person would hurt who they care about and think of such horrible things? I have no purpose which is why I don't want to live.
