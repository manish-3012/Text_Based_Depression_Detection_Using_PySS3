I (20 y/o) canâ€™t handle living in my own body anymore.(Tw : eating disorder).

Due to severe depression, i reached my highest weight this year this year (iâ€™m 152cm and was 58kg). In the meantime i had severe suicidal thoughts and attempted a few months ago, but my weight/ed wasnâ€™t the primal cause of it.

I relapsed and iâ€™m now 54,4kg. My entire days are centered around how many cals iâ€™m consuming and working out. It took off any suicidal thought from my mind for a while and i plan to lose WAY more.

But today, i got fat shamed. I never even was fat shamed at my highest weight and i really feel like ending my life. I canâ€™t handle living in my body anymore. I hate every single inch of me.
