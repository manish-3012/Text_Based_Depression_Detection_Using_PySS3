Sick of this question mark exsistenceI hate that I have no real justified reason to feel the way I do and yet year after year I keep getting hounded by this nagging that my existence it pointless. I'm getting so tired of having to argue with myself. I've pushed away everyone that's every loved me and in my solitude the only things that help are grand fantasies about reinventing myself and dreams about the future. But even that doesn't have the same hold on me as it used to. I fear that it'll be like this always.
 I've tried before and I still have the rope tucked away in my room. There urge is back but at the same time I'm so scared of trying and failing to go through again. Currently there's a building in mind but yet I still desperately want to believe in a break from the cycle.
