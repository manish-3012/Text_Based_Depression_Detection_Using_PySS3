My body rejects me. death cometh &lt;3not a poem cause, "poetry is creepy"

Today has been fun, got rejected by lauren. no big deal we are still friends, but cayde and Danielle are gone for good. my fencing master has drifted far away, a smart move on his part I must say.

in anycase, I am supposed to work a 9 hour shift but ive been here for over 11 because I just cant stand going home and sitting in silence. 

new problems arrived though idk what happened perhaps im possessed but about an hour after asking Lauren out I suddenly felt my mouth feel weird. like it was filled with mucas or crÃ¨me. weird enough on its own but it tasted like wrought iron so I went to the bathroom and spit out a ton of blood. this made me incredibly light headed. but I cleaned up the sink, went to my car brushed my teeth and went back to work. no need for alarm. it happened again after working out during my lunch break but since hasn't. I think my body is rejecting me haha.

I also sprained my thumb 2 weeks ago. or so I thought I think its broken because it hasn't healed any and still hurts like a bitch when I try to use it. good thing I don't need it for my job. 

Emergency rooms however are super expensive and even with insurance I cannot shell out 200-250 right now. 

oh well the good news is I don't have to worry about commiting suicide, my body is rejecting me on its own!! must be allergic to my soul ;D oh happy days &lt;333
