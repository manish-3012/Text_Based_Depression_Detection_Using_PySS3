I'm walking around, knowing it's overI've alienated my friends, I haven't gone outside for more than 20 minutes in five days, the prozac won't work anymore and I'm thinking "what's the point?" I walk around knowing my time on earth is pretty much over. The only reason I'm living is for my parents. What is the point?
