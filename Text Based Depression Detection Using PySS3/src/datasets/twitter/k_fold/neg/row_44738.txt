Someone to die withSometimes I feel like all I need in the world is someone who feels like im at least worth dying with. I feel like all the people Ive met in my life don't give a damn about me, and its my own fault. All my insecurities make me doubt im worth anything at all and I feel like im not even a person worth caring about.
