I don't love me, and why should I?I've been struggling for almost a year now. Just to give a quick backdrop to my life: I was engaged to a woman that I had been with for five years. She broke off the engagement about 7 months into it. Four months of grief later... I wanted to look for someone else... It must have been too soon because when I found a girl, she ended up pushing me away as well. It was like one major rejection - and then a follow up one just to reinforce the idea that I am - worthless. I've been crashing ever sense.

I look at myself, and then I look at many other guys and wonder what it is about me that would make me any better, or simply different (but in a good way...).

I am not a 'pretty boy' by any means, yet not ugly... So I'm not the worst, but not the best. Again, why should any female desire that? I go to school and do well, probably top 25%, but again... there is someone better. There is always someone better. That notion is defeating me.


How am I suppose to gather confidence in myself, if I don't even love who I am? This is really hurting my own existence... I want to be desired, and maybe in the past that's why I loved being in a relationship at all. Someone wanted me (And I wanted them so they felt like someone worthwhile, and their opinion mattered...). Because when I have been in a relationship I find myself motivated, passionate and useful. I want to work hard - for them.

I just can't do it for myself, loving me is the hardest thing. I feel so alone when it's just me. I don't have funny conversations with myself.....Does anyone? I can't 'surprise' myself, or be interesting to myself. It's me.. just me.
