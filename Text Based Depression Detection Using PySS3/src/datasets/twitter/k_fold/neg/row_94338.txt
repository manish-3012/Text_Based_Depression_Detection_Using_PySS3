In NovemberIâ€™m six tries in now. No more fucking games.
2020 has been the worst year of my life and I am fucking TIRED of waiting and trying to make it better and fucking sick of convincing myself Iâ€™m happy.
On November 12th, 2020, I am killing my self. I donâ€™t care what it takes, how painful it is, how many tries it takes; on my 33rd birthday I am checking out.

No more fucking pussying out; time to take control of my fucking life and end it when I want, before I become one of those miserable ancient lonely men I see at bars with nobody in their lives but the next drink. I decided this two days ago and GodDAMN has my life improved; every moment is like itâ€™s laced with opium, enjoying every second because I know my time is limited.

I donâ€™t recommend anyone else kill themselves; this is a deeply personal decision for me. But holy shit. The level of relief.
