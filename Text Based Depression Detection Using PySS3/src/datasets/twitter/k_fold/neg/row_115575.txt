In about 7-8 hours, I will be history!The belt and note are ready. I've given most of my precious clothes and shoes and those that survived have been properly arranged. As far as I know, my homeworks are done except leaving. I'm so excited that I will be out of this 2 years mess. 

Why suffer more and die later when I can shorten my suffering and die now with my own terms.

I wish you guys a success in whatever direction you went.

Take care guys!
