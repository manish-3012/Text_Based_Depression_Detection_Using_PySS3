Watching myself slowly die.I'm not even sure what to do anymore.  This isn't me.  This isn't my life.  I stopped taking my meds today.  I don't want to get better anymore.  What was I even trying for to begin with?

Iâ€™m only 27 and I married the wrong man.  I donâ€™t love him.  We are not compatible.  I tried to leave him before and start a new, but he tried to kill himself and begged to come back.  I cut off all ties but he found me anyway.  I took him back and it was the biggest mistake of my life.  Now were married.  I refuse to procreate with him.  Iâ€™m not dragging other human life into my misery.  He says he loves me and he cares, but his insecurities and esteem make it impossible for us to coexist.

His debt is following me.  They found my number.  Collectors call every day.  I answered the call one time because I did not realize that it was a collector.  My husband became extremely upset with me for answering the call.  He said that I made everything worse because they know how to contact us now.  I donâ€™t answer my phone at all anymore.  He owes tens of thousands for student loans and he is pretending like they donâ€™t exist.  He gets angry at me when I try to help.  Iâ€™ve given up on the subject.  It will be the ignored weight on our shoulders until the day I die.

My dog has fallen ill.  I have drained my account trying to save him, but now I am out of hope.  It breaks my heart seeing him lay on the floor not moving or eating anymore.  He is going to the vet one more time tomorrow.  Then I am taking him back to the shelter for good.

I have two cats.  I will ask a friend to watch them for a few days.  I need them to go to a good home and I will know that they will be happy with her.

Iâ€™m not even sure why Iâ€™m writing this down.  Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m even posting this here.  I just needed to see it I guess.
