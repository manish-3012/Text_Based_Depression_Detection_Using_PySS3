When you've spent years trying therapy and meds but still want to kill yourself what do you do?TLDR at the bottom. 

I've tried 6 therapists and probably around 12+ meds by now. I've seen 4 different psychiatrists, tried group programs and even been hospitalized. I've been getting professional treatment for close to 6 years now and guess what? It's done absolutely nothing for me, I've only gotten worse

So then what? Nobody ever fucking knows, they just say "see a therapist" and then when you say you have they say "see a different one" and then when you say you've also done that they don't have anything else to say. 

Treatment doesn't work for everyone and I really don't think it ever will for me. I'm exhausted with all of it and I've given it way more than enough effort by this point. I skipped my last therapy appointment because this therapist is a bust too but I think I'd literally rather die than try a 7th fucking therapist in 5 years because I'm not comfortable with any of them.

I've also stopped taking my meds now for about 2 months and not surprisingly I've seen absolutely no change whatsoever. They might as well have been sugar pills for all any antidepressant has ever done for me. All that's happened with me quitting the meds is I've saved a lot of money.

So yeah treatment doesn't work for me and never will, and nobody has a damn thing to say about that.

I'm just going on my own now as long as I can and if I kill myself then so be it. I'll try to survive without therapy and meds, in whatever kind of life that may be better or worse, and keep suicide as an option. I have the noose tied and ready. I've had it for a really long time as my escape plan, so if this doesn't work out that'll be my next step and I'm not afraid of it anymore. 




TLDR: Giving up on treatment because it doesn't work anyway
