Not quite sureI have never really contemplated this before. But tonight seems especially dark and over whelming.

I donâ€™t want to be one of those people looking for empty superficial responses from then internet so i hope this is lost in the noise and isnâ€™t seen.

The only reasons I can see not to do it is my pets and husband. They would be lost without me and the hurt they would suffer from abandonment. My partner has lost two parents to this and it would kill him if I did anything.

I have always been the bread winner but lately with Covid and In my line of work the business is not doing well. My team are struggling but itâ€™s the design of what we do. There is continuous pressure to be better, deliver more, improve, nothing is good enough. I know itâ€™s why we are here but there is only lip service recognition for anything we do. I know we are not essential.
Will I have a job in a months time, will they want me in a months time or am I being dramatic. 

If it ended now it would be calm and peaceful. If I went for a walk and something happened would it be better. 

If I take a break will there be something to come back to. 

I donâ€™t need a response. I donâ€™t want a response.
No one must sees this. 

I have never thought this way before.
