I feel like a screw-up and my life will never get better.I donâ€™t wanna go into much detail because it is a court case but basically I was kicked out of my school for something I did which was really bad. I was sent to Juvi for 3 months because of it. It was just something stupid that a friend and I did because we were bored but it turned into a way bigger problem than just that. 

So Iâ€™ve been out of regular schooling since February 2018. Thereâ€™s a chance my friend can get to come back to the school but I canâ€™t. If I even set foot on any school grounds in my county Iâ€™ll be arrested. I have to take online courses and anyone whoâ€™s taken them before knows how shitty they are.

My mom isnâ€™t exactly the greatest help in the world either. Sheâ€™s always gone most of the day and Iâ€™m just left at home most days. She is also is somewhat verbally abusive and manipulative. Iâ€™ve had 2 friends since March 2018 commit suicide and coupled with everything else thatâ€™s happened in the past year I am just so scared of the future and I donâ€™t think I can take it anymore. I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m gonna do for a job or anything. I canâ€™t drive because Iâ€™ve never gotten my permit and I donâ€™t think I can until Iâ€™m 18.
