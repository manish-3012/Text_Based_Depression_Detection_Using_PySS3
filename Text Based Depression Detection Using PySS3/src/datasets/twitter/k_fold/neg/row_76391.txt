I don't know what's keeping me hereIt's been years since I've gone out and hung out with friends, or even just years since I've had friends. I miss being able to forget, if only for an hour or two, everything around me. I miss having connections. I miss my old self. I miss the girl who could act like an idiot and laugh and have fun. I miss not feeling like a burden on everyone I've ever known.

In times like this I remember my old childhood friend, who cried and grabbed my arm after she saw my self harm wounds. She never cared to talk to me after we started going to different schools, just like the rest of my old friends. I tried to keep in touch but they never wanted to talk with me or to hang out.

I feel like a brick wall. With school being cancelled, the tiny bit of social interaction I get is gone, except for online. I'm not online much anymore. I only really talk to my family now, but it isn't positive interaction. My father usually just talks about how useless his children are. He's told me before that he thinks about beating me so I have something to call CPS about, so that the rest of my siblings and I could finally be somewhere away from him.

He always apologizes afterwards. I don't know why. It's obvious that he regrets having me. I can't blame him honestly.

I feel like the only way to be happy, and to make others happy, is to swallow a bunch of old pills my dad found in the house and told me to throw away and hope it kills me. Maybe he knew I would keep them, and maybe he wants me to do this.

I don't know why I haven't done it yet, or why I'm venting/ranting here. I don't know what's keeping me from going all the way and letting my arm drain of blood.

I don't want anyone to feel at fault, unless it would make them happier (as I assume my dad would feel). 

Anyways, I apologise for making this post. And I'm sorry if I got anything wrong, or if this is against the rules in any way. I just needed to say something.
