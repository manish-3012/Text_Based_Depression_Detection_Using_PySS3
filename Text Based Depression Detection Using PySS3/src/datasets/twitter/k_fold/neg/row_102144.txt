Feeling suicidalI feel this ache..this loneliness..this deep sense of emptiness inside me. I feel it all the time but it's just come to the surface right now. I've had an argument with someone and I just genuinely hate everyone. I feel like everyone is out to get me..that they're against me...and it just makes me feel really defensive most of the time. I can't relax because I'm constantly wondering whether people will backstab me. I don't have anything to look forward to because I'm constantly worrying. I just don't see the point of going on anymore. And I know that I won't change my mind because I used to say to myself "oh I'll feel better eventually..this will pass" but it actually doesn't. I always come back to the same conclusion again and again so suicide is once again on my mind.
