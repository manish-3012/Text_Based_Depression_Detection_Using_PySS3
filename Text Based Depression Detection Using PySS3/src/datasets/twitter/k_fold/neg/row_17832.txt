Well, It was quite a Journey.I don't know enough about Life but It just seems like 99% of people hate me unanimously, Is it spiritual? I don't know and I won't bother to know anymore. I made a post before seeking advice and no one responded to it except a person who was just here for the same cause I had. I'm not really making this post to gain anything or seek help because It's already too late. Maybe the 1% left are just neutral about me. I don't need anything either way, I've had my share and realized that I should've never been here in the first place. Maybe there's someone out there like me that might read this and relate, Maybe there's not. No one can convince me to stop when all their reasons to negotiate are irrelevant to me, And that's how It's been for years.  I think I'll deactivate my account and delete my socials when I feel like I won't be able to take a breath in minutes. Thanks for reading and farewell.
