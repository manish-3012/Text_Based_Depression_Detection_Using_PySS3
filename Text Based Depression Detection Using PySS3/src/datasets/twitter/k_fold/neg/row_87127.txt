It's about that timeI made a plan on how I'm going through with everything. I have an interview coming up for a job and If I get it I'm going to make as much money as I can before I end it. I'll pay off my debt so my father won't have to. I'll leave the rest of my money for my ex who I know wants to get out of the cess pool of a town that we both live in. I also have some military friends coming home from leave for a bit so I'll have time to have one last drink with them. So within a few months I'll be ending my life. I'm just going to try and get through most of it with ending it to soon. I was ready to go before but I rushed everything. This time I have everything planned. If something does change then fuck me.
