i just wrote a notei just wrote a suicide note. its very short no explanation or anything just an apology. i dont know if i am going to use it. i just wrote it just in case i need to. 
i promised my partner i would check myself into psych before i did anything and that i would talk to someone when i see a nurse to pull my stiches on thursday. i dont think im going to kill myself. maybe i will maybe i won't. i dont know. i dont know anything really. all i know is that i am 600 miles away from those i love most and i cant get to them because the world is collapsing all around me. my partner said maybe i should come home. i cant go back to living with my parents, I just can't. my partner lives in a halfway house for eating disorders, i cant live with her. I can't live on one of my friends couches in their tiny apartments. if schools open back up i have a job here that i love. 
i dont know what to do. i'm hoping this will all pass. but i'm not so sure it will. my mind has been hell for 8 years and i dont know of i can take it much longer.
