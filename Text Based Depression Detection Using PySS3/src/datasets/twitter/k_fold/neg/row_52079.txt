I'm not gonna do it because I can't hurt my parents like that...but I just wish a plane would fall on me or somethingI am so monumentally fucking retarded. I've wasted my opportunities at every turn. I had so many chances to escape this third world hellhole and my abusive family just by applying to some colleges. But instead I chose to sit around and binge TV shows. Now I'm in my 20s. I feel like my prime is almost gone. And now it seems so hard to get to the first world and I'd have to jump through so many hoops that it's not even worth trying.

It's not fucking fair. Other people get to wake up to beautiful landscapes straight out of a painting or stunning cityscapes like new york. Meanwhile I have to wake up to a suburban hellscape, 40 C plus temperatures everyday (fucking unlivable), insane traffic, the possibility of getting robbed or killed everyday, and a thousand other things.

Why the fuck should I have to grind my ass off just to get to a first world country, when others are just born there to begin with? Why do I get an abusive, dysfunctional hellish family while others get loving and supporting ones? IT'S NOT FUCKING FAIR. I just wanna die. I just want it all to end.

Why should I have to work for the bare minimum when others were born with silver spoons in their mouth? I see people online complaining so much about late ubers or having their name spelled wrong on Starbucks and saying they hate their life. You fucking ungrateful pieces of shit. Live my life for half a day and you'll see what real pain is. You have no idea. No idea. I am so fucking jealous and angry. I just want to die.
