Fear about getting helpIâ€™m getting worse Iâ€™m not having the feelings yet again but Iâ€™m getting bad, sever recurrent depression ocd anxiety panic attacks ptsd. I look around and my life is falling apart I think Iâ€™m doing better then I see around me and see Iâ€™m worse. I donâ€™t have insurance but even if I wait until I have feelings Iâ€™ll end up back in place for 5-7 days. It almost sounds so nice. But I donâ€™t want to miss time with my daughter, Miss making money to pay for my stuff etc. I just want to feel normal and accomplish my goals. So my delima is what do I do? I know I need help, I donâ€™t know how I donâ€™t want to wait then if I do I donâ€™t want to be that bad again because it just makes me look really bad. Iâ€™ve never felt this hollow empty and distant but atleast not suicidal yet. I fear reaching that point again. Having uncontrollable thoughts.
