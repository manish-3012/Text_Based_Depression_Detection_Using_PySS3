I need some help.I messed around with the network at my school and DoSed it. I might be expelled, which kills my chances of going to college. My mom is saying I should not have been born. I locked myself in the bathroom, and I'm typing this from my phone, so excuse any misspellings. There is a massive bottle of painkillers sitting on the shelf to my left, and I'm feeling like I should just take them all and die instead of letting my future be destroyed. Computers are the only thing I'm  good at, so if I cant do that, then I don't have any way to make money. Help me not kill myself please.

EDIT: Thanks for the help - I'm doing way better now. I don't know if I wpuld have waited if not for checking for Reddit messages and people's responses. You saved my life today - Thank you.
