Everything is painI don't want to kill myself, I just want to die, to drift away as painlessly as possible. I can't get a job, I'm in five figure debt for student loans that went nowhere, and every moment that passes brings nothing but loneliness and more evidence that I will die alone. I honestly don't know what to do, if this keeps up I'm not likely to make it to the end of the year let alone old age.
