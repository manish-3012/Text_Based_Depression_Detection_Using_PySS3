I want to go to the hospital for suicide ideation but itâ€™s so overwhelming doing that when it shouldnâ€™t be. (My experience)Iâ€™ve been to the ER 3 times for suicide ideation and if I had to explain how it was in one word, it would be: overwhelming. 

First off, Iâ€™m placed in a hospital bed, to be then moved to the ER hallway (the hallway for people that have used self-harm, threatened suicide and or are mentally unstable). Now, I donâ€™t really care that Iâ€™m laying in a bed, in a hallway for people that are at risk of killing themselves, but I could see how embarrassing it can be for people. Anyways, you have to lay in your bed until a nurse checks up on you, possibly checks your vitals and or a psychiatrist might see you (but since the hospital is typically crowded, it can take up to 2-3 days for him or her to see you.

The 3 times Iâ€™ve been there, you have to wait in your bed for at least 1 whole day (or night) to be then placed in the adult psychward. One time I had to wait 3.5 days until I was placed there. That means, I had to lay in my bed, in the hallway, with very bright lights (meaning itâ€™s very hard to sleep, and not to mention itâ€™s loud in the hallway and still pretty loud at night). Itâ€™s complete torture if you ask me. I donâ€™t think I will ever want to go there again, regardless of how suicidal I am, Iâ€™d rather kill myself in my own comfort.

I donâ€™t know how your hospital works but this was the layout: https://imgur.com/a/9Mj7nfs - keep in mind, the hospital beds in the rooms were meant for physical/dangerous patients and or people that need to be assessed by a psychiatrist.
