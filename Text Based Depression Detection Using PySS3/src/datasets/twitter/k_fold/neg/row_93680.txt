Feeling extremely suicidal because every psychiatrist/psychologist I've seen has been telling me that my depression "will pass with time"I feel so fucked up right now.

I've been seeing a psychiatrist for months and I started off so hopeful about improving because I'm a college student who just wants to live my dreams in life.

I started seeing her at the beginning of fall semester because my depression was at the worst it's ever been in my life. I can't even take care of myself or get out of bed most days. I feel cold all the time and nauseous. All my thoughts are anxious and scared.

Fast forward to the present. I failed a class and my psychiatrist's response was 'It's doesn't matter! You don't have to go to school! Not everyone does well in school!' Well I WANT A DEGREE. I WANT to graduate.

I feel so invalidated by all these 'professionals' who don't even listen to me. I'M SO SICK I WANT TO KILL MYSELF. I've never actually gotten to the point where I want to kill myself until now. There's so much I want to do but I reach out for help. I do EVERY step. I try to think positively. I do all the exercises my therapist tells me to do. It DOESN'T WORK. 

I'm on Wellbutrin at 150mg because my psychiatrist doesn't want to give me any other medication. Aren't psychiatrists supposed to consider all options for helping their patients? No wonder people in my position fucking kill themselves. There's no fucking hope anymore.

Depression WON'T PASS WITH TIME. My psychiatrist even told me she's sure that I have  persistent depressive disorder because I've been extremely depressed ever since I was a kid. But she won't diagnose me or even TRY ANYTHING OTHER THAN RELAXATION AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES. Literally every fucking person I've gone to for help just has me do this.

I'm so fucking angry because I'm assuming she thinks I just want drugs. I bet every fucking person I've seen assumed that. They're fucking shit at their jobs.
