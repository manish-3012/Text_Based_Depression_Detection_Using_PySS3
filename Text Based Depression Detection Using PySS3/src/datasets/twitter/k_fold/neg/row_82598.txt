I need helpWell, as I mentioned in a few posts before, I would be killing myself. Im 13 for more info. I told my parents, they told me that I was seeking attention and just wanted to get out of the activities they forced me into. Well then, I guess they will see. I have been told these things: You just want attention. I  have it worse. Go to a doctor. These don't help. I wouldn't be here on reddit if I could get professional help. I trusted you enough to tell you my issues and you can only try to one up me? If I wanted attention I would blast it to the world, and I am an introvert. Screw this. Im done.
