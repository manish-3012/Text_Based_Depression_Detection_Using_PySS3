I am my own worst enemy.I've read a lot of posts here from people saying that they feel like failures and overall, suffer general sadness.  I can't imagine what it's like to have such strong unavoidable feelings and not know why - My heart aches for you all and I really hope that you are able to work through it.  Despite my own desire to jump off a cliff, I do believe that it gets better when you're able to figure out the root of the issue. I have the opposite problem.  I know exactly what's wrong with me, but lack the skills required to fix it. 

I am an (generally) upbeat, outgoing, talented girl in her late 20s.  I have a beautiful home, a smart, funny, handsome, supportive boyfriend, and a good job.  Over the last little while, I've become a shell of the person I'm capable of being and it's because I've finally realized why my life is so messy. 

I have become aware that I am never going to achieve the things I want to in life because I lack the self discipline and organization to do so.  I was happy before - becoming aware of this is what sent me on my downward spiral so please don't tell me that these things are caused by depression. I used to just lalala my way through life and since I'm a talker, I could get myself pretty much whatever I wanted.  Then I get bored, my other traits kick in, and it all falls to pieces.  To put things into perspective:

- I'm constantly forgetting things.  I make plans and then double book, I misplace important things (keys, cell phone, purse, etc.),  I pay bills late when I have the money.  I have tried so many different ways to keep myself organized but none of it has ever been successful.  

- I'm late ALL the time. This has cost me many jobs and makes employers incredibly annoyed. It's never "oh, I slept in."  It's more that I don't understand the concept of time and find myself rushing around like a maniac when I realize I'm unable to get them done in the time I've given myself.  I'm never very late, but 5-10 minutes a few times a week can definitely cost you a job. In turn, I repeatedly tell myself what an idiot I am for not being able to get somewhere FIVE minutes early and save myself the embarrassment.    It also upsets friends and family.  

- I am incapable of doing something long term if I don't enjoy it.  I'm envious of the type of people that can say "My job isn't great but it's not my life.  I do this to allow myself time and money to pursue the things I enjoy." I can't.  I've tried, I'm trying currently and again, it's not working out.  I'm miserable.

- I am easily distracted.  I can't focus on things for an extend period of time unless I'm 100% enjoying it.  I have one particular hobby that I could usually do for hours (which shows me I'm capable, which actually makes me feel worse), aside from that I am constantly distracted and unable to focus on things I don't find interesting.  I don't drive because I fear that I'll hurt someone by becoming distracted. 

The combination of these things has resulted in my inability to follow through with anything in my entire life.  I have only had one job for more than a year - I dropped out of high school, driver's ed, and college - I have NO credit (I had poor credit for a while, but I adopted a mentality that if I don't have money for it in the bank, I can't afford it) - I don't drive so I rely on others.  In fact, I am CONSTANTLY relying on the kindness of others.  It's not fair to anyone, I feel like I'm taking advantage of them and that's not the kind of person I want to be. 

Currently, I know that I hate my job and I should get a new one because it's making me miserable, but what's the point? I'll just fuck up the next one.  I thought about going back to school but why bother?  I'm just going to end up with a fuckton of debt and no degree because I won't finish.  I want to pursue my hobby but I don't have the organization to make a career out of it and it's not something you can go to school for.  I also don't have the discipline to muscle through the "unfun" parts in order to achieve my goals. 

I constantly fail, therefore I am a failure.  Coming to terms with who I really am and realizing that these things aren't going to go away is what has left me paralyzed with sadness and I hate myself for being this kind person. If I know I can't fix it, what's the point of even living?
