Is there a point for people like me?I'm lazy, overweight, short, boring, and have no personality. I feel no connection to anyone else and can never seem to open up to people. No one needs me in there life. If I were to die tommorow no one would give a shit especially me. I don't think I'd really care if I got in some tragic car crash I died I really don't think I would. I have nothing keeping me here.
