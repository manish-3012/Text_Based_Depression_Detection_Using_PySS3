Every day I think I will be different, but I'm not.Every day I want to kill myself. I overcome it. But why do I even bother? The next day I will want to kill myself again. I wish I wasn't afraid. I wish I hadn't overcome that I had just gotten it over with. I don't know. I'm desperate now. Right now I just can't live anymore. So why am I even putting this here? I guess I don't want to die. I just want to feel better. I just want to feel better. I have to die now. I have to have the courage to do it. It's the only way to feel better.
