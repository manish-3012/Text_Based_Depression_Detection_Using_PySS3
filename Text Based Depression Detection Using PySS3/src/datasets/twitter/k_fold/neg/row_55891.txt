Please help me before I cross the line from panicking to suicidalI get incredibly over attached to people I'm interested in and every tiny thing they do makes me unable to function because anxiety.

I can't stand that I feel terrible when the guy I like hangs out with his friends.

I can't stand that I can't stand it when he goes to work or takes a nap.

I can't stand that I worry when he doesn't reply for a few hours even if I know why.

I can't stand that I need to know a specific time that he'll be back to function while he's gone doing something.

I can't stand that I can't tell him these things.

I can't stand that I feel this and we're not even officially dating.

I want to cry. He's at his friend's house right now and it's 11 PM with school the next day. I'm pretty sure he's sleeping over, on a fucking school night.  What could he possibly be doing there? I'm literally shaking. I get like this on a regular basis and it causes me to want to isolate him from everybody. I'd never do it- I know that's incredibly fucked up and even abusive, but I constantly have to suppress that desire. I hate this so much. How do normal people just not care what the people they care about are doing and not worry something will go wrong?

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
