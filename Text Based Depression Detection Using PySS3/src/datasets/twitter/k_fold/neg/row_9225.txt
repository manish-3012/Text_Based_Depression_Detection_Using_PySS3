I am very close to trying something.I need help. I have been suicidal for many years. Attempted but failed once two years ago. As a child I was abused and neglected by a sorry excuse for a mother and no father figure. I have no family and very few friends, none of which I can talk to about this.

I'm tired of being me. Because of my childhood I've become such a hateful person. I get so angry because of the people around me but I have no way to let it out. All the people I loved I've lied to and hurt. It's because of my own actions that I'm alone. I lost the love of my life because of my own ignorance. 

I have no skills. No talents. I never graduated from high school because my mental state was driven into the dirt and I couldn't get work done. I make a fool of myself everywhere I go. Whenever I look back on the past, be it memories of my childhood or just recalling recent interactions I have the overwhelming desire to pull a knife out of the block and run it through my neck again and again. Constant fantasies of blowing my brain out. Nothing can distract me anymore. It never ends.

I can't afford therapy. I'm nothing but a hateful, ignorant, lying coward. I've found a way to give myself a fairly painless death and I'm very close to acting on that plan. I don't want to have to die, but the mental suffering just doesn't stop.

Don't tell me "it gets better". It doesn't. That doesn't help me now. I don't know what will. Can somebody offer any words?
