i wish i could just die before tomorrowfirst time posting here, i dont even know what to say, i just have no one else to talk to. 

i want to die so bad, and i have for so so long, but theres never been a time limit before. 

tomorrow, i break up with my girlfriend. shes not toxic, or abusive, or anything like that. shes wonderful in every single way, and by far the sweetest most kindest person i met. i just feel nothing anymore. i dont understand how it happened. i was so happy for two years, so so happy. she was my world, and then suddenly she's just,,,, not my love anymore. i dont love anyone else, i dont think i want to love anyone else. i just want to die. if i just died she would never know how i felt, she would think that i loved her and never even know that i lost feelings for her.

but im a coward. im a shitty, stupid, coward who doesnt even know how to tell her girlfriend of over two and a half years she doesnt love her anymore. why me?? why couldnt i have been one of those smug bastards who meet the love of their life in highschool? why cant i be mentally stable for once? im going to crush her, she loves me so much and i just cant do it anymore. i have no one anymore. my best friend moved away, and we're both shit at texting, my girlfriend lives 9 hours away, and i feel like i cant even tell her anything. im just so scared. what if she insults me? calls me out for being a coward (I am) or ugly (I am). im not attractive, im weird and annoying, i know that for a fact, im never going to find anyone ever again. im just going to be alone, and hopefully i can just keel over and die.

i just wish i didnt have to do this. ive never been broken up with before, and ive never broken up with someone, i dont even know what im doing. if i had the strength and will to kill myself, i would. 

just so tomorrow can't come.
