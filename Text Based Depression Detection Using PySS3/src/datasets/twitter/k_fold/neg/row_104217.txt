Just how it isIt's kinda fitting that the only reason I'm not dead is because of my own incompetence. 

Attempt 1: gun was jammed and I had no clue. Chickened out after it wouldn't shoot

Attempt 2: my hand was shaky as hell and I missed the shot to my own damn head. Chickened out again

Attempt 3: I fucked up tying the nooseðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸

I don't want to attempt again, but if I do, let me succeed ffs, this is pathetic, even if fitting.
