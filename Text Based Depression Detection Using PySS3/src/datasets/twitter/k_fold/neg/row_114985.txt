I can't see myself alive next year.So I recently failed out of college. My sophomore year. The root of my depression stems from my sexuality, as my parents simply cannot accept it. I finally came out to them after Thanksgiving break, before I went back to school, and it went awfully. I sobbed myself to sleep for a week, and starting constructing plans for my suicide. 

My attempt however, failed. A suitemate heard me crying and screaming in my room and got my RA involved. However, I still cannot see myself living next spring. I can't see myself doing things like I normally can, almost like I have subconsciously already planned another suicide that I will act out at some point. 

Does any of this make sense? Has anyone had these feelings before?
