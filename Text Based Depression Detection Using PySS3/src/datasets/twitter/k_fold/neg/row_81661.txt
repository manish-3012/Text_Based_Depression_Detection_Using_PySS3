I wanna get off Mr bones Wild rideYesterday night I wrote my thoughts about the current state that I am right now, in this subreddit. But I canceled my post as it just looked like collection of rambling.

Anyway, I know that this has been repeated many times here. Just as I had thought that the sun will shine better tomorrow, there's always something that keeps me down. I tried to be grateful for everything I have,  but there's always something that slaps me in my face. And for that I realized that everything that I have now, will be lost eventually. The ups and downs in my life, only been fun for awhile. 

I'll break myself out till my body can take no more. And I hope it happens before I truly lost my soul. In the mean time, I'm still planning on last everything. Last meal, last music, last cigarette, last words... 

How's your day?
