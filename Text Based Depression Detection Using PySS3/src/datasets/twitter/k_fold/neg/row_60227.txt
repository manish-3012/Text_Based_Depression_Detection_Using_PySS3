swamped with regret and self loathing. suicide feels like the only way out.i obsess constantly over past mistakes. i beat myself up over the way i used to treat people. i hate, hate, HATE the way i look. i hate who i am, who i used to be, all of it.

i've been self harming but at this point i just want to die. i don't want to have to feel anymore
