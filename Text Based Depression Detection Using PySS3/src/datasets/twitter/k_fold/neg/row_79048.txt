Not yetMy first girlfriend cheated on me, she said it had nothing to do with me, she enjoyed the relationship and thinks Iâ€™m nice just didnâ€™t find me attractive enough. I try to stay nicely groomed. This was 2 months ago and since then everyday I told myself itâ€™d get better. I have 2 good friends and attend college. One of my friends are normally too busy to do anything with me, even talk to me and schedules things with other people over me, Iâ€™ve tried. The other one is just a terrible person that I only stay around because Iâ€™m lonely. Therapy didnâ€™t help, anti depressants didnâ€™t help. Ive been attempting to make a conversation with someone new once a day, still not a single person showing a slight of interest in me. Iâ€™ve joined local clubs and groups hoping to meet a friend and always leave feeling lonelier. My depression has worsened to the point where I donâ€™t find enjoyment out of my normal hobbies such as video games or running. 

My last day of work is Sunday and Iâ€™m going to kill myself when I get home that night. The reason Iâ€™m waiting is my work  has given me everything I have in life and is my only drive to live for as long as I did. 

Iâ€™m set on my decision. Iâ€™m posting here for attention mainly, I stopped going to class and play fortnite till I have work. As petty as it is having people feel sorry for you feels good, I always enjoyed receiving attention and since Iâ€™m never going to receive positive attention, Iâ€™m okay with it being negative.
