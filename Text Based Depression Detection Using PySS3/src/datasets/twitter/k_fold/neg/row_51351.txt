Is there a way to give up on life without killing yourself?Iâ€™m in an abusive family. My country (the us) is turning into a shithole. I donâ€™t feel safe whenever I leave the house. Iâ€™m struggling with Gender Dysphoria and who or what I am. Iâ€™m a bad person who just stomps on everyone who tries to help me. I donâ€™t want, deserve, or care for any aspect of â€œLifeâ€ right now But thereâ€™s one person who cares about me. If I kill myself, he will follow within a couple weeks. I donâ€™t want to condemn him to death because I couldnâ€™t handle some shit. Is there some other â€œgive yupâ€ button?
