Canâ€™t copeI really canâ€™t. I know no one cares. I know it doesnâ€™t matter. I donâ€™t want to die, even though I think I should. I really donâ€™t. But I canâ€™t make anyone understand. I canâ€™t keep pushing. My migraines arenâ€™t migraines. Itâ€™s Trigeminal neuralgia and itâ€™s here every day now for hours or all day. Even without that, I couldnâ€™t. I canâ€™t. I wonâ€™t. But I donâ€™t want to. I keep reaching out but itâ€™s the same thing every time. Ignored, not understood, waste of time. I have no answers, no solutions. I canâ€™t go through more decades of this. Itâ€™s only getting worse. My heart races so fast and everything feels scary. 

I was never given a chance to be okay, to be normal. Just take it all away, help me make it go away, please
