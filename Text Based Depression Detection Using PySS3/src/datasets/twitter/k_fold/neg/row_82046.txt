My Girlfriend, the thing that gave me hope, just left meMy moments of my life were spent with her. She got me off my depressed ass to the doctor, got my GED, enrolled in medical school. I had a trip planned to California to visit  family. She broke up with me over text from 2200 miles away. Now Iâ€™ll have to watch her fall in love with someone else and have that wedding we always talked about and the house we always talked about. I slept last night and had no dreams it felt so good. I wonder if killing myself will give me that sleep again. Iâ€™m desperate to know. 

My dad looks at me with disgust, my mom blames me for her drug days, my brother barely looks at me. I only have her, had her, I have no one now. I live in a state I hate. I donâ€™t blend in well. 

I think I could disappear and no one would notice.
