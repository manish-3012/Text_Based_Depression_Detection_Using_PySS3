Iâ€™m on the vergeI donâ€™t really know what to do. Iâ€™ve been thinking that my life is to chaotic from the choices that Iâ€™ve made to handle anymore. I have a kid and I only see him for a week every month.lots of very long car rides.  I pay so much in child support itâ€™s hard to keep up with everything else. Rent bills etc. My roommate is an old high school friend that I hooked up with years ago. And now Iâ€™m dating her friend(for almost two years) and these two girls wonâ€™t talk to each other and are really not friends any longer. I thought I had hurt someone in my past? But they tell me they donâ€™t remember anything that I said we did. And told me that itâ€™s in the past. My fucking cousin died in a car accident last month and his memorial was yesterday. All my family was a mess I saw a few manic mental breakdowns. I hate myself for the wreck less choices Iâ€™ve made in my life. To the point where I canâ€™t even see the light at the end of the tunnel. I feel like somethings coming to get me. And I just want an escape. I thought about letting go of the wheel when I was driving home today. Iâ€™ve been contemplating on what the cleanest way would be to do it. And it scares the shit out of me that Iâ€™ve been thinking about killing my self so often and so much these past few weeks. I need help
