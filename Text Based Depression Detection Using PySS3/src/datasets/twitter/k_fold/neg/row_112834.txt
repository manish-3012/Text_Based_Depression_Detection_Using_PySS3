My life is going fine yet the only thing that makes me feel even slightly happy is the thought of ending itIâ€™m 17 and have been struggling with ever worsening mental illness for a few years now, I always thought that the reason I was depressed was because my life isnâ€™t going good at this point in time, but after some thought, I realise my life is just fine, itâ€™s my brain thatâ€™s getting more and more sick. 

I have the grades I want, not many friends but Iâ€™m happy with the ones Iâ€™ve got, Iâ€™m successfully sorting myself out after a long period of depression by going out more and re-decorating my entire room, yet I still feel horrifically depressed, much worse even than before. I feel like living in this world is hell and that I donâ€™t belong here. I feel no sense of happiness or emotion towards absolutely anything, Iâ€™m always locked inside my own head, Iâ€™m ruining the small amount of relationships I have left through depressive episodes and intense anxiety. 

I used to be happy, even just a year ago, I was energetic and loved every little thing about life, Suicidal or depressive thoughts would never even cross my mind, but now itâ€™s the only thing that latches onto my thought process, no matter what Iâ€™m doing. I have suicidal thoughts all day and every day, not because my life is bad, but itâ€™s the only thing that gives me a little rush of excitement, the idea that I can just end this nightmare at any time. 

I just want this nightmare to end, I want to find whatever light was shining over my life before, I just want to feel something, anything.
