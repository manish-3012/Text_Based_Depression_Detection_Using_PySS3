I apologize if this isn't allowed. I know the sort of help I'm looking for isn't allowed here, but I just wanted to vent anyway, as there's not that many other places where I can do so.My life is awful. 

My life is pain. 

I'm never getting a childhood.

I'm never getting a normal life.

And I can't accept that.

I can never accept that.

My life is never going to "get better".

But a bunch of morons on the internet believe they know better, and try to lecture me on why I shouldn't end my life.

My life is never getting better, suicide is the best choice for me, but every time I'm given the chance to end my life I'm too scared to do it.

I'm sick of people telling me I shouldn't end my life, to get some help, that things get better, that everybody's life is precious.

My life is NEVER getting better, and no amount of strangers on the internet can tell me differently. I need to end my life, it's for the best, it's helpful, it's the right thing to do. Think of it more like putting me out of my misery rather than a loss. 

I don't want to gain the will to live, the will to live has only brought me more pain, it has never once helped me, which is why I've stopped listening to people who tell me otherwise. I want to gain the confidence to end my life. I don't want to stay in this world any longer, I want to be put out of my misery for good, in any way possible.
