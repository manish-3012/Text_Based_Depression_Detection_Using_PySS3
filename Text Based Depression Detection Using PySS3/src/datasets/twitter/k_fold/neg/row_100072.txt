Ive decided to kill myself. Not any time soon though.Ive decided to kill myself, but next year after I graduate with my masters. Getting my masters is the very last thing I wanted to do with my life. Well granted there were only 2 things I ever wanted to do with my life, get a degree and get published (never thought in 2000000 years that anyone would ever be crazy enough to publish me, so I was shocked something fierce when I got the email). 

Anyway, originally I was going to kill myself on saturday, but I thought that would be rash and not a well thought out plan. So I just picked next year.
