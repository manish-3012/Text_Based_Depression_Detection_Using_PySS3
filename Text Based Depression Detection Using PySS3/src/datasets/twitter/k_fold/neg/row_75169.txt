No one can prove that there is a reason for me to live.Recent I tried finding a hobby, spent 1000$+ on things I would need. Every single thing I bought was a fucking piece of shit. Now I have 100$, I am ugly, never had a girlfriend, have no real friends, have no chance of ever finding love, I think Im gonna end it soon. Reddit was my pass time, I liked the memes, now I feel zero emotions and I'm watching people fucking die with no emotion.
