Feel as thought I'm letting everyone down/a burdenLately I've felt that life isn't worth living.

I'm a 21 year old male at college with a girlfriend, friends a job and a rather loving family.
But I hate my life and just want it to end. I'm failing my course because I'm too fucking dumb and I can't bring myself to put in the effort.

My girlfriend loves me and I have a good amount of close friends but seeing them brings me no joy. 
I'm close to being outed as a failure to my parents and I don't know what they'll do when they find out.
All I feel is anxiety - like I'm constantly on the verge of a panic attack. 
I just want to go back to a time when I didn't have so much pressure on myself. I can't handle people's expectations.

I think about suicide every single day, probably every single hour. Whenever something bad happens, no matter how minor, I feel an instant compulsion to just shoot my head off.
I can't go on like this, because I can't see pulling myself out of this slump of no motivation and no aspiration. 

I just want it to end. I always told myself that if I ever felt like killing myself I'd run away from home first. Like, pack some stuff and get on a flight, or drive to another state and see what happens.
But now that I'm in a position to contemplate that, I won't even do it.
No money, no real desire to see any more of the world. So I figure I should just kill myself.
And I know it will be bad for my family and friends, but honestly, their grief is not quite enough of a deterrent. 

I want to be happy, but I don't think I can, and I can't go on like this.
My suicide note will be simple, an apology. Sorry for being so shit at life. Sorry for letting you all down.
Thanks for reading.
