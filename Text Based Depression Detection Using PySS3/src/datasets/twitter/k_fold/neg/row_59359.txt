My brain is broken.My brain is broken.  
Iâ€™ve always been this way, and I probably always will be.    
Got rid of all the drama â€“ namely, a life where I have to deal with coworkers and dysfunctional siblings â€“ but Iâ€™m still miserable.  
They werenâ€™t the problem.  They just drew out symptoms of my problem via my emotions.  
If my brain is broken, *I* am broken.  My heart keeps beating but I donâ€™t know why.  Iâ€™d like for it to stop, my heart and all the pain that comes with life.  Because I canâ€™t repair it.  All I can do is keep going deeper down the hole, and at the end is death anyway.  
Do you hear how broken I am?  It doesnâ€™t make any sense, but it makes perfect sense.  I donâ€™t function like other people.  Iâ€™m a shell with no family, no friends.  I donâ€™t understand people, and I donâ€™t understand me.  I reach out, I push away.  It has always been this way.
