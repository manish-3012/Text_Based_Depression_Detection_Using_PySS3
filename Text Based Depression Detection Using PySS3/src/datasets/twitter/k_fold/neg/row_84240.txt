Offer: A PenppalI'll start with this: I have been in your shoes before.

If you're here, chances are something is really bothering you. Maybe you don't know who to turn to, maybe you don't have friends that you can trust revealing information about your health. Maybe you just want someone to talk to, but you want it to be someone that doesn't know you at all.

I've walked the same line before, and I know how shitty it can be. I am humbly offering a listening ear and  friendly advice to anyone that wants a penpal to write to.

Writing can be extremely therapeutic. Writing to another person can be all the better: sharing stories, experiences, and advice is something I value highly, and I feel that a lot of people that come here could benefit from it. Personally, I love writing to people and I am always looking for someone to talk to. You can be as anonymous as you would like to be--I won't even ask for your real name if you don't give it to me. All I ask is that you send me a PM with your email and as much as you would like to tell me about yourself.

I'm offering a helping hand to whoever may want it. If you want a friend, I would be happy to be one. This offer extends to anyone that may want it, just please send me a PM with your email (reddit account works fine, too--whichever you prefer) and I will send you a letter shortly thereafter.

I hope this finds someone that is really just looking for someone to talk with. I've lived a pretty crazy life so far (I'm sure you would find some of my stories pretty amusing) and, like I said, I have had battled my own big, crazy brain before.

Your friend,
