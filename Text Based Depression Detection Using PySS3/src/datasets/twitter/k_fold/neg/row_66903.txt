These are not my thoughts and feelings. They're ruining my life.Please help me. I feel like I'm being invaded every time this happens. I want to be happy, I am usually happy. My life is great. 

So why do I have such horrible thoughts? Why do I fight with everyone and keep thinking about killing myself?

I feel like I'm trapped in my own head. I call the resources but I can't explain anything. My life is good. Why don't I want it anymore?

Edit: please help me understand? I need a name or something. What do I tell doctors? I have no hunger, no position I'm in is comfortable. I have headaches and cramps. My skin feels like it's hypersensitive, it hurts when I tOuch it. And these thoughts. I'm trying so hard to leave my house. I'm making every excuse to get away from the things I could use to hurt myself. But I'm so tired. I tried reaching out to friends but I can't express why I need them. They think I'm just bored. Please help me. I need this to stop. It's ruining my life I can't keep doing this.
