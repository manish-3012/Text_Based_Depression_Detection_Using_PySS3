I seriously want to fucking hurt or kill myself whenever I study.I think that is one of the biggest issues why I still haven't graduated yet and why I'm still a fucking loser. Whenever I study or just think about it my stomach fucking turns upside down. I never want to kill myself more than when I study so I avoid it as much as I can. It puts my depression and anxiety on crack. It emphasizes all of my flaws, how fucking stupid I am and how I'm just a useless piece of shit that just studying can break in half.

And the worst thing is that I have to fucking do it because if I don't then it will stay worse and keep being worse. I'm forcing myself mentally so I can hopefully get something done and stop living this pathetic, shitty, miserable life but honestly I just want to fucking kill myself non stop when I study. I get stuck and I feel like a useless fucking failure all the time.

Fuck school. Fuck subjects you didn't want to study. I just want to die. I'm not going to kill myself but I really really really fucking want to when I have to study.
