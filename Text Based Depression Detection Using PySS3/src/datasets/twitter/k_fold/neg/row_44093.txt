Just fucked up my whole life.Just turned 18 and got a great job - decided tonight that I'd try some graffiti on the top of a local school. Why not?

Ended up getting caught and charged with a felony. Guys, I don't know how to deal with this - I'm scared, and I don't think I can do this alone. That's it. One fucking mistake, and now I'm a felon.

I've struggled with thoughts of suicide in the past, but now there's nothing I want more than to just end my existence. Imagine it, seriously. All the stress you have? Gone. Everything? Gone.

Honestly, I have nothing to live for. I don't want to take this day by day. I don't even want to take it minute by minute, or second by second. I can't even start to describe my self-hatred right now.

**EDIT: After sleep and medication, I feel better and am nowhere near considering suicide. What I did last night was stupid, but after comfort from r/SuicideWatch and a couple hours to get my nerves settled - I feel confident enough to cope. Thanks everybody. I love you guys. **
