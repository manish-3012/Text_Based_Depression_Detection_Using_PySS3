High School and no hope for the futureHi I am currently an 8th grader going on to 9th grade and have been suffering a lot of depression. This depression has been impacting my academics sometimes I sit in school zone out and think what is the point of my life? I'm just like all the other idiots that surround me the world wouldn't miss me if I was gone. I haven't had much hope for the future lately because of the high school I am going to. Many people consider me smart but I fucked up this year and a little in 7th grade due to video games. I didn't do much of my homework in trimester three of seventh grade and I got my first C. I applied to various Boarding Schools for my ninth grade year Groton, Perkiomen, Canterbury (CT), Choate, and a few others I was accepted to some that I will not name and none of the ones I just listed which happen to be my favorites. I am currently planning to go to a school in New Hampshire this fall that gave me a full ride but I am not satisfied. I feel as though this school in particular will not prepare me for my future. What should I do next year as a freshman to prepare myself to apply to these wonderful schools. I feel like I have fucked up in some irreparable way and I don't know how to solve it... suicide has been on my mind a lot lately.
