#PHX Choosing life over love...I'm not from here, USA. I'm in a relationship here. It's mentally abusive. Constantly beaten down, ignored, hidden. I used to be someone else, bright, happy, funny. I avoid them now because they are looked down upon as being childish.

I've not anyone to really talk to; besides random texts from a friend who's out of town. 

I've no courage to call the relationship off. I'm too nice of a guy to leave. It's why I'm thinking of choosing my life; than end the relationship by leaving.

It has a tinge of revenge; for everything you've put me through, here is my fuck you, deal with it.

But I have choices, and had choices. I let this happen; let her treat me that way. 

Battered wives.... know it's not right, but can't leave.

Will you let me talk? I need to talk.
