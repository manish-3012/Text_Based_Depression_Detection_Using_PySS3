Thinking about clocking out.I've ruined my life already. Lost my first job out of college because of this depression. Went unemployed for a year before landing a warehouse job. Felt suicidal during that whole time. Only a week into this job and I have a sick feeling in my stomach before even going into work. I'm broke and can't afford to quit. I know this feeling always comes back to me and there's nothing I can do. Thinking about finally giving up. I can't take feeling like this anymore.
