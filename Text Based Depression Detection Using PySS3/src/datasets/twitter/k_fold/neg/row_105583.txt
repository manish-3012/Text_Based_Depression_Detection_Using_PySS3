Helping my Girlfriend.My girlfriend text me quite upset this morning as a long term friend of hers, who lives abroad in France, said that he is going to kill himself, because he loves mygirlfriend and the fact me and her are together is too much for him.

she said to me that he has a past history of mental illness and depression and she hasnt been able to get in touch with him.

I just want to know how to help my girlfriend as she's really upset and blames herself as she doesnt know whether he's ignoring her for attention? or actually gone through with it =[

Any Advice?

EDIT: the guy has got back in touch with my girlfriend, saying he's alive "but if it wasn't yesterday it will be another day"

she just told him that she doesnt need this and if he can't understand the stress he's putting her through, she doesnt want to talk to him anymore.
