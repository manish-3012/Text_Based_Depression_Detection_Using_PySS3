I donâ€™t feel anything anymore, and itâ€™s exhausting.This is probably just going to sound like teenage angst but Iâ€™m 17, and my life experience for the past few years, especially currently, has been one long emotionless void with the occasional overwhelming sadness and anger. I feel like my life is ending, itâ€™s my final year of high school and somehow Iâ€™ve managed to fuck it all up with my low ass GPA and inability to pick a career due to my crippling fear of debt and endless unhappiness in a dreadful office job. The future feels fucking suffocating and Iâ€™ve already given up. Iâ€™ve gotten into every college I applied to with my SAT scores but never responded to any of them, I donâ€™t try in school I quite my extracurriculars and I barely speak to any of my friends anymore. I come home, feed my pets, and lay in bed for hours on end. Iâ€™ve altogether stoped eating at this point and I donâ€™t plan to start. My OCD and attached Germaphobia at least keeps me performing some acts of self care but keeping clean is the extent. If I can sleep itâ€™s generally around 4am, 2 hours before I get up from school. I told my parents I didnâ€™t want anything for Christmas because I genuinely am not sure why Iâ€™m still alive. Bringing the endless cycle of unfeeling to an end and pulling the crushing weight of the future off my chest is the only thing on my mind most days. Im shocked I havenâ€™t just done, just said fuck it and got on with it. My girlfriend has no idea how Iâ€™ve been feeling, I canâ€™t tell her. My parents donâ€™t believe in mental illness and would only laugh if I were to describe what it is Iâ€™ve been experiencing. I think the only thing keeping me from killing myself is the pain it may cause my little brother and my girlfriend, and my cat wonâ€™t understand where Iâ€™ve gone. The days blend together so much I had hardly even processed how close Christmas was, which prevented my previous plans I had made as I donâ€™t want to ruin the holiday for everyone. I donâ€™t know what to do, I just want to fucking feel again, something that isnâ€™t a 10 second blind rage or overwhelming sadness. It would just be so much easier to end it all, Iâ€™d never have to come out, have to live out the rest of my life a disappointment, to spend everyday a void of a person. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me, and I donâ€™t know what to do, but I honestly donâ€™t my dead name on my gravestone. Iâ€™m sorry if this was incoherent, itâ€™s been so long since Iâ€™ve slept. This is the first time Iâ€™ve ever talked about this feeling or lack there of. Thanks for reading..
