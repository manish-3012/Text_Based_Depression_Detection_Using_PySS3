Is it normal to live with emotional pain?I just wanted to know if there is a name for this pain in the chest that wont go away and makes you feel like you live your life having to deal with it. 

No matter what I am doing I have this pain that feels almost like a lump in your throat that never leaves you and you grow so tired of the energy it takes that you just want to end it?
