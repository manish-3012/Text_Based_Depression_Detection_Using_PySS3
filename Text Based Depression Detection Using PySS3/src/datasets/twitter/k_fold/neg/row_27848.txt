â€ªHow can you go on living your life normally, unbothered and unconcerned knowing the last contact you had with someone you â€œloveâ€ was about them being suicidal? People are fucked.â€¬Just going about your day, updating Facebook posts, laughing, completely unbothered. Itâ€™s weird how love can turn to hate so quickly.
