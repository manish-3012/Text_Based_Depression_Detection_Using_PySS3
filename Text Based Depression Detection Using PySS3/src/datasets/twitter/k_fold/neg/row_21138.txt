My abusive boyfriend threatens suicideHello all, it's my first time posting on reddit.

Here's the deal: years ago, my boyfriend started to control me (by gaslighting, stonewalling, denying my needs, witholding sex and affection...) and everytime I'm depressed and tell him, he starts ignoring me to punish me. He can't stand his needs and problems no being at the center of the relationship and of my life. 
A few days ago, I decided that I have a right to feel my feelings. So I stopped making excuses when he asked me what was wrong ("I'm tired" "university is stressful") and instead I just told him I was depressed. 
He instantly started behaving like I was not existing; he does that until I fake happiness, do all the emotionnal work and put his hapiness at the center of our lives again, mine being optional. this time, I didn't. 
After two days (the longuest I ever resisted his cold war without crawling back) I decided to go see one of my only friends because I needed to talk about my problems and my boyfriend wouldn't. 

This night, after a rare nice day with my friend, I came back to a letter from his doctor (that he had left for me to find) where she mentionned he wanted to attempt suicide. 

I can't talk with him about my depression, but now I can't go talk to my friends either because I'm afraid to go home to threats or worse. I feel so alone. I have no one to talk to. I hid to exchange a few emails with my friend, but that's not enough for me, I'm very depressed and see no way out. 

If you wonder why I don't just leave him, I'm disabled, have no money to find a new flat, and am very traumatised by all of this. Plus, I still care about him somehow (well, being trained for years to see him as important and me as unimportant might have something to do with it)
