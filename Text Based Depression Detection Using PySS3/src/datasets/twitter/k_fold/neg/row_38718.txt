How is berating someone supposed to make them want to live?How is being told that I'm selfish, weak, and cowardly supposed to help when I'm already at the brink. I see this everywhere and I'm baffled. Imagine constantly feeling like you're being torn apart from the inside, and you desperately want the pain to cease. And instead of, at the very least, offering a listening ear, people decide to twist the knife. I don't get it. I truly don't. Maybe shaming people out of their feelings might work, but I have no idea how. I think the opposite of being suicidal was wanting to life and enjoying life. But it is not. It's having to live, forcing yourself to live, being obligated to live. You don't want to live anymore? Too effing bad, suck it up and keep moving, otherwise you'll be weak. Because there's no actual reason to live, you just do it or else you're a coward. 

What usually helps me is being assured that there are reasons to live, and if I just keep pushing, I'll find a way to enjoy life again. But I guess most people prefer shaming you. Shame is exactly what I need when I'm already in pain. I really don't know what I'm still doing here. Do I really want to stay in this world?
