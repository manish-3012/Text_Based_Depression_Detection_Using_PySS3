Iâ€™m actually doneI feel like my whole life Iâ€™ve always had a little bit of hope left that things will change or something maybe magically will take me away from all of this but itâ€™s not. I donâ€™t even care to be loved anymore I donâ€™t care to do anything anymore I donâ€™t care to get better I just simply canâ€™t . I feel like I just genuinely am a mistake I shouldnâ€™t be here I give up Iâ€™m ready to face whatever happens when you die atleast then Iâ€™ll be in control
