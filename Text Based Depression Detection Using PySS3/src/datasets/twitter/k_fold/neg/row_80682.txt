Suicidal thoughts but afraid to die.For the past year I struggled with suicidal thoughts due to a lot of issues in my life where I felt miserable, depressed like nothing was going right anymore. I couldnâ€™t shake the thoughts of what if I just done it, even done a minor attempt at it but quickly stopped and been self harming for a year as well. my life is still miserable but getting a little better. Although recently I keep experiencing these scary thoughts about death, not wanting to die, one day it will all be over etc which is strange because Iâ€™m only in my mid 20s and if Iâ€™m lucky (hopefully) I still have a long life to live, Iâ€™ve had that fear on and off for years but recently this is the most itâ€™s been so active on my mind and wonâ€™t go away like I just came to terms with the fact one day I will die and keep worrying like itâ€™s going to happen soon. Is this something anyone can relate to and knows how to overcome it, Iâ€™d appreciate it thanks
