Alone. Mute.I don't even know why I come here. I don't feel like talking, but I do feel like shouting. I feel like letting go and wrecking everything in my path. I feel so tense and frustrated that I can't do anything, for good or bad. I feel stuck in my head replaying the same old regrets and inadequate memories over and over again.

I want to kill myself with such a maniacal fervor, yet I know that I mustn't do it. I can control myself, but I sense how I'm slowly losing my grip on reality. I can quiet myself, but I boil and I crumble beneath that blank and dead stare. I want everything and everyone to shut up.

The world isn't meant for me. I'm too idealistic and naive, too arrogant and too demanding of others to be able to function in it. I'm slowly turning into a mass of seething hate targeted at humanity. I once let myself be spat on and ridiculed for the sake of "being good", but now, what kept me from doing unto others, emotional insight, is starting to wane.

I. FEEL. NOTHING.

I will die alone. I will die without ever feeling love. I will die without someone else ever knowing my true thoughts and feelings. I will die knowing that I was meant to be the "good guy", but fate took it all away from me. I will kill myself with such pity and disdain that my dissapointment will echo through the void. I will die with a self-ironyzing self-hatred as my last thought.

Can I, please, go? Can I? Can you not see me shivering a the thought of spending yet another useless day? How dare you tell me that I should live when you don't know just how much self-hatred I have? You cannot know. Nobody can. Only me. Me...
