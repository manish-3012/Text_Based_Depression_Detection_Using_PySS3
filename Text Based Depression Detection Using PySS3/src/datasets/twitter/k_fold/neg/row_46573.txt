I made a promise 2 years ago to actively try.Two years ago, I promised my best friend and myself that I would allow myself two years. I would give myself two years to actively try and get better. Itâ€™s approaching my date this coming Wednesday and I feel that I have ongoing-ly kept this promise. I have been to multiple doctors, tried therapy, continued my studies, got a job, stayed on medication for over a year and have also tried to make stronger connections with my friends and family. Yet, I still have no doubt that ultimately this is my fate. I want to thank my best friend for supporting me through so many difficult nights for the past 7-8 years of our lives. You have constantly sacrificed and put your life on hold to ensure that I was not alone. I want to thank you for staying by my side through everything, even when Iâ€™ve made it impossible, pushed you away, hurt you and gave you absolutely no reason to be with me. Thank you so much for trying so hard to keep me with you, and Iâ€™m so sorry that I am not strong enough to continue this journey with you. I love you and always will.
