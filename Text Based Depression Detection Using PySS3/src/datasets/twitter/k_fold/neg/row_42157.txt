I really just want to end it allI fucking hate living for real. I have NO ONE to talk to anymore. IÂ´ve lost my friends when time has passed and the more the depression gets to me. I used to go talk to a psychiatrist but I always pretended to be happy and I smiled a lot cause I hate bringing other people down and she said that I donÂ´t need to see her anymore EVEN THOUGH I HAD PROBLEMS AND SHE KNEW IT. I have medicines but theyÂ´re not helping at all, IÂ´ve tried so many but nothing seems to work, they just make everything worse. 

I hate my mom, my mom hates me, so does my dad. IÂ´m not close to my siblings and other relatives. IÂ´m alone. IÂ´m always alone and IÂ´m so fucking tired. I donÂ´t want to be alone anymore,  but IÂ´m too embarrassed to go out and talk to people about whatÂ´s happening in my life. I feel like IÂ´ve let every single person IÂ´ve ever met in my life down. I hate  my life so much that I canÂ´t even express how I feel. 

Why canÂ´t I just be normal. I want to actually feel happy and be good looking. I hate the way I look, the way I act around people, the way I sound like and mostly; the way I feel.
