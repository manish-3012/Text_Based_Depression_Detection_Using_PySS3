I can't live with myselfHi, I'm an 18 year old girl and I've been reading and relating to posts and comments from people who are depressed and anxious for 4 years now. 
I will be 19 soon and I feel worse than ever. 
I tried to make changes in life to get it together and be a functional being,but I keep falling back into those dark places.
I feel like life is not for me. I feel suicidal again, but theres is still a little hope within me. The problem is that the feeling of hope keeps fading and im already planning my suicide once i move out.
Im worthless, why would i need to stay if im the most useless person i know. I ruin everything. I can't do shit. 
You might say Im too young and i dont know what might come, but i dont want to know. I dont want to live with myself. 
Theres this toxic part of me that keeps getting stronger.
