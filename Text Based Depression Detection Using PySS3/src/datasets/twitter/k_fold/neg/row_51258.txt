Finding hopeI have learned to find hope that my life will get better and will become mine again. I know it sounds cliche I guess. I personally am in a toxic situation I cannot escape from at all. After searching for help from others only to no avail I realized The only one who can help me is myself. Im trying to learn ways to cope with the situation and ways to manage it to make it not as bad, also learning to find happiness in the little things to make my life the best it can be. I think that one day Iâ€™ll be able to make my life perfect despite all the shitty circumstances. Suicide is not the only option.
