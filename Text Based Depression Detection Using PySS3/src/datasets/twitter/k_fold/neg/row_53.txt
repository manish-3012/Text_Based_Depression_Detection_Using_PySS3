I want to do it but even finding a way to do this is difficult. This is the plan that I've come up with so far.Will it work? I don't want to stay alive but be disabled. I want this to work. Where I live, it's very hard for me to find a way to end my life without causing me too much pain.

Here's what I want to do:

I'll leave the kerosene heater on in the bathroom and keep the doors and windows closed to allow harmful gases to build up. I'll overdose on short acting and long acting insulin, and I'll take over 1g of propranolol, and maybe an antiemetic so I don't vomit the drug. I'll stay in the bathroom till I lose consciousness.

I'm 24 and I am a pharmacy student. The place where I live and my social skills - or lack thereof - don't allow me to get my hands on opioids, or other ways of dying peacefully. 

I'm not here to talk about why I want this. I know many of you know the feeling.

I just don't want to do it and fail and have to face family after that, or live with permanent brain damage. Please message me if comments are not allowed. I hope this is not against the rules.
