Iâ€™m lost in the road....Been struggling a lot. With heavy depression. I recently lost 4 family members. My grandma who raised me grew me up since a little boy and my 2 uncles and tia who was always supportive and encouraging. Iâ€™ve been battling a lot of health issues as well. People tell me to go ahead and do this and that and to get my life together and what not. But I havenâ€™t been able to properly jump start the vehicle. To get myself in place. My other uncle who I was close to as a kid and who I admire and appreciate a lot because heâ€™s always been one of those cool uncles just got diagnosed with cancer. Right now I just broke up with my girlfriend I said some shit I shouldnâ€™t have oh well. My parents they have never really been there. The one who I considered more a mom and dad was my grandma. Sheâ€™s the one whoâ€™d take me to the doctors in Mexico and what not. Now Iâ€™m left all alone. Iâ€™ve been dealing with these horrible suicidal thoughts. The other day I was actually thinking bout taking some Xanax and what not; bumping one of lil peeps songs (another song) and just driving off the expressway and seeing if that attempt would be successful. Thereâ€™s some nights I just break down crying and I break down in pain. Because of everything. Itâ€™s hard, it really is I canâ€™t control the thoughts and I donâ€™t want to go to a psych ward they donâ€™t help they just want to drug me up. Idk I guess itâ€™s all just so overwhelming. Iâ€™m constantly throwing up. Iâ€™m constantly faking a smile. Faking that Iâ€™m â€œokâ€. No one loves or fucks with me no more. A year ago all people wanted in with me now. Now no ones does itâ€™s ok though. Iâ€™m used to it. Oh well canâ€™t wait for 2021 another life in disaster and this pandemic doesnâ€™t help honestly haha.
