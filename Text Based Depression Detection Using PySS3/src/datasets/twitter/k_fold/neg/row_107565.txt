Kill meI can't do it anymore. It's too hard and I'm a coward who can't do it myself. Please kill me. It's so painful. I'm trapped in my own mind no matter what I do or who I talk to. Every time I think I get better, I fall twice as hard. I don't want to continue. Life is not a gift when this is the one you get granted.
