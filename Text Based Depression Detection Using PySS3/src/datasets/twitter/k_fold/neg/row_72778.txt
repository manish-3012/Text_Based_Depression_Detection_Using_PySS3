No one ever cares.I don't know how to say this any other way, but to put it simply, no one cares about me. I am sure others have felt this way, but I don't really know how to deal with this. Every person on this Earth deserves love, but I can't have any. Every day I wake up and I never have anything or anyone to live for, not even myself. I hate myself, I hate how I am, It's the reason why no one cares about me or loves me a single bit. I want to kill myself because I can't take it anymore. I'm so fucking lonely and fantasize about jumping off the highest building in my city..
