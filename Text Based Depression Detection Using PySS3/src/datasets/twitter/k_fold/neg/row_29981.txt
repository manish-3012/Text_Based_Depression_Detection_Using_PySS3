People Keep Wanting My Help But All I Can Think About Is Hanging From A Ceilingi deleted most of my social media not too long ago in hopes of getting a mental reset, but i feel myself slowly getting worse. someone had given my number out to people who were asking to get ahold of me and now i have friends and other people coming to me talking about how their negative thoughts and feelings and what theyâ€™re going through and i feel like a total prick because most of my advice is so shitty since i myself canâ€™t even believe what iâ€™m typing. all i can think about is going away and never coming back. i hope this ends soon. i hope we all get better soon.
