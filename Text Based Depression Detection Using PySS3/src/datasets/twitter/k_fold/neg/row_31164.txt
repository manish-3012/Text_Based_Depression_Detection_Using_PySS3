Suicidal thoughtsI tried to kill myself late July and failed ended up in hospital it was awful but I feel the same as I did then Iâ€™ve gone through multiple serves etc but I still hate my life and myself I suffer from extreme anxiety and depression and Iâ€™m scared to tell anyone how Iâ€™m feeling. I have extreme night terrors of being raped, kidnapped and killed. I want to live for my two new nieces and nephews but Iâ€™m finding it really difficult. I constantly think about slitting my wrists, slitting my throat, drowning and drinking bleach also taking tablets. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. It feels like the walls are caving in and I just donâ€™t want to live. I donâ€™t want to burden people with me problems but Iâ€™m in such pain everyday I hate myself for feeling like this. Iâ€™ve lost all my friends Iâ€™m not gonna do well enough at school and even the thought of school gives me a panic attack I feel so useless I donâ€™t know what to do anymore Iâ€™m trapped and I just want help please
