Gave Up Everything For One Girl Then She Fucked Me Over, Itâ€™s The Worst Feeling Ever!She is the perfect one. We got on really well. We accepted each other. We could talk about anything. We could do anything. I thought she was the one for me.

I know her since a year. There were two other girls I talked to. One of them wanted to be my girlfriend. Guess what I threw them away for one girl. 

She doesnâ€™t want to talk to or see me anymore. At our last meeting I kissed her. She liked it, but the next day she said she didnâ€™t want it to happen and now she doesnâ€™t talk to me. Wonâ€™t pick up the phone or anything. I spent a lot of money on her and it wasnâ€™t that I expected anything back. I did it, because I love her. Turns out she doesnâ€™t love me back. 

That night was the best night. All I can do now is be sad and think about how foolish I was to throw away two girl friends for her. 

Iâ€™m left alone. I was the kind person and now Iâ€™m fucked over. I want to die so fuckinâ€™ bad every day Iâ€™m feeling crappy. Whenever I fall in love I always get fucked over. This is the fourth time. Iâ€™m tired of this shit.
