Looking at funeral options for the first timeI've been here before, I'm just not getting better. I'm looking for a new counselor and I found one who seemed great. We set our appointment and I gave her my history so she would know a bit before our first appointment. It was supposed to be at 6:30 today. About an hour after I sent the email she replies that she replies, "After reviewing your response, I feel that I may not be the most appropriate counselor for you to begin working with.
 
It would not be ethical for me to work with any client that I feel is outside my scope of practice and experience. This is strongly emphasized in my profession and when this occurs, as it has before, I am to provide referrals to these individuals whose presenting concerns are outside the counselor's ability/expertise."

I would understand if she was just out of school or something, but she isn't. I picked her because of her experience. 

So apparently, I'm too messed up for her to even help me. It just makes me feel so hopeless. I've tried so many counselors without a good fit. I just want someone who can help me.

I'm looking into planning my own funeral. I don't want my family to be burdened with that. It's sad to think about, but I'm not even crying looking at it. Ok, maybe a little. 
I'm planning on making videos for special people in my life, saying goodbye and explaining everything. To me, I have a fatal condition known as depression. It's no different than someone dying of cancer or a heart attack. My illness is taking over my body and I can't stop it.
