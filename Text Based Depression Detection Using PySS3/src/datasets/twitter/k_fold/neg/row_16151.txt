I hate myself, but "everyone else" cares for me.I despise myself so much, I just hate how I make so many dumb mistakes and how I do things. I'm scared of death so I won't commit suicide, and everyone else cares for me, and I don't want to hurt them emotionally. I'm trying to do things that I like to get my mind off of my lack of respect for myself, but I would want some tips to get me to stop bashing on myself so much.
