If I had a friend that would be there when I needed them, maybe I wouldn't feel suicidal again.I'm much better than I used to be. I've tried so hard to get where I am, but I don't feel like I can progress anymore, I feel like this is where I'm stuck at forever now.
Stuck feeling depressed every month or so, only to feel better again, then back to depression, an endless cycle.

I've reached out to "friends", told them I need someone because I've been lonely and depressed, told them when I've been suicidal.
But they don't care. I'm always there for them when they're going through something, but when I just want someone to talk to and hang out with, no one wants to help.
I don't know why I can't just have a normal life, and not have to compromise my mental health in order to be occasionally happy.
