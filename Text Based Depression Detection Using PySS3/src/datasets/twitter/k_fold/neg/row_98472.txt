I feel I might have a mental breakdown in the next semester...They're going to discuss Asperger's syndrome in two classes... 

Just the thought of someone saying they think I have it, and everyone looking at me as if I were a lost puppy or freak would probably break me apart...

Also... Probably the four people I don't get along with would probably be in the night classes schedule, since all classes have 55 other students without counting me...

How will I be able to pass the semester with only a casual friend as support in the class? I get somewhat along with the others (mostly when working in homework/projects), but we don't really talk for anything else...

Will have to face the most difficult semester mostly on my own... Though I would rather work alone and avoid interaction with the class to not get attached...

Because I know how the story will end.

They will all keep in touch after graduation, while most of them will probably forget that I exist, except maybe if they need help in a psychological case, who knows...

Guess this is what happens after a misdiagnosis and losing your social skills...
