So fucking lonely I can't stand it anymoreI know that I'm supposed to want to spend time with myself and love myself or whatever, but I don't. I hate myself and I hate spending time alone with myself...and so much of my time is spent alone because I don't have many friends. I don't know how to talk to people in my classes or on campus, I get way too anxious and never know what to say...so I don't say anything and then suddenly it's 3 weeks into classes and everyone has made friends in that class and it's too late for me to try.

I don't know what to do. Each day that I spend alone with my thoughts is another day closer to me finally just offing myself. I can't stand this emptiness. No one wants to be around me because I'm bad at conversation and I'm uncomfortably awkward...I don't want to be around me either so I get why I'm alone. 

I am once again faced with a long day and night of being alone in my room, and I've already seriously contemplated killing myself two nights this week. I don't know what to do. I don't have anyone to reach out to that woudn't be concerned with or pissed off at me for doing so. I don't want to leave my room because I've already been out on campus since 8am (its 5pm now) at classes and such and I have pretty bad social anxiety, so I'm fucking exhausted.

I don't know what to do...nothing distracts me like I need it to. I guess I'll try and sleep, but that's all I do anymore and it never helps. I can only stay asleep for a few hours at a time and then when I wake up I just feel so sad because I'm awake again.

I'm sorry that I'm whining...It's just... I feel so backed into a corner every day of my damn life &amp; I really want to end it all today.
