Physical and mental health slowly dwindlingThere have been issues with my body that I have neglected to confront. The same goes for my mind. I feel I can not speak to my family. The only person I see on a regular basis is my mother, and she has ignored my cries for help and support. I feel neglected by her, and by the rest of my family for that matter. There will be times I find it hard to breathe throughout the day. I can not walk as far as I could last week. My chest hurts. I have massive headaches. I have social anxiety. I have no means of supporting myself, and no job, no friends. I probably could've prevented all this, if I wasn't so crippled by depression. The last time I cut myself, I was told only stupid people kill themselves, and was laughed at. 

If I had had someone to speak to in the past, someone I could've trusted and confided in, then maybe that would've oriented me into a better place than I am now. I am sorry for speaking in such a tilted manner. 

I want to die, and I want to live. But the thought of suicide has now become more and more frequent.
I feel that any means of self correction is now futile. 
 I feel bad for typing this, because I know that there are those who need more help than I do. I very well may be alive tomorrow. But I can not say that these thoughts will go away.
