I ll do it on the 13th.The last week of my life begins. All i need to do it do is write the notes and prepare myself mentally for what is to come. I wish everyone here all the very best. I will also try to help out others as much as i can in the short time that i have left. 
This wasnt supposed to be a rant or a call for advice. I am at peace now, and i hope to be at peace in my final moments. I love you all.:) :)
