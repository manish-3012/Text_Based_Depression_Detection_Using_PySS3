Boutta regret this oneWhat's popping, I've made a couple posts here before, and I just need a little help tonight. I'm a leader at my school, and people recognize me as an overachieving extrovert, but I've been covering up a lot of fear and pain. I'm fairly certain no one knows about what I'm dealing with except me. I've been eating one meal a day for the past few months and stayingg up late with suicidal thoughts. I can't let myself ever relax, even when people are trying to help me, I feel like everyone hates me and is trying to hurt me. I thought a lot about killing myself a week or so ago, but didn't go through with it within a couple days. I don't have anyone to talk to, and I'm scared of everyone, I'd appreciate some help.
