I don't know anymore...  I'm not even sure why I'm posting this; maybe I think that it will bring me some kind of relief. I feel like I only take away from people. I feel like I am burdening my parents by allowing them to put so much time, money, and effort into me when I know I'm not going to use it like I should be able to. Nothing traumatic has happened to me, but since December of 6th grade, I've been spending most of my life in either a sad or emotionally numb state. I feel like I can't do anything since I just want to die. I have been in advanced classes since 2nd grade, and I have always followed directions and essentially been the "perfect" student and daughter. For this reason, most people in my family view me as someone who will go on to do great things such as becoming a doctor. They aren't pressuring me to be anything specific; they simply want me to go to college and do something that makes me happy. My family deserves so much better, and I can't give them that. I have a family that most people, especially within this subreddit, would kill to have due to how supportive they would probably be if I told them, but I'm still not happy. I originally promised myself that I wouldn't try to commit suicide until I was 25, but I'm don't think I should allow people to continue to invest in me only to see me end my own life and waste everything they did for me so I'll end it sooner. I've written my suicide note despite not planning on killing myself in the very near future since I need to find a new method. I made it so that I would be able to kill myself quickly the next time that the suicidal thoughts come back and are really strong because I wouldn't have to worry about writing a note. I feel like my suicide will be impulsive, but hopefully not so impulsive that I have a failed attempt. I chose to keep the note short, and half of it is explaining that I did this all to myself and that no one could have made it stop. I haven't told my parents I feel this way, because I honestly don't see the point in getting better since I have felt this way for almost 4 years now, and I don't know how to say "Hey, I've been feeling suicidal and self harming for the last couple of years....So deal with that somehow". Going through the trial and error that is required to get help seems unnecessary, and I can't imagine feeling any different than I've been feeling for close to 4 years. I don't even know if I'm "bad" enough to get help. My mom just got a new job, and I don't want her paycheck to go to therapy and medication for me although I know that's not for me to worry about, and she would do that any day instead of coming home and finding me dead. I can't even obtain enough motivation to complete 2 summer assignments so it's stupid for me to think I'll actually amount to anything since doing that requires motivation. This whole post was stupid, and I'd be surprised if anyone read the whole thing, but if you did, thanks and sorry for wasting your time.
TL;DR: My life shouldn't create a shit person, but my mind choosing not to function correctly is making that happen so I think I'm just going to end it (but not in the very near future so don't worry).
