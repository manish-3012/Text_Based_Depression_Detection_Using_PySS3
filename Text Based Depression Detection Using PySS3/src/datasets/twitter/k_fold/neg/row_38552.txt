Why would someone who is meant to be your best friend stab you in the back so horribly and why would a group of people want to cause you so much trouble when they know you've had a really horrible few years and are very sensitive to stress and suicidal ideation.I've done nothing to these people. Nothing. I do my own thing and keep myself to myself. Ive had a bit of a break this year or so I thought, my confidence came back and I started to get better mentally and physically,  this doesn't seem to sit well with some people and I dont understand why. 

Why must I be damned with these bad few years for life? Why is it not okay for me to be happy? Would would someone be so poisonous to get me in serious trouble. Why is my best friend prepared to let this happen. I've had so much drama in my life these past few years. I cant deal with anymore stress in my life. 

Would it bring them pleasure to see me suffer? When I've really suffered these past few years. Why should someone take it upon their self to access my private records with some extremely sensitive information in about young childhood trauma and the mental and physical scars from that trauma because they've misconstrued a situation and think they can do this because of their job and to harm me, and then tell everyone like my personal stuff is like an open book.  Would it make them happy if I died, because I'm really not sure I can see a way out if they try to get into serious trouble. 

I dont understand why they want me to suffer.
