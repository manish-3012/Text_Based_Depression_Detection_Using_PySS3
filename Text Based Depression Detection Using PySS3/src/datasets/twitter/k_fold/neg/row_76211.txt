Iâ€™m an idiot I accidentally made fun of a suicidal friendI donâ€™t know what to do and I donâ€™t know if this is the right place to post this.. 
Iâ€™m sorry if itâ€™s wrong and I can delete it if it shouldnâ€™t be here 

I have this friend that is currently living in a country very far from his family and also in a state that is a bit further from the city. Heâ€™s currently working and saving up money. Due to covid and the whole lockdown heâ€™s been quite secluded and every now and then we would chat very little about the whole thing. 
(I guess Iâ€™m just a straight idiot for not asking him more about it, checking how heâ€™s doing more regularly.. Iâ€™m just realizing Iâ€™ve been too selfish for not doing that)
Anyways today he told me he canâ€™t leave the town heâ€™s in to visit someone he knows in a city kinda nearby bc lockdown and his birthday is this weekend so he was very sad and mad about it, and that his boss told him that if he finds out that he goes to the city, he will get fired. So I told him that his boss kinda has a point bc is quite dangerous to leave to a city that is in high risk of getting infected. And he said that it isnâ€™t fair because itâ€™s not illegal to go. And somewhere around there he said â€œwell the amount of suicide rates is the same or more than the amount of deaths by covidâ€ and I replied â€œdonâ€™t start speaking like a boomer or Iâ€™ll kick your assâ€ 
Then he said â€œwell only if you knew how it feels to be so secluded and not having anyone but you will not know because youâ€™re with your family and pets and you might be bored but at least you have people with youâ€ 
And I explained to him that I referred to what he said about comparing situations that itâ€™s not the same, and I totally not know what heâ€™s going through, but I know heâ€™s mad about whatâ€™s happening but thereâ€™s not much we can do about it. 
And then he said â€œIâ€™m trying to tell you Iâ€™m having suicidal thoughts and your answer was calling me boomer. Let it be knownâ€ 
After that I was shocked because I didnâ€™t read that in his message, I got it from the other side: the people that think that covid is not that bad, etc etc and I explained that to him and told him Iâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t get what he said the first time and that I would never make fun of someone going through suicidal thoughts (except of myself) and I was very sorry and if I could do something to help him and told him some ideas to maybe FaceTime (even though where he lives thereâ€™s no wifi) and he hasnâ€™t replied. 
I hate myself for not being careful enough, some parts of myself tell me it wasnâ€™t my fault because he redacted the idea in a different way to what he meant.. and other part of me thinks Iâ€™m just a straight dumbass for not asking him more about how he feels or whatâ€™s heâ€™s living. 
Before those texts I thought he was doing good because he found a girlfriend in the city nearby and maybe things were going better? But apparently arenâ€™t and Iâ€™m afraid I lost his friendship and I donâ€™t like that I donâ€™t know how to help him. And I hate that heâ€™s feeling that way. Suicidal thoughts are the worst. I freaking hate them. 
Iâ€™m having so much anxiety and I feel like Iâ€™m close to a panic attack
Also I donâ€™t know if this is relevant but I have those thoughts every now and then and in my chest I feel like a massive pressure when thinking about this topic but also now itâ€™s intensified because my friend is going through that and I donâ€™t want that for him
