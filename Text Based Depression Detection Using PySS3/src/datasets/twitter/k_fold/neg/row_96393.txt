I feel like the only reason I haven't killed myself is because my roommate couldn't afford rent on his own.I have nothing going for me and every time I try to push myself to do new things or improve myself, things just get worse. I dropped out of high school a few years ago because my medication made me unable to focus or care about anything. I ended up getting my diploma and told myself I would go to college but then my dad kicked me out. I got a job, then got another job, then ended up having to move back in with my dad and be constantly reminded that I'm a failure. Now I'm working a full time job and a part time job and the one night I took off to have fun (the night before I was going to take placement tests for college), my wallet and glasses were stolen so I've had to slowly replace everything I lost and I have no money. I left my boyfriend a few months ago because my mood swings were ruining him. Now he's doing really well while I'm living paycheck to paycheck with my friend who can also barely afford rent. My family doesn't talk to me. I have no real friends aside from the guy I'm sleeping with, and I know he only hangs around for the sex. Recently I fucked that up by getting an STD and it's so obvious that he doesn't care about me at all. I have nothing and I am nothing and it's taking everything I have to stay alive.
