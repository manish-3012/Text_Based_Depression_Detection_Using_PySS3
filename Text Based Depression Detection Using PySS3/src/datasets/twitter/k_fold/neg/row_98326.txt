Grad School has made me severely depressed and i fantasize about death dailyi have told my husband 2x and while he seemed concerned in the moment, he never brings it up or asks me if I'm okay. i love him and he is a good person but it makes me miserable that the 1 person who should care doesn't do anything and everyone always tells you to talk to your loved ones about this kind of thing but that didn't work for me at all. I don't even know why im posting here ...i just want to tell some one that i feel like im losing this battle with my mind and i am afraid of myself and what i might do
