I can't anymoreI keep trying to hold myself back from killing myself but it's getting too much. I don't know if I keep going like this. I don't feel loved or cared about at all and I'm afraid that I will never get that feeling.

I can't fight this feeling anymore and if next month is this like this I'm going. I just cant take it any longer.
