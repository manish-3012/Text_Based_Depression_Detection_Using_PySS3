Help me. Iâ€™m really confusedI donâ€™t know how to explain this. I feel like I just canâ€™t laugh anymore. I love to make people laugh but nothing is funny or amusing to me anymore. I know that I shouldnâ€™t be depressed and thinking about suicide at my age, which is 14 btw you pedos. I just feel like life just turned on me suddenly. Like I had a whole plan, an idea of what my life would be like and itâ€™s not going that way. Is started to actually talk to girls and actually go on dates with them, but itâ€™s not what I thought itâ€™d be like. Itâ€™s tough and I donâ€™t want it anymore. I know thatâ€™s selfish but I just dislike what I have right now and wish that I could give it to someone else. The things I have right now is everything I wished for but it just doesnâ€™t seem right and I donâ€™t feel like thereâ€™s a point in my life. I feel like Iâ€™m not that suicidal but I definitely wouldnâ€™t be sad or mad or be complaining if someone shot up my school and I died or if I got hit by a car or I got struck with a disease that kills me. I feel like I just want to go back and just play with fucking toys man. Please help. I donâ€™t know what to do and I definitely am not going to tell my parents because Iâ€™m way to young for this depresso espresso shit.
