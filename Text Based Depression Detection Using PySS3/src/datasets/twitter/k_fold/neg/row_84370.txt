A Waste Of TimeItâ€™s sad when you can count the reasons youâ€™re still alive on one hand. 

For me, there are only two reasons why I havenâ€™t been able to attempt suicide. One is kind of irrelevant, but there nonetheless. 

I live in the south and was raised a Christian. Itâ€™s seen as a sin to kill your self, and while Iâ€™m not the most religious person, being raised that way my entire life has just instilled this fear of â€œwhat ifâ€, so Iâ€™ve been waiting for something to happen that kills me and wonâ€™t be suicide. 

The second is that Iâ€™m 19 years old. I feel like, with everything Iâ€™ve been through, suicide would be a massive waste of time. I should have done it when I was first having thoughts at 13 because it wouldnâ€™t have been as large of a waste of time and effort. 

Now Iâ€™m in my second year of college in the most conservative state in the US as a gay teen. Life hasnâ€™t improved like Iâ€™ve been hoping for. I havenâ€™t found that â€œspecial someoneâ€ to have a shoulder to cry on, I havenâ€™t excelled in my major and been successful in some job, and everything is just as difficult as ever. 

Iâ€™m petty and I have no reason to kill myself. I understand that. That doesnâ€™t mean I canâ€™t still feel like a disappointment and wish for the end to come.
