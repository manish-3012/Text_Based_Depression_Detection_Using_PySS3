I cant think of a titleSo, ive been having suicidal thoughts for a while but could never bring myself to anything as i couldnt hurt my family like that. I also could not do that because ive told some friends how ive been feelings and they said they cared about me. This left me with some optimism that things will get better so thats another reason. 
Im currently 18 and enrolled for university, ive yet to recieve replies. The more the thoughts come the more i feel im not gonna amount to anything and this makes me feel like shit throughout the school day. With this being said im losing interest in school and i clearly cant do that. I try to push through by thinking of something else but the suicidal thoughts seem to come to the top of my mind. Ive talked to the school about these thoughts a while ago and i thought i was fine. Im not sure what to do. I feel tired all the time now and i figure if i cant feel happy, i can make my friends happy by making them laugh... Im not sure if im even asking for anything. I just wanted to express how ive been feeling.
