I feel like all I do everyday is desperately find ways to put off suicide, and I feel like I'm just a ticking time bombI "can't do that to my family" their words. How long can they expect me to fight this? It's unfair. 


I can't tell my friends because it's really not fair to let them know that them coming here prevents me from killing myself. It's too much pressure. Some of them know I'm mildly depressed. 


I was suicidal a few years ago for a long time. I had a few failed and legitimate attempts. At one point I moved in with my parents and asked for 24 hour company because i didn't trust myself


I can't go to the hospital. I'll lose my job. I'm a nanny. 


I'm just so tired guys. I want to be done. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to quit. I'm so so tired of fighting this.
