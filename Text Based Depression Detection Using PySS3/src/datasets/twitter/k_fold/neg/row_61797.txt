Too sad and afraid to carry onI donâ€™t really want to die, like if I had any hope things would look different. But Iâ€™m tired, and Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m losing people, I just wanna go before I lose anyone else. I feel like my close relationship with my father is crumbling and itâ€™s my fault, I donâ€™t see a point to education, I donâ€™t have a single idea what I wanna do. My relationship feels cold, I love him to death but I feel insignificant. He says I mean so much to him but heâ€™s always unsure if weâ€™ll last. I love him so much, I donâ€™t want to be alive to lose him or my father. I really donâ€™t see a future. I wanted to be an artist, but my art isnâ€™t unique or super good, I donâ€™t even know how I would achieve that. Years of crippling anxiety prohibits me from actually getting a job or driving. I donâ€™t see a world I fit into. I wish I was still the hopeful girl who saw the beauty in everything. I just feel angry and hopeless. Iâ€™m too afraid to move forward, whatâ€™s the point if happiness isnâ€™t made for me.
