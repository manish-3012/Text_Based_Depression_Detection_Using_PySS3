my friend just did it todayI dont usually hang out at SW since despite my depression I'm not even close to being suicidal. But a friend of mine just did it today.

He was a rather successful person, late 20s, recently engaged, having a new job  (~ 6 mo)... although he's rather depressive, he did not show the signs of doing  it at all. this is why all of us are so surprised to see this happen. He joked with us at the office on Friday, we made dinner plans for next week, and he was planning the f...g wedding. 
He did lose his father 1-2 years ago though and I know this was a huge bummer for him for a long time. But we all thought he was over this kinda stuff...

Anyways, my question is, is this really prevalent? out of the blue... just doing it... although being a fun person, hanging out with friends etc... can a person just do it? this is both scary and even more depressing to me. 

thanks for listening reddit...
