Update on My abusive mom put my cat down.

So im currently in a psych ward because of failed suicide attempt. Im such a failure that i can't even kill myself. I im here because i made a mistake. Last week i met a guy, i tought that he is a really good person, he even immediately drove me  home so i could at least check if my precious kitten is there in case this situation was a cruel joke. She wasn't there. I took her favourite toys, and left. He was supporting me all the way back, and because of this i thougt that i can't just leave leave him without saying goodbye. I didn't want him to feel used and ghosted by me.

That night i went home, took all my xans, drank a bottle of wine, and cut my wrists. Then i send him a message " Im really happy that i met you. You are a really good person. Thank you for all you did for me, but i feel like my life is over" I wanted this to sound innocent, like i was in a bad mood or something but wanted it to become clear when i would stop responding to him.
And he called the police.
Now i know that he cares only about his feelings. I wanted to die knowing that there is at least one person in the world caring about me. When i did this i wanted to feel safe and just softly drift away into eternity... But now i won't. Now i know that everybody in the world want's me to suffer. I feel like people only care about their emotions, not that i will suffer for years till i die of old age.


I'm still thinking about doing this again but this time properly.

I have no reason to live without her and i don't deserve any hapiness, i failed her and she died and i should too. I don't deserve to live.
