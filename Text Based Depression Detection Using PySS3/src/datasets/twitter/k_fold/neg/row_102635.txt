I Don't Know What to Say:Hey guys, I'm feeling very suicidal right now, I just started feeling suicidal again because of many things. It mostly has to do with not being accepted by others for who I am. I'm bisexual, non binary/genderfluid possibly, and mentally ill/disabled. Why does it matter what I do or if I live because I can't change how others will perceive me?? Why should I try anymore, people are gonna hate me?? We need change everywhere but nothing's gonna change. In reality, we're gonna be our own stupid selves. I'm borderline thinking about suicide. I'm always gonna be regarded as a freak, as a loser, as many things. I've relapsed with SH, I feel like I need drugs/alcohol or something to get through the night. I also miss many people, they will be gone for months. Everything is just falling apart and I haven't been able to sleep or eat much. I feel sick with anxiety.
