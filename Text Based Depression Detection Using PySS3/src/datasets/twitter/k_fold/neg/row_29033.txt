I fucked upI got hit by a car late last month with no serious damage and I felt nothing but a crushing sense of doom when the shock lifted and I realized I was, more or less, okay. I've been eating more and worse, I cry daily, I self harmed for the first time in a year, and I feel guilty for even typing this all out here. I know I should be grateful and enjoying life but I can't help but wish that car had done me in.
