Thinking about committing suicide 

I live in Brazil and 10 years ago I broke my teeth and since then my life is over and I have no money for the dentist and neither do I leave the house and do not leave the house it makes me lonely and does not reach out to me to help. I already had suicidal thoughts, deep sadness, agonizing nights, but lately I fought with my best friend, she no longer wants to pay attention to me or respond on instagram and I am thinking about committing suicide, but I still have no idea of â€‹â€‹a good method . I don't want to send a message to my friend saying that I will commit suicide if she doesn't talk to me, as if it were blackmail, I will probably cut my wrists and only then send a message saying that I already did. I thought about cutting my wrists, but maybe it will only bleed and get better after a while, I don't know. I thought about choking myself with some clothes, but it will probably be distressing and I don't want to face God after death and be sent to hell.

I didn't really want to die, I wanted love, affection, but all I have are people online who don't really know me, which doesn't count as friendship.

 

I don't want to commit suicide directly because of her, but I already had the suicidal desire in me, and not talking to her anymore was taken away from my comfort and intensified my suicidal desire and I don't know where to go. I try to read and study the bible, but lately I haven't even been able to read
