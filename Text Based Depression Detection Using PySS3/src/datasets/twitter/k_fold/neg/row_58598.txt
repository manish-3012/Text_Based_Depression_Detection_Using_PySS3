I took 20 500mg Tylenol pills last night. Why am I still alive?For the past few days I've been trying and trying to off myself, Sunday I took 12 xanax pills. I passed out but somehow managed to call my ex boyfriend who said he saved my life by making my heart beat faster. So the next day (yesterday) I tried mixing a half bottle of wine with 20 extra strength 500mg each Tylenol pills. I woke up 7 hours later sweating and incredibly nauseous. Am I going to slowly die? Because I would rather do it the quick way as I've been trying. Can someone let me know? Thanks
