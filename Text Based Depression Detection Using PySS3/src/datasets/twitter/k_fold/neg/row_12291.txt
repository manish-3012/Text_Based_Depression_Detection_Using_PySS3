I'm a Hollow Shell of a Human BeingI'm not sure what to do or how to feel anymore. I've never had any real friends, no one to count on. People are naturally aggressive towards me, or hold me to unrealistic standards just so I can feel accepted. No one wants anything to do with me and my entire life has been filled with people who take advantage of my kindness.

I suffer from depression and the desire to want to end it all. I try to be outwardly positive even though I'm teetering on the edge. I can't even go to bed without crying myself to sleep every night. I just want to disappear, vanish from this world so no one will ever have to put up with me.

I'm tired of people smiling at me through their teeth when they are pretending to have my best intentions at heart. I'm used by everyone at work, I'm used by "friends" and I'm sure my family wants nothing to do with me. I'm sure if I kill myself, they'll be dreading the fact that they'll have to take time out of their day to attend my funeral, and the money it would cost them.
