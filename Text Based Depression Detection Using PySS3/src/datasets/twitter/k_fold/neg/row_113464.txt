I just donâ€™t feel.. right.Iâ€™m not sad but Iâ€™m not happy. I start crying spontaneously and then I cut it off after five seconds because I hate feeling emotional. I just want to die sometimes because carrying on is genuinely paining and really hard work. If I let my guard down for less than a second I start feeling all of the boxed up emotions come out so I have to work harder and harder to keep them away. Iâ€™m not scared of death at all. Actually, I find it quite comforting that there is always a second option. So being scared isnâ€™t the reason why Iâ€™m not doing it. The only reason Iâ€™m not planning on suicide is because I want to feel love. It looks so amazing and I really want to fall in love one day. I want to have fun. So I will wait. Sorry about this, I just wanted to rant lol
