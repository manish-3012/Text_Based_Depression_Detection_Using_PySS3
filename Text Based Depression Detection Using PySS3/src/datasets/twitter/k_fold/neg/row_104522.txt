Im either gonna do it or run away. Im not even 16. I want to die.I canâ€™t take it anymore. Not only do i feel guilt from some fucked up shit i did when i was 12-13-14 that no one knows about, and suffering from mental health, but my family make it even worse. All they do is call me useless, shout at me, treat me like shit, put me below everyone else and whenever i try argue it just gets worse. They just call me a spoilt brat and then proceed to treat me like even more shit. I fucking hate them. They say, oh you have your xbox and things like that, and yes i appreciate that, but no matter what i do to help or the work i do around the house, im still useless and just worth less than everyone else. I fucking hate my life and tbh i want to kill myself. Even worse its like they purposley go out of there way to make my life worse, they purposley do things that make me misrable and then proceed to call me intolerable and to shut the fuck up or ill be grounded. I fucking hate everything. I tried talking to them about my problems and all they do is call me draining and to grow the fuck up. I physically both deserve to die and want to. Clearly im barely of any value to anyone in my life and tbh everyone would be probably be happier if i was dead. Iâ€™d be happier if i was dead and why? Because i feel like im a terrible person and that my value means nothing. The world doesnâ€™t need me. My family donâ€™t need me. I donâ€™t want me. This was never a thing when i was younger. When i was younger it seemed like my parents and friends actually liked me. But the nicest thing anyones said to me in the last 2 months was a thanks for doing all the wallpaper around the house. Thatâ€™s it.
