I need some advice asap! Please reddit! I don't know what to do anymore!Alright so im 19 and im in my "second" year of college. The reason why I put quote is as followed: I started college with a great attitude and I passed my first semester. I enter the next semester and thought everything was going good. I ended the semester with 3 F's and 1 D. I didn't want to tell my parents but I did. I have never seen my mom cry as much as she did that day I told her. I promised I would do better and the semester following that, I only failed one class. Again, my parents took it hard and stopped talking to me for a couple of days. The semester after that was almost tragic. 
I started with a good attitude and knew I was going to do well. Long story short, I failed all my classes. This led me to the point of almost committing suicide. I really didn't feel like I had a purpose in life. After that, I was determined to have a very successful semester and I just recently found out I failed that shit again! FUCK! Im so mad! I have failed about 10 fucking classes! Reddit! I WANT TO CHANGE!!!!!! WHAT CAN I DO?????????????? I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS!! I WILL TAKE ANY ADVICE!! PLEASE! I BEG YOU! I really want to start the new year off with a bang! Is there anything I can do to rescue my 1.32 GPA?  :(
