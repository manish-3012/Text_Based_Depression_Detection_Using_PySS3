I'm planning on dying right this moment quite honestly, and before anyone reads this I'll probably be gone.Well, I'll not beat around the bush my fiancee left me when my mother was dying in the hospital. I won't try and act like it's not fucking pathetic to be suicidal because of a relationship, but there it is. I've given everything to the woman and she threw me away when I needed her the most. Even after she did that and we were arguing for more than a month on end she decided to come back to me. I was the apologetic one, I did everything I could to make up with her, and I went out of my way to try and fix things. She left again. She said to me that because I was suicidal when she left the first time I was essentially "emotionally abusing" her like an ex boyfriend of hers who had sexually assaulted her. She compared my suicidal thoughts to a man who sexually assaulted her. When my mother came out of the hospital my mother didn't even care that I was suicidal. I can't anymore, and other than a little note I'm leaving in my room this'll be the last thing I ever say.
