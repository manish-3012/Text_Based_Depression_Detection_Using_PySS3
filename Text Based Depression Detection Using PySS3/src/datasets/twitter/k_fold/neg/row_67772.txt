a last resort I guessIâ€™m not sure how to start this off, itâ€™s a bit weird since this is the first time Iâ€™ve been on Reddit. I feel like I donâ€™t have anyone to turn to. Thereâ€™s a lot on my mind and a lot that I want to say, but that would take too long. I guess Iâ€™ve just gotten to the extreme low point of depression, anxiety, stress, low self esteem, to where I donâ€™t think I want help anymore. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for so long now, and I started cutting again. Each time the cuts get deeper and Iâ€™m always tempted to try killing myself with pills. The only thing keeping me here anymore is the fear of failure, but even that is starting to slip away. I keep skipping school because of the immense stress and anxiety it gives me, and because I keep missing assignments. Itâ€™s hard being around people, especially family who donâ€™t understand, and itâ€™s hard being alone on my own. Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™ll gain by venting on reddit, but itâ€™s a nice way to be fully honest and not have to pretend like Iâ€™m ok. I plan on killing myself eventually and Iâ€™m not sure when, but soon. I donâ€™t believe that life is worth living when all Iâ€™ve been doing for 5 years is this. Just nothing other than being a complete mental fuck up. Iâ€™m debating whether or not to kill myself today with tylenol and just get it over with. Iâ€™ve had enough with stalling and wondering which day is the one Iâ€™ll snap. Itâ€™s so hard living and Iâ€™ve just been crying nonstop about everything on my mind. Iâ€™m sorry to anyone who cares about me, which Iâ€™m pretty sure is just a few people. Iâ€™m just now trying to convince myself to get over the fear of a failed attempt so I can just die already.
