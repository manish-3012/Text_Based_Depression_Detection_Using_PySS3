Fuck you 2018, but thank youDespite all the shit I went through this year, I wanna take it as a lesson. Itâ€™s been so fucking rough but it made me who I am now. I am still feeling depressed and suicidal when Iâ€™m not suppose to. For instance, I am living with my happy family and friends. But these thoughts always finds a way to fuck you up. I should be happy.. but Iâ€™m not. Why? 

Iâ€™ve made my decisions to move on. I know I will get there. Just not anytime soon.

Nonetheless, happy new year to everyone. I hope you all will find peace and happiness
