Do yâ€™all have any tips for not telling your friends/family you are suicidal?So I have wanted to kill myself for a variety of reasons, unhealthy interests like Anime, being a waste of space, and ruining everything I touch. I was wondering how I can not tell my family/friends about this to make sure that those relationships donâ€™t die from the new found pressure of having to deal with damaged goods.

I made the mistake of telling my one friend, but I successfully played it off as a joke, and then one other friend actually knows but, well they had their own barrel of worms so I managed to shift the focus onto them.

So how do I not accidentally show signs of suicidal thoughts/urges? So far I have managed to keep my outbursts at like 2 am, but Iâ€™m worried that they might catch on to more subtle signs of suicidal thoughts, like giving away prized possessions or that sort of thing.

Iâ€™m also growing weak mentally, writing paragraphs or essays to people in email about my issues. Thankfully Iâ€™ve managed to delete them and not send them on accident.

Thank you, any tips are appreciated, Iâ€™m meeting up with a friend tomorrow and Iâ€™m hoping I donâ€™t crack.
