one wrong turning too manyi will always be lonely.
i will never be happy.

i try to immerse myself in poetry and books and music, but i realize these weren't aimed for me, but rather for people and from people who lived life more completely, at levels ill never even attain.

no more people, no more books, for me. what's left is isolation, as before and as always.
one wrong turning too many.

question now is of the value of living on.

there is a hardware store on the way to the trail.
