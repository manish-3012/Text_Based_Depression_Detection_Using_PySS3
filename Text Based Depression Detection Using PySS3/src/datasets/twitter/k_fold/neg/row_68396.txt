Very suicidal not sure what to doAlright, so Im 20 and I'm in my third year of university.I battled depression for the first two years of university to the point that I almost killed myself last year. For some reason, after that incident, I decided to turn my life around and change the things around me. I was suicidal for many reasons but it was mainly my poor grades and my lack of hope for the future. I really did turn myself around and vowed to never even think of suicide again.
But I find myself here again but this time for different reasons. Things aren't perfect but I have no reason to feel suicidal. I have friends (who I guess are close but I have major trust issues), my lovely parents, and a bright future (if I work hard this semester, I can go on exchange to Spain next semester amongst other things). Like I said though, things aren't perfect and I guess Im tired of trying to pretend they are, to myself. Ive always tried to let things slide by and remain happy because I didnt want to get into depression. Now I just see how meaningless life is and I have a long way to go to get to where I want and frankly Im just exhausted. Im privileged to have the things I do in life but I don't have it in me to continue to work hard and fight to get to where I want. Im not lazy. I will do what I have to do to get things done but I dont see the point in doing all these things when there is no meaning to any of this.
Im not sure why Im here. Im really calm, not scared about this situation.
