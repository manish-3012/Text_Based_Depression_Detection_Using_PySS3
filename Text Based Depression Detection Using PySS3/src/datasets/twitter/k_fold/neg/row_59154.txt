Todayâ€™s just been a hard day ðŸ˜©I donâ€™t know why, but the littlest inconvenience makes me want to throw myself off a bridge. I have passive suicidal thoughts everyday, but somedays they just become really strong. My mom told me today that I need to get out of this funk and apply for jobs. Thanks  mom, I didnâ€™t know it was that easy to be happy. I sometimes wish something else would take me out like getting hit by a car. For now, I guess I just have to live with these dangerous thoughts until I canâ€™t no more. Might go for a nice long run in the morning to get away and disconnect from everything. :/
