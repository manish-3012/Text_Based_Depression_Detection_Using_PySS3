Someone messaged me last night saying they were going to commit suicide, and I haven't heard from them since.I'm really worried. I didn't get the message until 3 hours after the fact, but I replied immediately after I read it and waited up for most of the night for a response. Please feel free to remove this part if it's not allowed, but /u/TheLoneMage, if you are still here, PLEASE let me know. 

She said her name was "Wendy" and that she wanted at least one person to know that she had lived... I'm just hoping that she is still alive...
