How does a suicide hotline work?Iâ€™m transgender and my parents are transphobic so I texted my brother that I canâ€™t live like this anymore and he told me to call a number. So I googled it and itâ€™s a suicide hotline. I donâ€™t want anyone to come to my house or put me somewhere, I might or might not want to talk but I donâ€™t want them to do that or record the call or me or anything I hate records so if thatâ€™s what happens I wonâ€™t call. What do they even do?
