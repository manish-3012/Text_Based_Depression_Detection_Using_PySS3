Ex-gf making a really convincing argument for leaving this world, what do I do?I recently met with my ex-girlfriend who I know to be depressed, largely in order to try to get back together with her.  In our process of catching up, she told me she'd been on a suicide watch recently and that she was becoming more convinced that life is pointless.  She's always told me that she doesn't really ever feel happy, she just can get distracted by things like seeing me be happy.  I think she mostly persevered due to a Christian sense of servitude (we're both Presbyterian) and a love of nature.  However, she has increasingly become more sure that people suck and only harm one another and nature.  Any arguments I've made in opposition to that line of thinking have sounded stupid as soon as they left my mouth.

Last week sounded definitely worse, though.  I asked her about how her faith factored into all this and she told me how she feels like its eating away at her.  She thinks it's a sin whenever you don't help someone you could possibly be helping, and honestly, she's right.  So she works and works and works to serve everyone she can, and then still feels guilty for not doing more, which is how I should be feeling, though I just push it out of my mind.

The thought of her dying makes me sick, but I feel like it's selfish to keep her in this world when all she feels is sadness and guilt.  What do I do?
