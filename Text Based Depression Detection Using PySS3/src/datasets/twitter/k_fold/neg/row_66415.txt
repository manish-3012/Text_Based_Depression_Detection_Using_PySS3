Well, I'm back. Alright. So last time I came with some basic issues, but it seems to of worsened. First off, my brother is in a mental ward. We might not get him back. I guess it's bad I don't really care, but that's also been my coping mechanism. Just to tune out to the world. So yeah, he might never return, the electricity might get cut out, I have no clue where I'll be living next year, and I'm just lost. The one person I could talk to left. Now it's nobody. I started flirting with a girl, and I guess that is a good distraction at time, but it's still just... life is a downer, man. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm 16. I guess... I'm scared. I don't want to see my sister hurt anymore. I'm sick of being blamed for things I had nothing to do with. I mean there has been talk of child services, but I don't want to go through the system. I just want.... I just want to... take a pause. Just let everything go away. I feel like I'm at the climax of the tragedy of my family, and we are about to crumble. I'm just starting out, but I feel like I'm going to get suffocated by the problems in my family. 

Thanks for listening SW. Sorry for not being able to keep it to myself.
