I'm too worthless to live. My final, tattered and drug fueled monologue enclosed.I'm so guilty all the time. I feel like there isn't a death painful enough for me to atone for my... everything. If i started apologizing now, forever, it wouldn't be enough before the heat death of the universe. All I've ever done is make things worse. Oddly enough, I've distilled all that I, truly, want in life to this: that I could be useful to someone. To truly help someone, who truly needs it, in a truly meaningful way. To be trusted, and loved. God, my fucking chest hurts thinking about it. And, christ, all the things, the wonderful experiences I will never get a taste of. Even if I wasn't about to blow my head off I just... don't deserve... anything at all.

 I wanna go out with friends who I am worthy of having, and laugh carelessly. I wanna have something like true love. I don't want to be rich or anything. I don't want  power or fame, not really. I don't want a lot. A garden for my cats... and some flowerbeds. Fuck. It hurts so much I can't take it. Like I'm in a bubble where I can see all that I can never have with perfect clarity, and for all the good I might feel I just feel misery and anger so intense I can't fucking breathe. I hate myself. I'm so sorry. I hope I don't hurt anyone in a lasting way. They'll be better off afterwards. Like tearing off a bandage. It'll hurt them less for it to be quick. I'd rather not... linger, and drag the good ones down. I know I'm still being selfish, in a sense, but I truly believe it'd be better this way. I hung out with my few remaining friends one last time and it nearly made me reconsider, I made them laugh and they almost seemed to enjoy my company. Hopefully they remember me that way instead of how I actually am.

I'm sorry. I hope someone finds this... cathartic, or poetic or something. This last act of vanity and pride of mine, a misguided and pathetic attempt to be known.
