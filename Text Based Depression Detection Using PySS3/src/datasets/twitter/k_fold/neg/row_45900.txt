What comes after stepping back from the edge?Iâ€™ve been there. Iâ€™ve had the blades in hand, or my foot pressed hard against the pedal, or the jug of whatever in front of me. Iâ€™ve been back to that dark place so many times and always take a step back to findâ€¦ nothing.

I keep hearing the lines â€œIt gets betterâ€ or â€œX religion/hobby/musical helped meâ€ or â€œjust get a petâ€. But I donâ€™t see it. I canâ€™t seem to understand how so much can be right with other people and not me. I donâ€™t know how to get from putting my gun back in its case to being someone who I can look eye to eye with in the mirror. I must be doing something wrong if I have nothing left and no longer flinch at the idea of something out of my control ending things for me. 

So my question is simply; How do you recover from being at deathâ€™s door?
