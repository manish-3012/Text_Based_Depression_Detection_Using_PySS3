iâ€™m a parasite iâ€™m a burdeni graduated from college last year and now im just living back home working a minimum wage job (working at Chipotle) to get by. i cant afford to move out and i struggle with motivation to make something of myself. i hate my life and i hate myself for not changing it

iâ€™ve always felt this deep sense that im a burden and my family would be better off without me but ive been triggered just now by an argument i had with my uncle. i made the mistake of voicing my political opinions on being anti-US imperialism given the recent iran debacle (heâ€™s very conservative/a proud capitalist). he mocked me as idiotic and idealistic while laughing in my face. he started by saying â€œif you hate the US so much, why donâ€™t you move somewhere else?â€ and then he told me he thinks poor people are a parasite on society and socialists just expect people to hand them things. and he told me i was miserable and lazy and that i offered nothing to society and that i get to live the life i have because of his generosity. he said to me, â€œyou say you care about other people but you donâ€™t. you donâ€™t do anything to help anyone else. youâ€™re selfish.â€ and â€œhow did you contribute to society today? by making burritos?â€ and told me i was ungrateful and insufferably miserable and going to die miserable. and that i could leave his house if i donâ€™t like howâ€™s speaking to me. such hatred in his voice.

im very close to just getting in my car and just driving it into the ocean. that will take care of me
