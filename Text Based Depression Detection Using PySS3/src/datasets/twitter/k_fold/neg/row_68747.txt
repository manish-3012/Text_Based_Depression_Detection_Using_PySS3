Traumatized my last friend; now i'm truly aloneI've only ever had one friend I truly could be open about my suicidal ideations with. At first I could control my mood (like I do around everyone), but now all I want to talk about around him is my thoughts. Well, I'm at the lowest point in my life and I honestly think I'm gonna bite the bullet this month. I sort of traumatized him the last time we talked and now he doesn't want to even talk to me about anything. He is the only one that knows where I am mentally and now he doesn't even care. I feel awful for traumatizing him but I find so much comfort in talking about how much I love the idea of my own death. I suppose that's why I'm here. I need to talk about it and I really don't need interactions; just an outlet. (also, I am not trying to seek help on this, i fucking hate when people try to help my destiny). Glad I found this reddit tho, I feel like I can now actually talk about my plans for hanging without traumatizing others
