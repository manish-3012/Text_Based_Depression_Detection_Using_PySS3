I had a bad fight with my wife and now feel like life has no purpose, I feel like ending it all.I had a really bad fight with my wife yesterday that was my fault. I feel horrible right now, as if the energy was suck out of me, all I can think of is how better off my wife would be with my retarded ass making a mess of things. 

Can I just go one fucking second without me fucking things up? Is that really to much to ask? Why can't i do anything right?

I think the world would be an infinitely better place without me making a mess of thing by just existing.
