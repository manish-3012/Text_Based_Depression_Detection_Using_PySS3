I[15M]'ve been existentially nihilistic for the past month or so.I've been depressed for the past month or so because of my belief that nothing has meaning. I feel that life and everything has no meaning and isn't interesting. I used to have desires and interests but now I have none and It's turning me into a lazy piece of shit. My grades are slowly getting worse although I used to get top marks. the thing about schoolwork is that I feel that everything is too easy and because of that I don't put in any effort and I'm getting worse and worse. 

I just want to stop feeling this way. But i'd never actually kill myself because I'm fucking terrified of death. I believe there's nothing after death so there's no way to know whether life goes on without me or everything just ends because my personal perception disappears if I die.
