I'm near the end of the ropeI used to be a straight a's student. Now I  have to catch up with school work by a certain time online. Life is so mundane. Work eat sleep. Work eat sleep. I can barely work which makes life even more boring. This is because of major depression. Pretty sure ill never amount to anything. I have social anxiety and have very few friends(their not real friends) nothing makes me happy. I have never had a girlfriend. I know i will die alone, so why not end it know. Don't give me that excuse that I matter there are over 7 billion people out there.
