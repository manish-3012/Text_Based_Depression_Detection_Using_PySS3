Contemplating suicideFirst of all; first post here so let me know if it doesnt fit the sub. English isnt my native language so spelling mistakes May occour

My life is a massive mess. My mom died (3 january im born mid december) couple of weeks after i was 15. i celebrated my 15th birthday in the hospital. Since then it was just my sister, my two brothers and my dad, and my sister. I was a heavy weed addict, and so was my sister (still is) she was the only one who understood me. ( i was a mentally troubled kid, and still is by the age of 21) my dad and brothers, While mourning they didnt Seem to have much empathy for my situation. Since then i have always Hated Christmas, especially since my grandmother Went Into delirium and hospital on Christmas eve, she didnt return, and in february 2018 burried her. I lost 2 people on Christmas eve, and done with Christmas. Its a Holiday of trauma. Last year my first GF broke up with me after 7 months and just after one of my best friende died in a train accident, which made me loose all hope in life. With a lot of psychriatic help i surviced, but been a Shell of myself. Today the Girl i loved told me she couldnt be with me, since she had a boyfriend. (i know im the asshole, but i truly love her, and have loved her for 3 years). She Found out she loved her bf more, which i completly understand, but being denied her love and intimacy, truly made me
Think about taking my life. I have been suicidal for years with no one to really talk to, and after today i really feel like it is the right choice. I dont believe in god or anything but i truly hope that if i go through with it, i will see my mom again. The only person i felt like loved me for who i am.
