I see no good future for myself.There is a lot more to it. But I'm stuck in a family that I can't escape. I'm getting older and older and running out of prospects for a chance at a good life. The only good possible outcome would be I die of a heart attack before I reach 40 but I doubt the universe would give me mercy like that. I want to end it before I become the very same monster my parents were. I'd rather die as I am now than have mental illness, hormone and health problems, and addiction turn me into the very thing that still gives me nightmares about my childhood. I'm already forced to financially rely on my brother who already has become that and there's no way out.
