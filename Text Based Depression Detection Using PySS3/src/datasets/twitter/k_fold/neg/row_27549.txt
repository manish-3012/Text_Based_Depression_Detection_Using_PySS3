what is there left for me to doeverything has just turned to shit since september things were going so good i was so happy the beginning of last year and it plummeted it feels like ill never just be purely happy without ending up feeling worse than i started i don't know when ill feel good or even remotely ok again so i don't see the point of staying here any longer because what good is a life thats not being enjoyed i don't get it i don't know what i did its not fair i feel like im in the worst position so far in my life i don't know what to do things just keep getting worse and worse i don't see the point in staying alive
