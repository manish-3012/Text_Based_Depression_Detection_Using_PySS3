I'm doneI can't do this anymore. Today was supposed to be a good day, my wife was getting home from her vacation and would be at the house when I got home from work. I was so excited and so was she! I would finally have her back in my arms after her being gone. But she got home and the first thing she did (over text) was to berate me because I left a few dishes in the sink. Apparently, cleaning the rest of the house is something that is overshadowed by the fact that I didn't "finish" the dishes. My life is a constant barrage of "you didn't do anything" regardless of how much I actually did accomplish. I'm never going to be good enough and that KILLS me inside. So, here I am. I'm so dead inside, I'm ready to make that more than a metaphor. I have the means, I have the plan, I may just actually go through with it this time. I'm over this.
