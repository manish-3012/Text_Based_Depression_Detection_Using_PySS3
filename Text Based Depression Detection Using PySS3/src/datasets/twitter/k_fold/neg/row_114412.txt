I'm in fear of losing the last bit of my sanityM/17 
I'm at an absolute low point in my life, I've got an overwhelming fear that this is the last time in my life where I can still turn everything around.

So I've been extremely ugly and overweight my whole life until a few years ago, and everyone has always mocked me for that reason. Adding to that I had a really bad childhood, my father leaving my mother because he couldn't handle me, and moving from the place where I grew up, losing all my friends. In 2015, I thought about how I wanted to die the first time in my life. I weighed around 230 lbs back then, I had terrible acne and very few friends. I somehow managed to get my shit together and already lost about 30 lbs (atm I'm at 160 lbs, pretty average) when I met this girl... We started meeting with a bunch of other people, talked hours and hours on Discord, found out how many things we had in common... There was a magic connection, so we started to meet, only the two of us. We were a couple a year ago, until she broke up with me last summer. She then got together with her best friend, it shattered my heart into thousands of pieces. I should probably say, she was mentally ill, had a lot of physical issues, but she was beautiful inside and outside, and had a lot of guys seeking her attention. I was fucking devastated and kept thinking of her, I tried to kill myself twice in the meantime. Even the police and ambulance had to come into my room to make me stop. I chatted with another girl a lot that time, we were really close, and my mistake was to develop feelings for her (in the meantime I think I just wanted to be with her to forget about my ex), and I asked her out, and she said no, since then she tries to avoid me. This has really affected me since she was really important to me as a friend in many difficult times. A few weeks ago, my ex confessed to me that she was molested as a child, and I made every single one of her mental problems way worse, I felt so incredibly bad.. Now I'm here, crushing low self esteem, acne and scars, scars from losing weight, having problems with school, drivers school, doctors appointments etc., my mother and family keep blaming me for letting me go, I have got nearly no friends, at least no really good friends that help me through tough times.. 

Now my problem is, sometimes when I think about everything that's going on, my body cramps, my eyes start rolling,... I shiver and sweat uncontrollably when I'm in rooms with too many people... Sometimes I ram my fingernails into my arms for stress relief... I listen to extreme metal music more and more, find pleasure in watching people die and in horrible thoughts in general, I'm getting edgier every day, and the main thing is, I'm getting closer and closer to killing myself...

The death of that Bianca e girl made me think about me, and if my obsession for my ex gf combined with my dark thoughts will someday lead me to lose my sanity and do things to her I don't ever want to

There's this part of me that just wants to be normal again, I'm infinitely grateful to hear some advice
