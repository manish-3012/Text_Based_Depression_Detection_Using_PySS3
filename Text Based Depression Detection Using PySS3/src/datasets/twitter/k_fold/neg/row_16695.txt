People will say anything to stop you from killing yourselfThat's the biggest problem with the topic of suicide, it's very rare to have an honest discussion about it.

If you're suicidal and someone is trying to talk you out of it, then the other party will promise you just about anything because they want you to live. You have something they want, not killing yourself, and they will say whatever it takes to get that from you, even if it means lying.

"It gets better", "there's always hope", "there's always a light at the end of the tunnel". They're all empty promises made by people who don't want to feel like someone died because they failed, so when they run out of platitudes they'll just say "you don't want to be helped" and now it's *you* who isn't good enough, *you* who didn't try hard enough, and it isn't theor fault if you ended up killing yourself because they "tried" to "help".

It's all just lies made by people who don't want to entertain the idea that if they were in our shoes they'd kill themselves to, cause that would contradict their entire view of the world as some wonderful place where every life is precious and full of potential that will always be tapped and that everything will always be fine in the end. 

It's dumb. Just really dumb.
