I am listening to my parents talking about my grandparents health deteriorating rapidly in the other roomIâ€™m so selfish to think about killing my self now, they have to deal with so much already. But I just canâ€™t stop it, the thoughts are so intrusive. If I get the chance I would probably take it. Why am I such a horrible person?
