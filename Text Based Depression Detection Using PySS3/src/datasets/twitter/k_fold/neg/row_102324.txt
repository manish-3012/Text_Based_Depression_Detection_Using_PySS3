My friend is planning to commit suicide but I can't bring myself to call the police on him or somethingWe're too close. I feel like I can't betray his trust like that, as much as I wish I could. Besides, he's already been hospitalized multiple times in the past and it never helped him anyway. He's homeless, jobless, just generally has nowhere to go upon release. He has no family support. No money or insurance to get therapy or antidepressants even after being diagnosed with severe depression. I live with my parents and can't offer a place to stay. Like even if I did call him in what good would that do? I'm just not sure what the fuck to do.
