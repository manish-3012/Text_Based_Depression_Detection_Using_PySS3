I have no future why should i even tryI quit weed 4 days ago and im pretty much just non stop crying, i cant find anytging to live for, headaches and jaw/teeth pain that weed helps numb is unbearable, ive been eating 1 meal a day and having really bad diahreah like 15mins after i eat, my depression has come out in full force, im thinking of killing myself around 30 times a day, i have no money and no job, i have no friends, i have nothing to look foreward to, i was going to get a therapy pet but my landlord wont allow it, i have autism and adhd and i cant even function at all as an adult, i have such bad anxiety i forgot to touch on in the train today and i had a panick attack, i found out today half my teeth are rotting and infected and i need my wisdom teeth out. I just really really want to die. I have no future, i seriously dont, im a burden to everyone. Im starting to get agrophobic and can barely leave my house. I dont know how to get help. :( what do i have to look foreward too? More poverty? More pain? Why should i go on.
