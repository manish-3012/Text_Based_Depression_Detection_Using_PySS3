Life just goes on.Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about suicide lately, and not just my own inevitable demise. Two days into this semester a girl was found dead in her dorm. She overdosed on pills. Apparently she woke up after she took them, said good morning to her roommates, went back to bed and never woke up. 

Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about her. If my friend hadnâ€™t mentioned it, I never would have known. Our university said nothing. No answers. No one even knew unless they saw the body bag on the stretcher or knew the roommates. So... Life just goes on I suppose. At night I see her in my room, I havenâ€™t been able to sleep, just thinking if I turn around Iâ€™ll see her standing there. Itâ€™s so interesting that a girl who was alive and had a story is now six feet under and we are all none the wiser. 

How minimal our impact on the lives of those around us truly is.
