I think I'm ready to let things go.you know ive always thought what do i lack in life? i have a pretty stable family, stable economic conditions, an ongoing college education and pretty good people around me.

So why do I feel so empty on the inside? I would have let go already if I hadn't stopped myself to think about all the things my selfish ass would miss. I want to visit Paris before I die. I want to go to a Kpop concert before I die. I'd like to experience adulthood and find myself. I'd like to be happy.

But then I think about the possibilities of even making a future for myself and I see nothing. I won't ever amount to anything when I grow up, I realized. I'd like to go quietly and painlessly... I've thought of how to go about it and I'm relieved that this emptiness and void that I've been filling with video games that no longer bring me joy will be gone if I go. I don't find joy in those things and the only thing that settles me is weed and the occasional juul hit. I'm such worthless trash, a disappointment... I will never be able to fulfill what I want to and the goals that I have ser up for myself. Dying will make it better for people around me... My mom's already tried to suffocate me... Maybe I won't fight back next time she does it again.
