I don't know if I want to see where my life goes from hereIâ€™m a few months shy of 25. Iâ€™m also a virgin, living with my parents, and working as a fucking cashier despite having a college degree. I majored in something fairly useless in college, but I minored in computer science and thought that would help me find something. I spent over a year after college talking to tech recruiters, building my web development portfolio and getting interviews, but ultimately not finding anything. There were times I didnâ€™t do great on an assessment or could pinpoint where an interview went wrong, but even when interviews seemed to go well and I did good on the assessment Iâ€™d just not hear back or get the â€œOh, yeah, weâ€™re going with someone elseâ€ email. It doesnâ€™t seem to matter how much I know about polymorphism or MVC or SQL injections, thereâ€™s always someone better.

I donâ€™t even know what to say about my complete failure with the opposite sex. I can look back on some rejections and see where I went wrong, but thereâ€™s so many others where things seem to be going well and then I just get ghosted or get a â€œOh, yeah, maybe if Iâ€™m freeâ€ text and just take the hint. I mean, I went to a predominantly female college and Iâ€™ve never been kissed. Thatâ€™s not fucking normal.  Iâ€™ve lowered my standards, pursued women Iâ€™m not even attracted to and still got blown off.  I have high-functioning autism, so I cut some slack for myself, but I still know other autistic people whoâ€™ve had sex and/or relationships. Iâ€™ve been working out more, but my arms are still fucking skinny which is another big insecurity. Part of it is that I just donâ€™t like eating very much, which is a whole other can of worms I donâ€™t even feel like detailing. 

There are things that I enjoy in life, I have hobbies and try to focus on things bigger than myself. Iâ€™ve been doing standup comedy for a while, and while I have some periodic success, Iâ€™ve seen a lot of my peers go further. Part of it is just that the networking and business side can be hard as an autistic person, but I also just go through long stretches of not feeling very funny. 

Iâ€™ve been taking Effexor for a few years, it does help and keeps my ideations from getting too vivid, but, likeâ€¦it canâ€™t change the fact that Iâ€™m a fucking loser. It canâ€™t bend reality to grant me more success. Iâ€™ve been a loser for the duration of my life thus far, and I just donâ€™t see much changing in the future.
