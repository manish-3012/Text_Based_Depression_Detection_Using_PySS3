I don't know what to doThis is the first time in my life I've had suicidal thoughts. I just think it would all be so much easier if I stopped existing. No more stress. I have a national exam coming up which I had been preparing for for the last 2 years and I don't think I can pass. I had been preparing alright but with quarantine all my motivation is gone and I haven't touched my books since April. The worst part is that my parents think I have been studying all this while and this is the first time I've been lying to them and I absolutely hate it. After I fail the exam my career prospects will be nil. I opted for a stupid stream and if  I don't pass this exam all my life probably will be spent working a job I hate making minimum wage. I start shaking whenever I think of my future and I really don't know what I should do. I was a great student who came in the top of the class without even trying and everyone I know expects me to achieve great things. I really only want to sleep. The only thing keeping my from suicide is that my family would be sad.
