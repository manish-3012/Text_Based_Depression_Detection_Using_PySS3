What is even the point of existing like that?Every decision I made over these 20 years was wrong. I have never done enough. And now my body is rotting, my mind twisted unable to function, and I can't ever hope to be a tiny bit useful to anyone, can't ever hope to earn a living. I am essentially dead already - of disease and of starvation. My present state is agony. They say it's going to be better, they say I am in the power to change everything. Then why the fuck do I make ten fatal mistakes while trying to correct one? There's no hope - none. I pretend I'm alive, but I won't have the strength to do it for much longer. In fact, it is fear that keeps me from ending this. Very soon, I won't be afraid.
