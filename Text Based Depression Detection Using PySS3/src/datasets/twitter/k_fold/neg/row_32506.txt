First Real PlanI have a feeling that by the time this year ends, I'll be dead. I was actually planning it out for when the time comes. My family hates me. I'm running out of money. I can't get a job. Ive got no degree. I fucked up every possible way and now I'm at the end of my rope. The only parts of my life where I'm significant at all are things I pay for. I don't know what happened, but tonight everything became very clear. Suicide is at the end of this. People will be sad for a little while but literally everyone connected to me will have it easier. I hate life. I hate living. I just can't do it right.
