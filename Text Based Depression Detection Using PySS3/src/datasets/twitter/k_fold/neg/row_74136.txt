So I waited until my depression got better but I still want to die.Got through one of the lowest points in my life recently and came out the other side intact. People constantly told me hang on and it'll get better. And it has. But I still want to die. I think I'll kill myself soon. I'm not depressed anymore but the world doesn't feel right. I think living doesn't suit me.

I guess this is it for me. Got a birthday party for a friend next week so I'll wait til after. It'd suck if his birthday got ruined over me.
