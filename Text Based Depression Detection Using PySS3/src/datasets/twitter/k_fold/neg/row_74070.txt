Just need to talkIâ€™m not sure if this is the right place to post this, and Iâ€™m sorry if itâ€™s not, but tomorrow early morning is 2 years since I lost my best friend to suicide. Iâ€™ve been doing really well, but itâ€™s hitting me hard right now. I guess Iâ€™m hoping this is a two part post. One, I want to encourage anyone that is having thoughts that people will miss you and please hang on and talk to someone. Two, maybe thereâ€™s someone here that has been through what Iâ€™m going through and wants to talk. Either way, I love every single person here, even though I donâ€™t know you, and please just keep grasping on to tomorrow if thatâ€™s all you have. One day at a time we can figure it out.
