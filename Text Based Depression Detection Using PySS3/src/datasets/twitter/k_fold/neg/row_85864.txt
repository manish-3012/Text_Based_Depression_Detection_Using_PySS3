Don't know if I'll make it to 21.I'll be 21 soon and I feel trapped, completely. I legitimately am a burden to my family and society in general. Funny how people say suicide is selfish yet when you're a fucking loser manchild who can't handle responsibility they look at you in disgust. I'm almost positive I'll do it soon as I have a reliable and lethal method available. I'm pretty sure I'm some kind of covert narcissist anyways. And who the fuck needs those people around. It honestly only makes sense to end it. It sucks my family is the only thing keeping me here because they'd honestly be better off in the long run.
