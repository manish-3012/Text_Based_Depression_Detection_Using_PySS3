I feel like I'm just done with life.I'm 30 and my life has been shit from beginning to now. I live this awful lonely existence where I have no personal life(never have), and a social life so narrow that it's either be the quiet weird brother around my brother and his friends or be alone at home. While most people have friends and best friends, the few friends I've ever made have pretty much disappeared from my life. So I'm just tired of doing it. The past two weeks I seem to get up every morning and just feel like I want to die or want to kill myself.
