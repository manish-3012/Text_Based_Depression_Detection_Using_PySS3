The good doesn't stick like the badUgh. I should be doing fine. Social life is great, grades are alright, my hobbies are going well, but it's just not sticking. The joy doesn't come and stay nearly as much as the sadness does. While I'm doing things I enjoy, I'm on top of the world. But at school in class and at night, it's like none of the good stuff happened. Even talking to friends at school, classes beat that down. I'm so fucking done with group projects, and yet more and more come along. Group projects have resulted in wanting to kill myself several times so far during the day, wanting to lock myself in a bathroom and die. I fucking hate this school. I was doing well with everything, and their bullshit "hands on", " we're fucking special snowflakes" philosophy has brought me back to this point. I'm not sure if I'm happy or sad about that. What I do know is that no matter what good things happen, bad stuff always comes along. Last time I was feeling this way, the want for death overwhelmed the concern for how everyone would feel about my death. Now, I don't feel like people would care too much, and I want to die because it just seems *easier*.

I just don't seem to have much in the way of feelings anymore, my feelings feel muffled. People would probably care but I just can't... It doesn't feel like they would care that much, they'd get over it. Not so much that they wouldn't care at first, but everything shall pass, and life would go on.

I don't know. My want for death is not because of anything outside of school, but just to avoid those terrible classes where I feel trapped and just can't escape. The good classes don't outweigh that feeling of despair, seems like nothing does.
