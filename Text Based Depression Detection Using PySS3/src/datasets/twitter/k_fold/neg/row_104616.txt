building resolveI started posting here, about a year and a half ago...   I really wanted the attention, I really wanted to wallow in self pity...

time passes

I look at my life now,  I see what I tried to improve, I see what has happened. 

I see the potential of a "Greener Pasture"

But, I can't help but feel that it is a waste.

Why am I trying to improve my life?  There is a solution where I can sit down and not have to try anymore.

I think about the career paths that are available, I think at my online dating profile.  

I think about what I do have... my parents and siblings, I think of my friends who have tried to stick around...

False hope.  

It's time I get serious about ending it.
