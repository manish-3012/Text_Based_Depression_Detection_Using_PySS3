Everything is a lieIâ€™ve been suicidal for a few months now. Never attempted it though. I just cut myself every now and then. I think of things I can do to kill myself like drink bleach or hang myself but I just never manage to go through with it. Iâ€™ve told people about my suicidal thoughts but nobody seems to care enough to check up on me everyday and ask me about it. I thought this girl really cared about me but deep down I feel like when she says, â€˜I will never be fine if you dieâ€™ sheâ€™s lying to me. She ignores my texts sometimes and acts weird making me all confused. Anyway I donâ€™t wanna rant about that. All I wanted to say is that I feel extremely hopeless because of how the world is around us. If we think about it, everything is just a big fat lie. So whatâ€™s the point of carrying on?
