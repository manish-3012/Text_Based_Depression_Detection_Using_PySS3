Is losing him, losing me?I want to be with him. But hes so hurt that he hurts me and i let it happen. Im so weak... while he returns to work. I plot my own death. And he doesnt like that. I tend to cut myself. Because i DESERVE IT. Ive been cutting since i was 12. I have my reasons to why im depressed and fucked up. And he knows why. We have a beautiful little boy. And my bf says to meâ€i hope he isnt sad like us.â€ I explained to him why im depressed a d he said â€œoh is that the reason u fucked me over cause thats what it sounds like.â€ I gotso fucken sad because like he knows what ive been through as a kid. And yea im fucked up but we have 5 months working on our 4 year relationship and he acts like he hasnâ€™t noticed how i changed for him. I do love him  but is it worth it?
