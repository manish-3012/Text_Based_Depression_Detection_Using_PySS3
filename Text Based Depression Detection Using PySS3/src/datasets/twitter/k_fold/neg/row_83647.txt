The truthMy parents are nothing like me, they judge other people and behave the way I wouldnâ€™t.  In the country I live you canâ€™t get bank account if youâ€™re underage without adult permission, you canâ€™t order stuff online, you canâ€™t work legally, etc.  And Iâ€™m too dependent on my parents and it makes me sick. I have no idea how to become more independent when Iâ€™ll be 18.  Without work experienceâ€¦ It looks like everything will be the same: they will do my laundry for me, tell me what to do, drive me to malls, talk with teachers for me, cook meals, etc. And  about intimacy. I never had a boyfriend, was never ask out, never kissed someone to the lips, never been hugged, was never invited to the party or friends house, never had sex. When a guy approaches me I just donâ€™t know how to behave. I just donâ€™t have the flirting skills. I feel like Iâ€™m always looking for someone to do things for me. I missed all those years when you gain social experience, etc., because I was sitting at home and reading books, gaining knowledge. I had terrible depression last year.. When the time came to choose between friends and higher position in school, I chose the better position. I had perfect grades, but at that time I lost all of my friends, because I worked more. When I realized how alone I was, I just worked harder, keeping myself busy to forget about it. I gained knowledge, but everyone around was turning away from me, I even sat alone all the time at school, when everyone sat in pairs, no one wanted to work in group/pairs with me. I had a few opportunities to stop the loneliness, but I rejected everyone who tried to get closer to me. And when I met someone who had normal social life and better knowledge/grades/skills than meâ€¦I lost motivation and will to live. No matter how hard I tried, someone was better than me. I reached the bottom. I was bullied a lot, everyone made fun of me . I didnâ€™t know who I was anymore, everything seemed pointless. No matter how much I tried to gain friends back, no one wanted me, even my own family. I started to believe that Iâ€™m stupid and I accepted it. But after 4-5 years of trying.. I wanted to gain my knowledge back again. I keep trying to become that motivated, selfish, but very hard working and intelligent person I was, but itâ€™s not coming back. Now Iâ€™m left without friends and â€œbrainâ€. Canâ€™t find my place in this world. I lost the hope. I have depression, social anxiety, Iâ€™m afraid to go outside and make interaction with other people because I know that Iâ€™ll be rejected and misunderstood. Iâ€™m sitting at home my whole summer holidays.  People donâ€™t get me, they donâ€™t understand my pain. Iâ€™ll hang myself today. I have no one to talk to me, Iâ€™m completely alone.
