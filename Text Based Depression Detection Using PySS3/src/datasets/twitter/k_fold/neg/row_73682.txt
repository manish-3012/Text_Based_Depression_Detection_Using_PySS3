How is it ethical to put a dog down but not a humanWhen animals are in severe physical pain humans first instinct is to put it down, the animal canâ€™t communicate, it doesnâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing. But if a human is in severe emotional pain, and they want to die on their own terms and they make the choice to end their life, they are considered extremely selfish. Does anyone feel the same way? I donâ€™t know Iâ€™m just venting.
