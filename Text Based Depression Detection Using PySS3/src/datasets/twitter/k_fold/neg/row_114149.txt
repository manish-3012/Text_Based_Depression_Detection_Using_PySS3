My soulmateI have a close friend who means the world to me. She doesn't wish to speak to me anymore. We haven't had a meaningful conversation in two years. She has always had emotional problems and pushes people away. She prides herself on her independence. I fear that one day she will commit suicide so much so that if I haven't heard from her in a long time I end up checking obituaries or her father's Facebook. She said she did the same thing to me fearing my death and checked my mother's Facebook. Although we rarely talk, a life where she is gone is terrifying.
