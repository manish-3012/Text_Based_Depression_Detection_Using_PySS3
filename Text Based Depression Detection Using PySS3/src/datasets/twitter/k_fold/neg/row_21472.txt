I am a person who has BPD and looking for a DBT around Los Angeles County and area of San Gabriel valley.

DBT dialectical behavioral therapy is the only way out for me.
I currently have a Medicare card.
However, I need to work. I do not have time to do DBT, but I have to do DBT because BPD is really an issue for me.
