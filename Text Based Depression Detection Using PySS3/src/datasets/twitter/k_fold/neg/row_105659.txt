Did someone turn the lights off...Or is it just another dark cloud in my head?
I'm cut deep, my heart won't beat, deep down low it's killing me.... I think I need help, cause I'm drowning in myself"- Papa Roach

First time poster, non-throwaway. Check my history to see how much vitriol I spew just to live. 
20 years of depression, mixed with a near decade of schizo affective disorder- that's schizophrenia mixed with- in my case- bi-polar disorder.

There was a time I was considering which law school I wanted to attend. Now I'm an abuser that can't be employed anywhere. The ultimate twist on this story- I was a peer counselor for sexual assault and domestic violence. 

There is nothing left. I'm overeducated and underemployed. I am losing my ability to write (despite acing the AP eng test) and am struggling to maintain basic coherent thoughts. My mom would yell for hours to herself and I am finding myself doing the same to keep repetitive thoughts away. I can't drive well or really go outside without thinking someone or something is against me. 

I majored in Psych so at the very least I am aware of my self-destruction.  I am now craving my self-destruction. I can't do it anymore. Over and over again my bi-polar flares will take me to outrageous behavior while my schizophrenic tendencies rob my of my basic faculties. 

I've hospitalized myself, but there is no denying; to continue is to allow this disease to take from me everything that once made me, me. There is no alternative. Schizophrenia can not be cured. The only thing that makes me feel alive is drinking, thus I have become an alcoholic.

My time is very neigh. My gf and son won't understand, but at least once I'm gone the whirlwind of chaotic-ness will end. 

If you are young, I hope you get the treatment you need. Mental illness can be ameliorated if you are honest with you treatment provider.
I still recall a therapist I saw telling me that my problems were too much for him and to get another provider; I never fully recovered.

If you have a chance to live free- no criminal record- take it. There is still the chance to be anything you want to; teach in China, join the army, join Greenpeace, get a master's in Norway. 

I'd recommend not becoming addicted to drugs and never, ever, letting anger rule your life because you will end up like me; no choice but to die.
