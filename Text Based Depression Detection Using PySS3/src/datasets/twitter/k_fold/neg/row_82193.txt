My girlfriend who I was guna put through college is going to break up with me.For her birthday I got her and I a trip to Tenerife it's on the 4th of july. It's too late to change names and all that so we agreed to try and be a couple untill after the trip and see how the trip goes. She said she would try but she isn't. This girl who I've been saving up money to help her pay for rent and food this september when she moves away for college looked me in the eye and said she doesn't love me, yet she gave out to me for me saying if we break up I'll be deleting all of our photos off my phone (because they would up set me too much). We have been texting and she calls me baby still and it's is really confusing.

I'm thinking about doing it i dont know when and i dont know how. But it's guna get done.
