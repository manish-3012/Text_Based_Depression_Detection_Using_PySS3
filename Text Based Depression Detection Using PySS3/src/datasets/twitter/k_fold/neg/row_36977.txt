want to go to sleep and never wake upwe've been struggling with suicidal ideation for most of our life, had a couple very serious attempts but years ago. we have DID, an extensive gruesome trauma history, daily nightmares and flashbacks and other symptoms. we have two suicidal alters, one whose preferred method is to take us to the river to drown us, and a recently surfaced alter who is, um, more active in their plans to die.

lately we have 'come to', finding that we have been googling suicide methods, looking mostly for a painless method of overdoing. we have had thoughts of acquiring fentanyl because we have heard it is pretty easy to kill yourself with, even accidentally, but have no clue how we would find any. its not like we can put an ad on Facebook marketplace.

we suppose we could stockpile our psych meds but that would take weeks. besides, we don't even know how much it would take to kill us. we have even looked into MAID, which is legal in Canada.

these episodes of suicidality can last for an entire day. when we're NOT suicidal we're actually quite rational, after all, out of the over fifteen of us, only two regularly want to die. its pretty odd to be honest. 

strangely, we can be very logical about wanting to die. we have no family that cares about us, no children, few friends, only endless suffering, we struggle every single day just to function, to maintain a pretence of normalcy. we have frequent somatic memory attacks, flashbacks, memory intrusions, attacks from persecutor alters, profound shame and self-loathing, and completely overwhelming mental, physical, and emotional exhaustion. we experience debilitating terror daily, and suffer from anorexia and agoraphobia. why WOULDN'T we want to die?

our only real lifeline is our trauma therapist, who see weekly. and Duffy bear, our comfort item.
