Overdosing on benadrylThis is a response to an old post, and I know that probably nobody is gonna see it but no, overdosing on benadryl wouldnâ€™t be a good way to kill yourself. I mean sure if you took around like 2,000mg than you probably would but that would be very painful because it would just make your liver and your kidneys fail. Iâ€™m speaking from personal experience when I say this and Iâ€™m not trying to tell you not to but this is not the best way to go. When I did it I took around 530mg and I ended up in the emergency room, when I got there they made me drink activated charcoal to stop the pills from damaging my live and after that they were trying to draw my blood and trying to get an IV in me but they couldnâ€™t find a vein because I was very dehydrated from the medication and so that was extremely painful. When they finally got the IV in they started giving me some type of medicine to help calm my heart rate down but it started mixing with the benadryl and that made me hallucinate, I was hallucinating for about 12 hours and I got maybe an hour or two of sleep that night and then woke up in a different hospital in an ICU. I was there for a few days and then I was transferred to a  psychiatric hospital and I was kept there for 5 days. All together I was in a hospital for 8 days and it was terrible. I was luck to not have suffered and liver or kidney damage from any of this but it was still a horrible experience. If you are going to try and kill yourself I canâ€™t stop you and I went through the same thing so I know how it feels, but donâ€™t use this meathod unless you want a painful death or a horrible week or two in the hospital if you survive.
