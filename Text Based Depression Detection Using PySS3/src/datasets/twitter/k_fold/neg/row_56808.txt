I can't get happyIt feels like I can never be happy anymore. Nothing in my life has gone good except me finally being allowed to get FB. I can't get Snap or Insta just FB. But life just. Sucks. Kids endlessly bully me for my orientation, looks, aesthetic, money, religion, and basically anything else you can think of. School is super stressful going into a new semester all my teachers are over working me. Not to mention band, I don't even want to be in band anymore but I am not allowed to quit. And when I asked my father for a new phone he said how much would it be and I said around 300 which we get income tax soon so we would get about 7000 and he said he is only willing to spend 50 bucks on one. My parents literally never buy me anything new it is all used and broken. If I do get something new it is because it was free. I just can't anymore.
