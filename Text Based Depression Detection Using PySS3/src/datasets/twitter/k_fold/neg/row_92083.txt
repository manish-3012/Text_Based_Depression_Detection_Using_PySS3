I donâ€™t know what to do...If Iâ€™m being honest I never thought I would be here. My life seems to just be falling apart nothing seems to go my way. I spend most nights crying myself to sleep and the will to keep going dwindles more and more with each passing day. 

Things really took a turn for the worst these last two weeks. First my best friend in the world who Iâ€™ve know for 14+ Years cut all contact with me and simply stopped talking to me. She refuses to talk to me and today when I messaged her asking if we were still friends she responded in a group message I am a part of but did not respond to my message. On top of that an ex girlfriend who I dated for about a year but was abusive to me when we dated re entered my life. Sadly I got way too drunk one night at a party and we hooked up. Today she told me she was pregnant. We used a condom but I guess itâ€™s just my luck that every single thing in my life goes wrong. 

I truly Donâ€™t know what to do she said she is keeping the baby but I am not ready to be a father. Iâ€™m only 20 years old Iâ€™m not ready for that responsibility in my life. I can barley keep myself alive let alone have to take care of someone else. Please I want to end it all but I just donâ€™t know. The only reason I havenâ€™t done anything yet is cause Iâ€™m scared of dying but the idea of it becomes more and more attractive as my life gets shittier.
