Why is everything so cruel in this world.I feel like Iâ€™ve failed it. Everything I do makes me feel like a loser. Iâ€™m tired of this. And I donâ€™t care anymore. I have nobody to talk to. Nobody would understand. My parents would just be disappointed. And if I look for a friend, I donâ€™t have any real friends. There was this one person but we ended on bad terms. I donâ€™t think I can get out of this state of mind ever in my life.
