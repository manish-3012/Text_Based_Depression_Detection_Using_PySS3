I have plans for today but I want to just skip out and dieThereâ€™s a job hiring event for a party store I applied to that begins in a couple hours. Iâ€™m terrified of going. I hate the interview process because I donâ€™t know what to say. I get nervous and I shake. I stutter and I want to cry. It ducking sucks that Iâ€™m like this and that I canâ€™t communicate with strangers normally. 

Everything seems pointless. Maybe I should just get a warehouse job. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll be slow but at least I wonâ€™t have to talk to people. But im anemic and im afraid of what that kind of job will physically do to my body. But maybe I should just face social anxiety head on and force myself to talk to people. A retail job would do that. 

I know going to this interview Iâ€™ll mess up. I always mess up. I either come off as bitchy who only cares about myself or socially awkward. I seriously hate myself. Just thinking about it all and the past rejection makes me want to die.

Iâ€™ve made comments about wanting to comment suicide frequently but Iâ€™ve been seriously considering it, and thatâ€™s scary.
