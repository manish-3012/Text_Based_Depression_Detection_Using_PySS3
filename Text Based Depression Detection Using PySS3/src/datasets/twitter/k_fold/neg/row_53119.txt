I dont want to make it to 17.Im sitting here in art class. Art makes me so happy. I cant' bring myself to do any. This is probably a sign that I should just give up. Im terrible at it anyways. I dont have a single talent in life - im selfish, ugly, fat, pretty damn stupid, slow, everything bad. Nothing good. I try to be kind to make up for how terrifyijg i Must be to look at . I look like a creepy alien, my face is warped and scary and disgusting, my body is out of proportion and huge. im 160 pounds. i was 120 last year. im so ashamed of myself.

My birthday is in June. I don't want to make it. I want to end it before, end it as soon as possible. My liver is damaged from an attempt a while ago. That means itll be easy to OD on all my meds at once tonight.

I have a boyfriend but he will be fine. He'd rather get high than come to school anyways. I love him but Im way too crazy and dont deserve him. Ive finally made a few friends but im probably an annoying tagalong/liability. i dont want to be a burden. So I will end it.

I just want my brain to be clear not foggy. I want to feel emotion. I dont know anymore. thanks everyone. I'll write some notes tonight. I've been planning on this for a while but it was going to be in May - i cant wait anymore. I really cant. Im tired.
