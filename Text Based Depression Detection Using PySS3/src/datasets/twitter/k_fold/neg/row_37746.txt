Iâ€™ve never attempted cutting or suicide but Iâ€™m on a delicate balance and I need helpToday, April fools day, was the 2nd worst day of my life yet. Iâ€™d rather not talk about the first. One of my crushes posted on her story this morning that she was now single! My depression yesterday was kinda bad, so this pulled me out of it temporarily. Two minutes later, she posts April fools!! My heart disintegrated within a half second. That are my day off some. I shot my shot with another one of my crushes. She laughed at me. So, to make it seem all fine and dandy, I said April fools between tears. That was the straw that broke the camelâ€™s back. I canâ€™t find reason anymore because my friends are the main thing that keeps me going, and I canâ€™t see them. I canâ€™t have any physical contact with my mom, which is wrecking my soul, and my depression has been around for about a year and a half now. This is the worst lull Iâ€™ve been in. Please help
