exhaustionexhaustion smells of futility. a single burning thought: what am i forgetting. what have i done, what have i failed to do?

under the single incandescent bulb, a second burning thought: if these psychiatric meds shorten my life, how will my children remember me?

who could sleep with thoughts like these?
