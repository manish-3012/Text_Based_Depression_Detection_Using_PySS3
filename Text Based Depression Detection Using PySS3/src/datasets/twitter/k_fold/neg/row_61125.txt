Can't handle loneliness any more I feel alone and useless. I don't know why I'm even typing this out, but I guess I just need someone to hear it. I live with my best friend, her boyfriend and a guy friend of hers. In a very lonely, reclusive person. I've never had more than a fling with guys and I loathe myself entirely. I am fixated on the idea of a relationship. I want nothing more than to be loved. I really, really like my (guy) roommate. He has a girlfriend. For the most part, I can handle it. But not tonight. As I type this all of my roommates are in the next room with their SOs. This drives me crazy. Loneliness honestly is eating away at me right now. I can't do this anymore. My friends don't listen to me anymore. I bore them. All I want is to be loved, but I feel there's no escaping this. I'm so drained at this point and feel worthless and pathetic.
