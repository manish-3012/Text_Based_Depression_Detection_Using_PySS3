No matter what I do my mind always comes back to thoughts of suicideMy childhood was great , didn't grow up rich or anything but we'll off. Parents took very good care of me made sure I had everything I ever needed. But as I grew up this feeling of emtyness and loneliness never went away. No matter what I did , friends I made or places I went the happiness was always fleeting. I wanted to die. I felt like I had no purpose no meaning to my life. I started heavily drinking with people who weren't even friends. I just wanted to drink to the point I couldn't wake up. Eventually I broke down when I was about 17 in the doctors office when they asked me if I had been feeling depressed. Ended up being diagnosed with chronic depression. I've been on medication the past 4 years and I'm turning 21 soon. these feeling I have haven't gone away the medicine helps but the thought of killing myself one day is almost a comfort. Is there something wrong with me.
