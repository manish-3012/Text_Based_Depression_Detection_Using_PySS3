Loss of Hope, Constant Rejection, No PassionI'm not exactly sure why I am writing this on Reddit but I feel so hopeless and unseen.  Sometimes I think I'm completely invisible. 

I'm thinking about suicide all of time lately. I try to focus on other tasks and things but I always end up back at just killing myself. I don't know why I exist or what there even is in this world for me. I'm embarrassed of myself, I hate myself, and I think it's just time. 

Things haven't gotten better for me. I'm 30 now and I regret not killing myself at 16 at the peak of when my life was good. 

I feel like there are people who love me, but they don't really know or understand me. They always say they accept me and when it comes down to it always have a problem with me or a criticism for me, I'm sick of it. I'm over it and there is nowhere I feel safe anymore. 

I've tried everything. Medication. St. Johns Wort. Therapy. Group Therapy. Mindfulness. taking one day at a fucking time.... all of it. Moments of good and happiness come up but I always end up back here. 

There really is no point in my mediocre existence. There is no place for me here, no friend that can help me. Why even go on talking about it? Maybe someone will read this and tell me not to do it... but no one has to be me and live my life. I know we all suffer. I have no hope anymore. Our society has damaged me.I will not be remembered, I will not be missed, my life will have made no impact, no difference. 

When I was little I thought I was special, I thought we were all special. I was so wrong. We are nothing unless someone with power or money says so. I'm too invisible to be seen. 

I'm really afraid to do it... but I just don't know what else to do, life isn't better, I'm not better.
