I'm done being strong.I'm 25, trans, living in a backwards country, dealing with depression and suicidal urges for over a decade. My partner wont stay with me if i transition. That's their choice and I want them to be happy. they are supportive and wonderful but couldnt be romantically engaged romantically after. 

Throughout my life I've suffered in silence and lived according to other people and I'm fucking done with it. I'm nearly certain that I'll die sometime soon. I put my life on hold to support my partner and build our life together. I have no education, no savings, no security. My partner is going into a fantastic field and is going to be set for life. 

I'm not bitter. I just have nothing left. I have no strength left. no hope. Nothing.
