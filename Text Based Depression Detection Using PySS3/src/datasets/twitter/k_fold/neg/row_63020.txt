I just tried to kill myself what now?Like really tried like took 6 Advil then cut in my bath tub hoping that Iâ€™d die of blood loss then switched to a shower when  I heard my parents and just keep cutting till I felt like i was gunna faint and had to sit down in my tub just to keep from falling over.
Fuckkkkkkkk I have a problem donâ€™t I. Is it bad that Iâ€™m pissed I stopped it is isnâ€™t it? Fuck I feel like I was so close I wrote a note I cut on both my legs something I told myself Iâ€™d never do unless I was committing shittttttt. What am I even supposed to do now I wanna try again but if I do it now someone will definitely come in the bathroom Iâ€™ve been in here to long already. I kinda wanna tell my parents but I also donâ€™t and what if they think Iâ€™m just attention seeking or start guilt trippiest me again fuck. Shoot I shouldnâ€™t curse this much sorry I just feel like it might be warranted. I have homework I should probably work on that but how am I just supposed to go on living after this. Do I need to go to a doctor or something fuck Iâ€™m definitely pale and dizzy as shit. Frick what do I even do now?
