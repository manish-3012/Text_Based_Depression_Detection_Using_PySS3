Why Do I Suck So Hard??!!Why do I have to be the world's most useless loser?? Seriously, what is wrong with me?

Well, a lot obviously as I'm here on a suicide sub begging for help from a stranger I will never meet. But beyond the standard LOSER list for someone in his 20s (rarely leave my house, have no friends and never meet new people, have no significant other, have no sex, live alone work from home, have severe anxiety about money, have a chronic disease sapping my energy), there's also the fact I cannot for the life of me have even one good reasonable night of sleep. Like no matter what I try I'm so addicted to stupid things that I sleep at 3am and wake up literally after 4 or 6pm.

How am I going to make any attempt to save my worthless life if I can't even be awake at reasonable hours.

I tried slicing my wrists for the first time every because I absolutely deserve every amount of physical and emotional pain.. is there anything I actually care about? Yes my pet. Watch her randomly die. Please help. Although bullying and tormenting me works too.
