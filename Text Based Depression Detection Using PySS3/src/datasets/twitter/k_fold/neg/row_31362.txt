How am I supposed to care about college when I don't care about being alive?My girlfriend dumped me. I loved this girl more than anything in the world. Felt things I didn't know existed. She left me and I'm am literally falling apart. To make things even better, I live three doors down from her. She is the most beautiful and interesting person I have ever met. This probably sounds like the same story told a thousand times but I'm tired of waking up each day to feel like a thrown away piece of trash
