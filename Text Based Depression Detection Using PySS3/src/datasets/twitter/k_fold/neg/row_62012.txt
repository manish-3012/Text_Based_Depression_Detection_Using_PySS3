If you want to live, that's your call. Don't expect me to suffer with you. You're making a choice to live and accept suffering that comes with it.Don't call me selfish for wanting to die. I'm here for you and nothing else. I'm here suffering for you every day. Just please let me die. Stop dragging me through this hell. Why do you want to live like this anyway. Life is not some fun  adventure.
