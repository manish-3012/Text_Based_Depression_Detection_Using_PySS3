It keeps getting worse. Need to get stuff in order.In the last week my ex wife said she was going to take my son to another state very far away. My shrink said I may have to be inpatient, and my health took a dive.

If I wind up inpatient I'll lose my son. So I can't even be honest with my shrink now.

I got fucked so badly on my divorce, and my business tanking in part due to covid, that I don't have the resources to fight her. And the other jobs that were taking to me stopped because of hiring freezes.

My not quite gf said she doesn't want to do this much longer, and wants to kill our relationship around the first of the year. But for my birthday I get to spend time with her, and my two best friends. After that Im done.

I need to finish getting stuff in order. I have to decide how destructive I want to be too those that have hurt me. And who to leave stuff to, including the relatively small amount of money I have left.

A few years ago I was finally doing ok after 20 years of suicidal ideation. Then I lost everything. My previous business arrangement and marriage disintegrated in the same 48 hours. Now I won't even get to see my son but for a month of the year.

And here I am. I need to get the appropriate drugs from the proper channels. I've read the books, and I don't want to die violently. I know my family and friends will be sad, but they will be able to carry on. I just have a little more work to do to make it easier for them.

I've tried so hard to be a good human, even if I'm not perfect.  It doesn't matter. Good doesn't prevail.
