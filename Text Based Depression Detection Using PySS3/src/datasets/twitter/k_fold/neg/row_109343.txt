Thinking about tonightLast night I lost my only friend group. It was all my fault. I can never get them back. Without them, I am nothing. I have nothing going for me in real life. I donâ€™t have any exams for a job, I donâ€™t have any money, and I will probably be kicked out when Iâ€™m 18 which is soon.

Iâ€™ve spent all day today sleeping, wishing to never wake up. Now Iâ€™m awake, I canâ€™t handle it anymore. I might overdose tonight, not sure what on, I guess the first thing I see. Iâ€™m sorry for hurting my friend group. Iâ€™m sorry for existing.
