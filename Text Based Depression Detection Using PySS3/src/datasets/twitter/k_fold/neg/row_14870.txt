Missing my birthday for residentialI'm gonna be at residential on my birthday. It's out of state during all this Corona shit. I already only have one friend and now I'll be completely alone. can't even get bday presents
Life keeps getting worse
Maybe I can get away w it at some point. I don't wanna live through this shit, no matter how long I wait things get worse and worse
Ex boyfriend who I thought I'd marry hates me
I lost all my friends
Missing my birthday
I can't even use my phone
