Im not black anymoreToday i was supposed to stop drinking alcohol because im partly addicted, and having sex, and masturbating 3 times a day, and a bunch of other unhealthy stuff that im doing because of depression and w.e. Im constantly sick and unhealthy, someone gave me a bit of hope that i could change that, so today was the cutoff point. But today i was told im probably not black for having a different opinion than someone else, i've been told i wasnt black since i was a kid, for speaking proper english(shocking i know), trying to get good grades, listening to rock music, just being myself. Bullied over alot of it. Never felt like i belonged in a community, and after hearing it again after so many years i can push my "stop drinking" back a few days, cracking a few cold ones. This drink is for all the people who feel like they dont belong anywhere
