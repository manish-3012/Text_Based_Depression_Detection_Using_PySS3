I am doing it tonightMy life is constantly going downwards and i see no point in livin anymore. Today was a horrible day and a cherry on top of it all. I am a loser. I am done with it.


My plan for tonight is to take a shower, wash my hair, change my beedsheets and take a mix of several pills. I'm planning on taking 14 Brintellix pills, 6 zoloft pills, and a couple of helex pills depending on how many pills do i have at home. I would have taken more, but i don't have anymore. None of these are letal per se, but mixed together they can cause serotonine syndrome and possibly death. I know I will be dead in the morning. I will take the pills after my mom goes to sleep and then she wont check up on till the morning, that's at least 9 hours. Then it will be too late. I won't leave a suicide note, everyone knows how I feel already.


 I just don't want to exist anymore. I will never be able to fullfil my dreams and my life is just currently really bad and i don't think it will ever be better. It would be a miracle if it got better.
