Please give adviceIâ€™m 18, I live and work in the middle of the English countryside, on a beautiful farm with my Grandmother and my Uncle. But Iâ€™m incredibly depressed, I was continuously emotionally and physically abused till the age of 14, both of my parents left along time ago and I was expelled from school in the middle of my GCSES so I am left with no education. 

The only person who got me through this was my ex girlfriend (we dated for 3 years) and we broke up about a month ago because she went to university. So I am left with no one at all, when I was with her I felt like I didnâ€™t need anyone else, I am so lonely it hurts like nothing else, until tonight I still talked to my ex and she has been continuously messing with my head, telling me she loves me and then telling me about the guys she is fucking, but I am too weak to just move on from the situation because I have no one else. 

I have no idea what to do, I just want advice, I need to meet people and get out of here but I canâ€™t leave because my family need me. Iâ€™m alone tonight tending the farm and the only thing I can think about is getting drunk and slitting my wrists.
