regret opening myself up at alltbh i think this will be the first and LAST time i listen to my therapist or anyone else that offers advice at this point. a little background on me.. im 25, suffer from depression, anxiety, borderline personality, ptsd, agoraphobia, ednos. was sexually abused from age 4 all through to age 14. my family with exception of my mother, twin and dad sided with my abuser and turns out they knew he was a pedophile just didnt care and would invite him to events n family get togheers etc etc.   


anyway, im also extremely shy/awkward cant verbally speak to people (not including my immediate fam). as a result i never had any friends, i had one actual friend in highschool n a friend by association cuz she was friends with my one friend. anyway after highschool ended we lost touch/contact n she moved to mexico. so i have no one. my therapist suggested that i join support groups to make friends and try to find people ic an relate to. so i took the advice, joined this site and a few others within the last few days hoping for the best. my view of humanity is already so low because ive been hurt so much for so long by other human interaction. but i wanted to do something different and try to overcome my fears.   


fast forward today, ive recieved some kindness from some on here, but also keep having run ins with asshole people making me feel even worse than i do now. im not in a good way, extremely suicidal and not sure if i even want to bother with being here anymore, n was already getting my affairs in order. but i wanted to give living one last try and  give one last effort and i have assholes treating me like sht from some of these websites. idk what to do anymore. its EXTREMELY hard for me to open myself up. my one friend didnt know anything about my past, n i didnt open up to her till just end of highschool n she still ended up abandonment me too just like everyone else, so i just dont want to speak or say anything about myself.
