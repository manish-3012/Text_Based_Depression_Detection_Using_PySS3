Iâ€™m dying at 12am ESTAs much as I wished about myself getting better, at 12am EST I am done. I have my pills and water ready to overdose I love you guys goodluck with everything and I just wanna share a short poem.

In peace may we leave the shore
In love may we find the next
Safe passage on our travels 
Until our final journey into the ground
â€œMay we meet againâ€
