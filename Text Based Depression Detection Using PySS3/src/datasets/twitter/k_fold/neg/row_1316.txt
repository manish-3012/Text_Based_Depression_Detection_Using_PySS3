I don't know what I haveThat's it.
I've been feeling horrible nowadays... But first some context: I'm a 17yo NB mexican... I just feel like random "depressive attacks" (idk if that even exists) passes through me from time to time, I'm currently in one of those â€”and the strongest I've ever had... I've never had the intense necessity to self-harm, but now I... I just feel like ripping my veins outâ€”. 
Well, you be probably thinking why do I feel like that... Thing is I don't even know... I mean, I have such severe things going on, but they've been there for quite a long period of time, and never lead to anything close to this.

They rejected me from both my dream careers (Neuroscience and Genomics â€”but still accepted in other 3â€”) like 2 weeks ago, but i don't think that's the problem, or at least not the whole.
Those attacks I said usually are coined together with flashbacks â€”long historyâ€”, shortened version: I think I was raped around 5-7yro and I had amnesia (those flashbacks came to my mind since idk when, but long ago, but I instantly forgot about it like next day... Until 1 year ago when suddenly I got conscious about having a mental gap [however I still can't remember anything about what happened, I just know something happened].

So, the other thing is being trans... I just accepted it during this quarantine, and no close-relative knows. I'm quite anxious about it (back in time, I thought trans ppl exaggerated dysphoria, now I see it's fucking completely real), whatever, I don't thing that's what's affecting me this much rn neither.

Idk if I just had panick attacks the whole night or what, but my hands' sweating, I got random crying attacks, hyperventilation, my hearth goes crazy, and I can't fucking sleep (as a matter of fact, can't since like 1 week ago).

I tried to ask for help to my friends, but I feel like I'm bothering 'em. I first had this today around 12 in the night, and a girl started chatting with me out of nothing, so that tranquilized me for a while, but then another attack came 30 mins later and went off, but then another one came, and one more like 20 mins ago (I'm at 3:50 in the morning).
