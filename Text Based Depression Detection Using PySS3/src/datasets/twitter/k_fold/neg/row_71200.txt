Help mePlease help me, anybody!
I canâ€™t take this pain anymore, this time Iâ€™m going to actually do it, Iâ€™m going to be strong and end it.
I canâ€™t see a scenario where I live through this, I just canâ€™t. Thereâ€™s no hope for me.

Iâ€™m sorry to my family, this wasnâ€™t your fault. itâ€™ll be easier without me anyway.
To my friends Iâ€™m sorry too but letâ€™s be honest nobody will miss me that much. I hope you move on quickly.

Tonight Iâ€™m leaving. Iâ€™ll wake up, put some clothes on and end my suffering once and for all. 

Goodbye.
