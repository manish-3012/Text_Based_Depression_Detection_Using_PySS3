Where did I lose myselfHas this reckless life been worth it. Why have I always been so self destructive. Now I am here. All joy gone. Living with a cloud above my head every day. It feels like I am just postponing my faith. Why have I always felt I would die young. And why does it seem I can't get out anymore. Everytime I try, it seems bad stuff happens again.

I have that feeling I have no where to go. Neither god nor the devil will protect me. I am in the middle, I have done bad and done good. And now I end up with no place to turn too. It is just counting the days now. They are both out to get me. I am stuck.
