People keep giving up on me and I see why.I never try to recover, I never get back to them unless they dont seem fake to me with the usual "it gets better" bullshit.

Truth is i dont want to get better, I have bad grades,  nobody believes in me i dont even believe in myself, I dont see a "good" future even if i live.

At this point im living for other people.
