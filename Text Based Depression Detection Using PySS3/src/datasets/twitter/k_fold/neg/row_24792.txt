Hoping to die early by accident/illnessIm chronically in pain which leads me to depression and suicidal. Iâ€™d love to end my life but Iâ€™m not brave enough and I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone. I keep thinking maybe it will get better but I highly doubt it. At this point, Iâ€™m ready to be gone anytime. Life could be beautiful but not for someone whoâ€™s chronically in pain.
