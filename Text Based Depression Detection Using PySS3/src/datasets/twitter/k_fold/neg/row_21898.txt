Pleasethereâ€™s no painless ways to die are they. I tried a blade instead for the first time and I never knew anything could be that sharp. I tried but itâ€™s too painful. Everything else is hidden from me. Iâ€™m tired of suffering and my reasons arenâ€™t even valid enough thatâ€™s why they sent me home. The only way theyâ€™ll care is if they find me bleeding out but I canâ€™t even do that. Why am I healthy? Iâ€™m pathetic , i donâ€™t even know if I have a reason. I just want to rest forever. Iâ€™ve been praying to drop dead. I hate being alive for crying out loud. Why am I such a pussy? I hate everyday. Itâ€™s the same as yesterday, this house just depresses me. I canâ€™t even kill myself. Everyoneâ€™s acting fake and bringing up things that I wanted before all of this shit just because theyâ€™re aware of me feeling this way. Fuck you. I donâ€™t want anything or to go anywhere i. just. want. to. die.  :( please, thatâ€™s all I wish for
