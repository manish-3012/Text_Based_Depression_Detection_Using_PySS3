Welp, I think this is itI've rolled it around my head all day. I only stopped myself last night because I realized that my method was stupid. I've got a new one now and I don't think anything can really stop me at this rate. As I mentioned in the previous post (and others before that) the overarching issue has always been an unreal level of stubbornness. I outright refuse to listen to advice sometimes, or at least take it to heart. I know that I'm the only person that can help myself in the end, I know that I can conceivabley do it, but no matter how hard I try I just can't get past that mental wall. Not gonna do anything special beforehand, no note, no will. Those are for people who have something left to say or something left to give. I just want to say, thank those of you who tried for at least trying. I'm not going to be able to do anything until about 4 hours from now, so try if you are so inclined. I doubt it'll do much good.
