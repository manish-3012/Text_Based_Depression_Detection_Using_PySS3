I hate complaining about my pampered life but god dammit I want to die so badlyI'm in a great neighborhood, my family is well off, I eat well, and I just want to put a bullet in my brain.  It's just repetition.  Every single day is the same.  Everyone is moving around me but I'm just in stasis.  I sit here at my desk and browse the internet all day.

I dropped out of high school without ever completing the 9th grade (after attempting it three times).  It's just so fucking pathetic.  I could get my GED.  But I choose not too.  Because that's all I am.  I'm just a filthy leech, completely supported by those around me, with nothing in return.  Once again, *pathetic*.

I don't know why I put up with any of this shit anymore.  I'm clearly not worth the time of day to other people.  I mean who the fuck would hire me?  I hate manual labor.  And I set myself up for a life working a job like that.  I don't want that life.  I'd rather die than deal with the repercussions of my pitiful choices.

Why am I even writing this?  It's just strangers on the internet.  All you can do is offer an 'I love you' or something.  But you don't really love me.  If you got to know me you probably wouldn't like me all that much.  I don't contribute to society one bit.

It's torture and I just want to make it all stop.
