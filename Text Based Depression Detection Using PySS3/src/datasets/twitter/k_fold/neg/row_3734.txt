DoneIâ€™m done. 
Iâ€™ve written a will, written notes, started giving away all my stuff. Iâ€™ve been arranging meet ups with people so I can see them one last time. 
Iâ€™m in agony. Living is torture and I donâ€™t think I should have to do this if I donâ€™t want to. 
I might hurt maybe a few friends but I honestly couldnâ€™t care less. Life isnâ€™t worth living, not even for them. 
Iâ€™m just trying for a method now. 
Iâ€™ve not got a date in mind, Iâ€™m horrid with deadlines (deadlines, get it?). Iâ€™ll just know when itâ€™s time to go but itâ€™ll have to be soon. Iâ€™m trying to hold out until Monday/Tuesday when the end of my meetings are. 
But after that itâ€™s fair game. 
Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m done with life. Iâ€™m done trying. Itâ€™s not worth it. 
I just need to keep talking to people until then to delay the inevitable.
