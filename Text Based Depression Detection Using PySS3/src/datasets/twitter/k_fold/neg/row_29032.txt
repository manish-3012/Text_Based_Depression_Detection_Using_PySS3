It feels like all my thoughts are negative thoughtsSomeone told me to write them down so I could show them to my therapist. Thereâ€™s so many, Iâ€™ve made an entire list. Itâ€™s mostly just different ways of saying how I want to die or how useless I am, but it still feels like an endless echo in my mind.

I canâ€™t even enjoy anything in life right now and nothing seems to help. I cry for an hour every morning before being dragged to work. It all just feels so pointless and unbearable.

Sometimes I wonder why Iâ€™m still here, but itâ€™s just because Iâ€™m too much of a coward to do anything about it - thatâ€™s just another thing I cannot do.
