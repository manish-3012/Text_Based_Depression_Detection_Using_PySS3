less than 48 hours...and I wasted today so far.  There isn't too much left to do really...I sold a bunch of my stuff online and made about $800 or so. I would sell a lot more but I'm making it look like an accident so I cant totally clean out my house though i wish I could...one less thing for my family to do.   I wish I could go back to when my trouble began or freeze time and just live in the moment for the rest of my life. Yesterday I went on my last hiking trip with the guy that I love and would be my boyfriend had I not gotten to myself where I am at. It was such an amazing time and I crave a life full of that with him. He even took this great picture of us and it made me rather sad because I know that is the last picture of us that will ever be taken. There is a unlikely hail Mary so I am holding out for Tuesday but I am not counting on that anymore. It is so surreal living in this state where nothing really matters anymore yet I try to keep up normalcy. I called out the last day I worked and I am supposed to go in tonight. I guess I will even though it hardly matters if it will make someone mad or I would get in trouble etc. 

I have a lot of things planned for tomorrow at least and then sometime Tuesday Ill see what lies beyond if anything. I am really not scared at the moment just more sad Ill be leaving people I love and regretful I missed out on so much in my past due to work.
