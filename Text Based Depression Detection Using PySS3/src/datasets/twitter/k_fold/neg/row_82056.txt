I'm Truly Scared Right Now.I haven't stopped having these suicidal thoughts since November of last year. Every day, my mind keeps thinking of suicide, tell me that life isn't worth living anymore. Flashbacks come back of missing out on a lot of things due to other reasons, seeing friends have what I wish I could have, many regrets about decisions I made. Now, these thoughts are getting stronger and I'm scared that I won't be able to suppress them anymore. I try to keep a brave face but I'm so scared right now. I want to try to keep living but sometimes I want to give up so I don't have to feel this way anymore.
