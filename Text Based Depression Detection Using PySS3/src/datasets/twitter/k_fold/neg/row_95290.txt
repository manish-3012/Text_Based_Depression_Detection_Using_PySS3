I hate being around people.People make me feel suicidal and angry. Maybe because Iâ€™m always trying to help them which makes me seem judgmental and emotional. I always want the best for everyone but in the end they donâ€™t care. Avoiding people and deleting social media are one of the best decisions ever. I hate that I care too much.
