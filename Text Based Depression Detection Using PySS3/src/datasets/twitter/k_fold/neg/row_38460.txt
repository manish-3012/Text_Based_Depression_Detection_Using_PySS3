I don't know what the point isToday very drunk  , almost 23, living with my abusive, alcoholic mom and I am trying to "make a living" off my "art". So fucking pointless. But I have no degree, no SO, just some familial obligation to stick around to make sure my younger, more talented sibling "makes it" soon as they do/can- I'm out i guess
