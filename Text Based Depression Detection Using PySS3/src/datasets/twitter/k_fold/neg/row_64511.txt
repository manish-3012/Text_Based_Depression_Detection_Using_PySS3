My life is ruined. I see no point in going on.To sum up the terrible misfortune I've had over the past 5 years: 

- developed severe OCD (the worst my therapist has seen) 
- lost all my friends after leaving the cult I was raised in. 
- my parents are the textbook definition of narcissists and treat me like the scapegoat of the family. 
- my ex wife left me because of my anxiety. 
- I want to move provinces to be close to my brother - the only one that cares about me) but I am stuck living where I am because if I was to sell my house I would go bankrupt. Also house rentals are impossible to find where he lives due to the crazy housing market (Vancouver) 
- women will not date me when they find out I have zero social proof (no friends, no family that cares, divorced etc.) 

I feel like I'm backed into a corner with no options to alleviate my suffering, the worst of which is loneliness.
