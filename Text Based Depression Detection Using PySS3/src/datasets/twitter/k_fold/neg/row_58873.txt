Sometimes I want to disappearI don't exactly have suicidal thoughs, but sometimes I want to stop existing. Just like that, poof.
In those moments I also wish I could stop feeling. I guess both things go hand to hand.

They aren't prolonged thoughs, they are just short outbursts.
But they still scare me. I'm afraid it will get worst.
