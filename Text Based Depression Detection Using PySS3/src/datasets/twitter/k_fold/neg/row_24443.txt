CW: OD. How can I be strong for her when I can hardly keep it together myself?I guess the timing of everything is what really has messed me up.. 
Sunday night I took a bunch of pills and downed 5 beers within an hour and a half. I ended up at the hospital for an hour and half and was told I should be fine. I woke up the next morning to find out my uncle had passed away from a drug overdose. 
My cousin now does not have any living parents and I want so badly to be strong for her and to help her. But all I can think of is that it should have been me that died.
Iâ€™ve been thinking that maybe if I got the job done right that maybe some how it would have changed everything And he would still be alive now. 
Iâ€™ve tried reaching out to friends and even tried the crisis line and nothing helps. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
How do you be there for someone when you canâ€™t even find any purpose or joy in life for yourself? 
Iâ€™m at a loss.
