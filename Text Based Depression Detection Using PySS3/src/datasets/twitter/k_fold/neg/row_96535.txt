I really wanted to thow my life away.Hello, im a foreign student living in a share house, 2 days ago i was found out comitting peeping into girls bath, got to the police, i didnt want to trust in reality so i denied, they let me go home, but then after some thought i turned myself in after a long sleep, they let me go home after that and make an appointment to interrogate me next week with a translator cause im not that fluent with the language, i called my parents and told them everything..they cried and told me whatever i do im still their son so no worry, but now im in a depression, can not look anyone into the eyes, go home late , go out early to avoid everyone, every night i dream of my parents, they let me pursue my dream , spent their whole fortune for me, but now look at me , i most likely will not able to extend my visa, or even get expelled from the country. Been thinking that i should just end it all but my mom crying voice keep just appear in my head. I plan to personally go apologize to all the girls i peeped while wating for the police to call me back, but im lost at what should i do after that. 
I just want someone to hear my story and get some loads of my shoulder.
Thanks.
