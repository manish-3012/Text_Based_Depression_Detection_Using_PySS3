Fighting for...?You ever have that feeling that if you stop being pre-occupied, then you'll fall into the abyss? So you chase the improbable, in the hopes your demons don't catch up - but slowly, so slowly, they edge closer as they cotton on to the bullshit. 

I really shouldn't have anything to complain about - I'm 23, and for all intents and purposes my life is going places from the outside; earning more than 97% of the UK population as a senior cloud engineer, supplemented by a side hustle as a freelance consultant. Further, I'm a few weeks away from buying my first house, and owning it outright by the time I turn 40 (if not sooner). Society teaches that this is the pinnacle of success, so then why do I feel like I've already failed? 

... Well, I'll tell you - It's because I have nobody, not one person I'd count as a friend. Sure, I've met a plethora of people over the years - but not one gives a single damn, lest I have something to offer in return. And when people do approach, it's with a thin sheen of fake intent - A shimmer of self interest which quickly melts, replaced with some demand or high-level request. But when I ask for an inch in return, I'm required to claw the privilege. So why bother? What's the point? Honestly, what's the point in continuing with the great charade that's life? When all that it is, at its basis, is one giant game of give and take. 

And when you finally do break through to someone, they tell you that you need to stop being a drama queen - that you need to stop making mountains where they need not exist. So, I re-iterate, what's the point? Everyone thinks you're walking some kind of golden path, when in reality I feel like I'm trying to swim through a patch of brambles - with the only thing anchoring me being the sheer pain I feel; war-gaming the various ways I could die, to find something I feel would be effective and relatively painless. Maybe one day, but for now I'm quickly running out of excuses to keep living.
