Super unhappy, no guidanceReceived little to no guidance from my dad. He was quite negligent - not just with me, but everything he does, he has house work heâ€™s put off for a decade. All of my siblings were in similar age groups, theyâ€™re all off together. Iâ€™m the youngest. 

I have no idea what I want to do. At all. I have a bunch of interests/careers I thought Iâ€™d be interested in, but then I actually research them and they turn out to be not what I expected. 

Iâ€™m not happy in life, and I feel that the lack of guidance in my life has really contributed to my sense of gloom.

It seems like the only option is to overdose on pills or something. I donâ€™t want to be stuck doing something I hate for the rest of my life just to keep the lights on. Iâ€™d rather die.
