Eh its coolI'm all right for tonight. But the only reason I don't do something is because my grandma and ma. Mas brother killed himself years ago and they both still deal with it. I lost my love. I'm 28 so it's not some puppy love. I lost THE one. She haunts me. I dream of her, think of her, remember inside jokes and make new inside joke I know she would love. I haven't seen her in 3 years and don't date. Ive been hit on but all ways find a way of turning them away. I don't know. She helped me. She's the only one to know all my secrets. I still try to better myself for her but I can never have her. Besides her I lost everything that made me, me. Why must I suffer to keep someone else from hurting? Why do I place theyre pain over mine?
