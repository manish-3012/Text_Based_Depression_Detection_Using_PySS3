My daughter tried to commit suicide last weekendSheâ€™s in a mental hospital this week. Sheâ€™s a pre teen, and I feel like a failure as a parent. Iâ€™ve always been close to her, and try so hard to ensure my children have a great life. She just started antidepressants and theyâ€™re putting together an after care plan. Iâ€™ve had four very good friends commit suicide unfortunately, and now my own child attempted. Iâ€™m so touched by this, and I want to help everyone who feels suicidal, but I feel helpless. 

Iâ€™m exhausted, and donâ€™t know who to talk too. I have only told one friend about my daughter, so Iâ€™m telling all of you anonymously. I need to find a therapist, and will soon. Just want to spread some love to all of you.
