An interesting nightSo I had a very interesting night with my "mates"...
The whole night I was givin shit about my job. I played it off as joke, because that's what I was told to do by my parents and work colleagues. Skip forward to later in the night and I was pranking one of my better friends (the only one not giving me shit)  with a gardan hose and he got abit mad at me (fair enough). Skip even more later to night we are all about to go home when I try to talk to my best mate. To patch things over.  But 3 other people are nearby and I tell them all to leave so I can talk to my mate... But one doesn't leave so I keep asking him to leave as nice as a can but he doesn't. Eventually I boil over my breaking point and almost start a fight because he wouldnt leave. By the time the almost fight is broken up my lift arrives and now I am at home about to kill myself because the town I live is full people like this and nothing is personal ( I live in a small)

I'm asking help from this subreddit because I can trust random people more then anybody in this town. 
Sorry with this doesn't make sense I'm abit upset
