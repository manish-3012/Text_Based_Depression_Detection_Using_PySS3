My friend has attempted suicide and I need advice.Iâ€™m posting this from a throwaway account. As the title explains my best friend whom I love a lot has recently tried to commit suicide. We have both struggled with our mental health in the past but they have been through so much on a much more grander scale. Yet Iâ€™ve never imagined ever being in a situation like this. I really have trouble communicating my emotions, and I try to break through that barrier I really do but Iâ€™m scared that whatever I say to comfort them will come across as hollow. Please if anyone can give advice I will be so thankful.
