I just hope the people I care about have great lives when I'm goneI cant fight this anymore, I dont know I have for so long. Nobody is going to care when i put my gun in my mouth. This time I'm not going to fail this time. I'm hated by my parents, my roommates use me and take advantage of my kindness. Both of my best friends are mad at me, and I dont know if I can fix either friendship . My work is a toxic hell hole where I'm mocked, behind my back and to my face. Nobody understands the true scope of the pain I feel. The one time I was happy and felt loved is a faded memory that doesn't feel real. Every relationship I've had I end up abused and manipulated. My parents are right I'm fucking loser. I give up the pain is unbearable
