I will go crazy, i can't take it anymore, my brain doesn't work please somebody help meI have been depressed for almost 2 years. I have no friends at all. I am completely alone, nobody wants to talk with me in high school and my teachers don't help me either (they rather keep their distence, because I am repellent and not talented enough so it's not worth caring about me). I obviously fell so bad, I cried almost every day in the school toilet, I just could't stop it though I knew that I had to be strong. The worst part is that I feel like my brain doesn't work. My memory is so bad, can't concentrate and solve problems. I literally did nothing in the summer holiday. I wasn't able to. I have read that certain parts of the brain like hippocampus shrink due to depression, but is it just because of depression? Because I feel like that my brain is so demaged that sometimes I can't even remember what happened the day before and I am completely unable to learn anything. I feel so miserable and hopeless. Please somebody help me I have no idea what to do.
