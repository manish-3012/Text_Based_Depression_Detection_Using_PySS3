AbandonmentThe only girl I ever really loved left me. It didnâ€™t last long enough to be given a real chance. Iâ€™ve certainly done some wrong, but if what Iâ€™ve heard about her previous relationships was true, Iâ€™d consider myself the best one by far, which makes it worse considering I was given the least amount of chance. I tried as hard as I fucking could and it didnâ€™t matter. Now Iâ€™m probably gonna be back with my folks soon. Square one, a loser again. If anyone wants to tell me a similar story, or hear my story, Iâ€™d be down for it. But for the sake of brevity, it boils down to abandonment. Iâ€™ve been shown how worthless I really am and if I had a gun, itâ€™d be over. I wish I had done it years ago before my brother did so my dad would be less careful about storing his gun(s?). Iâ€™m aware that it CAN get better, that I CAN make it better, but I wish I didnâ€™t have the luxury of choice. I wouldnâ€™t be able to care about the results of my decision if my mind was in oblivion.
