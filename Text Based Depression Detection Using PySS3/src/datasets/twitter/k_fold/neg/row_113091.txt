Whats the pointI have severe ocd, generalized anxiety disorder and clinical depression. My ocd has taken over my life since 8 years old and im 17 now. My acne is getting worse and worse. Im underweight and bony and hate looking at my body. I have pushed all of my friends away and now I pretty much have none. I used to have dozens of friends but now...lol. The only person who understood me is now dead. My other favorite person is in another state and isnt ever coming back. All I do is stay in my room and rot. What is the point? I literally cant think of anything rn. I guess iâ€™ll just continue to rot in my room til I finally have the guts to do it. Thanks for reading
