Iâ€™m a sideline for everyone I knowIâ€™m never main pick. People just keep me around if shit goes wrong. They keep me around just in case they need to use me. And once theyâ€™re done with me, they move on. I have nobody genuinely there for me. They want me around for convenienceâ€™s sake. It wouldnâ€™t matter if I killed myself. Iâ€™m replaceable. They can find so much better people. 

I canâ€™t do this for the rest of my life. Refreshing email inboxes, waiting by a phone, or watching the road for a visitor. Iâ€™m tired of being alone. Iâ€™m tired of being used. I just want to rid the world of myself. No one would truly care or notice. Just stuff my ugly corpse in a trash bag and toss it anywhere. Thatâ€™s what you do with garbage.

Iâ€™m done.
