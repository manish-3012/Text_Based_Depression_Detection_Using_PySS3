Feeling like its time for me to goI've been stuck in a depressive episode for the last week or so...its absolutely horrendous. Never been officially diagnosed, but I'm on meds for bipolar and anxiety. My therapist thinks I may be Bipolar type 2 because I rarely get mania, just horrible depression. All these worthless anti-depressants that the VA psychologist throws at me have done nothing. Just numb me out or set off horrible anxiety and panic. I'm sick of waiting for the right fix. I'm so close to finishing my BA but I've never struggled like this ever. I hate the person that I am. Lashing out at family members when I'm unstable and some days barely wanting to get out of bed. I just made my mother cry again tonight for getting aggravated at something she said. Endless cycle. Sick of waking up and trying to decide to keep pressing on or just end it all. My social anxiety makes me feel like I'll never be able to succeed in the real world. Anti-anxiety meds help a lot, but I can't always rely on that. I can barely talk to my friends when I'm like this...its pathetic. I can't hold down work, or relationships with women. Depression has me in a fucking death grip and I can't pry loose. Just so sick of trying to be strong all the time. I want to be free of the pain, and at peace.
