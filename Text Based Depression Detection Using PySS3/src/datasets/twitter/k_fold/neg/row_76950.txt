I can't continue this faÃ§adeSince I was in my middle 10's I was always taught that anyone was capable of anything in life, and I, being an innocent kid always believed those words, that being one of my many mistakes I've commited in my life. Now I'm 21 years old and reality has left a bitter dissapointment in me.

Personally I feel like I am a failure, nothing but a burden to my family and close friends. I was never good at anything I've tried, but not awful either, just like the rest of my life... nothing remarkable and doomed to be forgotten.

Now that I study in a university, thinking about what is going to be for my life has left me hopless about the future, working for a society that doesn't care about the individual and ignores them... just like my family when I try to talk, so Im forced to fake a smile for them, to at least not make their life more difficult. Even if Im at the U. i doubt Ill get anywhere as I feel that I lack the capacity to stay there, so even that future part is uncertain.

Personally I've made an objective to not make it past 21 if nothing changes and frankly I doubt people would ever notice Im gone... I mean, life comes and goes right? If where I live people think  profit comes first, I feel like at least I can win this one by denying them my life as I'm not a tool, but a human.

Everything is ready, but the hardest part will be making peace with my family even tho I don't think that will be necesary , don't you think?
