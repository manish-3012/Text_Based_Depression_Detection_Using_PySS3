TitleIâ€™m not even sure Iâ€™m ready to go yet but Iâ€™m so sick of everything and nothing seems to matter anymore. Iâ€™m sick of being treated like a shot stain or a burden, Iâ€™m sick of making everyone around me miserable. Iâ€™m sick of being needy and lonely and selfish and I just want to relieve people of me.
