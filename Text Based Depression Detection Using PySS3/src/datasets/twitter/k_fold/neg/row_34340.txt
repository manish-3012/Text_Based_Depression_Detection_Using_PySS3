Over the EdgeBeen about a step away this whole past week, maybe even month, but a couple weeks ago I was still finding pleasant moments.  The past week has basically been isolation and alcohol and codeine.  Well, being that close to the edge, all it took was my shitty, weird landlord being an asshole today for no reason (I'm paid up, and move out in a week, shit, there's NOTHING he could be upset about, not to mention he smiled at me just a couple days ago).  I'm now cooking up some ket, it's enough to put me to sleep forever.  It'll be ready in about 20 minutes.  There's like ONE person I'd feel about doing this to, that's it.
