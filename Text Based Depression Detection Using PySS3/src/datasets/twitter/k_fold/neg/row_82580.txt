Looking for a way out.I don't have any hope for my life and I don't have faith that it will get better.  10 years ago I hung myself but survived.  Last year I stood on the edge of a bridge but couldn't bring myself to jump.  After the bridge incident hospitalization, things were looking up. I was fired from an abusive job and was part of a mental health care outpatient.  I had hope stuff would get better but it never did.  The outpatient group didn't follow through with goals and now I am not with them anymore. and my current job is just working hell that doesn't pay the bills.  I don't have a family to turn to. I am in debt trying to live with a house I got stuck with cause of BS with an ex. I wish I could just leave this small town and start over somewhere else but no clue how and scared because of my mental disability that has made so much of life so hard for me.   The last few days I've been cutting nightly, trying to go harder each night hoping I can go deep enough.
