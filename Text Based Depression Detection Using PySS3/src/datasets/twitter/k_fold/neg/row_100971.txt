Itâ€™s my birthday this coming weekend and I really wish it wasnâ€™t.This is a long, drawn out vent so I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read any of this garbage. 

Iâ€™m going to be turning 25 and Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of self-reflection on what my life has been up to at this point. Still, after all this time, all I feel is dread and sadness. I feel like my life is just continuing to slip away from me and Iâ€™m terrified. Iâ€™m already halfway through my 20s for crying out loud and I havenâ€™t accomplished anything even remotely remarkable. People are getting married, starting families. People are traveling and seeing so many amazing places. People have LIVES outside work!

I donâ€™t want to be completely negative; Iâ€™m not naÃ¯ve enough to think that everything is awful. My biggest achievement Iâ€™ve done so far is that Iâ€™ve finished college and started work as a registered nurse. Was going through orientation just fine, and then Covid hit. They hurried us new grads along and so now, Iâ€™ve started my career helping take care of the ICU Covid patients. Iâ€™m actively contributing working towards ending this pandemic by helping these people and that does make me happy. No matter how insignificant I might feel, my actions are helping someone and their family at least somewhat. This is something unique that Iâ€™m doing that I can say not many other people are doing.

But work can only grant me so much happiness and purpose. I do not have any constant friends or anyone to talk to in my day-to-day life. Everything and everyone I do have is digital; I have basically zero other human contact outside work. The only people I really see are the other people working out when Iâ€™m outside running. And Iâ€™m not talking to anyone, Iâ€™m just running past them with music in my ears. Could I stroke up a conversation? Possibly. But no one is here to talk - just exercise. 

Obviously all this alone time could be blamed on the virus, but even before I wasnâ€™t much of a sociable person, go figure. I donâ€™t and didnâ€™t really go out much or go to restaurants - itâ€™s cheaper and healthier for me to cook and drink at home. Besides, I wouldnâ€™t have anyone to go with and I donâ€™t want to go to a bar alone. I would look so pathetic. Relationship status is nonexistent as well. No one wants to do anything during a pandemic. And even if I get matches, I canâ€™t keep a conversation going. People fall out; schedules donâ€™t add up for dates, etc. Is it me? Is it them? Iâ€™ve deleted and redownloaded Tinder so many times at this point thinking itâ€™ll be a different experience each time. I feel like I need to be at least trying though, so thatâ€™s why I keep it around. I would be down to meet people at a bar, but I donâ€™t have the confidence to talk to women. I need a wingman or something, not just myself. 

I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™ve been alone with my thoughts my entire life. I told myself back in college that if I was still feeling this way when I turned 25, that it was alright to go ahead and get it over with and just kill myself. Itâ€™s inevitable anyway. Living this long seemed like a suitable enough time to test the waters and see what it was like when I was finally finished with school and on my own... news flash, it sucks, it really does. 

I *desperately* want human connection, romantic or just otherwise friendly. I want someplace to go to on the weekends with a group of friends that we could all enjoy. I want something as simple as a hobby shared with other people that I could do together. Iâ€™ve tried club apps and meetup events in my city for the things that I enjoy - hiking/camping, fishing, reading. Nothing. Especially with Covid. I want to become more spontaneous and less stingy with my money and learn to have more fun doing things. But Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to waste it all. I am so hopelessly, disgustingly alone and all I want to do is just go to sleep forever and just say I had a good run and none of this was for me. Iâ€™m exhausted. I go to work and I come home. There is no in between. I cannot do this for the rest of my life; I will go insane.
