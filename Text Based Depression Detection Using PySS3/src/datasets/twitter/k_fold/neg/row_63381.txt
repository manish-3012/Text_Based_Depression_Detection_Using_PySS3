She hit me again.In front of the toddler.  

Again.

Apologized.  Again.  Promised not to do it again.  Again.

Screamed at me to get out of the room after.  Again.

Called her family to happy-talk about how great things are.  Again.

Locked herself in the bedroom while I bathed the kid and put him to bed by myself.  Again.

I *could* walk away.  I *could* grab any one of the kitchen knives and make her clean up whatâ€™s left of me.  

But that leaves the kid with her.  Alone.

I could try to take the kid with me.  With no money.  No place to live. No car.  No bank account.  Just me and a screaming hungry toddler sleeping on rocks until we died of starvation or get raped to death by the cops or eaten by dogs.  

Or found, more likely than not.  Locked up, drugged, restrained, beaten and raped some more, brainwashed some more.  Declared incompetent.  Put at her complete mercy.  Get a bill for $30,000 for being locked up.  Have that hung over my head.

Getting hit every month is the least harmful option here.

Fuck.
