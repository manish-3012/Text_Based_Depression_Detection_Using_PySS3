Iâ€™m a fat trans who canâ€™t pass and I need to dieOnly skinny attractive cisgender people get to have lives, thatâ€™s clear to me now.

No matter what I do I canâ€™t lose weight, I canâ€™t make myself pretty or attractive - i just look like an ugly man with moobs whoâ€™s starting to look we archery and old because Iâ€™m in my mid 30s and wrinkles and shit are setting in.

Iâ€™m never going to be able to attract a partner, Iâ€™m always going to suffer bigotry and discrimination and hatred, and Iâ€™m never going to even get to be rid of the dysphoria because I canâ€™t pass and I donâ€™t have a female body.  

Even if I paid for it I couldnâ€™t have sex because I donâ€™t have a vagina.  Even if I did pass Iâ€™d never be able to have sex or children.

Iâ€™m sick of this bullshit.  I donâ€™t get to be happy or live - only cis people get to do that.  

Whatâ€™s the point of living when all it is is torture.
