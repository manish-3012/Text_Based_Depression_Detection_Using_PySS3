Life is a fucking curse. I want to go back to the voidOnly the smart, the beautiful and the charismatic get all the experiences and the rest rot away daydreaming. Why the fuck do I have to sit through this, doing absolutely nothing because I am good for nothing when the most logical decision would be to just suicide? This is bullshit.
