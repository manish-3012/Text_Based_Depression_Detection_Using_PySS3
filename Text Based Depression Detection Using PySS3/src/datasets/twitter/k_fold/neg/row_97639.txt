I am a human parasiteI live of the Money my friends and family give me.
I should be working on my thesis to finish my education, and i tell everyone i know that I am working on it as hard as I can. The truth is i am doing nothing. In 6 months i have worked 2 hours... Truth is im probably expelled, but i havent checkes my mail for 3 months ...

I feel like Im so far out with my problems, lying to everyone I know, living of pity from people, and spending All my money on alcohol....
I have no idea what to do. I cant bring myself to tell anyone the truth...
My patents are paying for me to see a psycholigist ... But i feel like they're just wasing money...

Im scared of the reaction people Will have if I come clean..


Suicide hans been a consideration for awhile.

Iunno if this kind of post belongs here.
Just wanted to share this with someone.
