I want it to endNot gonna bother with a throwaway account for this. I'm sick of life, each day is the same old shit. I'm not getting anywhere in life and I want to end this miserable excuse of a life. I'm failing at school, stuck in a shitty job, I don't have any friends around me, just a small handful online. I'm..I'm..not sure why I posted here, so I guess I'll be ending it soon
