Looking like the end of the road for me...So things have been too hard lately. I'm 17, almost 18. Just lost my job of two and a half years. My parents don't trust me nearly as much anymore. My grades are slipping and I have two F's. I was supposed to be a smart kid. I got suspended at school when I was only trying to help a kid by returning their bag, but administrators didn't understand. I have no motivation now. The one piece keeping me intact was a girl. My home coming date, probably my best friend, and more. We went to a concert together last time and got fucked up. It's all I wanted. With all the other people grinding around us and guys trying to grind with her, she tells me "hey, I can't grind with you. You're like a brother to me". I could talk for hours about her but the bottom line is she's never gonna care the same way, and it's gonna hurt too much to remain as friends. Everything else is going so shitty and I don't know where to turn. After she said that I played it off and slowly worked into the crowd until someone gave me Molly and I just felt so much more amplified and sad. She made sure I got home, but I think that's the end. The plan is to take as many pills as I can while closing the hot tub cover on myself so when I fall asleep I will quickly drown too being a skinny motherfucker. I hope everyone has a good life, and I wish I could've impacted some of you strangers. And I've accepted it. I love you Anna. Goodbye.
