What Scares Me The MostIs me being here 70 more years; just posting 
on r/sucidewatch and r/depression for the rest of my life. Going to expensive useless therapy where u here how â€œamazing u areâ€ then swallow Prozac and antidepressants. All this for what? Whatâ€™s the end goal here? Potentialy heaven I donâ€™t want it I just want my last meal my last sleep. Fuck this shit
