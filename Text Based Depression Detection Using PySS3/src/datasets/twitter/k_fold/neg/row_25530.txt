Please helpingI have been going through a lot of tuff shit recently. Iâ€™ve been cutting for the past 3 years now, and both my parents are aware. Whatâ€™s sad is the fact that my parents donâ€™t care about me harming myself, or at least they act like it. Iâ€™ve attempted 2, both OD. Both times I didnâ€™t take enough to actually die. If Iâ€™m not feeling better by 2 months (something I saw on here) I plan on attempting again. I hope things get better, and that it doesnâ€™t have to end like that. Sorry about my stupidity btw. Thanks
