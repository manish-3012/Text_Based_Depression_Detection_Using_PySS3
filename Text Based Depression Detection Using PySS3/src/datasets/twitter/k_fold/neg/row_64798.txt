I don't want anyone to know that I think like that sometimes.So I'm 17. I want to transition to male. I think about death and suicide a lot. When we use the iPad's at school I like to leave little searches open for others to find. Like last time I left "How to kill yourself without anyone finding out". I wonder what the person who saw that thought. I don't think I would ever do it. I'm too vain and nihilistic. But I think if I realized I had fucked up my life and was a waste I would. I would cut my wrists vertically because that's how you loose the most blood and then jump off the bridge above the highway. It's dumb isn't it? Maybe I'm just a little crazy idk.
