It doesn't get betterI actually just gets worse. Always. Every situation I get out of, every problem I solve, just ends in another shitty thing happening to me. It's not worth it if this is how life is.

I genuinely feel like I'm cursed. I've never met someone that has as many shitty, inconvenient occurrences happen to them as me. I feel like the universe hates me. I feel like I'm constantly being punished with bad luck. I don't know why these things keep happening to me. My life is a statement to Murphy's Law.
