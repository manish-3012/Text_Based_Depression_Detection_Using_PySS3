Tomorrow I'm ending it all. 7th time's the charm?I'm pretty definitely ending it. I've got a detailed plan. 

Gonna tell people I'm really busy so that it doesn't raise suspicion, put on my headphones, put 3 or 4 plastic bags on my head and silvertape the neckline. I'll die listening to something fun.

It's effective. Nobody's gonna get to me in time, and I've personally tested this method with precautions to make sure it works. I've got 5 or 6 suicide attempts on my belt just from the last week or so.  I feel no joy in living, the mental health services are essentially useless and it's about time.

I'm debating wether I should hide somewhere in my apartment to do it. By the time they find me it'll be too late. 

# Or I'll take a bus to nowhere. Go into the forest and die where nobody'll ever find me. There's too much ground to cover and no reason for me to be out there, so I'll most likely just be called a missing person. Nobody's gonna have to check my corpse. My parents don't have to put my ass in a coffin. I'll make sure all my money goes to my sister as a headstart in life.
