Help Me!So Im 17,from India. I watched 5 episodes of 13 reasons why and after that I'm having a lot of sucidal thoughts.I tried to kill myself 2 years ago with slitting my wrists and after watching this Im barely keeping myself alive. My mother passed away 7 years ago. I cant seek professional help as my father already is called out various times as a bad parent. So I dont know what to do, Help me! Everything in my life is bad so at this point I dont know what to do.
