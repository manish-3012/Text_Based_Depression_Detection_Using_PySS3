29 years is a good run i'm ready to go. Having a nervous breakdown because my park managers were stealing people's rent and marking it down as unpaid and now i "owe" two months rent and they took off with the cash.I'm to the point if i saw the manager or his douchebag spray tanned son I would LITERALLY not jokingly, not hypothetically, Murder them with a pair of scissors before killing myself. I'm seething in rage and anger and i'm ready to die.
