want to quietly go awaydoes anyone want to go away quietly? to have as little impact as possible? when i die i want everyone to move on as quickly as possible. i figured that leaving no note , showing no sign of any emotional changes is the best precursor for this. iâ€™m tired of talking to people and i donâ€™t want to drag out my suffering any longer. iâ€™ve gotten so tired of living everyday that talking is exhaustive.  i want to go forward with my decision and leave as little of a ripple behind as possible.
