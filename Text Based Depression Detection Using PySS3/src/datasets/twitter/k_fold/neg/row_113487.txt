Being selfish. Wish I werenâ€™t born...I want to die but I donâ€™t want to feel the pain of dying. I want to die to escape. Itâ€™s too much pressure for a fragile person like me, I easily break. classmates, friends... family... They just feel to far from me. Please, me... Have enough courage to kill yourself. I want to just disappear. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
