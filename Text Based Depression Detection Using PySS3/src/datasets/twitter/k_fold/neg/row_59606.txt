My friend attempted suicide last nightPrior to this, Iâ€™ve been fighting extremely hard the past week not to hurt myself or kill myself but after bringing her to the hospital itâ€™s like some fucked up trigger has gone off in my head wanting to hurt myself even more than ever before. I just moved to a new city so these friends are new but I am so starved for any sort of feeling like I matter or attention that watching how much they are all coming together is making me...jealous? And thatâ€™s really fucked up to the point where I am angry at myself even more because what the fuck. How selfish of me. But I just look at my sleeping pills and think of how nice it would be not to feel this way anymore. Iâ€™m trying to get on the Suicide hotline text line because i am not really in a mental space where I can talk about it but there are too many people before me.
