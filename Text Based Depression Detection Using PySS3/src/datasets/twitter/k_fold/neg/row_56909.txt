Do i or dont i?Do I run away and just say fuck life and Everything in it? Or do I stay and inevitably commit suicide?

Saying fuck life means leaving Everything I love behind. But I would finally go and do everything I want. It would be hard but I would finally be living life on my terms.

Or do I stay with everyone I love in place and job that is killing me from the inside? This is the path of least resistance, it's what I've always done. 

If I ran I would get me a dog and train it well. I would probably get me a big dog or an Akita. Maybe a pyr they're super smart and good for protection.

If I stay I keep looking for a job that will be equally unfulfilling as what I am currently doing. And will just end up dying instead.

I have tried to explain time and time and time again how I feel to everyone around me but it's now falling on deaf ears. I am just expected to follow my husband's life and career. He is a good man, I love him dearly, he is awesome. But i can't keep clinging to that, because after three years of waiting for his education to finish and another year and a half to go, then no idea what's happening after that... I can't wait anymore. I can't keep my life on hold waiting for my debt to disappear and his education to finish.

6 years left of debt... It's never ending. I want to sell my car and get me 10k out of debt faster. But then we still have 34k left to go... Like that's ever going to go away. Not when 50%of our income goes to housing. Fuck housing! 
Fuck life. I can't keep it up anymore.

Why don't I just end it? Why don't I just run?
