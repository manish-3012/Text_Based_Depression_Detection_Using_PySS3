Fewer and fewer reasons to stay alive.The only reasons I haven't killed myself are because I think that I have some sort of special purpose that I may fufill one day (narcissistic I know tbh) and that one day I'll make some friends. 

And the more and more I fail no matter how many opportunities I get, and the fact that I know no common interests with anyone and no one likes me, I realize that neither one of these things is probably ever going to happen. ):
