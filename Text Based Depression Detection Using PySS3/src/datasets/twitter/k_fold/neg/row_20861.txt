Anyone else just feel ling an extra in a movie?Literally everything in my life feels like i'm just a stepping stone onto the next point in the plot for someone else. Everyone's around for a little bit and as soon as their story continues to something/someone else i'm instantly in the past. I'm sick of feeling so disposable to everyone i've cared about it's causing me to become so fucking toxic i rarely even open up anymore. 


I've considered doing it every day for a fortnight now and it's just getting worse and worse because every time i stop the thoughts from going further i think that i'm literally not going to affect anyone outside of a space of a few months/a year.
