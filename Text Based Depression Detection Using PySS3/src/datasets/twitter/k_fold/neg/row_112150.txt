Life is a never ending shitty loopSociety is a fucking mess when I first got depressed and tried to kill myself at nine. I am now 13 and go to a therapist but it doesnâ€™t fucking help. When I finally opened up to my parents they just said it would be mean to them to kill myself. Like my life is less important than their fucking happiness. I feel like there is no point to life and where I live school is fucking mandatory. All these people who barely know me thinks getting good grades is more important then my mental health and that I donâ€™t deserve to take my life or be sad because I have SUCH A FUCKING GOOD LIFE. Like that worked. I was googling least painful way to die when I stumbled across this and tbh this made me feel way better then anything else have. My biggest fear is my life going in a loop like it does right now. I am so sick of life. Thanks for listening to my Ted Talks ðŸ™ƒ
