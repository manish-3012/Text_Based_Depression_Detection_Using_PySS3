Black sheep fed to wolvesMy mom and i have basically been told we cannot, or should not seek therapy or professional help.

Because the very people who are the reason we need therapy are "like the kennedys" in this town, and everything just gets back to them anyway.

I thought my faith in humanity was already dead. This is a whole new level of bitterness i never thought i could reach.

The main person responsible for the most damage is an attorney so there will never be justice.
