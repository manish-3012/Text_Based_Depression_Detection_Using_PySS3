So Angry, Yet ThankfulAbout 44 hours ago, after months of suicidal thoughts, I finally attempted to do so after being triggered (over a final I thought I did bad on) by swallowing an abundance of pills and drinking a dose of nyquil. Almost immediately I had regretted my decision and called a close friend of mine who alerted my roommates.  

      When I realized school was about to get involved , I completely panicked and went animalistic. I tried to fight off my roommate who was holding me down. I knew my life was basically over and there was nothing I could do anymore. For months, I feared that this would happen and it did.

      They got school/residential life involved and EMTs came to escort me out of the dorm hall and I was taken to the nearest hospital.

      For hours, I was treated like a villain and was called things such as being evasive, a liar, and a threat to everyone. The whole process was so dehumanizing and they almost involuntarily admitted me. One of the doctors wouldnâ€™t even let speak to explain myself and kept going on about how they were 100% going to admit me. Thankfully my family got involved and I was able to be released. 

       Now, Iâ€™m going through this whole process with the school to let me be re-admitted. This all for them to cover their asses, I mean how would it look if people found out students were ending up in the hospital? I havenâ€™t been able to return to my dorms at all except for a quick 15 minutes to get â€œsmall, essentialâ€ items. I havenâ€™t been able to see my roommates, lay on my bed, go back to campus, attend my last 2 finals. I feel like I became a shell. My life completely changed over a stupid decision that was made in less than 30 minutes. The medication and amount I took wasnâ€™t even lethal. Iâ€™m trying so hard to find the strength and get through this, but honestly itâ€™s hard. I just needed to vent and since I frequented this sub a lot I thought this might be the best place to put it. Thank you all.
