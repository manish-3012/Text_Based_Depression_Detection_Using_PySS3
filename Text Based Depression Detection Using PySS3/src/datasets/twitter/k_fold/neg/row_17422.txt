I feel so fucking emptyI don't want to be here anymore. I hate this house. All I do is work and listen to music until I fall asleep. 

This is probably one of my shortest posts but really I just feel so numb and empty and my depersonalization has been hitting so fucking much lately I just feel drained.

Maybe one day i won't be so scared.
