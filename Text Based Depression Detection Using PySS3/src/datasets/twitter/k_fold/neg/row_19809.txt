Canâ€™t handle changesSchool has just started again and Iâ€™m so lonely. I hate that I feel this way because I know the situation really isnâ€™t bad, but when things change greatly like this it makes me so anxious and I feel like I want to throw up everyday when I go on the bus ..or I feel really depressed. I want to die so bad right now. I feel like thereâ€™s no way out. I know it wonâ€™t last forever , but all of my classes are so lonely. 3rd and 4th period are the worst. I donâ€™t know anyone in either class and theyâ€™re the hardest classes. They make me feel so overwhelmed. I came out of 3rd period sobbing because I couldnâ€™t figure the math out and the girl sitting next to me did it easy. Then I was already in a bad mood for the next bad class. I was just sitting there crying and trying not to make too much noise. The teacher told me I should go get some water and I couldnâ€™t stop crying just sobbing and sobbing . I donâ€™t know what to do..other than just say fuck what everyone thinks of me because I try so hard not to let my mind go to negative places but the classes give me so much anxiety. I could take easier classes, but I already have two on level classes and Iâ€™m not worried about my ability to do well in the class, itâ€™s just the anxiety and worry that Iâ€™ll do bad that I canâ€™t handle. I want to end my life so bad..I feel so alone and hopeless. I know that isnâ€™t the case but I feel so depressed and hopeless in the morning
