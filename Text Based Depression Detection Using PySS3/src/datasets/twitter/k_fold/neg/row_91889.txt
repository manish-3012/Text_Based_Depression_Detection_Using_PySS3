I'm done!!!!!!!!!!!!Disposable account. I have been care taking my family members first my Dad including taking care of him in hospice which broke my heart,now Mom who basically just wants a servant. Then my sister who has run off everyone ellse in her life calls me whenI hadn't heard from her in a while and asked me to help her because she was abandoned without a car,adequate income,scared,etc. And stupid fuckup me goes and gets her. She is the most bitter,nasty piece of work there is. She lives to mak trouble. Did I mention that she has a son? He tried taking care of her for 5 weeks,made up some sort of emergency and brought her back and won't answer the phone. I can't do this anymore. I have a history of severe depression and I'm wondering more and more why I am still bothering.My whole life has been shit and now it's worse.In October I will have been taking care of her for 2 years.My Mom and I did fine before she got here. I am having serious health issues,high blood pressure,chest pain,etc. What has to happen?????? I mean really I am the care taker here without me they can't live here,they would go into the system. I do care for my mother and don't want to abandon her but I can't live like this....
