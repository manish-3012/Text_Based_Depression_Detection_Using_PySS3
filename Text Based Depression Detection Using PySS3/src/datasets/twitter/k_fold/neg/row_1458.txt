Safely HomeI am home in heaven dear ones. oh so happy and so bright there is perfect joy an beauty in this ever lasting light. All the pain and grief is over every restless tossing passed I am now at peace forever safely home in heaven at last. Did you wonder i so calmly trod the valley of the shade? Oh! But Jesus love illuminated every dark an fearful glade. And he came himself to meet me in that way so hard to tread and with Jesus arm to lean on could i have one doubt or dread. Then you must not grieve so sorely for i love you dearly still try to look beyond earths shadows pray to trust our fathers will. There is work still waiting for you so you must not idly stand do it now wail life remaineth you shall rest in Jesus land. When that work is all completed he will gently call you home Oh the rapture of that meeting Oh the joy to see you come!
