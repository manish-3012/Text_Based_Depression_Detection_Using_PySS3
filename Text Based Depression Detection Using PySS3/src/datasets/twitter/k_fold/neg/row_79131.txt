hey.hi, how are you.
I'm sad.

I didn't use to be sad. My life's been pretty good. I'm a good student, I have many friends. But my girlfriend just broke up with me ...

I've been a solipsist ever since I started thinking about things. I'm having trouble expressing myself right now, so maybe you shouldn't bother with me. I'm sure there are more pleasant people to keep alive right now.

I feel so stupid for trying to end my life, because if I do I'm going to be the biggest cliche on earth. Oh, boo hoo, he killed himself because his girlfriend broke up with him. Nope. I didn't... I killed myself because why not. It's not the first time I'm thinking like this, I've always been tempted by the tracks. 

The only thing that's holding me back is other people's prejudice against suicide. Which is stupid because I'm not supposed to be sure in their existence.

What is one supposed to do if life doesn't interest him? Why should a person be forced to live, I didn't choose to be born.
