Pushing people away: need a stranger to talk toI've been suicidally depressed on and off for most of my life. I was diagnosed with AVPD, and I'm a cutter. When I feel like I need help and need to talk to somebody, I end up pushing away my friends and boyfriend. They say my depression is very stressful and overwhelming to them. I can't afford therapy or anything fancy like that. I'm not a hopelessly pessimistic person, and I'm happy sometimes, I do like to help inspire people. I just need a faceless friend who's dealing with the same kind of sadness to help me get through things so I don't hurt the people I'm closest to. I don't know if this will work, kind of a last resort type of thing.
