I wish I didnâ€™t have childrenDoes anyone else feel like this? I love my children dearly and I would never hurt them but I wish I didnâ€™t have them because it makes leaving this hell hole so much harder. If they werenâ€™t here I would have already gone. I feel so bad for them having to witness with my mental health struggles and for them not to have a â€œnormal, happyâ€ mum like all the other kids. I try to shelter them as much is possible from it all but they have noticed all the scars on my arms and are starting to ask questions. So for now I will sit here planning the best way to go so I have it perfected and I will take peace in that.
