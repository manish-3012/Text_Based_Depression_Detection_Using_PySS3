Soul-crushingly lonelyItâ€™s been about 2 years since Iâ€™ve needed to post something on this sub. I really hoped it would never happen again, but here we are. 

I tried to OD in my house in 2017 and spent 2 hellish weeks afterwards in the psych ward. I got my life on track enough after that to get into a college in my dream city, I found friends and a partner who gave me a reason to keep going. My college is fully online this semester so Iâ€™ve moved home, my partner and I recently broke up which will be better for both of us in the long run, but he was my best friend and I miss having someone always around so much. We still talk but his dad killed himself a year ago so I feel manipulative trying to get his attention by saying what Iâ€™ve been feeling. I have friends but a lot of them moved back to campus or are too busy to talk to me at night when Iâ€™m at my worst.

I have a desk job here which gives me just enough human interaction to make me feel completely empty when I come home and have nothing to do. I feel like Iâ€™m hanging on by a thread, every night I have to talk myself down or take extra meds so I fall asleep before I can get a plan together. I canâ€™t get back into my old therapist and I donâ€™t have the energy to call around and get into someone new. All I know is if I try again I canâ€™t fail, the mental healthcare in my state is so shitty I wanted to die more leaving the hospital than when I got there in the first place.
