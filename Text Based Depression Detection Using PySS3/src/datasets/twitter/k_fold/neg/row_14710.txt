The only thing stopping me is that i'm a cowardUnlike a lot of people on here, i'm not particularly close with my family. I've pushed away almost all of my friends due to various mental health issues. There is no one who would be particularly hurt or upset if I did do it i'm just a coward.

I'm scared of the pain, i'm scared that I will fail, wake up in hospital and no one will be there, no one will have even noticed, i'm scared that i'll live but have done some sort of permanent damage, i'm scared that there is something worse on the other side. Everything scares me. I wish I would just come down with some sort of painless terminal illness and it would take care of itself, but i'm pretty certain i'm going to live a long life of misery and not be able to do anything about it.
