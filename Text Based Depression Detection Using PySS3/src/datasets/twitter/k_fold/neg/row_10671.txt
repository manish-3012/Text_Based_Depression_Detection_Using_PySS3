WhyWhy canâ€™t i just do it. I made horrible decisions and everyones just fading out. I have no friends anymore, again. Its like i came to a new place just to lose everything again. Nobody likes me anymore. And its my fault. It just will not get better. Nothing will. Its just gonna go down hill and i hate it. I literally can not express the pain i feel, itâ€™s horrible. Nobody should feel like this, i dont think anyone even could bc im just not a good person. I hate what i did and all i want to do is die. Theres nothing good out there anymore. All the things that couldve ever possibly made me happy just dont. It doesnt make me happy anymore. It just sucks. Im so depressed everything is just grey and empty and fucking worth nothing. I feel nothing. I feel empty and drained and fucking worthless and a disgrace. I just donâ€™t understand why I cant just do it already and end my life. Its like im scared too. Idk why though. Im going to die one day anyway why not just do it now. When youâ€™re dead everything means nothing. Noone will remember me and if they do its because i fucking hurt people. Not physically but fucking emotionally and mentally. I donâ€™t understand why im so fucking scared to just do it. I just wanna fall asleep on the train tracks and just die. Everyone would be better off w/o me anyway. Its fucking horrible. Im worthless im scum. Im trash to this fucking earth and every single day just gets worse and worse and worse and worse. I donâ€™t know why i cant just do it already. Its like my body just rejects it but. Idk. Just why
