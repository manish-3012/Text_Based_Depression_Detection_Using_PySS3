Let's bet how many times I need to listen to "that joke isn't funny anymore" to go ahead and do it.My husband said he was done hurting me and did it again. We can't do anything with out me being hurt and I know I'm being dramatic no one else is crying and trying to kill them selves over blow jobs but... idk man. I tried three times this last month is the 4th time a charm?
