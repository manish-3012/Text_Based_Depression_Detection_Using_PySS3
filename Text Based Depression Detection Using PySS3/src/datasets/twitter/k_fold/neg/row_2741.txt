I wrote a suicide not todayIt didnâ€™t feel like enough. I recorded a video. I donâ€™t think 15 minutes of me rambling and saying goodbye is going to save my friends and family from the mountain of guilt and grief Iâ€™m going to put on them. Iâ€™ve fought my demons for a very long time and Iâ€™ve been losing as of late. Iâ€™m exhausted. I just want it to be quiet in my mind. 
Iâ€™m so afraid of botching this and donâ€™t want to put the burden of discovering me on anyone, but I guess thatâ€™s the nature of the beast. 

Strange little corner of the internet this is. Iâ€™ve never been able to openly talk about suicide before.
