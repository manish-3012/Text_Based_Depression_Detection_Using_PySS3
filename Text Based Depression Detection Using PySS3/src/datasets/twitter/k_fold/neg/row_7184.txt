My life is a jokeBAM generic ass title for this shitshow. Iâ€™m a fuck up. Iâ€™ve fucked up a million times and Iâ€™m gonna keep fucking up over and over again because thatâ€™s just how I am. Iâ€™m not allowed to be anything but a useless fuck up. Every second of every single day is just more and more bullshit piling up. Like today. I finally had a good day going. I went to the psychiatrist and was feeling pretty good. I even decided to stop and pick up a movie to watch tonight. But of course since this is my shitty fucking life weâ€™re dealing with something HAD to go wrong. I wreck my car. Iâ€™m now officially fucked. I canâ€™t have a single good day. Itâ€™s all over. I just want a good day. So Iâ€™m giving up. I come home and try to find my knife so I can just cut my wrist and be down with it. And guess what? I CANT EVEN FIND MY GODDAMN KNIFE SO I CAN KILL MYSELF. Itâ€™s literally a sick cosmic joke. Fuck everything.
