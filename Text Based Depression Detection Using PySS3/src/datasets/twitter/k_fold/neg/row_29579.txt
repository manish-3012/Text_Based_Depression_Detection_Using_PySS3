My best friend told me that heâ€™s gonna commit suicide soon and I donâ€™t know what to doSo My friend has been struggling with depression for a few years now mostly originating from â€œa terrible childhoodâ€. Heâ€™s been going through therapy for 2 years now through which he attempted to take his life once and was only saved in the ER. I am always too afraid to give him any sort of advice since am obviously not a professional but he already goes to the professional and still need my ear and I donâ€™t know what to tell him. 
Please help what can I do?!!
