anyone else feel like they wasted their childhoodIâ€™ve been cutting myself since I was 10 and now im a senior in high school and i feel like I havenâ€™t had a day since then where I havenâ€™t thought about killing or hurting myself. Im failing school and I donâ€™t want to graduate. and I have no idea what I want to do now because I spent all of my developmental years hating myself and how I looked and wanting to die. I feel like I wasted so much time being depressed instead of being a kid and Iâ€™ll never get to go back and that if I make it to adulthood that looking back ill feel nothing but regret like now I wish I could have a second chance and enjoy being a kid
