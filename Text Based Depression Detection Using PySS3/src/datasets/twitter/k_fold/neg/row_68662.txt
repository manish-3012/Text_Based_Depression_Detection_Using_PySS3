Tried to kill myself, going to try againPosted a couple of days ago here because I tried to kill myself but I was too scared to now I'm going to try again because I am so tired of being alive I can't do it I am so ugly and disgusting I have been trapped in my bedroom for months because I can't let anyone see me because I'm so ugly and disgusting and there's nothing I can do about it and I have been throwing up and crying for the past few hours because I am so disgusted by the way I look and I don't want to be alive in this body anymore
