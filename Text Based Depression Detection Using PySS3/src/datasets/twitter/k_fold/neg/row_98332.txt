The PromiseIt's kind of funny, it started when I was around 12 that sometimes I got the thought: "If things don't get good, you can kill yourself when you're grown up." That was always only for a few seconds, and then the thought was gone.
  
Now I'm 19, have a major depression since 6 months and constant suicide thoughts. It's ironic how I predicted this years ago, and now it's my turn to fulfill the promise to myself.
