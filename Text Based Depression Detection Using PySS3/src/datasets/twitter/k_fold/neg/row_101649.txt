Its only gonna get worse.I have a feeling no one will bother to read this or comment, as I'm just another one of the poor souls on here spilling their depressive thoughts on here, I apologize if I ruin your day or get you in a sour mood. I'm empty, cold, and feel of nothingness.

My plan of execution is to go to a remote forest and walk into it as deeply and as lost as I can.
Die of either exhaustion, hypothermia, starvation, thirst, or any other natural deaths of the sort. 

I want to rot and decay in the moss and tree roots. I want no one to have a chance of finding my body. 
 
My decaying corpse will be a banquet and smorgasbord for creatures and critters of all kinds. 

I want to be forgotten from society, I want search parties to give up on me, I want my parents to realize what a mistake it was to have me.

I'm planning on taking a trip tomorrow across the country and into the wilderness with family for a camping trip. This may be it, this may be my chance to do what I've dreampt of every night for 5 years.
