my dad died and i want to kill myself to see him againi'm not enough for anyone, people will cry my death for 2 weeks and then overcome it, my few friends will find new healthy and normal friends

i'm not enough because i've tried and nothing works. everyone replaces me even when i'm still here 

we're gonna die at some point of our lives, so what's the big deal if i decide do it right now?

the pain is too fucking much, it's hard even breathe and wake up. i've dealt with depression all my life, then my dad died (my only support) and everything got worse (i only have 19 but i've suffered a lot, and everyone say that) and this pain, this new pain that you'll only feel when you lost someone important, will never go away

the other pain, the depression, the problems can dissapear, but this pain not, this feeling of dispair and emtpiness. the pain of lost someone that will never come back

everyone says "he's better where he is, he's not suffering" so i want to go there, i want to stop this pain i want to stop suffering. i want to see him again

i want to be enough for people. i'm not. everyone treats me like shit, everyone replaces me. but he was there for me, damn he was too fucking supportive even when i fucked up things (i'm an only child so i think that made him focus all his love and support on me all the time)

my cousin says that shitty things happen to you because you were a bad person. then with that logic i must be the worst person in this world because i've suffered a lot, i've cried, i've hating myself, i've begged for a change without results

i'm not enough, i will never be. the only person that saw something on me and gave me support and love is gone 

i just want to die. or end this pain. i just want to stop thinking. i want to be enough. i want to stop being a burden
