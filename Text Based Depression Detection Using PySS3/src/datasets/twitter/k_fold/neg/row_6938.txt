I regret that I never took the initiative for my life.If I had dared to challenge my toxic surroundings and mindset I could have started living my own life years ago. But now it's too late. I wonder if I should play all my cards and commit suicide, in case there is rebirth waiting for me, so that I can try to live my life again. I was so weak. Even at 15 I could have been alive. No I feel like a living abortion. I aborted myself.
