I care too much for people, and they take advantage of thatI tried to fix him. I couldnâ€™t. He was too broken. He turned on me and made all of his problems my own. He spread horrible rumors about me. I had to quit my job, and Iâ€™m suffering these horrible nightmares ever since. You canâ€™t help those who donâ€™t want to be help. Why am I still here if I am just someoneâ€™s punching bag? Everyone takes advantage of me. My therapist gave up on me. My meds arenâ€™t working anymore. I feel stir crazy over winter break and I canâ€™t get over this horrible loneliness. The nights are horrible. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s worse: the pure loneliness or the fear of going to sleep because Iâ€™ll have a nightmare. How can I go on like this? There arenâ€™t enough people in the world who are good. I just canâ€™t.  Part of me thinks Iâ€™m silly, that maybe the manipulation was my fault. Maybe I let them walk all over me because I canâ€™t say no. I donâ€™t want to live like this. Iâ€™m too overwhelmed.
