Help?Hey, i have this recurrent suicidal thoughts, they are very serious and those feelings hit me like a freight train. My life it's not bad, i have a girl that loves me and my family as well, but i just can't help feeling suicidal and let down on life.

I feel normal some days  but then i get this down-ness and everything feels gray and hopeless, I would have no problem killing myself. There is a gun at my house and I think about that shit every single day.

How easy it would be for me just to end it all, stand up, get the gun, put it in my mouth and that's it. No more panic, no more feeling down, no more problems. No one in my family has any idea that i have this feelings and toughts, NO ONE, only you guys. this is the first time in my life that i tell this to anyone.

What should i do?
