Back againI hate myself for constantly coming back to post. I hate myself for being okay for a week and then suddenly not being able to drive because I imagine crashing it too often. I hate being weak. I hate being alone. 

I guess that's all I want. To not be alone or to just feel nothing at all. I have no futureb at all right now. Nothing to look forward to.
