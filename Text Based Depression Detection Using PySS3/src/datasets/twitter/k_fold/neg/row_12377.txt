I am trapped in my bodyI am so unbelievably depressed its getting to be too much for me to cope. My head is just swimming with hyper anxiety and negative thoughts. I feel like I'm trapped in my body, unable to escape. Having to get up tomorrow for work and face reality is too much, everyone at work thinks I'm weird. I can't kill myself, I'm too much of a pussy but something has to give. I feel like I'm going crazy.
