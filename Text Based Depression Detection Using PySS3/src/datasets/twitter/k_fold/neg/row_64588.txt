It all just hurts really.I'm so tired. 

I'm tired of wishing for things to get better. I'm too depressed to work for my happiness. I've already failed two exams, and there is no hope for the rest. I know I can do better but it's too late. 
It hurt seeing my teachers disappointment on her face as she looked through my course work. She even said that I was a mess. She just thinks I'm lazy. 

I really want to die, I hate myself the most. I don't have any redeeming qualities. I'm awkward, poor and unattractive. I'm only here for my parents. Can't wait until I die.
