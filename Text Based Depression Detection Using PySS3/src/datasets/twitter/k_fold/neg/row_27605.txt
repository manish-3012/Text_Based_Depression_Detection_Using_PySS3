Lost parental rights, lost my job, gambled away the restIm not really sure what to do at this point. i keep seeing myself hanging from the ceiling every time i get more bad news. I tried to distract myself by going to the casino. 200... 300... 600.. 900.. 500.. and 600 more this morning. everything I had to keep going is gone. unemployment will barely cover my bills and i havent seen my kid in weeks. Im not angry. Its the same pattern over and over... just aware of how meaningless all of my efforts have been. i constantly feel like nothing is ever enough.
