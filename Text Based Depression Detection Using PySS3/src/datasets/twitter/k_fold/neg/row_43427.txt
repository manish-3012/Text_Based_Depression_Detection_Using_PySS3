The only reason im alive is because im afraidTheres a hole in my heart that gets cut deeper each day, no matter what i do it never gets better. Ive lost strength and my reason for doing half the things i loved in life...ive lost my reason to be alive and i dont have anyone here to talk to or help. I might kill myself in one month depending on how things keep going and im hoping someone can help save me by then.
