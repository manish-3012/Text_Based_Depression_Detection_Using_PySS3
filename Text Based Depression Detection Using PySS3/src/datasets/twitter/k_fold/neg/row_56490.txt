I hate living.Iâ€™m 21. Been battling depression for about 5+ years now. Lately Iâ€™ve been questioning everything and Iâ€™m not sure I see the point in living. Iâ€™m not suicidal as of now but I seriously wish I never existed. Ive been in serious low spots before but Iâ€™ve never felt worse eternally than now.
