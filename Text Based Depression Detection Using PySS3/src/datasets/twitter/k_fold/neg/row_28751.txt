I cant run away from it anymore, and that's alrightIve done everything I can to try and get rid of it, done every self help tip, put all the effort, found a hobby, cleaned my room, worked out, ate healthy, ive done it all. The only thing ive ever gotten is temporary joy, but it always come back. Its been almost seven years, and its never gonna go away. Ive wasted so much of my life being depressed, I havent ever been the same since my dad died and my family fell apart, I was only ten. Since then its trial after trial, triumph after triumph, nothings getting rid of it. Therapy helped a little, weed makes me temporarily happy, friends are nice, and school's not the best, but thats okay. I should be happy, Ive fixed all I can, ive been as introspective as possible, im starting to believe that i just dont have what it takes to shake this. 

  Depression's gonna kill me, sooner or later. Im done fighting something that doesnt go away, and when the time's right, im going to end it, and thats a certainty. Maybe im just not cut out to make it. I gave this disorder all I had, it wasnt enough, and at this point im okay with it. Im okay with dying, ive accepted that this is just how life is gonna be, and thats okay. I feel content now, im not angry, im not upset, I know This is how life'll be and ive accepted that depression isnt something im ever going to get rid of. Its a part of me, wether I want it to or not, no point fighting my nature. Ive lived close to a decade with it, ill give it a few more years, then I can finally rest. Im grateful for what ive got, im glad there are people like you reading this, makes me hopeful that other people can get out when I cant. Y'all are great, really. Thanks for reading, I hope everyone can fight another day.
