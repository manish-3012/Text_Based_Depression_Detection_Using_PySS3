The suicide lifeline chat is useless and shouldn't even be offeredI can't do phone conversations. I'm so desperate at this point from waiting for endless, endless queues on the chat, I've waited nearly 8 hours in total today in two different sessions, I've waited at least 4 hours a day the last two days. I never made it to the front of the line until a bit ago and of course after 90 minutes at "Position 1" in the line it finally went through right when I \*had\* to step away from my computer because I could not stare at the screen anymore. No notification, no ping, no nothing. I missed it. I've waited so long. I'm so desperate that I finally called the line and they couldn't hear me and I hung up in a panic attack.

They shouldn't even offer a service with wait times that bad. I cant imagine how many people in a crisis may kill themselves because they see that option but can never get in. I don't understand.
