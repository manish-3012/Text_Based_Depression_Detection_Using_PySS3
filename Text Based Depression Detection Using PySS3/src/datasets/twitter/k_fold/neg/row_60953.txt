A friend committed suicide months ago.......and it feels like it's infected *me* now. I think about dying far too much these days and I think about her and wonder why these thoughts didn't go away-- she's gone and I think about it, I'm sad for it, I remember that funeral and that pain and those tears and the *anger* and yet *here I am, again.*

I don't want to die, either.

I just want to stop all this... malaise.

I just want to remove the cotton ball from between my ears.

This should have ended up a deterrent, that cliche positive taken out of a negative situation. Instead, it's a reality. 

She did. So can you. 

And yet I don't want to.

And yet I do.
