I have intrusive thoughts and theyre killing meI've been having intrusive thoughts lately that are mostly picturing scenarios in which I kill myself. The rest of them usually involve me questioning my self worth or hyperfixating on my interactions with people. I don't want to have these thoughts, and I definitely don't want to follow through with any of them. It's bothering me to a point where I can't fall asleep at night, and when I do I either have nightmares or I wake up frequently. It's so frustrating to me and I honestly feel like I'm on the verge of breaking down 24/7. I know I should probably see a therapist but it's kind of difficult right now with the virus, and I really don't want to have to do it online. I need serious help trying to curb these thoughts for the time being because I'm not sure how much more I can take without going crazy.
