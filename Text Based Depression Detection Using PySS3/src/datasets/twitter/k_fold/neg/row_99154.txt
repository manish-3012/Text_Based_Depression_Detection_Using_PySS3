Guy at my local SubwayThe man who works the late shift at my local subway seems...off. When you walk in the door, he puts on (an obviously forced) huge smile and greets you very nicely, but you can tell he doesn't want to...If that makes sense? Anyway, as I watched him, something still seemed...off...Then a group of guys in front of us asked him how he was doing (not in a concerned way, but just to be friendly, as you do) and he replied with a tentative "hanging in there" which approx. 30 seconds later he said "when I said, 'hanging in there', I mean I'm fine." This struck me as odd. I've heard "hanging in there" and not thought about it any further than, well, they are hanging in there. BUT his need to qualify/change the statement makes me uneasy. I can't help but think he may be contemplating suicide. I want to say I have ZERO psychology experience, something just seems off. I think he's a nice guy and would hate to think of anyone taking their own life. I'm just wondering what I can do to help him and put my mind at ease. Maybe I'm am alarmist and nothing will happen, but the thought that something might happen bothers me. If anyone has suggestions, please tell me.
