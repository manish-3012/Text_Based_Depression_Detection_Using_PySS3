I willingly walked in the street of my subdivision today, almost got hit however the driver had to fucking stopBeen socially rejected all my life from elementary school and now I'm a freshman in highschool. I'm fucking tired off the harassment I suffered from my middle school years and I know I failed at life. I'm tired of trying to get accepted for who I am and what I like to do and my appearance, my friends think I'm a homosexual since I'm 15 and never had a girlfriend even though I actively tried since middle school began. I'm made fun of my appearance and my fucked up hairline. Why oh fucking why couldn't I've been genetically gifted a better face and frame. It's a cruel fucking shitty world we live in and I'm tired of fucking fighting.
