Out of energyI can't even come up with enough motivation to write a halfway decent suicide note. 

I don't understand why I get so god damn low like this. I'll be okay around like.. 30-50% of the time.. then a flip switches and I just get so fucking badly depressed. I'll be trying to eat good, and take care of chores and stuff.. and then one thing can happen and I become suicidal. I just am so ficking tired of everything. I can't stand waking up in the morning anymore
