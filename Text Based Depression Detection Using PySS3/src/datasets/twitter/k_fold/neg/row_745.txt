I think I will do itNot right now. But soon. I've just had enough. 

I'm 27 year old female. My story is this:

My dad was violent and alcoholic in my youth. Me and my siblings got used to live in fear. My mother ditched him when I was seven, only 'cause my little brother got cancer (if he would've gotten abused while being sick, he could've died). He survived, but I was always put aside (naturally, 'cause he was sick and I was healthy). I was good at school, I've always liked it. Fast forward to age 15. I was raped. It ruined me. I started to drink (a lot), and to hang with older guys. I started to date one. I moved in with him when in high school. Drinking was our favorite hobby. He also introduced me to some drugs (cannabis, LSD, MDMA etc.) Then... I tried to kill myself. I nearly succeeded (death was few minutes away). I went to hospital for a while and when I got back to home, I continued all my bad habits.

Now I'm in university, but I just can't do THIS anymore. I should've graduated half an year ago, but I'm lazy and stupid. Also my fiancee (formerly mentioned as the old guy) hates me nowadays. I'm disgusting, stupid water buffalo in his opinion (yeah, I've gained weight and I don't look like a 16 years old anymore). It's sad 'cause I know it's true. I hate myself and I'm sad for all my relatives 'cause they need to pretend to care for me.

I just know that my life isn't going to get any better. I am shit and my life is going to be shit. I'm just done.
