WhyI donâ€™t understand anything. What is life. What is human existence. Whatâ€™s real. Whatâ€™s fake. Does love matter to/from anyone? When you have psychological issues people give up on you. Partners, family. They get tired of it when youâ€™ve already been tired of it, living with it for so long. You have no support no matter where you go, no matter who you talk to. They all will eventually get tired of it and give up on you. Their sick of hearing it when youâ€™ve never mentioned it. Their sick of your personality. Their sick of how you sulk and how you look at life. Their tired of your energy being so negative when thatâ€™s all you know. Therapists try. Psychiatrists try to fix your chemical imbalance. Nothing works. Nothing matters. You lose yourself. Who are you? Who am I? Nothingâ€™s real. Everythingâ€™s autopilot. One big fog. Everyone gives up before you do. Trying to hold on to one thing but you canâ€™t. You canâ€™t even find anything to hold on to. You are your own worst enemy. Your mind is your worse enemy. Alcohol, drugs, anything to numb your mind then it always comes back. Always comes back. Everything comes back. I hate it. I hate you, I hate me. No one loves you. You donâ€™t love anyone. No family, no friends. Just you yourself and a weak bullshit ass rope or bottles of pills thatâ€™s suppose to help staring back at you. All of it. Waiting for you. I donâ€™t get it, I donâ€™t get anything. Whatâ€™s real. Iâ€™m not real. Your not real. Nothingâ€™s real. I try I try I try I fucking try I FUCKING TRY. No one wants to deal with me, I canâ€™t even deal with myself. I canâ€™t understand myself. No one understands me. No one will. Why fucking why why is it like this. I canâ€™t. I fucking canâ€™t. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I canâ€™t fight, I canâ€™t fight it. I hate everyone, I hate me. everything goes, everything rots. Im done. Iâ€™m fucking done.
