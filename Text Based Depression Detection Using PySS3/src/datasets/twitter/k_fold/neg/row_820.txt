nobody cares anymore. i want to kill myself todayhi im a 22 year old female living in a single apartment. i can't continue with life anymore. my one friend that i had has been trying to help me but she's been busy stripping lately and she has all these guys and money and stuff going on, she's kind of given up on motivating me to keep going. my parents love me and call me twice a day because ive been so depressed. but i feel like a drain on my friend and to my parents. especially since they pay for my school and half of the rent. i just deleted all of my social media and snapchat. i would die in a second but i love my parents. i don't know what to do. i can't stop crying. i can't imagine things getting better because i feel worse then worthless. i want to die today
