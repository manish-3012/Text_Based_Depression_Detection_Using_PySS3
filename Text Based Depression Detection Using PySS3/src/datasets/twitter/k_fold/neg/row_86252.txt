It's only a matter of time....Where do I even start? My best friend became a stranger. I have a doctorate degree relevant to a career I no longer care for. I've seen some of the most disturbing things due to the nature of my past career, so you cant tell me life has great things to offer. I've  seen abuse in prisons and jails, ive seen the worst kinds of abuse happen to children, I've  witnessed deaths, and I've  lost all hope.

I literally feel like there are rocks in my chest and I spend 90% of my day looking at the wall. I cant eat. I tried spending time with friends, but I just end up crying and going back to my room where I can stare at the wall. My mind runs circles about what I could have done differently. My mind constantly thinks about past mistakes and regrets. I want to end the misery. It seems like the logical thing to do. Ive been fighting this for over a decade in hopes that it would get better, but every day it gets worse. Why continue life when I have the power to end it? No more pain, no more disappointment, no more failed relationships. The best part of my life is when I'm sleeping. The worst part of my day is when I wake up because life hits me and all of the painful memories gnaw at my entire being. 

In the morning,  every day, for a year I went to the top of a parking garage and tried to convince myself to jump, but I thought about the pain I would endure if I wasnt successful. I almost used my exs gun, but I was too shaken to operate it correctly. I attempted pills, but the dose wasn't lethal. I tried hanging myself on a tree, but the rope was too loose and i ended up scratching myself badly on some limbs. 

It's only a matter of time and there's some comfort in knowing I'm not alone. Im a slave to my own cognitions. I cant live like this and I wont.
