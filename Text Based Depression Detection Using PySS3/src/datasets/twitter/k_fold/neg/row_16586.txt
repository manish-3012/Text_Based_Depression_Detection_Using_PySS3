I donâ€™t know anymoreIâ€™ve felt with suicidal thoughts for the last two years. Everyday feels like Iâ€™m just postponing the inevitable and that I should just kill myself already. Iâ€™ve thought out so many plans and I almost did it back in August but never actually did. Since then Iâ€™ve felt like Iâ€™m just putting it off like everything else in my life. 

Iâ€™ve turned to self harm to distract myself I guess but itâ€™s just not enough anymore. Iâ€™ve considered going to a teacher or something but I donâ€™t know what will happen. I know that my parents would be called but they canâ€™t know. 

Theyâ€™ve said time and time again that being suicidal just means your not Christian enough and need to pray more (Iâ€™m atheist and LGBT in the closet). Theyâ€™ve also said that if I go to a councilor theyâ€™ll homeschool me for the rest of high school. 

I donâ€™t know anymore. I want to stop hurting but that would mean leaving my family dog, going into foster care, being put in a new school, and never seeing my friends or to stop procrastinating and just kill me self already.
