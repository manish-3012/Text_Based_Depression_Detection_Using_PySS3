Can't get over my ex?Hi, thanks for taking the time to listen.
As of late, I broke off from seeing somebody who was really important to me. We weren't even official, friends with benefits if anything. We saw each other for around 3 months, but I fell so hard and became so attached. I know it's hard to believe but I was genuinely in love, I have never felt so captivated; literal raptures instead of butterflies. 
This person broke it off with me, because he didn't see a future. And now I feel completely lost. It's been 2 months since, and I don't know why I haven't moved on. I'm feeling extremely low and have lost a lot of hope. I've already burnt everything he has gave me to try and forget. I am crying nearly every night.

Does anyone know how I can get through this?
