Going to end my suffering in a few hoursI just don't value my life.  I keep focusing on what I don't have and how much I hate mankind.  I've fought this for over 20 years and have just gotten worse each year.  I don't care how much my suicide hurts my friends and family.  Best to die and feel nothing rather than another 40-50 years of sadness.  Goodbye.
