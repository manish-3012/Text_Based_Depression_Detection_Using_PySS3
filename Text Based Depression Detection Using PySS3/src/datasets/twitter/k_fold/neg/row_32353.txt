One of my friends plan to kill themselves soon, and I'm running out of options. I can't change their mind.I care about my friend. Is there anything else I can do? He is suffering, and is so far gone that he believes suicide is the only option. He's not bluffing, and I can't bring myself to contact authorities. Is there anything I can do to change this?
