It's getting too muchI've been battling depression since an early age. I still live with my family, who also happens to be abusive. I've been chronically ill for a few years and it completely turned my life around. 

Trapped in my room, I haven't left the house in at least 3 years. I lost all my friends as a result of my sickness, couldn't continue with school anymore, can't work.

Even my online friends are slowly distancing themselves from me and I just don't know what to do anymore. The only person who seems to still care and talks to me is my ex. But he is seeing someone else now and I can't really be bugging him with my issues, when I still see him as the love of my life and it also hurts me so much seeing him with his new girlfriend.

I just looked around the basement to see if I could find a rope, but luckily I couldn't find one. I just don't want to be alone tonight. Nobody is ever there to keep me company anymore and life is just becoming too hard for me.
