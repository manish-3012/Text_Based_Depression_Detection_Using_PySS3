I'm on the verge.....Honestly suicide has always been something on my mind for years. I always thought "Oh, after high school things will definitely get better." but no... Two years later and it's only made me realize there's not a single person who cares about me. In every conversation I am ignored and spoken over. The only person I consider to be my friend barely talks to me. My family wants me to move out because they hate having me around them. I have no idea what I'm doing with my life and haven't experienced happiness in years. I imagine death will be relaxing. 

I'm not sure how to go through with this. I don't have any weapons or rope, but I have two 90-count bottles of 800mg ibuprofen. 144,000 mg of ibuprofen. That will sure do the trick right?
