Iâ€™m a lost causeIâ€™m a 14 year old boy I havenâ€™t been to school in 9 months and I am not going to get anywhere in life I will probably end up killing myself at some point but Iâ€™m just too scared to leave behind my cat who I love so much I donâ€™t know what to do with my days now Iâ€™m too scared to go outside I just sit in all day and try be happy but when I go off of my Xbox all these dark thoughts come into play and I canâ€™t get away from them itâ€™s so shit
