I'm going to off myself at work. Going to the job I used to enjoy. Same as everything.
I'm a glass blower and there more than enough dangerous gases I can tool with.
Time, has lost all meaning.
My burning stomach pains I've had sense the age of 9 will no longer be a problem. The habit of hating everyone is just. I can't live up to anyone's expectations, not even my own.
Failed attempts at happiness has left me tired and  down.

I am no longer afraid.
