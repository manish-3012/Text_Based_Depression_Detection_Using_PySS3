I want to die. I can't take this anymore.A few weeks ago, I had a dream that I was on a roller coaster, and the tracks ended, and I fell and for the longest time I got closer to the ground until I was dead and woke up.

I keep seeing that image...and I keep thinking how badly I want that. A quick, painless fall and no more stress.

I just lost my girlfriend, and I love her so much. 

I'm applying for universities, and I'm not sure I'll get into any.

I have no money because I spend it as quick as I earn it. I don't care, but if my mom found out, she'd be hell to deal with.

God, I miss my girlfriend.

I just want this all to end. I am so lonely, and there is nothing for me here. I want to be gone. No more. In fact, I wish I was never born in the first place. I don't deserve to exist. I just want to die. Nobody is every going to love or care for me. I have two friends that I care about so much, but they're close with each other than we are as a group. I have a job I can't stand. It makes me want to break down every time I go there. I'm applying for other jobs when I turn 18, but I don't I'll get one. I'm never going to find another girl again. Nobody is ever going to love me.

I can't take this anymore. I just want to die.
