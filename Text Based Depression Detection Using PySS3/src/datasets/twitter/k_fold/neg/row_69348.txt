Done saving myselfI guess I donâ€™t know exactly why I am posting here. My mind is swarmed with thoughts that I just canâ€™t get rid of. On so many occasions I have had such bad and terrible things happen to me, yet I have always been the one to pull myself out of it. Even when others are struggling I have always told them, you are the only person that can save you. But Iâ€™m afraid I feel done with saving myself. What is the point? My mind is very evidence driven and the evidence points to more and more heartbreak. I just donâ€™t see the point in saving myself just to endure more and more disappointment and further heartbreak.
