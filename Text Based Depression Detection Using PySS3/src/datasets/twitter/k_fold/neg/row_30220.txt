how can I help a friend...I dont know how to help a friend I met recently online, she has some suicidal thoughts and self-harm issues, and I want to help her with it,,, she struggles with some similar issues with depression and anxiety as I do, though I never had sucidal thoughts or did self-harm, and I dont know how to help her, and its making me realy sad, specialy since everyday at evening she seens to get on "bad mood" and wants to get isolated, so I worry for her very much at that time,,, she hasent told me directly that she has these problems, I saw her posts on reddit about it when I was looking for the post she made about making friends( and how we met ), and how to aproach this? can anyone give me some advice ? I looked some stuff here on the site and asked some other friends about it, but I dont realy know how to help, so maybe someone with more experience can help me with that?  


 ( sorry for english and if it sounds confusing, its so hard to write this for me, Im very confused about it and I just want to help but I dont know how )
