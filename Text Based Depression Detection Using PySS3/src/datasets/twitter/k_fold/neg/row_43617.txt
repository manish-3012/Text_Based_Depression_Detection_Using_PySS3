Happy Weekend.I'm just leaving the library, I no longer have internet at home.  
Since i've lost most of what matters to me, including just the will to live, i've been thinking about ways to die.  I've had this desire to die but not the determination.  I think I may just have found the courage to finally do what needs to be done.  im scared, anxious and a little excited that this might be my final time on earth and ill be free and happy even if its in non existence. 

i've enjoyed my time on SW just because I've seen true feelings posted here and if im not able to log in again for..whatever reason I just wanted to wish everyone a happy weekend and a successful resolution one way or the other.

Farewell
