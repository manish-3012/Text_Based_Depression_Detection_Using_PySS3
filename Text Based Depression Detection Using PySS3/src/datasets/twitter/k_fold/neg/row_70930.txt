Covered with scars, so alone, I'm killing myself this weekendI'm forever alone as they say and I fucking hate myself because of it. I'm turning 40 soon and don't want to be alone any longer. My life is worthless. If it had worth it would have been validated by others by now. Girls couldn't care less about me which I can't live with myself knowing any longer. I'm going to burn myself more and then go on a bender and blow my brains out.
