Do I sit back and watch my friend die?Don't really know how to write this. My friend has been suicidal for years and we've done everything we possible could to be there for him. His family has done anything in their power to help them out, programs, hospitalization, trips, anything you can think of. Even us as friends, if he's not hanging out with one, he's hanging out with another just so he doesn't feel alone. We love him so much but nothings changed him mind. He's been depressed as long as I can remember but this year has been the worst. He's attempt I think 3 times now? I wish there was something I can do to help. He posts on a forum and the posts have been getting worse and worse to where now the most recent one is him saying he's finally going to do it. He doesn't even know I know his account name and doesn't know that I see it. But he's always vocalized how he'll never be happy and it's what he wants. I've seen him at his lowest, I've been there when he was going to do it but changed his mind. Knowing he'll stop at nothing.... do I let him? Would that make me that much of a bad friend knowing if he ends his life, he'll finally be at rest, he'll stop suffering, the internal battle will finally stop? But if he lives, the suffering continues? I don't know..  at least one different perspective would be appreciated ... thanks
