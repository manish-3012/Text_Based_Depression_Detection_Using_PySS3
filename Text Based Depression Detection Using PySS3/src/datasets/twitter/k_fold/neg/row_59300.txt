Working myself to death for very little, donâ€™t really see the point anymore.Have a job that only pays $11.00 hourly full time. I am a Marketing Assistant, but lately the place has us working in our warehouses at all hours lifting heavy stuff, packaging, and shipping. We are not allowed to question it or not do it, we would be fired. I have no time to do my usual work and I get in trouble for that, and I just donâ€™t understand what Iâ€™m supposed to do. I have asked for overtime to work at home on my computer and get brushed off. Was told in a few months I could ask for paycheck advances if I was really struggling that bad, but those would be taken out of future paychecks. I have mentioned raises, but they said I will have to be reviewed first, but I was given no date. They just keep ignoring me.

Due to COVID no one else around is hiring, I donâ€™t live in the best area. Iâ€™m barely making rent each month,  no food in the house. I have a college degree in Graphic Design and I feel like I made a mistake doing that since I canâ€™t get a proper job in that field. I am just at a loss. I broke down in tears at work yesterday because I felt like I was going to pass out do to the work load. Iâ€™m only 5â€™2â€ and 120lbs. 

I am 27 and feel like a failure, everyone else I knew from college seems to be doing fine. What did I do wrong? I donâ€™t understand... I have bad GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and serious clinical depression. I just really donâ€™t see anything getting better and barely have any support systems. My job and barely anyone else gives a shit about me so why should I even bother anymore.

Basically, the only reason Iâ€™m still around is because I am cowardly and donâ€™t know how I would kill myself. Though, Iâ€™m thinking more seriously about it each day..
