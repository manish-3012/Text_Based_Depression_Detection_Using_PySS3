Feeling worse the closer I get to resolving problemsTheres a long history of issues really and I thought my life had gotten better after I met my ex-fiance. But soon things got MUCH worse. We broke up over a year ago and since then Ive been working on trying to fix my life, but it seems mostly just waiting. 

I lost everything. My job, my retirement money, my car. Im in so much debt. I had to go to counseling for the last 2 years and this month I am done, provided I pay the remaining $740 by the end of the month. Plus I paid off a van, not new or anything but its mine now. Things should be better right?

But I feel so hopeless. I dont have my own place to live, but someone is letting me live with them for $100 a month(its my ex-fiance's step-dad). So of course Im thinking about how Im going to find my own place to live later this year and it just seems impossible even with these extra bills paid off how am I ever going to afford my own apartment and a life. 

Its not just the living situation, its also the fact that I am transgender. Something I realized 2 years ago really and even thats a big financial and social burden. Its almost as if I have to choose having a place to live or transition. My job or transitioning. Is that even how I want to live?

Even work has so much drama lately and just shows me how unfair and fake the world can be. I hate it. But I'm trapped for now. 

Thats all I can say right now really. sigh.
