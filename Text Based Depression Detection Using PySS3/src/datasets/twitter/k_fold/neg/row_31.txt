I cant stop feeling like my therapist didnâ€™t believe I actually had any problemsI feel like he thought I was a fake he didnâ€™t even do the full 6 trial sessions with me I feel so disconnected and fucked I am meant to find a longterm therapist but I ant do it I just canâ€™t I have nothing to expel my fucked up thoughts I want to die I am going to clear my overdraft by the end of the year then buy a mask and nitrogen and fucking end it Iâ€™ve gone my entire life with no one believing Iâ€™m fucking depressed and no support my family and doctors are just fakes they are just a fucking facadec
