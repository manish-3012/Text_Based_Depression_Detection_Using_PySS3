Life is tough...I want to change myself. I grew up in a horrible family. My father was an alcoholic as well as abusive, after he died when I was 12 (thankfully) my mom decided to crack the whip (she was almost worse).

Ever since I was a little kid I always told myself I never wanted to be like them. That I'd be different. That'd I'd be great.

My older brother went the same road as them. He's only 24 and he's a college dropout and has to pay child support because he gave birth to a bastard child.

I'm almost 20 years old and I realize that I'm still just an average person, and it seems that nothing I do will matter. But most of all I fear that I'll end up like the rest of my family.

I always wanted to be something amazing as well as fall in love with someone amazing. But nobody that great will ever fall for just a tramp like me.

Perhaps I overvalue love(sex). Perhaps I'm a perfectionist who wants nothing but the best in his life. I'm afraid of ending up mediocre because I feel as though I have all this knowledge and that I have a responsibility to use that knowledge to give back to people/society.

Alas I digress.

I try to work hard every day, but sometimes its hard to just keep going. Especially when I have almost nobody that supports me. Very few friends. No family. *sigh*
