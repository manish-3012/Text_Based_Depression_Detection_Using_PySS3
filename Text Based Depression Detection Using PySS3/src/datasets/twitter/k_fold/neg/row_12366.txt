Probably not going to make it through this weekI don't want to feel anymore. Everyone wants to catch that next high from being happy, and the lengths people go for it is astounding to me. When I get happy I immediately look to the crash. When my pains come back and in full technicolor to boot. If I can't enjoy being happy for one instance then why should I even bother myself with living? I don't know if this sounds like a whiny post. If it does then sorry.
