what to do in the meantimefor perhaps the 100th time, iâ€™m announcing that iâ€™m going to kill myself. i already know how iâ€™ll do and what song iâ€™ll be listening to, i know who iâ€™ll be thinking of and why itâ€™s something that i *must* do.. itâ€™s just a matter of when and not knowing that is what makes everything more difficult.
