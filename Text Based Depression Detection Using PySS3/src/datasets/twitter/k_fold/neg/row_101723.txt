Overdosing on 100+ Advil is constantly in my mind but I'm afraid of what will happen if I live.The effects of surviving an advil overdose sounds terrible, dialysis, kidney problems, liver problems. My mind constantly tells me to kill myself and reasons as to why I should but as soon as I hold the pills I start thinking of what will happen if I live.
