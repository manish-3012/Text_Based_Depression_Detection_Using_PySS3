I feel like suicide is my only option.Long story. I apologize for the long post.

I moved in with my partner and she decides to break up with me. Her behavior was erratic. She always came back to me, said she wanted things to work, then would go back to tinder and talking to girls. This cycle has lasted for over 7 months. 

I shortly discovered soon after that she is a narcissist. Her behavior was finally explained to me and I finally understood why she was abusing me the way she was. 

Recently, I lost my job. My narcissistic ex has refused to go to work always claiming she is "depressed" and now we have no money for rent and will be evicted from our home. My ex has stated that she is going to abandon me and go live with her sister while I become homeless. 

I have no one. Both of my parents are deceased and the little family I have left are very toxic therefore, I refuse to live with them. I am trying to apply for jobs but I don't have enough time to get my things together. I am completely devastated that my life has turned out the way it has. I cannot believe she is going to just walk away and leave me when I need her support most now. Instead of trying to have me live with her sister for a short period of time, she just simply states she doesn't want to go through this with me. 

I am afraid of where I will be. I am so close to suicide. I don't want to die but I crave peace. I crave relaxation and no stress. I can't even sleep in peace because I have vivid dreams about everything i'm dealing with. So even in sleep, I cannot unplug. I am very close to suicide as I feel it is my only option. I just want my pain to end. My life has been a downward spiral since my mom died 6 years ago and I don't know how to get out of this one alive.
