Iâ€™m going to kill myselfTodayâ€™s the day. Iâ€™m gonna do it. Iâ€™m going to kill myself. My life is absolute shit and whenever I think it canâ€™t get any worse it does. My parents got a divorce and my mom has turned out to be a lying manipulative person and took advantage of my dad. And now my dad wants to to go to court to testify against her. I know what she did is wrong and itâ€™s the best thing for my 7 year old sister but then it makes me depressed testify against my own mom and ruining her life. This is too much stress so Iâ€™ve decided I want to escape it and that Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I no longer wish to be on this earth anymore. Goodbye
