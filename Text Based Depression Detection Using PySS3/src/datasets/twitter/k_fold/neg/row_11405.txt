Iâ€™m in the hospital, and Iâ€™m sorry.Iâ€™m taking up a Crisis Stabilization Unit bed that could instead be used by one of you, who actually stand a chance of getting better by receiving some help. We have a critical psychiatric bed shortage here. Iâ€™m so sorry it couldnâ€™t be one of you here instead. These resources are literally being wasted on me. I donâ€™t feel like getting into it, but my SI is not going to go away anytime soon. Might as well discharge me and count on being too chickenshit to do anything.
