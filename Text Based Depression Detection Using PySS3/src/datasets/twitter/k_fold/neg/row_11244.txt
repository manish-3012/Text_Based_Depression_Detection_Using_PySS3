I dont want to kill myself but I don't want to live either.Fuck I don't know what's wrong with me right nown I posted here the other day bitching about stuff and yeah, since then I had a girl reject me (no suprise there, I'm a highly rejectable ugly trans freak), I've cut and now I'm posting this sitting on the edge of the roof of the parking complex attached my my appartment building. I keep imagining just leaning forward and doing it but I can't stand hurting the people that claim they care about me.

My father just shelled out thousands so I could stay here in Atlanta and here I am being a little bitch about to jump to my death a few days after signing a 1 year lease. What the bloody fuck is wrong with me you guys. I don't know what to do, I can't go back to the hospital for the 9th time, all it does it make me more suicidal. 

Doesn't help that I'm currently without a therapist.

Seriously though, any suggestions are appreciated.
