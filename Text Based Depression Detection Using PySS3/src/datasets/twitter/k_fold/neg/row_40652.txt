There is no point in being nice or caring.Everyone will hate you for it. 

It doesn't matter. This world will assume the worst about you no matter what. You try to be decent. You try to be caring. You try to be invested in your work. In your hobbies. In people.

You think you want to connect with people because you want to improve your ability to interact socially but the truth is, you're reaching out because you hope someone will grab your hand and save you from drowning in your own anxiety.

Drowning in your own black hole of depression.
Save you from yourself.

The truth is nobody cares. Words will spill out of your mouth like debris from the collapsed buildings of intent and everyone will assume you're only out to score or take advantage of someone.

People will ignore your actions. Your reputation. They'll only focus on something you said; not your history of anything you ever did, like standing up for the less fortunate or the marginalized.

No, you are a criminal for making a mistake and being human.

Well, fuck you. I'm done.

I can't make anymore mistakes if there's no me.
