Feel like my life is a long struggle in between brief moments of blissful escapismI only feel carefree when I'm immersed in something other than my own reality. I never actually feel truly happy. My life has been on a slippery slope for the past year and I'm just not living anymore. I'm trying to come up with a reason not to just go, got the house to myself until Sunday... 

Edit: thanks to anyone reading this or upvoting it's nice to know I'm at least not totally alone
