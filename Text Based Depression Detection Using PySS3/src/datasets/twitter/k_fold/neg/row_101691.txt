So help me god lolI just want to kill myself. My mind wonâ€™t stop thinking about it. My life has been shit for the past 18 years. I suffer from PTSD and that causes me to have so many problems. I deserve to die because Iâ€™m wasting my life away, I just spend it watching YouTube videos or sleeping. Iâ€™m just a terrible human being who does nothing good. I have no motivation for life; it takes so much fucking work to be alive. Iâ€™m failure as a student, patient, and as a daughter. I just donâ€™t want to suffer anymore. If you can euthanize an animal because they are suffering, why canâ€™t I end mine? Iâ€™m thinking about ending it tonight, either by cutting myself or jumping off a bridge. Not sure if Iâ€™ll go through with it.
