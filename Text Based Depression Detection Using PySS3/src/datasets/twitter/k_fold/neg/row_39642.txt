I need help... Over 4 1/2 years down the drain. My time feels limited.I can't do this.. I'm having terrible bad thoughts of hurting someone or myself. My relationship is going down the tubes. It's not easy for me to flush over 4 1/2 yrs down the toilet. I can't get this 12gauge out of my head, I am not stable right now. I have no support, I am alone. I am going to the corner store for beer.
