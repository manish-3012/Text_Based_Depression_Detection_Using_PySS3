I just donâ€™t wanna be anymore. I could never hurt my brother so Iâ€™ll never do it but fuck I donâ€™t wanna suffer in silence for the rest of my lifeI want to die 

I guess Iâ€™m posting because Iâ€™m so alone. I have so many people I could reach out to but I donâ€™t want to be a burden. I feel like shit. 



I need help and canâ€™t ask for it. 

I just want to die. Why canâ€™t I just have never existed?



Edit: I want to cut so bad. Thank god im not home but also Iâ€™m so afraid for my boyfriend to catch me crying. 

I want to go home and cut. Maybe then Iâ€™d be able to sleep.


Edit 2 bc why not: this is so damn pathetic. Could have had a good evening? Wtf triggered me to ruin this?
