Suicide is the only thing on my mindProbably delete this later.. but anyways Iâ€™m about ready to end it. I havenâ€™t slept and itâ€™s 10 am. I lost another friend and I donâ€™t know why. I canâ€™t even keep a Fucking friendship going or even be happy. Iâ€™m done being unhappy, angry and scared. Iâ€™m 18 and Iâ€™m a complete loser, dropped out in 9th grade and havenâ€™t had a job since April. I have nothing to live for Fucking nothing. The only friends I have left always seem to be annoyed by me bc I complain constantly. Iâ€™m always upset and itâ€™s hard to cheer me up. So yeah Iâ€™m thinking more and more about just putting a bullet in my Fucking head
