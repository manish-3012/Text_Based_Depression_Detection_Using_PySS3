Stress of a lone wolfThis is my first time on this sub, I just need some support. I recently snapped after a ton of stress from my job and school, and I haven't been able to sleep since then. It made me think about a few things. I have like 3 friends that I sort of talk to, but i can't exactly remember the last time we hung out.. I want to say around 2 months ago? I've always been a loner, and I like it that way, but I guess I'm comparing myself to everyone else I see on Facebook and shit, they look so happy with all their friends and here I am by myself. I work a lot, but I enjoy my job. Yeah it's stressful but I work with some pretty great people. I'm in an advanced math class and I haven't really given it much thought but I just realized that I'm getting a shitty grade and I won't graduate if I fail that class so I'm getting my ass in gear for that. I've started to meditate, and it's helped immensely. I thought about suicide once, and it scares the living fucking shit out of me. I guess I just feel like I'm not normal, and I don't know why I'm not okay with it. I have this terrible feeling in my chest like im penting something up, and it has gotten a lot better but I'm just trying to figure out what's causing it. Maybe I'm just overwhelmed? How can you get over being overwhelmed? 

Sorry if my formating (if you can call it that) is confusing
