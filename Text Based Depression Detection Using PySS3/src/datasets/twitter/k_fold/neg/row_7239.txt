The person I feel bad for...Is my father as he lives alone and my sisters don't talk to him. But I can't keep this going. I'm mentally, emotionally, and physically destroyed by loneliness, guilt, and regret. Sometimes you have to be selfish to be happy. I won't be happy, but at least the pain will cease.
