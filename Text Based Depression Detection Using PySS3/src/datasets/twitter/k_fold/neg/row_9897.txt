Not good enough.Hi. I'm 16 years old, female, and I just got fired from my first job. 

I've come to realize that I really am not good enough for just about anything. I was a mistake, an unplanned baby. I was always left behind by my parents. My dad was an alcoholic and my mom was in her early 20s, and was a party girl. I usually spent my time with my grandparents until I was able to take care of myself. I had a boyfriend, 20, who ended up being a sex addict. He molested little girls when he was 16, which I found out about a month into the relationship, but decided to stay because I knew nobody would ever love me. It was torture. We live in a small town, so everybody had known what he had done in the past, and I was ridiculed and humiliated. I finally left after a year of being with him, when I realized he never changed, because I was forced into anal sex by him and was sexually assaulted in my sleep. I've always been a failure at school. I have a bad learning disability with math. I'm not attractive, and I've never had many friends. 

After this, being fired, I've finally had it with my life. There's nothing for me. I come from West Virginia, I'll end up being like everyone else. Dirty and poor. There's no point in telling me to stay strong, because I can't. I was not supposed to be here. All I am is a mistake and a failure.
