Concerned for my friendThis is my first post on reddit so excuse me if I make any mistakes. My friend is wants to kill himself. He has very explicitly said this. In our most recent conversation he flat out told me he doesn't want to live anymore. He's only 19 and I don't really know what to do or what to say to him. He recently withdrew from his classes at a large University and he won't be able to go back until at least Winter 2016. He thinks that we (all of his friends) hate him and that no one would care if he killed himself, despite me and others telling him we care about him and want to help. He saw a doctor and says he got medication to take but that was three weeks ago and he says they aren't working. So far only me and one other person know about this. I have no idea if I should tell the rest of our friends and I have no idea what to say to him. Should I tell him to try to see another doctor? Therapy? He lives at home with a single mother and they are honestly very poor so I don't really know what his options are.

Edit: So in the 30 minutes since I've posted this I have learned that two of my other friends also want to kill themselves. I honestly have no idea at all what to do.
