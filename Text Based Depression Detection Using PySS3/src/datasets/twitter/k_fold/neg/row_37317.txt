27 and going to the bridge on the 25thI don't have any money or family, but I do have a girlfriend and two friends. I don't ever feel happy and it's been like this forever and it always will be. I feel like I'll become homeless and like it's coming at me like a train. I don't have any future or options,  and even if I did I'd never be able to feel any positive feeling, all I'd do is get myself out of this scrape this time, and maybe the next one,  until I couldn't anymore and then I'd be on the street. I'm leaving my roommate a month's rent and I have to pay someone for work he did on my car then I'll be good to go. I've tried saying good bye to one friend but it's too hard to say it without being too serious or raising concern,  so I haven't said bye but I hope the people I care about know they're good people and friends.
