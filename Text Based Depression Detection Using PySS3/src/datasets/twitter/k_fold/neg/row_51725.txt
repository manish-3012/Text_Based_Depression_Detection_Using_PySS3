I know how to tie a noose but what do i hang it onIn my bedroon i have a ceiling fan whoch probably wouldnt support me and then i have a rail on my wall that supports my closet door but is only about 7 feet in the air.

Before you send me the suicide hotline i already have that and it wont change anything ill probably chicken out anyways so all i want is solid advice.
