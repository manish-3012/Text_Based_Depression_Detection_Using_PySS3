Only staying for my 2-year-old son. I feel so trapped.I don't know if just typing this out will help, but I can't get these suicidal thoughts out of my head. I'm in a decent job, own a home on a couple acres, had a great upbringing and yet I feel like I can't connect with any of it. I love my son, but my wife treats me like shit. I've always had self-esteem issues (was a "fat kid"), but I was really getting myself together when I met my wife. 

We both grew up religious, but I always had doubts and realized I just couldn't quantify it all a couple years after we were married. That seemed to set us both on different paths and now I feel so trapped. I've been spiraling down for a couple years (am 26), but lately I just feel like I want to end it. I've come close a few times, but always think of my son. I just want to run away with him and start a new life (grass is always greener, right?). 

I guess my marriage would be the catalyst to my downward spiral, but now it's affecting everything. I find it hard to focus at work, my social life is disintegrating and anxiety is rising. I've gone to therapy, but they suggest the same things over and over. Couples counselling, clearing negative thinking, journaling, etc, etc... I literally just want a fresh start. A new relationship (haven't had sex in a year and she's the only one I've been with), new job, new location, but it seems impossible.

When I think about how short we're actually here, I feel like my life is just wasting away and I'm passively allowing it to happen. My mind keeps telling me that suicide would be a way of taking control and showing everyone.

I'm just all over the place. Don't really have a centre anymore and the lack of control over my own life is killing me. I can't even control my own moods anymore and that worries me. 

Anyway, thanks for reading if you did. It felt good to type it out even if it was all over the place.
