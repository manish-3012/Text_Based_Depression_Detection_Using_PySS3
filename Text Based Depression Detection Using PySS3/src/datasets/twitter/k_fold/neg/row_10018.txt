Why shouldn't suicide be a choice?TL:DR- Why do think, if you think so, that suicide is absolutely a wrong thing and those who do suicide are somehow cowards?

Details:-
So I have been going through a lot lately, got dumped by a girl with whom I was in a relationship for about 3 years. Lost interest in job. Lost any dreams for future. Found out people I know are not really "friends" with me but just acquaintances.
I can understand the girl's perspective as we were in a long distance relationship for the past 1 year and I wasn't an ideal partner for her. I wanted to leave everyone and everything for her but she never promised me the same. She didn't have any obligations to stick with me and found someone who had more in common with her. She tried her best to give me the news slowly over 2-3 weeks before finally saying she wants to break up. Although obviously that didn't lessen the pain but whatever.
I thought I was friends with her bestie, so I asked her for help. But she simply denied. That was probably the first shock for me. I had helped this girl prepare for a lot of interviews and whenever she would have asked me for help but I asked her for help first time in my life and she simply says she can't interfere in this and that her friend should decide alone what's best for her.
.
I had joined a company last year and found out people are really just worthless lumps of meat. The same ones who always showed as if they are so nice folks and took help from me on multiple occasions won't even blink before stabbing me in the back. Okay, I think they don't owe me anything as well, so that's that. I stopped talking to them properly and reduced helping anyone as much as possible while trying to be calm.
.
I never liked my family anyway. They are not bad people it's just that their upbringing has been in an extremely conservative way and they cannot change their mentality and perception of the world. They were always forceful about what subjects to take what job to find and also about marriage. Although I have been able to force my way into a job I wanted to go for. But I still don't like their treatment of me in the past. And I don't really care about their happiness much.
.
I have got some of my school friends but except 2-3 of them, I don't generally have much to talk with others. And even those that I have had for support are busy with their lives.
.
obviously, nothing much to cry over but just pointing out the fact that everything in my life has now become calm. And by calm I mean horrifically calm.
.
I always thought this, and now that I am aways thinking about this, I feel that suicide should be a choice. A properly accepted phenomenon by society. I did not ask to be born in this world. I was forced to live through a narrative which had way too many factors that I couldn't change. I don't want to be anyone's lab rat to test different scenarios on me.
I am done with this world. I am done with society.
.
I could have gone through with suicide, but everywhere I read people bitching about how suicide is an "easy way out", a "cowardly" act.
I also know that my parents would feel the worst heat from the so called "society" and hence don't want to go out in that way.
I have been searching for ways to get some lethal disease like cancer or brain tumor or something. But no one on reddit or anywhere else on the internet seems to be interested in helping me. Everyone is very quick to start the usual lecture.
.
I just want an end to this story. I don't want to hear any worthless lecture on what I should do. Because I have done more than I could. Still I cry every now and then. I feel like jumping off a building. But I have to control, what for? Just because of this worthless mentality of people that suicide is cowardly!
.
So please quench my thirst and let me know why do you think that suicide is cowardly? And where do you draw the line? Why should someone go through hell everyday of their life when they didn't want to be alive in the first place....
I seriously don't want any lecture on what I should do to be happy or anything. I just want to understand why can't suicide be a choice? Why can't society accept it as a private matter. I didn't want this life and this is my life so I should be allowed to stop it, shouldn't I?
Where am I logically wrong?
