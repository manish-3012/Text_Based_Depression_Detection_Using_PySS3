I just want my life to end alreadyIâ€™ve been to 3 different psych wards (one I went 3 different times) and all they did was switch my medicine around. I didnâ€™t receive any type of counseling or therapy there. After two times at the psych, I got in to seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist regularly but nothing has helped. When I opened up to my therapist about feeling suicidal, I was just shoved away to a psych ward. I did try to commit suicide last year by overdose, but my ex called 911 and they took me to the hospital, then to a psych ward. 

I just want my life to end already. I lost the only person truly in my life last summer, my ex. He was literally my family, my best friend and my fiancÃ© all in one. I have no family here, and I barely know any of my family. The closest relatives of mine live 1,000 miles away in across the country from me. I also have no friends. I have one person who talks to me regularly, but sheâ€™s honestly not a â€œfriendâ€ since everything is about her.
