I'm not in need, but I want someone to listen.I can't detail all my thoughts to why I want to kill myself, so I'm not, for simplicity sake. To put it short, a lot of things affect my mental state. I'm at the point where I'm apathetic or scare, stress and alone. There so many things I want to do, but I never do them. Things get in my way... symptoms making me think I'm might die when it might not even be that serious \(Hopefully, as the doctor tell me I'm fine\). Always Paranoid\(hopefully I'm using that word right.\) I'm just always worried about something. Doesn't matter how hard I try.  Things won't change. If things could change... if I could change, I would of so long ago. Why must I keep living. I don't trust anyone like I want to. Anyone couldn't understand. I don't even understand myself, thoughts and stress. I'm Tired and I just want peace... one way or another.
