Someone talk with meMy girlfriend of 5 years, which I been living with my whole grown life with, as we moved out from our parents to live together almost at the same time we met, has gone away for 5 months to do exchange studies. It's only been a few days since she left and she is now saying that she is having so much fun and that she don't miss me very much. She doesn't even talk to me unless I send something first. She tells me that I need to start being independent and that I need to learn to live by myself. I asked her if she was gonna leave me and she asnwered: I'm not gonna lie, I don't know. Probably not.". This crushed me and it's hurting so much. I just want to puke and rip my hearth out. It feels like my life is ending. She is all I have. I don't have any close friends which I regret now. I need someone to talk to me right now. How can I survive this. My biggest fear have always been to lose her. I love her so much. Before she left she was so affectionate, but that all swirched quickly. WHAT HAPPENED. Help me. It hurts so much.
