I'm drained and don't even want to bother making everything "good"I have asperger and never fit in, besides that, since I was a kid I never really felt there was a reason to live (fyi: I wasn't suicidal or anything back then, I just saw no point in living or dying).

Anyway, I tried to fit in, I tried to meet new people, I am in therapy, and it isn't helping at all. 
And please don't say "try a different therapy". See, my whole life long I've been thrown from doctor to doctor, from here to there and non if it ever helped.

I'm also tired of human beings.
They always lie, abandon, hurt you and then they act like nothing happened, even though they just made someone really depressed and pushed him to the edge.
Well tbh, there have only been 2 people I felt living for. Only 2 times did I feel like living in these 18 years of pain.
But they both abandoned me.

I'm also tired of always acting like everything is fine and thinking about suicide every day for the last whole year and a half.

I'm empty, drained, really freaking depressed, don't want to go to school anymore and just want to freaking kill myself.
