'If I'm to slip beneath the train ment to take me, know that I believe that it was worth it.'Song lyrics from 'if im to die' by Keaton Henson. I'm obviously not creative or talented enough to think of such lyrics.

I think the song is about how death is inevitable, love and falling out of love. I'll never get the chance to experience that, the love part of course. I think I've accepted that now.
