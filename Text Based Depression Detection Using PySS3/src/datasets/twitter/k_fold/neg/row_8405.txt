Pressing the reset button.Iâ€™m losing this game. I took all the wrong turns, made all the wrong choices, and now Iâ€™m headed nowhere.

I just want to press the reset button. Iâ€™ve gone as far as I can here and Iâ€™m ready for a fresh start. 

Iâ€™m not leaving much behind. No job. No friends. Hardly any family.

A new beginning sounds so refreshing. I can just imagine the beautiful blank slate and hopefully Iâ€™ll get it right this time around.
