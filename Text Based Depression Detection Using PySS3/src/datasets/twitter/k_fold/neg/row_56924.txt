Fuck this shitI know everyone around me don't respect me. I know if I tried to leave them and thereby forgo all the privilege concomitant to being their bitch and try to work my way up in the world I will only be trapped at a low-paying job with no free-time for self-improvement and still be not respected, being thought of as a disposable tool of convenience. Fuck all of you: I'm worthy of self-respect and I won't stand as your bitch; I'll fight for that or die trying by the hand of the demons of self-loathing evolution vested control over to you by way of us evolving as a social species, needing group approval to survive. Humans need room to breathe and self-improve as inextricably theirs that society does not give them.
