I tried to kill myself 2 years ago.Instead of feeling happy for still being alive, I feel like a failure. That I couldn't even kill myself without fucking it up. Now I feel stuck. I'm in a job I hate, in a body I hate, and in a house I hate. I'm stuck with a car that was too expensive, because my dumbass didn't think. I have no friends. I'm constantly lied to.

I don't want to keep doing this. I want to just shut it all off.
