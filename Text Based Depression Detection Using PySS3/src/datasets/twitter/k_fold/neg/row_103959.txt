I think tonight is the nightI donâ€™t want to wake up tomorrow, I donâ€™t want to worry about going to work tomorrow. I just want it to be over. All I need to do is drag the blade down my arm and it can be all over .  I donâ€™t want to live another aimless day regretting all my choices , I want it all to stop
