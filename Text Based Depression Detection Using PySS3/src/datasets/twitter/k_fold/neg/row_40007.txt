Fake a Suicide Attempt, or Live in a Tent?That's my current dilemma.

&amp;nbsp;

My financial assistance is about to be cut off. Welfare, in other words. Could be in about 1 months time.

&amp;nbsp;

I've brainstormed many possible ways out of this problem, without it having to result in my death . . although I do nonetheless believe that my death is inevitable, sooner or later ..

&amp;nbsp;

 I really just think it would be nice if I could at least delay my death, so I can at least finish building up my YouTube music / film channel, which has recently been gaining new viewers and subscribers.

&amp;nbsp;

Faking a suicide attempt comes with the risk of damaging my health, and adding new scars to my collection . . on my left arm. It could get infected really badly, in a worst case scenario .. which would warrant an amputation.

&amp;nbsp;

Alternatively, I could just tie a rope around my neck, stand by the edge of a bridge, with a bottle of vodka .. and just get drunk, and pretend as if I'm getting mentally prepared to jump. That would be a better, less gory alternative .. although it comes with the risk that I might slip .. and end up dying for real.

&amp;nbsp;

Living in a tent is not the lesser of the evils. It's pretty harsh out there. . I wouldn't go out camping in the hills without a machete or something, god knows who or what is lurking out there in the wild. My family would no doubt report me missing to the police, and that opens up a whole new sea of trouble.

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, failing all of the above.. there's always the option of cutting out the bullshit, getting on with it .. and killing myself for Real. Would still be nice if I could just get the chance to finish my fucking videos .. at least have 24 of them, 24 good videos with lots of hours of effort put into them. I want to leave a legacy behind.
