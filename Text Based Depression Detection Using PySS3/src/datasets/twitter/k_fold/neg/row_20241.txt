telling my doctor about suicidal thoughtsLet me start off by saying I have the literal most shit insurance. My primary care doctor does not care about me and has put me on 20 mg Prozac daily to "help" with my extreme anxiety, bipolar, BPD, and ADHD. I stopped taking it months ago. I know I need to either get into her or another doctor soon because I have been feeling extremely suicidal. I am just worried about telling my doctor because I definitely can't afford to go to inpatient treatment, as nice as that would be. If I tell them, would that mean I would be under an involuntary inpatient hold that I would have to pay for? TIA.
