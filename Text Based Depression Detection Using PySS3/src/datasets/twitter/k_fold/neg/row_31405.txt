If one day I got better, what would even be left?Years ago the entire way I saw myself and the world broke down and slowly rebuilt it around my mental illness(es?). It's a fundamental part of my personality now, it dictates everything I do, everything I want and don't want, everything value (which is, of a course not a list that includes my wellbeing).

Every now and then I consider seeking help. Actual help. My college has an on-campus therapist that my tuition pays for, I could literally walk in and say "good morning, I want to die and I'd appreciate it if you'd make me *not* want to do that". But in the very, *very* small chance I actually went to a therapist and in the even smaller chance I actually get better (which I doubt, cause that's require me coming out of a couple closets and that's sure as hell never gonna happen) then what? What am I now? Who am I without all of this suffering?

Depression has eaten everything I am and made it a part of itself. What'll be left when that's all gone. What's left then?
