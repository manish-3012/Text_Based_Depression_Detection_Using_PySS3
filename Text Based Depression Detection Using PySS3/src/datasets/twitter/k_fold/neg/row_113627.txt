About life, randomness and purposeHello everyone, I hope this is the correct place to post this.

I've been hit by a black swan event, absolutely out of my control and not-preventable thing that swept me off my feet and made me reconsider the world, my place in it and how I interact with others.

I dont know how much I should backtrack on my experience but, in a nutshell, my SO, without previous signals and 2 years short of marriage left me in the span of 2 days.

That in itself is bad but I am rational, my mind is clear and I'm aware that my current situation may have been triggered by this event but the storm was always there, lurking, waiting for fate to start breaking.

I returned to arts, always been my safe-haven, met with friends, strengthen bonds and physical exercise, im experiencing the cookie-cutter good way of dealing with trauma and loss, my life, in every other aspect it's, from the perspective of an outside observer, ideal.

Even then, I have the impulse of ceasing to exist, not to suicide per se, as I dont want to impose grief onto my loved ones, but every day and action is accompanied by the loudest call of the void, I can *forget* about it if im really submerged on work or art but it always comes back, like the unrelenting tides.

I live the dicotomy of rationally wanting to live and the need to cease existing, this necessarily doesn't come from a place of sadness, I just don't see the point of being, even if a Genie promised me right now that only happiness awaits, this need wouldn't go away.

Thank you for reading and excuse any mistakes as english is not my first language.

And for anyone else that feels reflected in my text, I understand you, I deeply do.
