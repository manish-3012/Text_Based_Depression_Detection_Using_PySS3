Uh heySo ive been feeling really down lately, even tho i dont have much to feel down about. But i just wish i wasnt alive and while googling things about suicide i found a post about this reddit group saying theres tons of supportive people here and decided to make an account and vent here. Maybe it will help? Idk
Uh im 16 and again i dont really have much to complain about, my life is fine rn. I have amazing parents and amazing friends and an amazing girlfriend but i just feel so depressed and anxious and i dont know what to do. I just wish i wasnt alive rn.
I think i need my meds changed, maybe upped because my seasonal depression is setting in.
My girlfriend is coming to see me tomorrow. This is the 2nd time we will see eachother irl. The first time i went up to see her and thats when i asked her to be my gf
Im very scared about seeing her again.. what if she realized im ugly or gross for being transgender or just hates me and im so scared idk why and i dont even know what we are gonna do or when she coming to my town.
I dont think she knows how fucked up i am, every day for the past few weeks ive been thinking about what would happen if i just died rn and how i would do it.. i just want all the pain to stop i wish i could just sleep for a few weeks until everything is okay again. I dont know what else im supposed to say at this point.. i just feel so empty and nothing makes me happy anymore and i wish i wasnt alive
