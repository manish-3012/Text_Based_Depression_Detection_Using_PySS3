Thoughts on sucideMore of just wondering if it's actually that serious to have suicidal thoughts? I've been having them daily for like several years now. Yet I've read that in many cases if you tell your therapist your having these thoughts they will/are obligated to break your trust and call the cops on you and get you put in the Looney Bin.

Is it really that serious? Like pretty sure most people who are depressed thing about killing themselves. Cant really lock everyone up lol

For me if I had a button that would end my life I would press it immediately. 

Am just curious if I say went to a therapist and was actually honest would I actually get locked up?

Idk if this post is meant for here but thanks if you repsond...
