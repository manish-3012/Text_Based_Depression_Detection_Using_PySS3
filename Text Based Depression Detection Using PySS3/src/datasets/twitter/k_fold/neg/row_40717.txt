Does anyone have suicidal fantasies about being killed?Iâ€™ve been suicidal most of my life, but sometimes it goes so far as to envision actually being killed (or at least seriously hurt) by someone else or in an accident of some sort. Maybe itâ€™s because then theyâ€™re doing the dirty work for me. But I was wondering if anyone has ever had this happen as a suicidal thought or fantasy? I know itâ€™s fucked up, but this is the suicide watch sub, so hopefully yâ€™all can understand.
