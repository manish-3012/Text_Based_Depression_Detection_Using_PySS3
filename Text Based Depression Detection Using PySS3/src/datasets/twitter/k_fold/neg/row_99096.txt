all I think of is suicide and my brain is not working but zeldaI hate this pain

I hate waking up every hour or two in a cold sweat

Every waking moment alive are just hell

I should be in the hospital

I hate everything

My mind is broken

It hurts when I piss

It hurts when I swallow

It hurts when I think

I just wanna sleep.

But I'm waiting for zelda
