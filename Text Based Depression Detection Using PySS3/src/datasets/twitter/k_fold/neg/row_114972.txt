I Refuse To Die So Easily But I Need Some TipsIâ€™m very bi polar, one minute Iâ€™m trying to kill myself and the next Iâ€™m perfectly fine. I donâ€™t want to die I want to keep living even if I donâ€™t have anything to live for right no. Iâ€™m trying to piece my life back together, lately I havenâ€™t been able to eat or sleep. Iâ€™m not in the position to get professional help and talking about my problems to friends and family is out of the question. Do you guys have any tips/tricks for staying safe when I get those really bad mood swings or anything that might help my situation in general?
