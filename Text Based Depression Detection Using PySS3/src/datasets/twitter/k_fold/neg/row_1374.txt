Concerned for a friend, advice?I'm quite concerned for a friend of mine, who refuses to get help other than to talk to me and a few other people. To start with, both he and I are in High School, which should give you some idea of where he is.

For the past 10 months or so, he's been depressed pretty much constantly, to varying degrees. At times he's been mostly okay, but it's never a sure indicator. Currently, he says he's not currently actively suicidal, but he thinks a lot about suicide and various methods. In short, suicidal ideation.

I've asked him to promise that if he's ever actively suicidal, he'll call me, a suicide hotline, or 911. He's said he can't promise that.

Basically, I'm asking for advice. I've been depressed before, I was even actively suicidal twice, but what helped me doesn't seem to be helping him, which isn't exactly surprising. I'm quite concerned for him, his depression has been getting worse over the past few months. I can provide more information if needed, I'm sure this whole post is a somewhat stream-of-consciousness and confused.
