The only answer to chronic illness: fentanyl, xanax, and gabapentin gameover cocktail. Only 1 more day of this hell.Every minute of every day, I hold out against pain. Time was that i cried myself to sleep about it. Then no tears came.

I'd rather go out on my own terms now than suffer another 20-30 years of this slow death.

The only things im worried about are how will this affect my family, the people i care about? How long will it take them to find my body, hopefully someone at school checks on my dorm.

Theres only so much pain a person can take, eventually everybody snaps.
