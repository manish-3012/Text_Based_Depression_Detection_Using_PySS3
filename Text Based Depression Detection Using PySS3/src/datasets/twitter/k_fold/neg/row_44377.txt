I don't know why I am still here.I have always been on the bigger side. Ever since my first day of middle school my life has been nothing but ridicule and people talking shit about me. I am in my last semester of high school right now. That is over six years of constant ridicule from my peers. I have tried to make friends very often and try to hang out with them, but every time that I do go somewhere with them they will make me feel like shit and toss me out of the social circle and then ask me why I didn't enjoy it and they know damn well why I am unhappy. I have tried to get a girlfriend or even get a girl to notice me but they are shunning my just on my looks alone before they get to know me. I just feel so hopeless in everything because no matter what I have done in the past six years not a single thing has gotten better. I don't know why I just don't do the world a favor and take myself out....
