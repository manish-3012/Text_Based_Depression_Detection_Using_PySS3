X-Post Depression. So much sadness, so much upheaval in my life. I don't want to live anymore.That's all.

Depressed since 2009. I achingly yearn for an intimate relationship with someone who cares for me but my illness just pounds inside my head until I can't help but blurt out the horrible thoughts I have about myself for some relief. This pushes people away though I desperately do not want to.

I'm working on my issues--seeing a therapist for cognitive behavioral therapy for my dysthymia. I am getting better. More than a year ago I actually attempted suicide. I would never do that again. Ever.

It feels like everything in my life is going wrong. Dysthymia, breakup, all my plans for a move to another country shattered (and thus all my plans for going to conference interpreting school down the drain), my cousin is dying with cancer leaving two small children behind and to top it all off I got into a car accident today.

Life is so fleeting, and yet... I cannot help but think if my head went through the windshield this morning I would be free.
