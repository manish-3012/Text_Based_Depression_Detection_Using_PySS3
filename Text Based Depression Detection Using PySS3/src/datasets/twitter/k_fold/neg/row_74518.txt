I'm a burdenI have to kill myself. It'll be less of a burden for everyone. I know my parents care, and they spent all that dumb medical money on me. Me. Why am I such a burden? Why do I drag my parents down with me? Why do they care so much?

My dad just came in and expressed how happy he was that the results were clear. Nothing wrong with my heart. It's like the guy in the car was another person. The guy who was screaming that the truth from my mouth was an insult. He was some forgotten guy.

My dad said I was a new person. No more excuses. No more problems. That's not true. My depression is still here. I still hyperventilate and cry when I'm stressed. I still want to die.

My dad shouted that there was something wrong inside my head, and he shouted he didn't wanna pay for a psychologist. And I wasn't hurt. I wasn't angry. I understood. I costed them so much financially.

And they still care?

I'm gonna go take a nap. If I feel the same way when I wake up, I'll do it. I'll kill myself. And I'm sure I'll do it.

Goodbye.
