An indecisive dumbass.The title is practically my job description, I'm all of the above and more, but that's not what this is about. For whatever reason whenever I consider suicide or go out of my way to ask myself "Why dont I just do it today?" I reach the same conclusion, Im apperently choosy about when a good time to off myself is, not the best skill but sure is a good icebreaker. Not picky and choosy in a way like "I want to live to see this" more like a "if I commit today people will think its because of what happened last week" which seems strange but I guess makes sense considering my personallity, a people pleaser. Quick example, my entire friendgroup left me without reason (or they just didnt bother to tell me) strange but eh, no more than a week after that I thought about the usual suicide talk with myself but got pulled back to earth when I remembered people might think its only because my friends left and not that I was suicidal before hand. Not sure if any other people get this at all or if its just me..
