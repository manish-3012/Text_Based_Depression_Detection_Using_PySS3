ByeThe leather

When it pinches my skin

I'll think

Of your fingertips



The cold metal 

And the strained strap

The closest I'll ever come

To a lover's grasp.



And I hope

That its quick

And I can revel

In the finality



And I hope

The only thing

Breaking the mirage 

Of the white gates

Will be the rich depths

Of you.
