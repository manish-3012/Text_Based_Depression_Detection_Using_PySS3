Just because others want me around doesnâ€™t mean I want myself around.Whats the point if other people want me around when I donâ€™t want myself around? I donâ€™t like myself. Iâ€™m paranoid about everything, i get angry over video games and petty arguments, Iâ€™m terribly pessimistic, I complain too much. I just want to split my mind in two and kick out this person with all these awful attributes that worsen my days. Every time I wanted to kill my self I thought about how other people really want me around. But whatâ€™s the point if I canâ€™t even tolerate this fucking moron whose typing this right now?
