Itâ€™s less about killing myself and more about ceasing to exist.I doubt Iâ€™m going to end my life although it would be nice too. Im generally a happy person im just plagued  by constant suicidal thoughts, they verge from the clarity that would bring death or a pleasing feeling of not exciting anymore. I live in a country where guns are highly illegal and hard to get a hold of but shooting my self in the head is a constant fantasy. I find it strange that even being a happy person i think about killing myself. I struggle talking about these thing to other people so who ever reads this, thank you.
