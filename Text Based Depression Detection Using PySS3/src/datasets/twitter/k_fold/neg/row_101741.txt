My phobia stops me from overdosingHey, I have a lot going on in my life but my phobia really affects me. I'm emetophobic which means scared of puke. I'm so painfully scared it consumes me, I'm desperate to overdose but the fact is I'd rather just die than be sick.
Im disabled and I have Â£300/~$390 to live off each month. My partner supports me in that I don't pay even half the rent but I feel awful. I feel stupid, worthless and inadequate. I'm tired of being in pain, not being formally diagnosed with issues I and other doctors know I have. The healthcare system here is fucked, I've been waiting since I was 13 to find out what's going on with my body and I'm nearly 24 now. Reddit, I'm so tired. I'm so tired of my legs not working half the time, the consuming fatigue, the pain, dizziness, bowel problems, bladder disease, seizures.
I tried to hang myself when I was a teen but that clearly didn't work out.
Being chronically ill I have more than enough meds to kill me but I'm too scared of failing and throwing up or throwing up on the way out. It's ridiculous. Guess you could see that one as a blessing and a curse. I have BPD also and no therapist, I can't afford one either.
I just don't know what to do.
