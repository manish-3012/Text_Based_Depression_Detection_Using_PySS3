i keep trying to overdose and now my body feels weaki think i am slowly dying. my body feels weak and i have been vomiting blood since last night. i dont feel well, i don't feel like a person anymore i dont feel like myself anymore, im dying. ive been having panic attacks lately now more than ever and i cant control my thoughts and i feel like im going down a dark path and i have no idea how to stop it, i feel so fucking alone and empty, ive been so fucking sad lately. im glad im dying
