There's no point if I can't connect with anyone.And I really don't think I ever will. Things don't just "work out" because they have to, they work out because you have normal people skills, don't excessively hate yourself and consequently drive people away, don't feel like you're stuffed with cotton wool instead of pumping blood, don't constantly sabotage yourself because you've been told so often that that's your purpose, and most of all, because you actually deserve to be loved and recognised.

That's it. Thinking about all of this instead of doing my assignment.
