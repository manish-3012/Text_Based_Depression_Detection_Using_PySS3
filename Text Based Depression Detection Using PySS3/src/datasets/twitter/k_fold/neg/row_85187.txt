Depression since childhood has ruined my lifeI have been depressed since age 12 and am now 22. My depression came back full force in college (I had thought I was doing better at the time) and caused me to fail two semesters in a row. Now I have no degree, over 20k in debt, no way to get my hands on my transcripts because I still owe the school room and board (a year of credits wasted). The 6k I owe them just went to the attorney general so now I probably won't even get a tax return. All I do is get underpaid as a programmer ($9 an hour, live in the actual fucking middle of nowhere so there's nothing better around and I don't make enough to move anyways).

I have been actively fucking trying to get better. I have been on countless meds, none of them work. I go to group therapy most days during the week. The coping skills they teach don't make my fucking debt go away. They don't cure me being chronically single and rejected since I've been old enough to date. I don't have the energy or motivation to look for a better job. I don't have any self confidence left to try and get dates anymore (I can't even manage to get one date, I've been on one date in my whole life and it's now been over a year since then.)

I just don't have any will left to keep doing this. I need a fucking miracle at this point. I shouldn't have to pay this debt, I was pressured into going to school by my guidance counselor. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I don't want to deal with this anymore. When I look online and see how other people dealt with it they all have kids or girlfriends or wives or someone that they loved enough to keep living for. I don't fucking have any of that, there's no point in living this fucking disappointing life anymore.

I can't deal with this anymore. I'm taking a shit ton of old meds I have lying around. Enough that I won't wake up.
