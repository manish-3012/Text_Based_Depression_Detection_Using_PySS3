I tried and failed but believe i should have succeededI am really poor
I was neglected and beaten until i was 18 by my mom and her family while my dad was virtually never there even before divorce
I have no concept of love or healthy relationships
My ex who sexually abused me manipulated me cheated on me beat me and gaslit me was annoyed by my suicide attempt and used it as a way to get internet sympathy points and is rich kicked me away with not so much as any of my possessions being offered to me when i go back to my abusive mom since i had no one else
I dont want to say what i did
But its been almost a year and it still hurt
no doctor
I have cavities in every tooth and need emergency surgery
I fell and broke my nose and mouth and scarred my lip from drinking too much and my current sometimes abusive boyfriend was standing and watching as it happened in front of his whole family of men and he blamed me getting hurt for drinking heavily even though everyone else was drinking and i just wanted to mentally escape for a moment...its my fault but to break up with me for it then get back with me for sex and cuddles??
My mom ordered him to physically abuse me last time i visited her because i was not following her orders to go outside fast enough when she was trying to sleep.
My family abused mevdaily and even at an older age too old to know so little about self care... Or adult functioning
I wont make it on the street here
I wont be able to get away
My body hurts so much every day
I messed up my one good relationship with cigarettes and lies and agreeing to be polyamorous when i had insecurity issues and now those people are gone forever i should have only tried to be friends so im stuck im an idiot i have not a single friend and i want to have a reason to stop killing myself with cigarettes even though i can barely breath and i weigh like a stick when i was a teenage girl
I hate myself and am useless and my family genuinely has no idea who i am or how much they hurt me and also blame me for my existence
No one has ever been on my side
How can i have any reason to live?
I cant afford a doctor and every day hurts
I cant shower
I want all my teeth gone
My jaw is broken
I cant sleep
It hurts
I just want it to not hurt
And i dont even know how to love myself or trust myself or not look guilty when im out in public even though im just existing
Im sorry im old and ugly and awkward and poor
Im sorry my anxiety makes me worth hating
I am sorry being hated is something that keeps me unmotivated
Im sorry this is so long
Bye
