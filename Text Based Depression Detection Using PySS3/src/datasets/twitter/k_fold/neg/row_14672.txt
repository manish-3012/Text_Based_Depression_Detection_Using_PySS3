My Brother Cut Himself And I Don't Know What To DoI'm on my phone now but just yesterday i made a post in the anxiety subreddit about my brother. Turns out things were a lot worse than we thought. 

I was with my mom in the living room when he called out saying he needed to go to the hospital. We thought his anxiety was kicking up and he was stressing over some things. My dad went to go check on him and next thing I know we was all scrambling. The ambulance and police came. My mom and dad went with him while I stayed with my brother who has a disability. They left the knife here and there is blood all in the sink. I dont know if i should clean the sink or even if I am able to do that. I certainly dont want my parents to do so and i am just so lost. I know reading this sounds crazy but I need some outlet. I haven't had proper sleep in about three days and I don't know if I will after this. My anxiety is through the roof but I feel like I have to be strong for everyone else.

**Update:** Got a call back from the dispatch saying they are coming back to pick up the knife. All of my family is aware of what is happening. I just feel really helpless and I can only imagine how my parents feel. I told my bother to use the other bathroom. I don't know whether im ready but someone has to do it.

**Update:** Got another call back saying they didn't need the knife and to throw it away.
