Encountering suicidal person onlineWhat do I do when someone feels suicidal online? 

I was playing a League Of Legends match and had won the game when this person on the opposite team explicitly states that he wants to kill himself. My mind kind of went blank from there. I didn't know how to help the person other than give him the hotline for the suicide prevention number and tell him that, "There are people that care about you". Now... I'm filled with regret. Regret that I wasn't able to do more for this person, so... what should I do when I encounter this type of behavior online again?
