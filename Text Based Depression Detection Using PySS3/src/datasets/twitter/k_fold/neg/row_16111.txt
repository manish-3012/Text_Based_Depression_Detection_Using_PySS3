Good bye, I'll remember the kindness of strangersAt this point I feel like I've written a novel in this sub with how much I've been posting in my quarter\-life crisis. I previously said I would end my life in three weeks if my therapy appointment with sexual trauma counseling didn't go well. I have instead decided I will leave this life on Wednesday after my regular therapy appointment. I just heard my parents fighting\-\-which reminds me that as much as I struggle with self\-hatred now, my depression was originally caused by external factors\-\-and my mom said that she wants to kill herself. This scares me, leaving her, possibly triggering that. My mom's life isn't happy either. She deserves so much better. But, I think, losing me might give her the freedom to leave my father and live a different life. Thank you to the kind people of this sub as well as r/OCD, r/adultsurvivors, and r/rapecounseling for reaching out to me in my time of need, giving love to me when I couldn't provide it for myself. I wish everything good for you all.
