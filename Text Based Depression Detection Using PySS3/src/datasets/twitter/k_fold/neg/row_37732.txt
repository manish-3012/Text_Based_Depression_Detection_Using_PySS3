I guess I'm just waiting to die, while slowly builing up enought motivation to do it myself.This is my second post here, and since then my suicidal thoughts just got worst.

I am at a point in my life were I live for the sake of living. I can take little to no pleasure from pretty much everything. It all just seems so pointless.

I don't really have any real carear plans. It's not like I have absolutely no future, just that I can't see myself enjoying anything end up doing.

Even my relationships are decaying by the second. A part of me doesn't want to lose my friends, but a bigger, louder voice, just drains all my energy and motivation to do so. I see it crumbling around me, and all I can feel is a thin sliver of hopelessness .

My dream is to just die. Like, one day I am walking down the street, and a car just hits me. That would be the best honestly. So much so that i constantly find myself thinking "one day... one day it will happen".
