good morningthe first thing on my mind everyday is how can i harm myself and since i dont have that option anymore (my mom found the blade) i always think of suicide. i want to die so badly. thinking about living, not only does it give me anxiety but it makes me so depressed. i have amounted to nothing, im 18, i have no car and no job. ill never be able to drive because i have narcolepsy. im always going up and down with my depression. im so sick of this cycle of feeling good for 5 months and then another suicidal episode. its so exhausting. im miserable. im so fucking unhappy i want to take my own life for several reasons, but i dont want to hurt anyone. ill miss them but fuck this is not cut out for me anymore.
