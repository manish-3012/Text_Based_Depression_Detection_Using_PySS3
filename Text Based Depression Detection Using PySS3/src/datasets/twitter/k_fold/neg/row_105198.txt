Another day, another attempt.Hi, so far in the past years I posted 2 topics here, and here comes the 3rd one.

Do I come here for help? No. You don't know what I go through. What might best suits you, won't suit me, in fact that is the worst thing you could do to people like me.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are a wizard, make it that I get to be born again, in a healthy attractive body, in a country like USA, while my parents have billions on their bank accounts, and I'll be pleased to start my life again. Hell yeah! Bring it on, I can't wait.

A lot of people say "money don't bring happiness", we all know it's a lie, to a certain extend. We might as well say "poverty doesn't kill". Just as money does bring us closer to happiness, poverty brings as closer to death.

I started to write a book, because in order for people to understand something, they need to know you are there too, and in my life, I went through many things. That's what I thought this topic would be about, but as I'm writing it, I get to wonder, what for... What will it change? It will most likely disappear in a wave of new topics that are posted here daily. A lot of effort for nothing, I could sum up my life with this line. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never really got a seriouss reply here, even though what I always wrote was long, deep, and detailed.

I wonder is it because I'm a foreigner, a 31 y.o. male, or all this is just too much to handle. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that I realized. People don't commit suicide becase they are afraid of it, they chose life in measury. I had these kinds of thoughts since age 8, 31 now, that's quite long, and I get closer all the time.

I got up at 7 am today, prapared everything, and once again unfortunately hanging didn't go as planned. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rule 1b, If I wrote you what I felt today afterwards, that would be enlighting. Experiences like that are one of a kind.

I have a loaded black powder gun hidden in my basement, but I'd rather die peacefully. Euthanasia is not an option, but know this, all roads lead to death. Amount of hours, days, month, years, attempts, doesn't matter, because it only gets us closer. Noone asked me if I want to be born, but if I was a Sheiks son, I wouldn't object. I'm not. I'm nobody, I have achieved nothing, there is no way to improve my situation, I can't hit the fucking jackpot, I'm such a worthless being I can't even kill myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Live this nightmare and earn **509,01USD** a month? LOL, no. When I was younger I used to wrote all over some random US forums, "adopt me", then years later, "marry me", to get an American citizenship, and after that, I tried to get the Green Card, but failed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to wake up, end it all, but why it so hard to do it. Tomorrow is anothey day, another chance!
