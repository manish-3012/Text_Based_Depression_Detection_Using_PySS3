They donâ€™t believe I have mental illness.they think iâ€™m lucky because of the things i seem to have on the outside. but they donâ€™t know my pain, the internal battles i have to face within me every single fucking day. if i show it, iâ€™m just seen as an attention seeker and a crybaby that relentlessly complains about life. They think Iâ€™m just overreacting, being overly emotional and overthinking things. they tell me to just stop being this way as if it was so easy. and these make me feel even more alone and misunderstood in my struggles which worsens everything.
