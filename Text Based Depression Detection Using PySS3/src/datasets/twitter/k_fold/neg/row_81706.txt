What a waste I have beenI am 48 years old, and my life has been a waste.

Relatively soon, I will die.
Maybe in 20 years, maybe tomorrow, it doesn't matter.
Once I am dead and everyone who knew me dies too, it will be as though I never existed.
What difference has my life made to anyone?
None that I can think of.
None at all.

I know we're all pretty small in the big scheme of things, and I suppose the most you can hope for is to make some kind of difference, but what kind of difference have I made?
What in the world is better because of me?
Nothing that I can think of.
Nothing at all.

I don't fit in here, I don't fit in anywhere.  No friends.  None at all.  No girlfriend since 2008.  Loneliness has been my constant companion for so long that I no longer remember what it feels like to not feel lonely.

The sun is setting here, and soon it will be dark.  Another night swimming in shadows.  Perhaps tonight is the night that I'll finally drown in them.
