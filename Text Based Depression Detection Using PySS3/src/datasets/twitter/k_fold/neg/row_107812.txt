Hi! Please help. In-patient treatment for depression costs?Hi! Iâ€™m sorry if this isnâ€™t the place to ask this but I need help.

I live in Brooklyn, NY. My roommate is severely depressed and we may decide itâ€™s best for her to admit herself into a psychiatric in treatment program for depression. Her only family member is an extreme source of her depression and her whole life has refused to acknowledge, let alone pay for, her depression.

I know I thankfully have about $10,000 I can use to spend towards her care (though if I do spend it on her, I would rather not spend it all on in treatment care but instead a portion on her care when she returns). How much do hospitalizations typically cost? What are the steps I can take in the meantime to make the best decision, both for her health and financially? Are there resources, like types of programs, hotlines or facilities, I should be aware of? I know I would like a program where can be prescribed medication if itâ€™s decided thatâ€™s be good. I do not know what exact insurance she has but it is a private insurance plan.

Obviously if she must go into debt to save her life, then itâ€™s beyond worth the risk but debt is a scary reality for someone who is already hurting.

Thank you for any advice or thoughts you may be willing to give.
