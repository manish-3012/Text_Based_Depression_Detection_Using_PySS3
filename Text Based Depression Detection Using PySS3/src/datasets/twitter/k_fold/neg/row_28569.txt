Hey, just need some people to talk to.Feeling pretty rough now. Meds are failing to help me currently, and just need someone to shoot the shit with before I go and off myself. I play OSRS mainly, and some Overwatch. I love any type of video game, though. I listen to lots of music, not country though. Sorry. Just talk about anything and everything, please.  If I stop responding, please don't get offended. I love you all but I just have a lot going on right now.
