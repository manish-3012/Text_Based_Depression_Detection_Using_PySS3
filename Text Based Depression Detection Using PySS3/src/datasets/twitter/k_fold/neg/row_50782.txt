I'm just brokenI'm on the line between life and death, I can commit any time really, it's just a matter of when.

I told my crush that I like her yesterday, feelings were not reciprocal and it's brought me down further than before. I have a habit of self-harming myself daily and I feel it's just going to get worse now.

I really don't want to live and no one seems to even care if I am here, people don't realize how I feel, no one actually cares and I'm so forgettable that they don't even talk to me. I initiate everything, literally everything. I keep telling people I'm not okay and that I am doing really really bad, but no one seems to give a flying fuck either way, of course they say they care and tell me to continue living, but it's obvious they don't give a fuck about me, they don't do anything to help me or support me and I no longer have anyone to talk to about my thoughts and how I feel.

I keep trying to occupy myself with games and other activities but literally nothing satisfies me, I find nothing fun anymore and I have no energy for anything, no motivation and no will to live.

No matter how many times people tell me it'll get better, it never does and I continue to stand true to my word that It never will, I wouldn't say I revolve around destiny and shit but I honestly feel like it's my destiny to be lonely and in the end, kill myself.
