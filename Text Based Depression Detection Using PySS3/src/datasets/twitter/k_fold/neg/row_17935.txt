I don't think I can go on like this anymoreI don't even know where to begin. The only person I have to talk to walked out on me this morning after a fight we had last night. It's not the first time I've caused a fight that lead to him leaving, it's just the first time he hasn't come back or even responded to me. I don't know what's wrong with me, I never think of putting others first before myself, but don't realize I'm being selfish or careless or just a plain bitch before it's too late and blows up in my face. 
I thought I was doing good, we're both going through a stressful time but I'm never good with stress and let little things get to me and lash out at people in response. That's why I have no friends left, and I'm too introverted to make any new ones. I'm weak and over emotional, and as such never advance in my career, and end up fucking up my relationship. We haven't even been married two years yet. 
I think about suicide occasionally, how everyone would be better off without me constantly screwing up. Honestly I think the only things keeping me from going to sleep for the last time are my cat (I couldn't imagine her getting put back in a shelter or something) and my family, who freaked out because I didn't answer anyone's calls all day. 
But I'm so tired of screwing up all the time and feeling this way. I just don't think I can make it through a divorce with the man I love so much, that I've built my life with. I know he would be happier without me and the problems I cause, but I can't bare to lose him. I guess there's that selfishness again. I've tried medications and tried focusing on being a better person, but there's no hope for me. I am who I am i guess. 
Sorry for the rambling, i have no one else to talk to, especially not about this. I just want to give up on everything, I'm so tired of trying and failing.
