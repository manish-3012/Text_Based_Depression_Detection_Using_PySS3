First day at school and I already want to dieIt's my last year in high school. The friend that I was sitting with last year sat with someone else. I feel hurt and alone. She has a lot of friends, and to be honest she wouldn't be my first choice either. But I have literally no one else. I'm shy, I blew my chance, now everyone already has friends and it's too late. The only reason I'm friends with her is because we used to roommates.

The only thing keeping me sane right now is the chance that we'll switch to online classes soon. Last year I was miserable and suicidal everyday for months, therapy was expensive and didn't help much. This year I can't even afford it. 

I despise school. It's hard for me to be alright even when I don't have to worry about all this. I've had just two classes today and I already feel done.
