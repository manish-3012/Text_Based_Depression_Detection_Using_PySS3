I donâ€™t know anymoreHello I am a 17 year old male and I think I am done dealing with life. I have been depressed for about 3 years because of family problems that would happen in my house. Due to those problems my brother had passed away a few months ago. However during that darkest time of my life I was also received with a blessing. A girl came into my life and basically numbed the pain. She made me the happiest Iâ€™ve ever been and we recently broke up. She means everything to me. She makes me so happy and we still have been talking here and there but it kills me every time because nothing is the same. I used to see her everyday and now itâ€™s never I think about all the things we did and it makes me sad. She sort of acts like we never had anything in the first place now and it hurts a lot but anyways Iâ€™m tired of losing people in my life and I know eventually I will lose other people as well and I donâ€™t want to deal with those problems and pain when it comes. Itâ€™s just too much and I genuinely think things will be better off without me and also I donâ€™t see myself going anywhere in life but Iâ€™m hoping that when Iâ€™m gone it will give other people opportunities to think and better themselves. But yea god bless everyone and I love you all.
