He bit my legItâ€™s been nearly a year, heâ€™s insane, Iâ€™m deranged. He doesnâ€™t understand my mentality, my issues, my fears. He thinks Iâ€™m hysterical, we just finished arguing, he was getting mad at me over a smoke. He threw old pop on my leg and I was mad so I was going to wipe it on his pants but no, he grabs my leg and lifts it up to bite it. My leg stings, Iâ€™ve been thinking of hurting and offing myself, earlier I stopped myself from cutting my wrist, now I wish I hadnâ€™t. I have this strong euphoria of experiencing death. I just need help to get out of this or I just might do it, Iâ€™m too weak and strong at the same time.
