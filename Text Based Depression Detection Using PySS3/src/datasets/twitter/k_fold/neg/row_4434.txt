Why is my survival instinct so fucking strong even through I want nothing more than deathIâ€™ve attempted suicide with pills and held a loaded .45 ACP handgun to my head on 2 occasions.  On one occasion my dog came up to me and I just started fucking bawling. And the other I had some Lofi playing, laying in my bed, gun to my head and finger on the trigger, and I had so much adrenaline running through me I almost passed out my vision blacked out for a second and my heart was no joke beating over 3 times a second. Thatâ€™s what stops me in the moment. But when I put the gun down all the logic and reasoning of why I want to die is still there. Still valid logic supporting suicide as the best option. Literally a 5 pound trigger pull away from everything Iâ€™ve ever wanted but itâ€™s so fucking impossible to do it. Has anyone else experienced this? Like a literal nerve block like my finger physically could not move to pull the trigger.
