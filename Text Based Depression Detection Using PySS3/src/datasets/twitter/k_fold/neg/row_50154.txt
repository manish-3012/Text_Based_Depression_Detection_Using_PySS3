I think one day I will do it.I've never been truly suicidal in my life. But I also never really wanted to live. It didn't matter to me if I live or die. I was eating because my body was hungry, breathing because I simply couldn't stop, going outside, smiling and talking to people because that's what they expected me to do. 

But today when I was crossing a street I looked into some car's headlights and I thought that it could be all over if I just made one more step. 

I managed to make my family hate me, I never made friends, my grades are getting worse because I don't have energy to study or really do anything and because of that I'll probably won't get accepted into university. I wasted my life and there's nothing more keeping me here. A part of me really wants to hurt myself and I think that part considers suicide as an option.
