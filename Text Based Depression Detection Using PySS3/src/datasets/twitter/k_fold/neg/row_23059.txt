What is the process of checking yourself into a facility to prevent yourself from committing suicide?I'm having these strong feelings of not wanting to exist and although I think it would be very selfish to act on them, I'm concerned that they won't go away. Are there places I could check myself into if this gets worse? I do NOT want to tell my family or friends this and have them worried and get labeled as suicidal and have them worried or whatever. Is there an equivalent of a rehab center but for this? If so, what are the legal/permanent record consequences of going? Will I be labeled as mentally unstable forever, etc? Any advice helps.
