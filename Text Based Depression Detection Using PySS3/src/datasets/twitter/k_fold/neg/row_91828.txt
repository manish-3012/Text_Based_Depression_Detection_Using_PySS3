Iâ€™m losing everyoneLong story short. I attempted suicide in June and really freaked my friends out. Since then Iâ€™ve lost three really close friends for stupid reasons. One because I got motorcycle, another because he had a crush on me and couldnâ€™t deal with being around me anymore when I donâ€™t like him back.  The third was for a very similar reason, a girl that I was flirting with distanced herself shortly after my attempt. I just feel like Iâ€™m such baggage now to everyone around me. No one wants to be around someone who doesnâ€™t want to be around themselves. Like, everyone was supportive until they figured out that worrying about me constantly wasnâ€™t worth it anymore. I think Dying would be easier on everyone at this point.
