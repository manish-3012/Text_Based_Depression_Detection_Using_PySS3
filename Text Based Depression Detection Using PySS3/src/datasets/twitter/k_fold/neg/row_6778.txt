Countdown to the end journal: I survived the attempt.My apologies amigos, I know with how i've been building up the tension everyone expected a grand finale. I picked up my xanax script on monday, took the entire bottle, took all of my lithium, all of my escitalopram, and a handfull of advill as well as an entire bottle of mucinex dm for good measure. Woke up in hospital. I'm a fucking failure. I will update when I make a new plan.
