Life bores me.Iâ€™ve struggled with severe depression and anxiety since I was about 10 years old. Iâ€™ve tried different varieties of pills, Iâ€™ve had appointments with professionals and been in different treatment programs. Amidst all of this Iâ€™ve attempted suicide three times. That aside; Iâ€™ve tried my best to distract myself in ways such as hanging out with friends, hobbies... you get the idea. Long story short - Iâ€™ve literally tried anything within range to help myself get better. Nothing has helped in the long run thus far and it has only gotten worse.
During these years Iâ€™ve done my best to conclude the whys, the whats and the whens. At first I believed it was the passing of my father that caused it all, and maybe even my childhood, but lately Iâ€™ve been starting to believe that neither two are a core reason at all. You see, ever since my teenage years Iâ€™ve always felt incomplete, unhappy, unfulfilled and like Iâ€™m not the main character in my own life. An outcast. Only a stepping stone for all the people that have walked in and out of my life - a bottomless resource you might even call it. In a way thisâ€™ll perhaps sound contradicting but Iâ€™ve always prioritised other people and their wellbeing as a way to distract myself from my own, because it always made me feel good when my friends and family were happy. A temporary bliss, sort of. Other than that Iâ€™ve tried to fill this hollowness inside of me with the love of former boyfriends. Hasnâ€™t led anywhere, obviously. Sadly Iâ€™m at a point in life now where not even the wellbeing of my friends and family is a good enough reason to stay. Metaphorically speaking - my life is like the roots of a big tree. See, the roots represent different paths in my life, but they all lead to the same source. The base of the tree. No matter what I do, what path I take, I will always end up in the same place.
As I said; Iâ€™ve done my best to conclude and Iâ€™ve indeed concluded. This life is not for me. Iâ€™ve come to realisation that in this world of concrete, I will never feel complete or fulfilled. I will never feel happy, because strictly speaking - life bores me. And finally being able to be honest with myself after such a long time of struggles and denial truly has such a liberating and calming effect on me. Iâ€™m done carrying this weight on my shoulders, Iâ€™m done pretending and Iâ€™m done going the opposite direction of a one-way road. I donâ€™t want to live, and why force myself to do something I donâ€™t want to do? Iâ€™m sorry but I give in.
