Hang OnIf anyone wants to be heard or listened to feel free to reach out. Just like a lot of yâ€™all Iâ€™m struggling as well trying to hold on to a small glimmer of hope that things will change and I will find the energy to change my life. Iâ€™ve always struggled with believing in my own future and still do but never have an issue believing in others and trying to help even if itâ€™s in the smallest way. I hope yâ€™all can find something small today to give you a reason to keep pushing through the day. I firmly believe we all deserve the happiness we lack. So if I can help anyone Iâ€™d be more than happy to.
