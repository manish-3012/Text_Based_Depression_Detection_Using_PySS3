The classic "I want to kill myself but I'm too much of a pussy to do it."For a long time I've wanted to kill myself but the thing that held me back was that I thought some people actually liked me and that would be a shitty thing to do to them. But now I've done some thinking and I've come to the conclusion that I make the lives of everyone worse. If I had never been born at all this would have been avoided, but now it looks like I'll have to put some people through some temporary pain. My ex girlfriend and I broke up because I developed a bit of a crush on one of our best friends (who, to add insult to injury, is a dude). She just recently told me that she felt like I was abusive towards her. I asked her constantly during our relationship if she felt this way, but she always said no. This made me realize that the only reason people pretend that I'm not all bad is that I'm too unstable to leave behind. All my friends stay with me because of pity. The friend I developed a liking for also has a girlfriend, and I envy their relationship and I know I'll never have one like it. They are perfect for each other, and I'm never gonna find anybody. All my friends are constantly annoyed by me and it seems that they try their hardest to pretend like they aren't. I want to end it but I'm too much of a fucking coward to do it. I hate pain (just like everybody else in the fucking world), and this combined with me just being a general coward makes me have very limited options. I want to be talked down, too, but I'm also too much of a pussy to contact a crisis hotline. I don't know what to do.
