HoleI feel like no one can hear me. I feel so disgusting. Iâ€™m trying to find ways of hurting myself to right my wrongs. I hate the skin the that I am. I am apart of the most inferior race on earth(black)  and I am so ugly. My acne has made me want to kill myself, even more. My body is disgusting and I avoid all mirrors. Being gay is a worthless added stress that is ruining my life. I hate that my natural feelings are sick and wrong. I was born cursed. I feel so alone and untouchable. I am jealous of normal good looking people I see. Couples walk by and I get so sad. I donâ€™t what I did to deserve such a shitty card. If God hates everything I am, why wouldnâ€™t he give me a switch to make me normal at an instant? Why am I still here? Iâ€™m so scared to kill myself in fear of me messing up. I donâ€™t want to make my mom sad. I am so depressed. I wish I was my older brother: athlete, married, christian, kid, momâ€™s favorite. Heâ€™s everything my family wanted me to follow by. Killing myself would give my family gratification in knowing a faggot like myself got what he deserved, eternity in Hell. I heard their hateful shit all my life. I know what my kind deserves at the end. Iâ€™m tired of waiting. Iâ€™m sorry that this is long post . If anybody is reading this, I am crying out. I have nothing. Iâ€™m not changing my sexuality and Iâ€™m not going to a fucking conversion camp. I am done with this world. I am so worthless, it makes me sick. I just want somebody sometimes. Somebody who cares that I am awake. Iâ€™m so tired of feeling like a sack of meat dragging across the floor each day. Why do I deserve that same fate as murderers and rapists? I fucking hate this.
