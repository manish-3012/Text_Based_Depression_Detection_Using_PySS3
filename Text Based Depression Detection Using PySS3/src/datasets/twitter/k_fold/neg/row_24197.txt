I think I was set up to fail from the very startBeen 24 years so far and my life was only truly good for a few months.
Every single time I try to have or do something good it gets ruined. I always end up abandoned. No one in my life seems to truly give a fuck about me. My "significant other" doesn't even answer me anymore. Doesn't matter whether I try or not, so I've given up on that too.
I've been varying degrees of sick mentally and physically my entire life.

Started to feel kind of better again recently with some adjustments to treatment just to end up in the ER with some problems no one can figure out. All of which no one even cared enough to ask about. 

I barely function at all now and it's making me fail at everything.
I don't really enjoy anything anymore. Nothing. At all. 
I feel punished and defeated. I haven't done anything to hurt anyone. Of all the truly awful people I know I've been the one to end up kicked down and broken spirited over and over. Its bullshit. I'm sick of it. I don't want to do any of it anymore.
I don't see the damned point anymore.
