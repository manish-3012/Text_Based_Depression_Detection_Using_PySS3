Crushing DebtI can confront many of my demons, but debt is that one thing I want to be free of. No matter how hard I have tried, I'm still under loads of debt and can't even get a job. Just about had it. Millions of times have I gotten myself back on my feet but it always goes to waste. If I can't make my monthly payment by the end of June, I'm just going to end it. I don't care anymore. It's not like anyone will really care, not even my family. I'm a failure who can't get a job and under debt, so that's totally a good reason to be the laughing stock and punching bag, right?
