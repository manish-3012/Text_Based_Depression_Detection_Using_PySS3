2017 has been the hardest year for my mental healthThis year has brought a crazy mix of emotions. My anxiety is at an all time high and Iâ€™ve lost the ability to care about most things in my life. Today I was sitting at work thinking how I could kill myself when my fiancÃ© messaged me about how much he missed me and I almost broke down crying. 

I feel like Iâ€™m staying in this stagnant spot and not going anywhere. I havenâ€™t cleaned our apartment in god knows how long, I donâ€™t want to do my hair/makeup, I just feel so hopeless. The only thing I can gain the strength to do is shower and sleep. 

Iâ€™m getting married next year and all I could think about was how my fiancÃ© might not see me in my wedding dress while Iâ€™m alive. I feel so lost and sad. Iâ€™ve been putting on a happy face and Iâ€™m losing all hope. I want to run away for a while, travel to California and never come back. I want 2018 to be different
