Holy fuck, this person gets itNot sure if anyone else remembers that video that went viral for the mighty years back about suicidal ideation...it started off saying "I'm suicidal and no it's not what you think." And it was a whole video about how the author feels passive suicidal ideation constantly. I follow her (the author) on fb and she just released her own take on the video and it's really good! Sharing here because maybe someone else can find comfort in her words tonight.
