I'm no goodI don't really see why I should be kept alive anymore. I'm messed up, worse than useless. I destroyed my own life. I'm a burden to others, a waste of time and money. I knew deep down that what I was doing was wrong, but still I kept doing it. And nothing's ever going to fix it. I'm just procrastinating, like usual. I don't want to be this, but this is what I made myself.

I don't think anyone actually likes me, and why would they? I think they mostly put up with me out of a sense of duty. Because they're decent people, unlike me. Sure, they wouldn't want to deal with the aftermath. But why drag this out? Pretty sure I'm sunk anyway.

I'm sorry for wasting your time.
