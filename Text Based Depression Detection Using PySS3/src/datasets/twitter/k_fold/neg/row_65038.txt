I feel like giving up on life...My mum always blames me for everything I've ever done in my life. She treats me like a slave ordering me around to do stuff that is so much easier for her to complete herself than making me run around the house. I understand she is old and gets moody often but..she always blames me saying that I make her life miserable. While in reality she is making me miserable...I try to get away from her as much as i can but theres only so much I can do being only 16. She always makes me feel useless and says that my face is annoying the shit out of her. She calls me stupid, useless, etc. She punishes me in various ways where a normal parent wouldn't do as punishments. Obv Idw to die, I have someone I love and care for to live on...but sometimes I really feel like giving up, it sometimes feels like life is worthless and as she said, im a worthless brainless stupid girl.
