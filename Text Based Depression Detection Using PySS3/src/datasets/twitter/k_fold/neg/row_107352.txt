I don't know how to move forwardIt's been a lot these past few months. My grandfather passed a few days after I came out as transgender at my school and I never got to tell him, I still haven't told the rest of my family because I am almost certain they would pull me out of college. the funeral was the day before my birthday, then two days later my significant other (of three years) ended things suddenly (over text message). she was my only actual close friend, and when she broke up with me she put in a no contact order at our university, meaning I cannot talk to her whatsoever. I had to leave two student organizations I was in because of the no contact order, as she is in the leadership of one and the other is mostly her friends. Almost all of our mutual acquaintances and friends took her side, basically because I refuse to speak ill of her to any of them but she apparently has no problem saying things about me. I think she called me emotionally abusive, because a couple of her friends have said that since the break up. I don't think I ever was, and if I was it wasn't on purpose (I know that doesn't excuse anything I may have done). Im not mad at her for leaving me, I get it, I feel like I probably deserved it. I'm really upset that I am loosing her, though. She was my best friend. On top of that, some people were in my room the other day, I would say they are budding friendships, and one of them read a joke about columbine and was like "isn't this fucked up?" Well my roommate only heard the joke and told the campus police we were going to shoot up the school. Luckily, they believed us when we said we weren't, but most of the campus thinks I am a terrorist now. I am extremely stressed about finals and all the work I have to do, but I can't get it done because I'm still a mess and I honestly have no idea how to do anything at this point. It's been a month and a half or so since the breakup happened, but my depression, bulimia, self harm, anxiety, and suicidal ideation are all coming back. I cut myself for the first time in months, and my bulimia has gotten bad enough that my throat has been bleeding off and on. I tried to talk to the therapist on campus, but she basically told me that I've been in therapy enough in the past that I should know how to deal with things by now. I can't tell anyone irl about some of this because I would likely be institutionalized, which would put me behind in school and seeing as it would be the third or fourth time, I might be there for a while. I'm scared, and I feel so alone. The biggest thing I am afraid of right now is that I will not finish my work and will fail my classes, then loose my scholarship, get kicked out of my house, and become homeless.  I don't know If I am being overly dramatic or if that is a real possibility. If that starts looking more like what will happen, I am going to end it. Its just too much. I'm not looking for people to just be like "hey pm me" because that isn't what I need right now. I need help, actual help. not just "youll get thru it."
