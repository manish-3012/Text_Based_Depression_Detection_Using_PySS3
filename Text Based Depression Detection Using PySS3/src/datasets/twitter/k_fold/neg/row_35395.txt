This is not how I pictured my lifeWhen i was growing up, I never thought I'd be nearing 30, single, part-timing at two jobs, and living in an apartment. I always had a plan- go through to my PhD, teach at a university, get married, start a family...I'm not near any of this. 

The economy forced PhD programs to start accepting less applicants, so I didn't get in anywhere. Then my GREs expired, and while I was offered an adjunctship at the university where I got my master's, it's part time and doesn't pay the bills. I have to get a part-time, minimum wage job to make ends meet. I don't have health insurance. 

I've been trying to find a full time job- applying to various types of jobs. I don't really have any skills that translate well to the real world of jobs, and I don't have any experience outside of of various part-time minimum wage jobs and my adjuncting. I hate that companies don't even send out rejection letters anymore. It's just a waiting game for jobs I don't get. My alma mater won't even hire me. 

I live in a one room apartment with my pet. Often, she's the only thing that I feel keeps me going, since I know she depends on me. I have to take care of her. 

I broke up with my fiance about two years ago. He wasn't a nice man, and I'm glad to be free of him, but I'm lonely. I have no relationship prospects, and I don't relish the idea of spending my life alone. I'm not a very social person, so I spend a lot of time alone at home. 

Add a recent estrangement from my parents to all of this, and I just feel like everything is kind of hopeless. I don't see things getting better anytime soon either. I feel...empty, alone, and I want to give up.
