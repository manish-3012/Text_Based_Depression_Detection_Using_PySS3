does it really get better?i constantly ponder, does it really get better? im so tired right now, tired of feeling alone all the time. i sometimes think, maybe i was destined to die young? maybe this is my fate. i cant turn to any of my friends anymore because theyd never understand my situation. i had a failed attempt when i was only twelve at a bridge and i still imagine myself there right now on edge surrounded by everyone as i cry and let go. i dont know how to feel anymore. im tired of fighting this battle, i want to surrender but i also want someone to stop me. 
my heart hurts seeing everyone struggle in this community, i send hugs and prayers to all of you.
