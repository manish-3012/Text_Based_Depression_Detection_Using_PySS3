Please helpI want to kill myself. Iâ€™m so tempted to go over to the overpass by my house and just jump. But I donâ€™t want to disappoint my family and parents anymore. I donâ€™t want to go back to therapy. I hate talk face to face about my depression because to my honest I have no idea why I feel like this. I shouldnâ€™t, I have a good life, good family,  supportive people. But I suffer for chronic depression (yes Iâ€™ve been diagnosed) and none of it makes sense. I just feel useless but I shouldnâ€™t. This is why I want to kill myself. Because Iâ€™m fucking stupid and only make things worse. What do I do? I want to go to the hospital to stop myself but I donâ€™t want my parents to know. Iâ€™m so scared at this point
