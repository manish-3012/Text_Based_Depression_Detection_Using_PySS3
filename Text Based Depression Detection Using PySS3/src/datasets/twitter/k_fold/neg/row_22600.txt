Doxycycline and suicidal thoughts. Anyone had any experienceSo am on doxycycline for my chest. Having serious suicidal urges not thoughts. Like real urges. I would take pleasure in some pain now. Like of I had a gun I'd definitely blow  my head off. But probs shoot myself in leg first to see what it felt like n to warm up. This happened last time I was on these pills. Typed on Google n apas it's a side affect of the pills obvs combined with my mental state doesn't help but fuck me I feel weird.
