I had a dreamLast night I had a dream where I found out I had a terminal illness and had less than a year to live. It wasnâ€™t my first dream of this kind, but itâ€™s increasingly  shows how okay I am with the concept of death. I used to wake up in fear and sadness, but now I when I think of inevitable death I feel like a big weight has lifted off my shoulder. Like - oh thank god itâ€™s finally happening. You canâ€™t worry about the future when you have none. And knowing whatever I do today wonâ€™t have a consequence for tomorrow. 

To be honest I donâ€™t have anyone Iâ€™ll be sad to leave behind, not even my loving family and great friends. I know theyâ€™ll get by fine without me, maybe theyâ€™ll shed tears for a week or two but theyâ€™ll eventually get on with their lives. Death has that effect on people. Besides, you canâ€™t feel guilt when youâ€™re dead - not like Iâ€™m feeling anything now anyway. 

I donâ€™t like living. I have nothing to live for. The cons outweigh the pros in any situation, and the struggle is just not worth it. Why is it so hard to die? Why do I have to plan and find workarounds if I donâ€™t want to suffer to death. Why do people insist of not letting painless means of offing yourself be available to someone who has decided they donâ€™t want to live? The worlds already overpopulated and now the people who willingly decide they donâ€™t need a space in this world canâ€™t leave - not painlessly. Even animals are allowed more humane ways of dying. So now Iâ€™m just stuck here not being able to do anything and not getting anywhere.
