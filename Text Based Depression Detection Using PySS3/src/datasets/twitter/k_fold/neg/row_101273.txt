I'm not sucidal, but I don't mind dying. Is this a sign for later suicidal thoughts? I have no will to live. I have no close family ties, and not that many close friends. I like to isolate myself; I would rather spend time alone at home interneting than go out in the world and meet people. I work and go to school full time. I have no life outside of those two, except for the occasional get together with friends.  Most of my friends are long distance and I'm really bad at  keeping in touch. I'm alone a lot. I do believe that I have a mild case of depression, not yet professionally diagnosed however. 

**Edit**: Update on the steps I've taken: I officially signed up to Okcupid. I hope this gets me somewhere.
