I need someone to talk toHello!

I don't really know where to start on my cause but..recently my life became worse, alot worse.

I've been suffering from depression since i was young, i had no one to talk to regardless of who they were to me, parents, friends and people that i've gotten together with

To give abit of background info, i've been thinking of suicide since i broke up with my ex-girlfriend 3 years ago, it was never constant but it was always a lingering thought.

Fast forward 8 months i fell in love with someone else, she confessed to me and i felt that maybe it could work out. We got together and went on strong for a year and a half, and thats when my life started crumbling again.

For awhile I've been neglecting her because we haven't had much to talk about and i was pursuing other stuff. Recently she's been dropping hints which i brushed aside unknowingly. And then it happened, she talked to me over facebook and told me about how she felt. All the neglecting made her snap, she told me how she fallen for another guy while i wasn't there for her. I understood her words and i respected her decision.

The day after we went out to talk, i told her how i was a fool and finally understood where i went wrong, sadly i was too late, she had already given me many chances before she finally decided. Even if she got back with me it would be out of pity she said. I told her that i would try to make her fall for me again. And here we are

The past few days has been horrible, i feel as if my heart is about to shatter, countless of times i thought it'll be better if i just didn't exist. Day after day we've been drifting further away, sometimes i think that the only reason she replies me is because she's afraid i do something stupid, and i hate that. And i wished that i could just stop everything.


I left out a number of details because i didn't want it to be too long, but if anyone is willing to hear my full story you're free to drop me a private message.

Edit: Some extra info, the past few days it's been a rollercoaster of emotions, i told myself that i'll cheer her on for whatever he decision is. But everyday when i wake up i would have horrible nightmares of me losing her and seeing her with another person and it completely shatters me. I've stopped myself from even trying to commit suicide. But i'm afraid that i won't be able to do that again when the time comes
