I don't want to suffer anymoreYou know that when alcoholics get sober things are supposed to get better. BULL FUCKING SHIT!  NO ONE AND I MEAN no one in my family really gives a shit how I'm doing. So what else is there to do besides just end it and kill myself. At least then I won't be suffering the constant and daily mental shit storm that is my life. The really irritating part is my adoptive father thinks that if I just get a job I will be happy.  Yeah right go to fucking hell you arrogant bastard. You only had one job and never went to rehab and had your life put on hold because someone else demanded you do it or they would treat you like garbage for the rest of your days. FUCK YOU ASSWIPE. Why don't you try getting a job as a nobody before you bitch out your son about not having a job. The economy is fucked and I'm fucked if something good and righteous doesn't happen to me soon.  Otherwise it's time to leave and peace the fuck out. 
Someone please save me from myself. I am not like this normally. I have rope and am no longer afraid to use it. What the fuck did I do to suffer like this
