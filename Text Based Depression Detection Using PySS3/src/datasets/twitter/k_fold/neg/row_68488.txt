I honestly donâ€™t think iâ€™ll make it to 2021..Even though I did everything I was supposed to do I just feel so damn empty. I even get bullied in my dreams. I just got me a nice seasonal job and iâ€™m still in college with one degree and I still feel like a damn loser. I get treated like crap alot and I dropped all my classes this semester and these chair people arenâ€™t responding to my emails to change my major I want to drop out fully but I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t own a gun but I have sheet covers and belts when iâ€™m ready. F this world bruh.ðŸ˜µðŸ’”
