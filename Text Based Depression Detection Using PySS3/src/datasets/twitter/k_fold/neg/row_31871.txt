Coping till collegeHello,i'm introvert guy from poor country and have no idea which fucking college i could attend as fucked up brain i am.First of all i'm totally become sick in head.My late childhood is spent on movies,video games,deep web,gore stuff on the internet,porn,alcohol..Completely fucked up.Like my mind is falling apart since corona because im mostly with my family which fucks me double with questions"what are you interested in life" or "find some point in your life".I don't even have idea what college i could attend as someone who is scared totally of people since childhood,i mean i don't even know how i get anxiety and stuff i was extremely anxious as a kid yeah,and went completely anti hero way since primary school(maybe because i was bullied some grades by classmates) and now it is time for me to attend college soon and still not interested in anything,literally nothing,my life is completely pointless i am becoming just like my dad .I am negative,nihilist all of this shit is mostly because i am sick of family totally and would better live on street selling drugs in corners rather than spending more time with them.Would you guys give me ideas which colleges i could look up as a introvert? I want to cope till college so i finally become rich after everything done and don't care about anything and anyone or i will rope immediately if i fail to get something.
