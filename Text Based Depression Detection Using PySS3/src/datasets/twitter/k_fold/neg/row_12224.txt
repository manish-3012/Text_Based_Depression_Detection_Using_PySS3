I feel terrible saying thisBut if I can't voice it here, where can I voice it? I wish I had cancer. Or that I was in an accident. Something that killed me. I don't care how painful it is. I'd get to die and my parents wouldn't have to deal with the stigma of a suicidal daughter. People who die in shootings or of cancer or whatever, they want to live and are denined that. I don't want to live and I am in perfect physical health. Fuck.
