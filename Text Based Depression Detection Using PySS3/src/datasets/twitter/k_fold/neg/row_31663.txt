There's no hope anymoreIm exhuasted. 

Plain and simple. 

I go to beauty college 30 hours a week, and I've already been struggling with suicidal thoughts, and the fact that I'm unemployed and homeless. I finally found a job, but it's graveyard shifts for 40 hours a week. I'm already barely hanging on as is. I think this might be the end finally..
