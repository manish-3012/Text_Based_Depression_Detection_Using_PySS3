Why do I hate my life.I'm not good at these type of things but I don't know what else to do. I'm at point where ive cried myself to sleep three nights in a row and I cant even say truly to sleep because ive slept a total of maybe two hours. I have a wonderful little boy who is the only reason I haven't gone thru with anything but he's still a baby so he wouldn't even remember if I did. My mom seems to care but we argue all the time. I lost the one person I could talk with and I feel like my only option is to just end it all. I think of all the pain I wont feel anymore and it honestly makes me happy. I just don't know what to do anymore.
