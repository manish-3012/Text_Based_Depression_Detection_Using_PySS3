I feel pathetic to die like this.I'm 23 year old female and I've never had a relationship that wasn't online/long-distance and I screwed up the relationship that was probably the best I could ever get and I miss being with her lately every second, especially since we're still friends who talk every day, so I'm reminded of what could have been â€¦ a lot. I'm a virgin and a lesbian and my only sexual experience was being molested as a child. I want to die so badly because of trauma and mistakes and major mental illness, but I feel like if I die now it will be pathetic to die as a 23 year old virgin with gross trauma. I know I'm not ugly nor am I a "social outcast" but on the inside I feel so cut off from the world. I don't know what to do. I've tried every sort of therapy, including expensive residential treatment. I still want to kill myself. At this point, the idea that it would die while like this is keeping me from doing it. I just want to be loved, but I don't deserve it. I don't know. Does anyone feel the same or have similar experience?
