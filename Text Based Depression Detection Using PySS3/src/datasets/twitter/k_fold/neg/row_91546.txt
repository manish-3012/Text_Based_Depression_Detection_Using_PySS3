23(M) going through family divorce and I relapsedIâ€™ve dealt with depression and attempted suicide a few times in the past. I have stopped after thinking about my family, and it helped me through it for awhile, until my family started fighting again. Throughout the years Iâ€™ve had been patching things up around and it has affected me emotionally. I relapsed again self cutting and drinking to help me take my mind off. Iâ€™m honestly too numb at this rate and my parentsâ€™ relationship have affected my relationships with other partners that Iâ€™ve decided to stay single until I can sort myself out. 
I donâ€™t know what else to do. I canâ€™t leave home much because my parents is strict and I donâ€™t get to go out much either. 
What do I do?
