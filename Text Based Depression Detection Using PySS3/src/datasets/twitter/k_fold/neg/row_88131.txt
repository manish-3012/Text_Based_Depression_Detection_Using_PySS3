I'm ready to dieThis has been a long time coming I would've done it a year and a half ago but I thought I had one last chance at happiness and I found it but now I've ruined that... It's unfixable... And I'm done I can't anymore. It used to be I just wanted to be gone not necessarily dead but just to not exist that's not how it is now, now I want death I'm ready for it... I don't want to cause any more pain but that's inevitable in this. I'm not really looking for someone to talk me out of this or try to convince me life's worth living because my experience has shown me time and again that it's not, whether because it actually isn't or if simply because of my specific personality/mentality/etc I make it so it's debatable but.... I don't want to talk but I need someone to talk to I can't say anything to anyone I know... I was directed to this sub from another I've never really posted anything before and I don't usually look to others for help...I don't what else to say

Edit: just wanted to let everyone know I'm still here some things happened over the weekend and though I don't really feel any better maybe worse actually I have to stay around awhile longer to make sure things will be ok for those I care about... I've thought about trying to find professional help someone to talk to but don't know at all where to begin thank you all for all your help this last week is meant allot
