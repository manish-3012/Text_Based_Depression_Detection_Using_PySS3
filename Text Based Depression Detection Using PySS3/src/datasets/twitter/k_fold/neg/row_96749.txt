Is it bad to have a plan?I just kinda made a plan for my last day. I wrote it in a document on my computer and I have a lot more details on it there than here.

I'd take the bus to the arcade, play some games, take the bus to get some pizza, get some junk food at the store, and then go home. Once I get home I'd eat and watch cartoons and eat the junk food. Then a the end of the day I'd end it. I have more details with that but I'm not allowed to talk about methods here.

Before my therapist quit, whenever we talked about suicidal thoughts, she would always ask me if I had a plan. Is it bad to have a plan? If I have a plan does that mean I'll be put in a hospital? I'm just so scared and sad and desperate... D:
