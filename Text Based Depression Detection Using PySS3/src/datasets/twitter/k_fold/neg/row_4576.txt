i donâ€™t want to do it. but i feel like i should. ( this is my 2729494 time writing something to post in here and finally having the courage to actually post it )i donâ€™t do anything in my life. mainly work for 3 hours a day, come home and play video games high asf till my girlfriend gets home.  iâ€™m not good at anything except for smoking fat and playing video games. i feel like my life is useless still, never going anywhere or doing anything, i feel like my friends like me but at the same time i feel like everyone iâ€™ve ever met wouldâ€™ve been just fine without me bumping into their lifeâ€™s. i feel sorry for myself all day telling myself iâ€™m trash, my girlfriend threatens to break up w me if i donâ€™t change myself and idk what to change because every part of me needs to change but every time i think of changing i give up because trying is harder than giving up, i used to wish everything was handed to me on a silver plater but now i just wish someone would hand me a step by step guide on how to get over myself so i can finally kill myself and stop bugging everyone i know.
