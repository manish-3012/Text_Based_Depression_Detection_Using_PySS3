Panic attacks cause intense suicidal thoughts even though I don't want to kill myself?I've been dealing with anxiety for years, it got so bad in June I finally got help. I started CBT 3 weeks ago, and I've been on 10mg a day of Lexapro for 2 months. It was working great but then I was getting panic attacks again and so my doctor upped it to 15mg 3 days ago. 

Anyway today I had another panic attack this time except it was far, far worse than they have ever been. It started as the normal sweating, racing thoughts, worry but then it got worse. Suddenly I was feeling trapped in life, like it was all too much to handle. I felt down and suddenly began thinking suicidal thoughts. NOT how I would, or even that I wanted to die, because I know I don't, more just the scary thought that I am suicidal and my parents and friends would find out if I admired myself to the hospital and then I'd loose my job. It's similar to another thought I have when I panic, which is the fear of throwing up. It has never happened, and I don't feel like I'm going to, but the fear of doing so sends me into panic and as the attack gets worse the more I believe I will throw up. Same thing here 

I took .5mg of Ativan and it stopped the panic after a few minutes. I was still shaking and very cold for a little while after. Even now when I think about it I don't want to die and I wouldn't say I'm suicidal. I also had a friend kill herself 2 years ago, I wouldn't wish that tragedy on anyone. 

If it were to ever get bad enough I'd admit myself to a hospital but I'm just very confused why this has happened all of a sudden and mainly when I have a panic attack. Right now I'm sitting at my desk typing this and relaxing, probably going to read a book soon and I'm pretty happy honestly, and I WANT to live, yet earlier all I could think of was not living anymore, even though I knew I wanted to.
