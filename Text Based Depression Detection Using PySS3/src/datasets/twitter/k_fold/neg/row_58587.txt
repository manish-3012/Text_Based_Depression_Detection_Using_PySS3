Thoughts Getting WorseI think it's worse than I'm making it out to be. I've started to hit a more depressive episode. I have OCD, struggled with anxiety my whole life (I'm 19). Started having suicidal thoughts again. I had them bad about a year ago, and seriously contemplated drowning myself, sat by the creek and everything. However, I thought against it. I'm not sure I want to die as much as I want the pain to stop. It aches so much. I actually don't want to die, I have so much going for me. Tonight it's been hard. I won't do anything. Couldn't do it to my mom I'm all she's got. But it hurts. Currently taking Seroquel and Prozac. Maybe I need a med change. But I don't know how to tell my therapist. Maybe I could email her... I just don't know if I could get the words out. My chest just aches though. Are these thoughts worth taking seriously? Maybe I'm just doing this for attention or I'm making it up in my head.  It sounds like something I'd do. I'm so fucking stupid.
