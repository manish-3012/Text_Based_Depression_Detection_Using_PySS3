Its inevitable. It's happening. I just need to say it outloud where someone will know its serious.I'm not sure why I'm posting. Reddit is just kind of my primary world right now. Its happening. That's decided. I've called the hot lines. I've been in the hospital. I've dumped thousands into therapy and medication. Ive told family and my few friends. The reality is its the only actual relief ill get. Seemed like the only fitting sub to leave a record. Notes seem trite.
