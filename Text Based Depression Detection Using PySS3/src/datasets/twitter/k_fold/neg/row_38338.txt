Feeling guiltyI'm feeling guilty again for no reason. There was an argument within a group of few friends that I didn't have any part in. One of the friends is fed up with one or both of the other 2 friends and I feel guilty as if I personally angered the first friend. Rationally thinking I know that I didn't do anything wrong but I still feel like an annoying little bitch who deserves every bit of pain she can inflict on herself.

I suppose there is a reason why psychotic depression has a higher suicide rate than "normal" depression.
