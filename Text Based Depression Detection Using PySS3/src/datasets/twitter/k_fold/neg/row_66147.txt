I suck at relationshipI didn't pay her attention more. So yesterday she told me to leave. I told her then you will not hear me again because I will kill myself. So she forgived me and telling me not kill myself that easily. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts and before meeting her I have tried to kill myself but somehow didn't do it. After few days later I met her and I thought myself lucky that there is more to live. But I feel bad about it. That I'm just making her stay with me otherwise I will die. I really don't know about relationships she is my second girlfriend. But my relationship before really didn't took long and she just told me to not meet her again but that time I had friends to talk so never really tried to end things. 
At this point I'm afraid in future if I and her have disagreement or I mess things up which I will probably do some point. I will tell her I will kill myself and she have to stay with me. I don't want to do that to her. But I don't know what to do if I mess thing up. Whenever I have problems I just think death would be solution to it. I don't know what should I do.
