I canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myselfItâ€™s been a really hard few days. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. 

Iâ€™ve emailed my therapist, chatted with a crisis counsellor online, played with my pets, attempted chores. Nothing can hold my attention. 

I want to die. I feel like I donâ€™t belong in this world. Iâ€™m too sensitive. No one will ever want me. 

I want this to end.
