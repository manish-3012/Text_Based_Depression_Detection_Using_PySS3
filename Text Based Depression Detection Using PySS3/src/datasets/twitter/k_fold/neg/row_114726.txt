Not sure if I can keep doing this any longerIm 19. I unknowingly had pictures of a 15 year old on my computer about a year ago.  Charges were pressed I went to court.  I'm currently on probation for a year and have to be on the sex offender registry for 10 years.  My life has been completely ruined by this and my family doesn't talk to me.  I longer have the desire to keep going.  I constantly fear being sent to prison and the harassment from the community.  I sincerely feel that I'd be better off 6 feet under.
