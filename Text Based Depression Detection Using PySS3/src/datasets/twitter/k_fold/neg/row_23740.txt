I am sorryI guess I am too weak for this world. I try, I postpone every day, but it's getting out of control and will probably culminate one day. Call me an asshole, or stupid, or anything you would like, but I am done with life. I cannot remember being happy since I was 7, and I cannot remember a single day since the last 3-4 years when I haven't prayed for a peaceful death. After all the pain, I really just need a peaceful end. I pray to god everyday to take me away in my sleep, so that it spares my best friends the guilt. I want to die in a way that makes it seem it was inevitable. I cannot leave people hurt, but I cannot keep hurting, living on. I have planned everything, from OD to a rope to a suicide bag, jumping off my 14th floor apartment to slitting my wrists, everything. But it's either too bloody, painful, or has risks of survival. I just want to die in peace. I want the universe to know that I am beyond help, because only I know the pain and hurt I face every day. And I want the universe to fulfill my wish. I do not deserve to live, but as a human being, I deserve a peaceful death so I can finally stop hurting. Yes, I am a runaway I guess, a coward. It's a fact, and I just want the pain to end. I want this life to end.
