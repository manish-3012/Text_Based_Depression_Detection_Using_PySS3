My college GPA is ruined, as are my chances to ever get into the school I wantI have a GPA of 1.6 or something. I cant just reset everything its all impossible, I feel hopeless. All my friends go to the school i live right next to, the school my parents and grandparents went to. 

I could never get in. I am not an A student(they only accept people who make As) and I have failed at everything and I donâ€™t want to go to another school where my religion will get made fun of, like how on reddit everyone just despises us. 

I donâ€™t want to live anywhere else, I just want to stay here in my state in this city and I see another school that just accepts anyone near me but I started out at a high level Pac 12 school, now I have to go to the garbage school to get an education, and my GPA will never be good enough to get into the good school that has my religious affiliation.

So many people just fucking theow me in the trash for my religion in person and on the internet. Its the only good thing in my life and I just want to kill myself.
