final wordsMy last resort. I have somewhat decided and i think i am okay with it. my life sucks nothing is going right i don't feel like I'm accomplishing anything it really feels as if there is not purpose. If i do really end up doing it, i wanna leave some last words :)

Thanks to the people that have helped me along the way. Well i guess the two people that have. I don't really have a support system but i felt like i was bothering them so i kinda stopped asking for help. Thank you H.C and H.N. My mother did care about me but she didnt know how to help. My family is pretty stoic with emotions and i have a narcisstic dad who doesnt give one single rational shit or even mind to me. theres really nothing else. I wanna thank my animals lol that have helped me along the way. maybe this is a selfish decision but i feel like im better of this way and im okay with it and itll be less of a burden for the poeple around me. I dont really know what else to say but ig treat everyone with kindess. if you tihink someones doing some thing for attention or pity, maybe they are actually hurting and only doing it for attention.
