I don't know what to doI want to end it so bad, my husband is asleep in the bed, Im in another room debating on whether or not to go through with what I've wanted to do for months. I'm so tired of feeling nothing, I know if I do this it'll break him but I don't think I can go on anymore, I love him and I know Im probably being selfish but I really don't care at the moment
