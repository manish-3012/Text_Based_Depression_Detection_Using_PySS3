today is my birthday. I think it should be my last day.I am turning 28 and nothing is what I thought it would be for my late 20's. I'm an artist, and still working at Starbucks because I was always too shy to socialize/attend/network at art events. I'm still single because I am a disgusting looking woman (despite trying to fix that, I put a lot of my spare money into trying to have better clothes and makeup and anything). I am very awkward with guys because a lot of them made fun of me when I was a kid/teenager, so I wouldn't even know where to beign with dating. I have no reasons to stay alive. 

Thank you if you read this. I am praying things beyond our life exist so I can find happiness there.
