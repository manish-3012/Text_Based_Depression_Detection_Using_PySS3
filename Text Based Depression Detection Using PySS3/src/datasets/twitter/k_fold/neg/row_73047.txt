Should I see a doctor/therapist? (intrusive not-exactly-suicidal thoughts)Recently, I found out that having recurrent thoughts of dying wasn't exactly normal (?) - like, I'd have thoughts that life would be so much easier for everyone if I'm not around; life would've been better if I died instead; if ever I get raped/kidnapped, I hope the villain finishes it off by killing me; I'm going to get hit by a car one day (this one is really repetitive); and when I die, I hope I won't see it coming - I want it to be quick and unexpected, hopefully an accident. And I've had these thoughts ever since I was a child. I never paid much attention to them, but I saw a video on Facebook about it and apparently, not everyone has the same thoughts? Not everyone thinks about dying? :o This got me a bit concerned.

But the thing is, I've got no depressive symptoms, I'm not manic-depressive either, no OCD... basically clear of psych symptoms. And the thoughts are just that - just thoughts. I never actually made plans to kill myself (none really hashed out anyway), never even hurt/slashed myself on purpose (scared of the pain), never thought of hurting other people...

Seeking help in my country is quite pricey, and I've read horror stories of people who got confined in mental institutions just because of these thoughts. I don't want to go through that, and I can't afford it either. 

I'm still concerned though - should I seek help now, even if they're just thoughts; even if they don't hamper my functionality? If not now, at what point should I seek help?
