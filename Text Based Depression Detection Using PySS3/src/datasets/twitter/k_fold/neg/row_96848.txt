I think I am really better off deadWhen I think about it I always think about the people it would hurt right after but I've been thinking about a year or so after I'm gone would it be worse for people or better and when I think about that I see that it would be better if I was dead I don't help anyone as much as they help me and I'm just a waste of time and energy everyone in my life would be better without me I hate thinking this but no matter how I look at it I can't see a way how I would be better off alive
