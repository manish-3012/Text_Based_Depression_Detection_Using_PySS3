No reason to live / tired of life / don't feel like living anymoreHi,

Reading this article made me feel more depressed / like killing myself / tired of life / not believing in God / the afterlife. I'm black / can't be on the level of these people. I want  to get a gun and shoot my brains out. If there's a god / afterlife I want to be in hell rather than be with a so called loving god that made my life hell. I can't do math / am disabled. I wanted to do engineering. I'll post more once I get a response.
