My sisters weddingI am no contact with my family, except for my baby sister. My parents were abusive, and my mother is a narcissist, so everyone in the very small town I grew up in thinks sheâ€™s wonderful and thinks that I am the monster child that abandoned her. My baby sister is getting married soon in my hometown, and all of my family, and all of the people who think Iâ€™m so awful, are invited.  she is the only family who will still speak to me and I canâ€™t let her down by not going but I also donâ€™t know how to go. The rest of my life is so horrible that it feels like I might as well fucking off myself before her wedding date so that I donâ€™t have to worry about it. It doesnâ€™t help that I donâ€™t drive and itâ€™s in a very very small town where there is no such thing as Uber or lyft and I have no idea how Iâ€™m going to get to the wedding or get away from the wedding without asking a family member who I havenâ€™t spoken to in years for help. She doesnâ€™t understand why I donâ€™t want to go, it hurts her feelings that her wedding frightens me. My life is such a shit show I donâ€™t have anything to live for anyway. Iâ€™m so fucking scared for her wedding.  I am fairly recently divorced myself, and I have no friends or anyone I can ask to go with me to the wedding. I have aged poorly because of stress, I am mentally unstable and on medication, I am a self-injurer, I have alcohol problems, I donâ€™t want these people who already judge me to see me like this, but I know if I donâ€™t go my sister will never forgive me. I think itâ€™s kinder to everyone for me to just end it. and not just because of her wedding, because Iâ€™m just a giant piece of shit in general and I donâ€™t deserve to live and Iâ€™ve been suicidal for the majority of my life, the wedding is just the most recent catalyst.
