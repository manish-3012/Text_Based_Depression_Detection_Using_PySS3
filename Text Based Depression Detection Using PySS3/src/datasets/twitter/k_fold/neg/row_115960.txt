Starting to look like my only option.I am falling apart. I feel like I am melting. Everything hurts. I am confused and hurt. 

It feels as though someone is reaching through my chest and squeezing my heart.

I am weak. My strength is a facade. 

I want to dissappear. I want to run away from my life, and go anywhere else. I want to start over, but I cannot because I am stuck. I want to be somewhere that nobody knows me.

Everything is set. I just have to do it.
