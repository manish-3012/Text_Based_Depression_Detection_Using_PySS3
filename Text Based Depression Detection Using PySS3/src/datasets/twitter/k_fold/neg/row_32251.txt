i need suicidefuelI have pretty much burnt all my bridges, because I decided to die, but the urge to die is fading, and I know my life wont get better, because I have tried for 10 years now, so dying is actually the most rational thing to do.  I had planned to end it by the end of this month (before I turn 25) and I want to do it with a smile, knowing it is the right choice. (I have nothing left, so don't try to convince me to live, because that's impossible).
