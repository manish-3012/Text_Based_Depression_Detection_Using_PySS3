Had enoughI've had enough of everything, language learning and the stresses with it. Today I met someone speaking fluent English you know what l, I messed up. She didn't speak to me because as I say, I'm just a background character

She had a better accent I could ever have. I don't fit in with this world and I cant blend in at all in a different country. I've got nausea every day, im tired of life tbh

I just feel pathetic, I look like a grim reaper. I feel so much, that I'm not even there at all to most people. They see me but, they wish they couldn't..
