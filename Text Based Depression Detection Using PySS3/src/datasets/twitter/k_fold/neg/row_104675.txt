I dont want to live anymoreToday was not an easy day. Woke up and since the morning I felt horrible, barely got out of bed and got some food. I spent most of the day crying and feeling useless.

 I talked to my girlfriend a bit over text but instead of her supporting me (there was an attempt but it was not great to say the least), she broke up with me saying she needed someone else. This came off as a shock since just yesterday we talked about what could happen with us in the future.

Now I am laying in the bathtub, sometimes crying and thinking about suicide. I have to go to work in half an hour. Its 3:30 am and I have not slept at all because when I tried I just started crying.

I wish this day never happened, I wish I was never born.
