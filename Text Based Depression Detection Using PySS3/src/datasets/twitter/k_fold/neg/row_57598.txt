Abandoned and kind of feeling ready to just end it all. [x-post from /r/depression]Last night, Tuesday night, my (20/M) best, and basically only, friend (44/F, it's a long story) told me she doesn't want to be in contact with me anymore, according to her our friendship is toxic for the both of us. :( Then I thought: "well at least I have therapy on Thursday, so it isn't too far of that so that I have to walk with around with it for 2 weeks." but then this morning I got an email saying my therapist got sick and my appointment is moved to March 10th. :( I have no idea what to do anymore. :( Somebody help me get out of this mess of a life I created. :( I'm alone, again, why does this happen to me every time? :( Why do people keep leaving me? :( I should just end it........ Apparently I'm not worth any human contact....... So why should I keep living?
