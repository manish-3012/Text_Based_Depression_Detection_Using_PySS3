Here's me setting a date for the third time.You know what they say...third time's the charm. Maybe this time I will successfully off myself.

I have set dates earlier for killing myself...one failed because an important exam fell on that date and another because of the lockdown due to virus. And I am really adamant on not failing this time. I am failing at so many times for so long. But I don't want this to go wrong.
