I don't see why I shouldn'tI could either continue to suffer and suffer, or I could end my life and not have to deal with anything anymore.  I don't deserve to live. There are so many people in this world with potential, the motivation to be the greatest. I have nothing. I don't have any plans for my future. I don't want a future. I am a failure. I just let everyone down.
