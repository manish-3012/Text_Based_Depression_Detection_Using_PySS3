All I want for Christmas is... Death.I already have a rope ready go and have studied the art of tying the perfect knot so that I would die quickly and painlessly, heck I wouldn't mind dying painfully as long as it gets the job done. 

But you might be wondering whether I have the appropriate place for hanging or (k)not? I do, I have already scouted it out. Now this kind of thing must work the first time I try it, due to the virtue of me living with others.

So, if this goes well you won't hear from me ever again!!! Isn't that great? However, if I became a chicken you will have to hear me complain. 

So, hopefully for you and for me this will be my last goodbye! Hope you're all having a great Christmas! Don't let my potential death bum you out!
