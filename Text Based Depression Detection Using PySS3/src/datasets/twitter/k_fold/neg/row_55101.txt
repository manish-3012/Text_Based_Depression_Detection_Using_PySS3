I don't think I'll do it, but I've thought a lot about how I would.First, I'd either sell or donate almost everything I own. I don't want my family to have to clean out my apartment and try to figure out what to do with all my stuff. I'd advertise it as a moving sale on Craigslist and leave any money I made to my family for the expenses. There are a few special things I'd leave behind for certain family members or friends - things with a special meaning or that have been in the family for a long time.

I'd make sure my credit card was paid off and my rent was paid through the end of my lease. Have my electric and internet services shut off. I'd verify that my brother was set up as the beneficiary on all of my assets. I'd even wait until after I file my taxes so no one has to worry about that. Even try to wrap up anything pending at work.

And I'd write letters to my closest family and friends. I know nothing I can say will take their pain away, but hopefully I'll at least be able to give them a little bit of closure. I'll keep it sort of vague - I don't want them to know the full depth of my depression and despair, or the traumas I've endured. It'll be more about how much I love them, and how sorry I am. How it's not their fault, but this was the only option.

I would try to do it in a way that wouldn't inconvenience or traumatize others. I think jumping in front of a train would be quick and easy, but it would affect hundreds or thousands of other people. Maybe I could overdose. It shouldn't be too hard to find some heroin in my neighborhood. I've never used before so it shouldn't take too much.

But I won't do it. I'm too tired. I'm too tired to live and too tired to die. So I'll just stay here, not quite alive, not quite dead, just ... existing.
