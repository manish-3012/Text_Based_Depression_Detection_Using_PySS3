Feeling useless and suicidal after doing something goodToday was supposed to be a wonderful day. I got my driving license on my first try thanks to all the effort and support received from my loved ones. I felt so overwhelmed with joy that it felt like i could explode.

But the feeling lasted very few hours. I'd say minutes.

I feel empty. I just want to cry and die. Even though I surpassed all my expectations with the driving issue, it feels like that was just what I was supposed to do, and anything less than than would be shameful -this meaning, there was no reason to be happy to begin with. I think that all this time I was just trying to suppress these feelings only to achieve what I was supposed to, and now, there's nothing to do.

I stopped talking with so many people only to stay focused. This feels so much like a relapse, but this time it's going full speed. Feels as if i wanted to postpone my suicide, using the driving subject as an excuse.
