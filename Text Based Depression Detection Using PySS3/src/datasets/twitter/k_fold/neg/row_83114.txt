My last hope(?)I'm not sure where exactly to post this, but I really need to write it somewhere before I go crazy.

My last hope at this point is going to the psych ward and I'd really like to go there because if I don't I might attempt to do something again. Except since I'm a minor, I'd need my parents to call there and everything so they'd take me in. My parents don't know about how I feel and I'm scared to tell them. While my mom is partly the reason why I feel this way, I know that she already has a lot of her own problems and I'd just make everything worse by talking to her about it. Plus, she's the type who sees mental illnesses and things like that as something that's 'all just in your head' so if I'd tell her, she'd probably just laugh it off or something. My dad probably wouldn't do much about it either.

I really don't know what to do anymore. Nothing brings me joy anymore, nothing makes me happy and I don't see a reason to live anymore. But I really want to give this a try before I attempt to kill myself again. I just don't know how to ask for help since I'm scared that the only response I'd get is that I'd get laughed at. 

I'm not sure if I worded any of this correctly, I'm too tired to think at this point so I'm sorry if this whole post is pointless, I just needed to let it out somewhere.
