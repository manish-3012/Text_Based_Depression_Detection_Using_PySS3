why am i even here. what is driving me forward.i mean i havenâ€™t finished watching avatar yet. and i have a concert to attend in november. thats it really. 

i guess my responsibilities are driving me forward. even though i never bother to complete them. college meetings, school work. the constant flow of meaningless tasks convinces me that i have something worthwhile to do with my time. i think if it werenâ€™t for these i would be dead already. but i also think without these i would be happier. 

people have seen the red flags. ive isolated myself from everyone i used to talk to. no one reaches out anymore. i have huge callouses on my knuckles from forcing myself to vomit up my food. i have deep scars running across my arm. i get asked about those a lot. i get a lot of weird glances. people know, or at least they suspect something. so that suicide awareness stuff they repeated over the loudspeakers that one week in september is meaningless. the posters on the school walls, broadcasting that same idiotic number over and over again, are meaningless. the suicide awareness bracelet they gave me at lunch one day. they watched me put it on. they saw the rubber glide over those red scars. they stared but no one said a word. at least they try to act like they care, i cant blame them. 

and i cant. because its all my fault. i have no drive or motivation. my goals are just daydreams. i will never find them in the physical world because ive never tried to catch them. to hold onto them, even. they drift past in my head.  i gaze at them passively from the grass because i dont have it in me to stand up and reach for them

im really bad at ending statements, like i am at writing conclusions for essays. but ill save this in my drafts to write down in my suicide note sometime in the future
