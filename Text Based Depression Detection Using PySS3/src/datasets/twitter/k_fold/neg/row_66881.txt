no dreamso my girlfriend has told me i need to get have a dream to be successful. currently i live with my parents, and have a 10 hour a week minimum wage job, pity employed by my father. i registered in four classes, and i can't pick up a book and read it. i just don't care. i drink every night, and smoke cannibus/tabacco occasionally. 
i hate being around people. i'm very insecure. no one really knows how i feel. i'm bipolar 2.

if i had a dream it would to be not employed, sit in my own house[so no one could bother me], with the blinds closed. and i would just lie there, alone. i wouldn't even want a  girlfriend. i would just want to be by myself doing nothing. similar to what i do now, masterbate all day and get drunk alone every night. i'm tired of life. so i want to cut the enviable and die. guns are cheap
