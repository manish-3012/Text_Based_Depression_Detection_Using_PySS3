minor inconvenience at work and Iâ€™m at the bridge. Iâ€™m tired of always being treated like a last option, like all Iâ€™m good for is filling in the gaps.Iâ€™ve realized that my life will always suck and Iâ€™ll never be happy so why stick around ? just because it can get better doesnâ€™t mean it will. what if it gets worse? I donâ€™t want to live to find out. Iâ€™m here at the bridge and it can be over in seconds. just one step and I can sleep in peace forever. I tried calling my mom because she usually helps me calm down but she didnâ€™t answer and I feel so alone. I feel like a failure and death is the only way to fix that. Iâ€™m just waiting for some people to leave so I can go in peace. Iâ€™ve had many close calls but I think this time itâ€™s foreal.
