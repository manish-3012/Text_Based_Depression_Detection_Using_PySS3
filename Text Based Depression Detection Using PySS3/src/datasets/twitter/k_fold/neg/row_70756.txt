i want to blow my brains outmy friends and i parted away

i have no best friend

i used to lie to myself that i enjoy solitude
well it's getting excessive now

i feel like the creature in frankenstein
has to endure the endless isolation

the worst part is that
i am the problem and my own punishment.
