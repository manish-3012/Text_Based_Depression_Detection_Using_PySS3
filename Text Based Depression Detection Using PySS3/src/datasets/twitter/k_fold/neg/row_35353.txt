Tired, but I can't sleepMy fiance sleeps next to me, and all I want to do is get up and hang myself.....but I can't do that to him, or my mom....and everyone else who cares and loves me.  I wish they wouldn't.  
It would be so easy too.  Him dead asleep, wouldn't hear anything....but imagining him waking up to find me, hurts worse then the want to kill myself.
I don't know how long I can keep this up.
