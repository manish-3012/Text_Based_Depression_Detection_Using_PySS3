How to tell how serious my friend is when telling me she wants to commit suicide.I was with my friend and we were taking pills together, the kind of pills that make people open up, she makes an everyday effort to appear happy to everyone else and bottle her feelings up, and she told me that when she's older shes going to kill her self, even if the likelihood of her killing her self is zero, how do I get her to express her self in a way that will actually relieve some of her depression, I know I can't do it all but she already told me she'd never see a therapist ever, she's told me she was sexually abused when she was 10 years old and all the stuff that would cause chronic depression in someone, but she considers crying a weakness and hasn't done it in a while what do I do?
