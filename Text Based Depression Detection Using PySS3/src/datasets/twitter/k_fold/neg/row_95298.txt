It's going to be tonightCurrent mission is to drink enough to build up the bravery to finally kill myself. Probably about halfway there. Anything I should worry about before that? I don't have a will or anything but once I'm dead it won't really be my problem anymore. A bit worried about my roommate but he's not working right now anyways and won't really have a problem finding somewhere else to go. I kind of want to write notes, specially because I'll feel horrible about hurting my mom, but I can't take it anymore and I don't want to stick around any longer than I need to. I've lost almost everything I care about and don't really see the point in sticking around anymore. I didn't ask to be alive and life's basically just telling me to fuck off at this point anyways.
