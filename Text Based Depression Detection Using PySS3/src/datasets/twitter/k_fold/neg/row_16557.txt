Itâ€™s nearly Christmas and I want to kill myself but my sis birthday is coming and I donâ€™t want to ruin itIâ€™ve been having a hard time coping in the new normal, I couldnâ€™t grasp the lessons. They told me iâ€™m only freshmen college and iâ€™m having fails. My mom just told me I can just stop and sell my body and some sort. I donâ€™t feel good. I survive suicide 2x (overdose) without anyone of them knowing it and my failed attempts. 

Itâ€™s nearly Christmas, my sis birthday is on 20th. I have been feeling on the edge and wanting to end it all. And my family kept pressuring me. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I wanted to die right now, been searching ways how to. Nothing in this house helps me, every actions done, every words that were spouted, it doesnâ€™t help me at all. No one even tries in this house. I donâ€™t want anything at all but for me to be done.
