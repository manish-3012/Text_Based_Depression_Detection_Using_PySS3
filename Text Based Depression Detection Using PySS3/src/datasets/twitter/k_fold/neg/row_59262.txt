I think I'm doneI dont think anyone who actually knows me would care about this, I dont think anyone reading this does either, so I'm sorry; I really need to get this out. 

I'm just done being too good and not enough at the same time; I'm tired of being the "genius, if only you put in a little more effort", I'm tired of being the "most wonderful person" someone's ever met and then being too much to handle, I'm tired of trying to pretend I'm not hurting and I'm okay, I'm tired of living with this stupid face I wear in front of everyone, I'm tired of having to be okay. 

There's so much to remember; I've spent my entire life trying to make memories with people so that I wouldnt be forgotten, and all these memories are haunting me. Every night. Every day. Every time I look at myself in the mirror, every time I think of all the times I tried my best to be enough but wasnt. I'm just not. I know that. Im just a stupid idiot who keeps hoping the next time is different when I know it's not going to be. 

I was on a trip this time last year, I remember going to bed every night praying that I get to end things on a high, I knew my downfall was coming; it always comes. I dont miss him, I miss having a home, I miss belonging, I miss having something to look forward to after my shift ends. Now it's just an empty room, wasted space that I wont leave my mark on.

There's so much I'm holding on to, and I swear I tried to be strong, I swear I did. I wanted to prove to you that things get better. But I dont think they do. Not for me. 

I'm sorry for rambling. But I think tonight's it for me; the sky is cloudy and I cant see the moon, but the wind feels nice. I would have loved to be able to reach out to a welcoming sky; but I guess not even the night wants to deal with me. 

I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. It's too much. I'm not strong enough. I'm sorry.
