Can I post here without being institutionalized again?Last time I posted here (over 2 years ago) someone called the admins or something and the police came to my house and institutionalized me for a week, just cause I admitted to wanting to die. How am I supposed to talk freely if I'm afraid of being committed again? Is that still a thing people do here? Because it doesn't help.
