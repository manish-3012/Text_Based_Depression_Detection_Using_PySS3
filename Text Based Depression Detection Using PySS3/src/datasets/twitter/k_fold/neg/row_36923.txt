I cant even describe my situation anymore.But maybe lyrics can:

"Every day I awake
I await my fate as the sky turns blue to grey
Now I understand it might be my last day
Might be my last day
Now I understand it might be my last day
Might be my last day

So what am I supposed to do now I've reached the end?
And if I gained another chance, would you still be there?"
-Asking Alexandria - Gone (Black Album)

It seems to describe my situation better than the worthless piece of me is able to..
