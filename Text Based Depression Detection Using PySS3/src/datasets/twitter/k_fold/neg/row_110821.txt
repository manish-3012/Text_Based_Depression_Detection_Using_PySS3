I really want to dieI won't do anything to myself because of my boyfriend but I wish I was single. Then I could just kill myself.

My family thinks I'm a 'troublemaker'. I just can't seem to get with the program. I am obese when they are healthy. I am selfish when they are selfless and I complain where they just move on with life.

I think my family will be sad but they'll just go 'oh well' and move on. People I used to be friends with will do the same. Current friends will feel really bad, but most people will just think 'well we reached out but couldn't help her cos she didn't try hard enough'. They won't realize that they are judgemental and toxic.

I'm on psychiatric medication. I go for therapy. None of it helps. 

I don't think I'll ever be happy. I have an exam soon. I can't study because I can't sleep so I can't concentrate. I can't fail. If I fail I'll be stuck living here another year and I just can't do it. I can't pass if I don't study though. It's a real mess. Even if I do pass, I can't imagine ever being happy.

Maybe I'll be lucky and get the coronavirus and die. That way I don't have to kill myself.
I just hope I won't infect others if that does happen.
