15 and contemplating suicideSo my life has been messed up since I was 5, court battles, mother with mental issues, I have mental issues. My step dad killed himself in my basement while I was home when I was 12, he left behind my brother. My dad and I donâ€™t speak anymore. But right now I just.. I donâ€™t know. I have no friends, Iâ€™m a dropout because I got bullied far too much. I mean Iâ€™ve quit self harming, Which is good. But right now my mom has kicked me out. She said sheâ€™ll call the police if I come back. She just gave birth to a new baby a couple days ago and I havenâ€™t even met him. Heâ€™s my half brother. And Iâ€™m crying because I need to see my two brothers the most. My fucking other family can, but I canâ€™t. IM 15!! Iâ€™m a god damn teenager! This has to be illegal, social services was in our lives and they said LEGALLY I have to stay with my mom. I have nobody, my life is down the drain. All I do is cry and cry and cry. All I want is to see my brothers, Iâ€™m staying with my grandma right now, she basically raised me but for some reason, deep down I miss my mother. Sheâ€™s told me to kill myself, to fuck off, how she hates me. Iâ€™m not sure if I can take this anymore. All I do is smoke weed to make me happy. I know thatâ€™s not good but what else do I have? My grandpa has abused me before, bruises. My mother is basically my sister since she got pregnant at 15. Sheâ€™s 31 and obviously Iâ€™m turning 16. I donâ€™t know man, fuck my life.
