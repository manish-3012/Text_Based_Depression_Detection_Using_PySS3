My biggest fear is people reassuring me that what I think of myself is the truthI'm so scared of disappointing people I'm constantly trying to alter my personality and behaviour around them so they enjoy my company. I have no idea who I actually am and if what I'm doing right now is what I like to do or just what I do because I feel like people expect me to like it.

 I don't know who I am and I don't care for myself. I feel like I'm only here for others and if I am to disappoint them I lose my right to live. I'm scared people will reject me if I show my real self whatever that might be
