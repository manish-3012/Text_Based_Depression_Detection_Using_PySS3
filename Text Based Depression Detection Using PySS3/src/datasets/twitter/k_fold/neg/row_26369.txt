just a story.When i was 10 year of age my father had an accident in the shower, he slipped and cracked his skull. During the time that he was in the hospital the Doctors found that he had a brain tumour the size of a baseball, the worried that it might be cancerous, so they tried to remove it. For the most part it was a success, however during the sugary he had a stroke along his right side. when he was released from the hospital we noticed that he had changed, quite a bit, it was because the tumour they removed was in the area of the brain that stores who you are (at least thats how i understand it). That was very devastating for me and my family because he was completely different and we had to morn his lose and learn to love this new man that came in his stead. Because of the fact that he was different over the next six years my parents relationship grew cold. they both no longer loved each other and felt it would be for the best to get a divorce. not only that but it turns out that my mother and my dads best friend were falling for each other. I am now 16 years old, live in an apartment with my unemployed father, away from my 4 siblings and mother felling hopeless and hurt. i don't know who to turn to. so the only logical thing to do would be of course to post it on the internet. i don't think i will take my life though, mostly because i worry about what my friends and parents would think, but also because I'm to afraid. The point of this post is because i just want some encouraging words. thank you for your time.
