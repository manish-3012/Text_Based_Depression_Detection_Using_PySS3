I feel like a leper.Everyone avoids me, Everyone cancels plans. Everyone gives me the "why the fuck doesn't she just leave" look. I blame it on my weight, because a lot of times I think I'm pretty damn cool, but lately I've been wondering if I'm a fucking weirdo and nobody will tell me. I've tried so hard to improve myself, but it's just hard when I know I'm only doing it so people will like me.
