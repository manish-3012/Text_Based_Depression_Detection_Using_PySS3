Living is pain, existence is pain. The only happiness I feel now is knowing that itâ€™ll all be over soon.Just for some backstory, Iâ€™m a 14 year old boy from Ontario, Canada. I have a relatively good life, great marks, great friends, good parents. Despite all this I seriously contemplate suicide almost all day. The only chance I had to kill myself I blew it by calling a suicide hotline. They called the cops who took me to a psychiatric hospital. I feel bad for my family because they have to deal with me. I lied to my therapist so it seems like Iâ€™m ok. I want to die so much but I donâ€™t have the chance to for about 5 more months. My only happiness is knowing that eventually Iâ€™ll have a chance to end it all. Sorry about my formatting, Iâ€™m sure nobody wants to read a wall of text.
