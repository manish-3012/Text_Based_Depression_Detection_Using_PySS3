It would be so easy to just end it if people would stop caring about meI have depression since I've been 14 years old (I am 21 now) and I thought about suicide a lot in those years and now it's starting to kick back in.

All I want is to let go. I feel like I can't handle anything society wants me to do. I was a shut-in most of my life, a complete introvert, but that changed a bit after I entered university, I made a lot of friends without even trying (and it kind of bothers me, actually). It would be so easy to just go if those people wouldn't exist or just stop about caring about me. My parents care. My brother cares. My friends care. 

And I hate it. 

All I can think about is killing myself right now. For the last months. It got so bad that I can't even think straight anymore. I can't concentrate. It got so bad that my studies at my university are a complete train-wreck without any hope to recover. I won't and I'm not able to finish my bachelor. 

But... since I know people care about me, I can't bail. I just can't "run away". I don't want to hurt anyone. I know I would. And that's why I hate myself, because I just can't stop caring! That's why I will go to therapy in the next months, that's why I still pretend that everything's alright, that's why I will do a fresh start in another field in my university. And I hate it.

I do so much to pretend that I am still alive inside, because I don't want to hurt the people surrounding me. It hurts.. all I want is to let go.
