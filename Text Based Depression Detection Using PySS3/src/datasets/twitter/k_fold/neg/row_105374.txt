Covid induced suicidal thoughtsHi all,

Just to clarify (sad I feel I need to...): I'm not new to suicidal thoughts. I've had suicidal tendencies for a while and been treated on several occasions.

BUT FUCK.

I'm so over this. I'm so so over this. How do I get through this now? When I'm told this is the new normal? When I found life before this so hard anyway and now it's even more bleak? 

I need this to stop. I know that's not unique or special, but I can't deal with this any more.

Lots and lots and lots of love to anyone feeling the same xxx
