I just can't fucking take it anymore.My friend died, and nobody told me for months. my partner is so fucking selfish and doesn't even care about me, all he cares about is himself and making sure everyone pities him and doesn't force him to do anything he doesn't want to do because hes a delicate wittle twauma baby, which includes actually giving a shit about me and physically being there for me. He made me cope with my mother's death all alone and screamed at me for cheating after I got raped. All using the fact his mother never loved him as an excuse. All he fucking cares about is being able to tell people he knew in high school that he has a girlfriend so they don't think he's a complete loser. He never spends time with me. Right now he's in another country and keeps lying to me about coming to see me. He's pretending he's 30 minutes away from me because he thinks I'm stupid. Nobody else will ever care about me because I have a personality disorder that makes me fundamentally unloveable. I'm also fucking ugly, which even my partner admitted to recently.  
I work a deadend nightshift job that's really hard on my body and live with someone who doesn't respect me and eats half of my food every week. I'm broke and my only family members who are still alive don't give a single shit about me. Everyone I love keeps fucking dying.  
I have fucking no one. No therapy, no friends, no caring family, no loving partner. Absolutely nothing. I can't go to a hospital because I would lose my job and my life would suck even more.  
I can't fucking take it anymore. I've known for years I was better off dead. People spent so long screaming at me that it gets better WHEN IT DOESN'T. all it ever did was get worse and worse and worse and worse and all I want to do now is die. I have no drive to do anything but kill myself. I can't even afford help. So fucking fuck it.
