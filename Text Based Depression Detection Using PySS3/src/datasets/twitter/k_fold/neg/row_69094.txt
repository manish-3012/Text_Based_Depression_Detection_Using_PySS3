What happens if it happens again?After many years of fighting off intrusive thoughts and depression, a little less than three months ago I finally lost a battle and made a serious attempt on my own life. Serious enough that other people had to resuscitate me. It was still definitely a "cry for help," though - I texted a lot of people before I did it so people could find me.

I don't want to die. I just lost a fight with some other part of me that isn't me.

But now I'm really scared, because things have gotten so much worse. Most of my family has stopped talking to me after calling me an asshole for what I did. The small circle of friends I had are completely gone. My wife kicked me out of the house and only let me back two weeks later after begging her.

I feel very, very isolated. I reached out for help and almost everyone that I thought cared about me just turned on me so quickly. They're allowed to be mad I guess. But now they've all just gone.

I haven't healed or gotten better at all. I'm barely hanging on. And I don't even have the support system I thought I did last time. I don't know what to do. It's going to happen again.
