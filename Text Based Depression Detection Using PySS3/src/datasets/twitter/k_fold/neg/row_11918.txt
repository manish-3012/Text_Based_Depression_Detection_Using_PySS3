Why am I not doing it...?I have been depressed for long periods of time a few times already. This is the 3rd time that has been several months... I have been really depressed for roughly 4 months at this point. The past 3 weeks have been especially rough. In the last two weeks I lost about 7kg because I just havent been eating... I was planning on killing myself this weekend. I have tried in the past. But for some reason I just didnt do it... I have felt worse than I have in a long time today. I cried several times today and didnt get out of bed. At one point I just cried for almost 3 hours straight... I dont know if I was scared or if I think it will get better or maybe something else... I still think about suicide. I am thinking about it right now... Why didnt I just do it...? Only explenation I really have, is because I dont own a gun. I always think about using one of those... Is it normal to be picky about how you kill yourself...?
 
Its almost 3:30 am and I am confused and feeling absolutely horrible and alone....
