A reason to liveI want one solid reason to keep going, a purpouse for which to wake up tomorrow and smile, something to work towards. But regardless of what i want is have nothing, no dreams, no passions, no friends, no relationship or relations in general.  


Also i suffer from a gabling addiction that i'm trying my gosh darn hardest to fight, even now and then it fucks me really good but overall i am managing it better with time.  


Also depression and Bipolar, what can i say.. a bundle of joy.
