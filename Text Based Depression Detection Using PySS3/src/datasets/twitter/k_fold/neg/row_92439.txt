I feel like I have nothing to live for.This is a throwaway account, for obvious reasons. I've been wanting to post for a long time here, so here goes. I have no future, in any career path anywhere. I have the worst grades at my school, and am known as "the dumb one". I'm stuck at an extremely rigorous school, only there because my dad wants to spite the rest of my family. I've looked into it, with what I have now, I cannot get into college, period. I have no future anywhere. There are a multitude of other reasons, but I don't want to get into it. I hate everything about me, who I am, and my life in general.
