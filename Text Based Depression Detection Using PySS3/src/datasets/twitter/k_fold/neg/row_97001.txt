My life is ruled by fear and I want it to endI donâ€™t even know anymore.  Iâ€™m afraid to tell my therapist anything Iâ€™m actually thinking bc I think sheâ€™ll get me locked up in a psychiatric hospital, which would ruin my social life and take away the last ounce of dignity and self-respect I possess.  Iâ€™m afraid to trust anyone cause I know Iâ€™ll just get hurt in the end.  Iâ€™m afraid to hope for anything because I know Iâ€™ll just be disappointed.  Iâ€™m afraid of everything and its paralyzing.  Iâ€™m miserable.

I canâ€™t see any point in life anymore.  Really itâ€™s just a matter of time, and of getting over my fear of death.
