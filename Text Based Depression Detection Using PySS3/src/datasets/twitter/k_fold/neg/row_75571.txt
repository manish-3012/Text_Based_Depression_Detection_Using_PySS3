Overdoseing didnâ€™t kill me but caused me nerve damage and now I wanna die even moreI have constant pain in my feet due to overdosing caused me to have PN nerve damage . Now I wanna die more I read about PN and a lot of people lost the ability to walk after a while. Before overdoseing I had many reasons to die and now I have even more . Iâ€™m so depressed because even I thought about wanting to get better whatâ€™s the point if I would have PN at such a young age it literally ruins every chance of living and hope and future that I didnâ€™t have in the first place . I want to kill myself without failing Iâ€™m so scared to fail again how can I die fast im in constant pain not only mentally like it used to be ,  but physically too.
