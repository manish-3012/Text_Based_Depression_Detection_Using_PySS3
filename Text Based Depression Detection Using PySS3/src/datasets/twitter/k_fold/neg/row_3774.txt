URGENT friend in another country may have tried to commit suicide/be trying right nowI looked on the sidebar/FAQ etc for info but I couldn't find anything. Sorry if it's there, I skimmed really quick because I'm panicking/rushing

At around midnight my best friend logged off all her social media sites and turned off her phone. She left a few messages saying that she was hoping to not wake up tomorrow and that she wants to die. I wouldn't be worrying this much if it wasn't for the fact that her phone still hasn't been turned on and she hasn't made any other post on any of her social media accounts. She hasn't even gotten on skype which she does at the same time (3pm) every single day. 

She has been struggling with extreme depression and suicidal thoughts which has only been getting worse the past few weeks. I am so so so worried that because of something bad that happened yesterday (sorry I can't give details) that she may have have tried/be trying to commit suicide. I have no idea what to do since I don't live in the same country as her (she's in America, I'm in Canada.) If there is anything at all you guys know that I can do *please* please tell me, if there's a hotline I can call or something... anything at all. I have never been more scared that she actually would go through with this. Any help at all is appreciated!! Thank you!

Note: She is a legal adult. I don't have her address/city written down, I only know her name, her job, etc
