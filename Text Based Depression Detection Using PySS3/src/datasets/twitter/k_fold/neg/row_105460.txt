Being a drama queen.So I just felt super overwhelmed that I decided to just vent here lol
Is it bad that I just want it to all end? People are going through so much hardship and here I am acting like a little b*tch just Because of a few emotions.
Iâ€™m losing everyone around me and Iâ€™m causing it. Just because I canâ€™t trust them and scared I might just get hurt again. I opened myself up only to feel like I meant nothing to them. Just feel used and feel like no one cares. 
When I try to go out and i donâ€™t know.. be â€˜normalâ€™ I just feel overwhelmed like Iâ€™m not needed and whatâ€™s the point. 
I just want it to all end. I feel worthless and useless. Just a waste of space.
