this doesn't make any sense sorrygod this is like impossible to explain but i'll try i guess. this is probably going to make no sense and be kind of hard to read so sorry in advance!!!!!!!?????  
this doesn't make sense but i feel like i don't exist. like i feel like i'm not even a real person and it's literally impossible for me to be anything that i want to be and i'm just this weird non-existent group of blobs floating around in space and like half the time my brain is full of cotton candy and it's just going going going and i can't stop screaming and skipping around and singing and i want to DO STUFF and then the other half of the time i can hardly get out of bed and i literally can't function at all  
like i feel like my brain is broken and everything about me is fake and like.....just not ME, it's just this weird fake thing that i can't make any sense of and i don't know anything about myself  
like sometimes i get like the violent urge to kill myself and it's like this weird swelling feeling in my chest and i scream and cry and rip my hair out and then other times like now my brain just feels like it's going to melt and everything feels fuzzy and fake and i just vaguely want to die  
as melodramatic as it sounds i know i'm not going to live much longer because i can't go on like this because i can't be anything close to the person i want to be and everyone hates me and my life is worthless, i'm just this weird fake thing and my life is going nowhere and i literally contribute nothing to society and my brain won't stop jumping around in my head  
idk i know this probably makes zero sense or makes me sound like i'm on drugs or something but the things that go on in my head are just making no sense and i can't figure out anything that;s going on and idk. i just feel like i'm dissolving slowly and sooner than later i'm just going to be this weird husk and i'm going to float away one night while i'm sleeping and no one will ever see me again.  
ok. sorry. i know this is nonsense but i just wanted to write it out somewhere. i dont know if anyone will relate to this at all but you never know.
