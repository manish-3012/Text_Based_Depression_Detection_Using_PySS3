Depression is kicking my ass.I have an unsafe living situation. I had to remove myself and both of my pets from my home. This is causing me a ridiculous amount of depression and anxiety, and I'm really having a hard time. I have been forcing myself to not self-harm, but it's really challenging. There's nothing more that I want to do than cut myself. I find myself thinking, often, about suicide. I made an appointment with a therapist, but the soonest they can get me in is Monday.

 Right now, the only person that I can talk to about this is my boyfriend, but I don't want to scare him. He's really happy that I'm trying to get help, and he's been so supportive. He's understandably very worried about me, and I feel bad for making him worry. I don't know how to get myself out of this mindset.
