.I've thought about her every minute of every day for years. I've imagined every social scenario with her a million times. I've not spoken to her for a year, but I treasured the memories of the few times I did and when I could see her in person. I have a million pictures of her saved, I stalk every social media account I could find and everything attached to it every day just to absorb as much of her as I can. She's going away forever soon and I'll never see her again. It's not just been a passing fancy, I love every part of her more than anything. Not being able to be with her has made me lose my friends, my study and everything else in my life over the past few years, and I have nothing else to fall back on. 

I can't deal with not having her. Every instrument in my brain tells me she was and is the future and the only way I'll ever feel happy. As much as you can tell me this is what I need to change, I know by feel this is true. There is no ecstasy I've felt better than when she's looked at me smiling.

If it's over with no goodbye and no way I can reach her it's it. I'm hanging with my belt. Maybe then she'll finally know and I'll be a part of her wherever she is.
