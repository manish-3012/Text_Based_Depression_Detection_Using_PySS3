Iâ€™m not suicidal but..I just found out an hour ago, another one of my friends committed suicide. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m drowning all over again. Her birthday is on November 4th. She wouldâ€™ve been 20. I struggle with depression as well, I have friends who do too... I lost on of my best friends last year on Nov. 15 downing two bottles of pills to slow her heart. Her birthday wouldâ€™ve been on December 24th and she wouldâ€™ve been turning 18. She was the baby of the group, we graduated high school in 2018. Iâ€™m so angry. Sad. And lost. My friends mean so much to me.
