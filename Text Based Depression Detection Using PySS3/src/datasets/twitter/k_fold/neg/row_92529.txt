Please someone just kill me. I want the pain to end!!!Does anybody else get that feeling in their chest that they need to kill themselves. It almost feels physical. It feels so horrible, I can't stand it!!! I'm sick of feeling it everyday, when will it end. Can it end? The pain makes me want to shoot myself every time I feel it and I probably would if I had a gun next to me. I can't live the rest of my life like this!
