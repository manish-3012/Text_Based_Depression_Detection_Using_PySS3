This is fucking it.I'm sitting here.  My weapon is next to me.  I have three fucking dollars.  A degree in English.  No job.  No prospects.  No gas.  No food.  And the loan company just took my last food money for their BULL FUCKING SHIT that they told me I wouldn't have to pay this month.

I have nobody to love, nobody to hold me, no weed to smoke, and I'm typing so hard that I doubt my fucking keyboard will even last long enough to talk.  So, give me the fucking reason.  Give me the fucking reason I should draw one more breath.  No fucking games, no bull shit, you tell me, what is the purpose of going through this much pain, crying and breaking my teeth with stress, and being bullied by every motherfucker in this world with any semblance of affluence just because THEY FUCKING CAN?  WHY?

Why the FUCK should I even consider not plunging this into mu throat RIGHT THE FUCK NOW?
