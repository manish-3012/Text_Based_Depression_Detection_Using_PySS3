hesitant about posting...I am hesitant about posting here but I feel that perhaps I should in case I end up doing something stupid, this is a note of sorts. 

While I aspire to study philosophy next year at uni, there's something on the inside that tells me that there is no meaning. I'm Christian too, to add to the contradictory nature of my mental illness. 

I used to be an extremely studious person and yet tomorrow I write an exam (and the day after that too) and I honestly haven't even started to prepare. 

I have experienced a lot of loss throughout childhood and I am currently in a household where there is a lot of emotional abuse (slowly it's getting better as the person in question is receiving therapy). 

The truth is, people, don't get what they deserve. While the saying that I lived by "treat others as you want to be treated" has aided me in helping others it has slowly murdered my soul. Those who hurt others I've seen live the lives people they have hurt dream of living and those who are hurt don't deserve the hurt but the dream they don't receive. I understand jealousy is a negative emotion, but mixed with a want to die and a numb soul it inspires pain. 

Does the pain I'd cause matter more than the pain I'm experiencing? If this is what life is, being forced to enjoy the small things, then I don't want it. I don't know what to do anymore. 

Has anyone else wanted to do awful things to themselves and others to feel evil enough to deserve the pain? 

I understand I'm not alone, and I've even tried to help others in similar situations, however, I've never experienced such a fierce hunger to leave this place. 

I don't want to be someone else. I just want to be somewhere else. 

I truly love you all fellow Redditors,
