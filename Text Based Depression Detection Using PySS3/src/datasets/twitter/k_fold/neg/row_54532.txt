I really hate myselfI just hate myself, i am a pathetic human being, i am 24 years old i have done nothing at all with my life. I live in my mothers basement and i dont think i will ever be able to leave because i have no money and no prospects, I am the faliure of my family, my sister is the straight A person who is a dental assistant something something.
I am just fucked up i am not smart enough for any kind of post secondary, i have ADHD making studying or paying attention in a class next to impossible.
The suicidal thoughts have been getting alot worse since a year ago when i had to give my dog away, i rented a trailer where i could have her with me but i had t move out and i could not find another place that would allow me to have animals so i had to give her away, she was my only friend and i am so fucking alone now, i just hate life i dont want to be a failure and be alone for the rest of my life i would rather it was just all over.
ontop of that i am Asexual, not attracted to men or women so there is just another reason i will be alone forever i have no chance at a relationship in my life time.
i just want it over i cant take it anymore, i am just a weak person that is not able to cope with this adversities that normal people seem to be able to overcome.
