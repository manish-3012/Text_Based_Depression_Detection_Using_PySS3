I think I'm going to kill myself in the next few weeksI've always been a disappointment to many. My mom, my dad, my brother, my friends and especially to myself. I've always tried to become the best of myself but I'm sorry. I'm not good enough. I've just wasted the best opportunity I had in a long time. To everyone out there, don't do the same things I did
