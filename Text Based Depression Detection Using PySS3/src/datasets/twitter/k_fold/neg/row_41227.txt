Why canâ€™t I be good at anythingThe only thing Iâ€™m â€˜goodâ€™ at is guitar, but that doesnâ€™t matter because there are people better than me. Iâ€™m not smart because there are other people who are smarter than me. Iâ€™m definitely not attractive. I have 0 social life outside of school. Can I have ONE FUCKING THING GOD DAMN. I canâ€™t even get up to take a shower like the disgusting fucking loser I am. I hate living knowing that everyone is better than you.
