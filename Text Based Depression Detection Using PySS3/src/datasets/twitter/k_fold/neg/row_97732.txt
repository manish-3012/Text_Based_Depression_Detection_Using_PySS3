I feel ...pathetic.I really don't know what to say other than I want to die. I don't only because of not wanting my girlfriend to be the one to find me. I'm almost 30 years old and I really have no future for myself. I've thrown away my chances at getting an education going to shitty local 2-year degree schools and dropping out half way through for various reasons. Those loans have now gone into default and there is nothing I can do about it. And I can't go back to these schools again because I don't have or make enough money to be able to. 

Every time I get a job I manage to fuck it up somehow. Either I call out too much or I say the wrong thing to piss the wrong people off. I've never even made more than $10 an hour in my whole life. This certainly does not help my work ethic. It's completely down the drain ever since I've become more and more depressed.  I feel so pathetic for not having ever been able to support myself without the help of someone else.

It's only a matter of time before my girlfriend leaves me. Every day that she stays with me is just one more day of her putting her life on hold for me. It's not fair to her.

So, yes, I want to die. There is no positive outcome in my future.
