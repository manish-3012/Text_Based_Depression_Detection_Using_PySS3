Thanks for helpNot sure what username I used but I came here four month ago because my 13 yr old was suicidal.  She is a little better now.  She seems much better, but I,know itâ€™s two steps forward one back.  

Two things helped:

1.  Genetic testing and finding a depression anxiety med that actually worked.  So if you have tried meds and they failed you, consider it.  The first med made it so much worse.  The one the testing indicated helped.

2.  When she was bad she found a friendship with a supportive person.  He had become a sexual predator.  Luckily he was only an internet person, but I found it 3 weeks ago and the police are seeking him now.  He was an adult man and beginning to talk about meeting.  She felt powerless to end it, worried she would be in trouble and was stuck.  She has bounced back a lot being separated from this.  

I guess I want to tell you minors on here. If something is going on that is a secret from your adults.  If they are sane, TELL SOMEONE.  It wil, suck for a minute, no doubt.  But we can help.  What you are imagining will happen when we find out, is usually so much worse than what happened.  

Thanks for your support a while back.  It really helped me keep a grip. Some of you said you wanted me to be your mom.  Thanks, thinking to say something like that makes you someone Iâ€™d want as my kid.
