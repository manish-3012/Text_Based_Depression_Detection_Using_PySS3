I just hope there's someone I could to, share my feelings withI have a loving family but everytime I talk my heart out things get covered up. I've been suicidal on and off. Hopefully I'm going to get married in an year or two. I want to end it all before I get married so that I don't spoil my future wife's life. I know for sure that I will die by suicide, I'm just waiting for that moment. I also sincerely wish I'd have someone to talk to, someone I can pour my heart out to. :/ I have no clue what's going on. Everything is going on in autopilot mode. 

Thank you for reading kind stranger :)
