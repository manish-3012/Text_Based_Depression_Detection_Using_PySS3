Why does god take the people who want to live?I screamed and prayed to god to take my life cause i donâ€™t want to live anymore. Then i see people who wants to live and fight for their life die, when i just sit here wasting oxygen. I donâ€™t get it at all.

Its so unfair. I feel sad that people around you dies when you would gladly give your live for theirs. I would 100% sacrifice my life for someone elseâ€™s  chance to live. Im done with life and been done with it for a long time now. 

Im just to decent to take my life, cause i know that if i would take my life. All of the people who care about me would also give up, and i cant give that pain to people who tried to help me. Its not their fault that life wasnâ€™t made for me.
