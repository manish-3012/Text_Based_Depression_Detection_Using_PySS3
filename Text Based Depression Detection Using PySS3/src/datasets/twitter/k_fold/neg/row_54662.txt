My wife and I are breaking up, I left my previous wife in a hospital bed. I don't want to go there again but the feelings are so powerful. Please help.My last marriage ended with me trying to kill myself. It was a planned suicide. My current wife was there for me when I got out of the hospital. I felt like she was my life line. However much of our relationship feels forced. I am doing my best to hold it together right now. I think I am going to be in a place here soon where I need help. Around the time I split up with my ex I also lost all of my friends in the process. Now I have one really good friend who has been there for me but I'm tired of putting my stress on his shoulders..I already know what he will say. I wanna just be okay with this situation since she is at a friend's house getting drunk and will party away her problems. I can't do that. I'm running a business. Now I have to go to work tomorrow and deal with this at the same time. Frankly it's more than I can deal with on my own. Please help.
