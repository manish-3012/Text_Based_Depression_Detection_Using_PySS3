Since I can't leave my husband, maybe its time to go.I am really miserable.  I have been planning it for years, but really trying to hold out for my kid.  I know its selfish, but its pretty apparent to me that shes better off if I'm not here.  

My husband loves to talk about how his friends and men in general get fucked over when women leave them, and how the woman always gets everything.  Honestly I dont want anything.  When I've talk to him about leaving, I've told him he could have all of my military retirement, and when I am back on my feet I will send more.  But that's kind of a fantasy because there's nowhere for me to go.  Literally the plan is either a tent or a homeless shelter.  

None of it is good enough though.  He threatens that he will quit his job.  Throws in a guilt trip about our kid's quality of life being diminished.

My husband's father left when he was really young and he has talked about the lasting negative impact it had on him.  Its pretty evident that my actual presence will create a lasting negative impact on my kid though.  The only point to remaining alive is that my therapist says killing myself increases my kid's likelihood of suicide as well.  But it will be difficult to survive with nothing.  Theres no friend or family to stay with.  So what do I do?
