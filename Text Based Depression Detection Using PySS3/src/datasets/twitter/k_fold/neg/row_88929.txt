Don't know what title should i addTomorrow a meeting with parents is taking place and my dad will see my bad grades and how much i've been skipping classes, and can not wait to hear him insulting me, my mom looking at me like i murdered someone and i will probably get threatened with a knife or a fork again. i want to die so bad but i think of my little brother and my mom, it is funny because my mom was the one that told me i am a burden and that i should die, already knew that but it still hurt. The idea of going to work for the rest of my life after school is too much, i will be a slave 45 years of my life working for society, for the corrupts fuckers to steal the money from us, this world is not made for me and there are too many people on this planet already.
