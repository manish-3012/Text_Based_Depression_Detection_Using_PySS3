Sitting in my car in the garageThere's this idea that suicide is an irrational, spontaneous act.  But I can tell you, every time I put my car in the garage I think to myself, does that vent up at the top mean carbon monoxide poisoning wouldn't happen? Would the neighbors notice? Who would feed my cat? Poor thing, no one wants him either.

I'm not a teenager going through a breakup, I didn't just have a particularly bad day, I'm just a person who is gradually coming to an understanding that this is it, this is as good as it will get, and what is the point of extending this?

My particular religious path discourages this sort of thing, and that's really my biggest deterrent, but some days, that doesn't mean so much to me either. Today, I'm getting out of the car, going in the house and feeding the cat. But I kinda don't know why I am.
