I so fucking done.Laying in bed with my 4 month old sleeping on my chest and all I can think about it is ending it all.  I'm so tired. My husband is no fucking help. He was awake watching Yugioh  while this baby was crying and I was sleeping. But instead of helping he just watched his show and fell asleep. I'm so done!  He doesn't want to help. Fine I'm gonna go and he can do all the work and figure it the fuck out.  

I'm buying 4 bottles of 100 tablets of ibuprofen and downing that shit and taking a long bath with a razor blade tonight.  I want my physical and mental pain to end.  He has my brother and family to help him. They will be better off without me.
