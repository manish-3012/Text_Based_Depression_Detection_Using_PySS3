So, last year i was raped while drunk at a club in italy. Last week, i found out that this girl i went to middle school with, was raped by one of our classmates while she was drunk at another girls house party. And we were discussing the issue because the guy that did this, is one of the most attractive and popular guys in my city. A Chuck Bass if you will. And one of my friends said like â€œwhy did you have to tell me this? Youâ€™ve ruined him!â€ And idk that pissed me off so much. Like no. Sorry. Cant really rant on twitter bc she follows me there but how can I educate her on this?
