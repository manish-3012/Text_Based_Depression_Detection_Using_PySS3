Drug cravings and living in a shitholeMy life is a bad cartoon, that is the only reasonable explanation, I am craving drugs so bad right now I am shaking and my body feels â€œthirstyâ€ I feel like my skin is crawling all over and I want to throw up. I also live in a house with 5 roommates. And we all share two bedroom, I share a bedroom with three other people. Iâ€™m literally crying because of how much I miss inhalants, but instead I have to lie and say I am crying about my cat (who got hit on the road last week) fuck this shit, I hate myself, I want to just get High and sleep all day, I want to get High until I forget to eat and die, that would be the worldâ€™s greatest way to go out
