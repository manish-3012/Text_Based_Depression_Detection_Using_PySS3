Alone at rock bottom and rejected without fail for years on end. How am I still hereJust pulled a trigger on my skull the first time. The only 2 real friends I thought I had left in the world finally just abandoned me. Someone talk to me? I'm so incredibly sick of this endless stream of people who desert me for no apparent reason, with no explanation, right when I need them most

I've also had several lucid dreams about public suicide, and voices in my head trying to convince me to kill myself daily for years now. For some reason I've been fantasizing about playing Russian roulette every day until I die, which even I see is insane. I am so fucking lonely and exhausted of feeling this way. As time goes on, things just happen exactly the same way, and things feel increasingly hopeless.
