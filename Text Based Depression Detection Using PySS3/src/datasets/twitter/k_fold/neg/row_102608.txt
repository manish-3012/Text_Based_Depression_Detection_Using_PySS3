Week before college starts and I just want to kill myself alreadyLived basically my entire teen life with little to no friends or family. I never have anyone I can just talk to you know? I don't feel human anymore I just feel like such an outcast. I don't think anyone knows what it's like to not have people to talk to throughout your day to day life. I feel like I'm fucking broken. I don't know how to talk to people hold a conversation or even look people in the eye. I have no life experiences I can fondly look back on and I just feel more and more depressed as the days go on. I hate my personality, how I look, my socially awkwardness, how I let people use me for money because it's my only way of getting close to people who eventually just get tired of me. I just hate everything about myself and how my life's turned out. I know I'm young but I feel like a lost cause. I don't even have acquantainces I can add on social media for Christ's sake. I can't go to college like this and I just can't go on living life like this.
