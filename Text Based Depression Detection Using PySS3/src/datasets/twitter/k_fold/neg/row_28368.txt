Everything is set and ready to go...The wonderful thing about the human body is that it is so easy to end it all. I have always been a vain person, never wanting to cut myself in fear of the last results, thus my self harm has always been psychological. But here I sit with a razor blade in one hand making small inroads into my arm, two shirts to tie over my wrists, and a shower with scolding hot water to help fight against my blood clotting.

I just cannot do it anymore. This is my life, this is my suffering, therefore it should be my right to end it? And what point is there a reasonable time frame in which so much suffering has been had in which everyone involved can understand that this is the must humane way out? How many more days do I have to live for other persons rather then for the first time making a choice for myself, doing something to aliveate my own pain rather than prevent theirs?

No... no more. It has to end, it has to stop.
