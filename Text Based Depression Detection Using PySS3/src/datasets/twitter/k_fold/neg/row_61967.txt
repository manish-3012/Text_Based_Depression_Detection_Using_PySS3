New job anxiety is making it worseI haven't been able to stop thinking about killing myself for the past month+. It's not like that's completely new to me, but it's never been this bad or this frequent. I can't go an hour without thinking I should just end it and I can't focus on anything else.

Despite that I've been trying to find work so I can get away from my current living situation and try to get better. I start a new job tomorrow, first time I've worked in the last 5 years outside of sporadic commissioned artwork, and I'm absolutely sick with anxiety. I know a big part of it is being afraid of the newness of it and not knowing exactly what to expect and my fear of fucking up, but I'm terrified that this isn't going to be a good fit. It's sales with a lot of pressure to perform, and I'm absolutely not a natural salesperson and i hate approaching people/talking. I didn't even apply; I was seeking positions with way less responsibility but was approached by a recruiter and was desperate for money so I accepted--and now the more I read about the job/company the more I feel like it's going to drain me even further and I've totally fucked up.

My biggest fear is failure and I feel like I'm setting myself up for a lot of it when I'm already in a delicate place. Getting through tomorrow doesn't even feel possible, let alone the next three days of 7 hour training shifts. I cry at nothing and I can't seem to keep myself calm, I'm so emotionally exhausted.

I have a wonderful therapist but other than seeing her once a week I have no support system and I feel completely isolated and alone.

I don't know if this post has a point. I just don't want to feel this bad anymore and i think I've bit off so much more than I can chew atm.
