Why is it so hard to dieNothing's fool proof. All the medication in my house is useless; I can't overdose on any of it. I almost killed myself last August, took my mums amlodepine. It would of killed me. But I made myself vomit. I always have that drive, that will to live and I hate it.


The only thing I look forward to is that things will get better and they never do. It's exhausting to live. To eat. To breathe. There's no point to any of it. No meaning. I'm not important. I'm just a burden. It's  like I'm mentally challenged; everything that's so simple and easy for others take my greatest efforts. 


I've had numerous accounts on this site, pleading, begging for help. For someone to take me away from this nightmare. I cried again on the bus. Its all too much i have no purpose. I don't even know what i'm doing half the time or where im going. I want to run, but you can't run away from yourself. I just want to rip off all my skin, get away from this prison i call a body. I feel inhuman, like I can't understamd others; ive missed out om so much in life.  I have mo experiences. I look back and all i see is misery. I don't even have the strength to look ahead.


I don't know why I'm writing this. But I do know I want to give up. And as soon as I find a way out I will.
