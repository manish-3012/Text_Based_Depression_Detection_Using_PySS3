Why cant I like anything?Im 19. Im in college doing a class that i hate. Actually, i dont know when was the last time that i really enjoy anything. I cant like other people (although i do have many friends, but i do not care about them and i dont esteem them at all), i cant like the activities that i do in my daily.. Now Im trying to get in another class in college, but i dont even have any support of anyone neither a perspective of change. I dont see how i can get out of this hole. I dont even know why im posting this, but guess thats what people do right? Honestly I dont even see a point, but here I am.
