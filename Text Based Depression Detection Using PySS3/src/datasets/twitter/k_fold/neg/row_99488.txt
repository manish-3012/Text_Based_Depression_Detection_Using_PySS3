I don't want to be hereIt's an odd feeling. We're all gonna die. That seems a bit different thinking you might be the one to be the cause of it. A lot of people cause their own deaths though. Or certainly indirectly contribute to it. Maybe it's not very different from someone suffering with leukemia than someone who's suicidal. It's just another part of a person's body that's trying to kill them. Sometimes it's successful, sometimes it isn't. I just wish I could find some comfort in the times when it isn't successful.
