When do things ever start looking up. I'm ready to give up at times.So I've dealt with depression since 2008. I've had relationships come my way and then just fail. I've had multiple jobs but nothing that can help me with reaching my goals. Well I got a full time job I enjoy now so that's been a great thing. And I have had my girlfriend in my life for 6 months now. But I'm worried too much good is happening all at once. So I take every situation and think about what could go wrong. and then it just tears me down and makes me wanna give up because I feel like I will just fail in my job and relationship and just being plain happy. I dont know anymore. I just dont have much faith in myself, I feel like I will ruin everything good I have.
