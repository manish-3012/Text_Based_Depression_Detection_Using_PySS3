ready to dieI had a privileged upper\-middle class life up until 13 years old.  Then my family dissolved over night: family lost all their money, father arrested, mother became an unemployed drug addict, brother dropped out of high school.  I was the high\-achiever and was expected to do great things with my life.  Then I got sick.  For years doctors couldn't help me.  By 20 I was waking up chocking on my mucus every night, struggling to breathe throughout the day, developed severe OCD, and a manifold of other health problems.  My friends and family abandoned me as I went from artsy, studious, charming to weird, sickly, and awkward.

I turned to hard drugs while I continued to see doctors.  This allowed me to work, attend school, grow as a person, and protect my heart from a world that has no place for the sick.  My 2nd year of community college: a nutrition class I took saved my life by changing my diet which solved my health issues.

I had more enthusiasm than ever.   I wanted to have fun and enjoy life as much as possible but at this point I had no friends.  So I took to study.  I read everything: Shakespeare, Kant, Freud, Darwin, The Bible, anything I could get my hands on\- I was reading up to 10 hours a day.  Then I got injured.  Tore ligaments in my ankle, prescribed pain killers, and accidentally overdosed which triggered psychosis.  I lost my job, my car, fucked up in college, stopped reading, turned to drugs and began to overdose every month, struggled with bouts of homelessness/poverty.  I came to my senses last winter.  I'm thinking clearly now for the first time.

No one helped me.  I don't like people anymore.  I don't care about the world anymore.  All the hope, ambition, and passion that was in me is gone.  Loneliness crushed me in the way I always feared it would.  All I see is darkness.  I'm ready to die.
