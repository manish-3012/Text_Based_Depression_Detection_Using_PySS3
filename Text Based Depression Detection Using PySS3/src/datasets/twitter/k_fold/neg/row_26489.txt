My mental health problems affected my relationship and pushed the love of my life away. I love her with all my heart and we broke up months ago. She was the reason I didnt kill myself last year. I tried moving on and working on myself but I need her. Sheâ€™s moved on and weâ€™re over. I am so suicidalI wake up instantly in the morning with extremely high anxiety. I think of her constantly. I had been feeling a bit better over Christmas because I was constantly distracted and was able to avoid thinking about her. Iâ€™ve been thinking of her constantly and I love her more than anything. I really think she is the most perfect girl in the world and I canâ€™t believe I lost her. If I had been in a healthier mind, I wouldnâ€™t have lost her but my issues became too much burden for her and I donâ€™t blame her. She has now moved on and seems to be very happy and in love with someone else. Weâ€™re over and Iâ€™ve lost her. I have tried new hobbies and working out. I have tried to see past her. I have never in my life loved someone so much. I would do anything if it meant getting her back but I know itâ€™s over. She is not somebody I can get over. I would love to die. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because of my family.
