I want to kill myself but I can'tI thought I was going to get better, but life keeps fucking me. My grades are still shit. I'm still behind. I still don't have any friends. I'm still starving myself. I almost fainted a couple of days ago. I'm losing the only person who truly cares about me, my girlfriend. She's the sweetest, most lovable and caring person I will ever meet. She's the only reason I'm still alive. She's the only reason I'm still trying. She's the only thing that makes me happy. We're probably going to have to go NC for a while because something happened, most likely she got caught talking to me again or her school found out what we're doing because they installed a sort of keylogger on her laptop that tells them when she said x words on y apps if those words are offensive, inappropriate, etc.
I'm scared. She's depressed too. She has awful people around her and she has to deal with them everyday. She's hurting so bad inside. There aren't enough words to describe the pain she's going through. I'm scared she'll get worse if that does happen. I'm scared I won't be able to deal with not being around her. Everything hurts. I lost my bus card today. I don't know how ill get to school tomorrow. I don't know if she'll be okay. She's the only reason I'm holding on. I can't see myself living without her. I promised her I wouldn't cut myself again (I used to cut before I met her), but that's the only way I know of dealing with the pain without her. Life's not worth living. But I got to keep fighting. I promised the person I love the most that I wouldn't do anything. I promised we'd be together forever. I promised I'd always be here for her. I can't let her go. But the pain will be too much to handle if I have to live without her for a while. I'm tired of being depressed. I have bipolar depression and season depression and it makes me feel like shit. Some days I feel like the most worthless living being in the universe, and without my baby by my side to help me deal with it, I'm sure I'll feel that way constantly. I'm tired. I'm really fucking tired.
