I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreIn 2009 I went to law school to try and better my career. I was pretty good at it. Finished in top 10%, some scholarship money, law review, the whole shebang. 

Since I graduated in 2012 I have been nothing but various stages of miserable. I am constantly what is wrong with me, constantly berated for my work in various degrees. Yesterday I got yelled st for 20 minutes about a motion Iâ€™d written, and at the end of it all I didnâ€™t even understand what Iâ€™d done wrong. Iâ€™d never been treated this way in an prior profession.

I have spent the past 1.5 years trying to find another job and getting nowhere. Recently I had two great interviews with a company to be told that it came down to me and one other candidate, but that I did not have enough of the â€œrightâ€ kind of experience.

I am at ropeâ€™s end. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I dread work every day. I donâ€™t sleep much. I make my wife miserable because I have no idea how to function after being beaten down all day, or at best utterly ignored and dismissed.

I am 225k in debt because I can only make payments on interest. I used to think I was going to be good at this, but now I suspect Iâ€™m no good at anything. Now itâ€™s just a prison I canâ€™t escape.

I donâ€™t think I want to die but there is nowhere for me to go anymore. Every day feels entirely pointless and burdensome, and everything I do seems to make other people unhappy. I canâ€™t find a new place to work. I canâ€™t muster any interest for activities other than stupid tv shows or trying to sleep. I am too cowardly to kill myself but have no prospects either.

Iâ€™ve heard all the platitudes before. They arenâ€™t helpful anymore, the â€œeverything happens for a reasonâ€ bullshit that is what people say when they just want to ignore you and move on.

I just want something to end and it feels like Iâ€™ve run out of options as to what that is.
