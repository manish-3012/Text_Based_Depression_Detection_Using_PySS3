im a failurei got kicked out of med school (that i tried so hard to get in so that i can change my life) for being hospitalised twice in my first 2 years. 
i hate the psychiatric ward and i dont think it helped me... 
other people can be so mean.... and i cant stand it.... im so scared of people... im so scared to get a job... 

im ugly.... and useless... 
i think everyone hates me... 

and i, too, really , really hate myself
i think about suicide a lot
i really should just die
i keep thinking about this

maybe i will see sharence again when i die.. 
maybe im not meant to live...
i feel so tired..... useless.....
