Don't know how much more I can take..I'm just so tired of life, been dealing with Depression, anxiety, social anxiety, ocd, bdd, paranoid thoughts, depersonalization/derealization and constant suicidal thoughts for the past two years. I just feel hopeless and want all this to end. The only reason i'm still in this world is because of my family, if I didn't have them i'd be long gone.
