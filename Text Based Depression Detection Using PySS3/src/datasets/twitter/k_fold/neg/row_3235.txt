Feel Like Giving Up On Everything (Including My Life)Don't think of this as silly but... I have a major problem. I know some have to deal with losing a game, but I can't deal with it. In fact, I absolutely hate to lose a game. Throughout these few years, I've been playing MOBA games like League Of Legends and SMITE. And at first I did ok, but it went downhill from there.

First on LoL, I reached the minimum requirement in order to play ranked games. After the placement games, I got placed in Bronze 1. I tried to reach my big goal of gold in ranked, but too many obstacles got in the way and I've dropped to Bronze 4. I tried everything and I'm nowhere near my goal.

And on SMITE, the storyline is pretty much the same, but there's 3 game modes, and I got placed in Bronze 5 in all of them. That's the lowest position possible. I tried to climb my way up, but I got stuck.

Everyone's performing better than me, I always end up with more deaths than kills, and I keep having more losing streaks than winning streaks. After all this, I feel worthless, I feel hopeless, I feel weak, and I feel like a big wimp. I just wish something would go right for me for once. Just this once.

If all of this doesn't change, then I give up. What's the point of trying knowing I'll end up with another loss? I feel like ending my own life because I can't stand with any more losses.
