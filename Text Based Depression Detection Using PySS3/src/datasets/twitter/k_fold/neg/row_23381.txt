caught in limboHello, I'm not so sure where to start, so I'll just type as the thoughts come. I've always had anxiety issues, there is no question about that, the first time I had any confirmation of it I guess was when I was in school, when I got extra time to sit examinations because of "childhood trauma/dyspraxia" to be honest I dont even know why I would deserve extra time from that. Anyway, three years ago I would say was probably some of the happiest times of my life, I had just finished school with many highers and was ready to start working during my gapyear, I think this was the time when I was most confident with myself, I could get out of bed in the morning with a smile on my face and I never had these heavy mental weights holding me down every single day. Fast forward a year and I'm, starting university, I was nervous, ofcourse, I cant concentrate in large groups of people and it breaks me down I sweat profusely I must look like I've killed someone, my legs are weak clumsy and inconvenient. I try to avoid as much contact as poissible through the first few weeks, telling myself I could make friends later, I sit at the back of classes always wearing a big hoodie/beanie or whatever hat crossed arms just so people wouldnt approach me I guess. Inbetween classes ill go and sit in a toilet cublicle and read or write/do classwork, I know the cleaners routines and I change floor depending on the time, its pathetic, this happened my first whole year, I dropped out that year, I decided to take another "gapyear" to try and sort myself out, become less socially inept etc, I work with small amounts of people and I'm fine with them after a while we get along but it's not like I'm any of their friends, I would'nt go to them if I was in trouble or them to me. I was excited to get a fresh start at university, I thought I could turn myself into a new person, reinvent myself, I listened to hours and hours of body confidence tutorials and things. I started back at university two/three months ago, same university different course, and it is no different from last time, I've found myself doing exactly the same trhing and it tears me apart doing the SAME thing every single day, wake up go to uni come hgome play league of legends and thats about it, in my free time I'll sit and play league for 5 hours straight or more, I really don't want to be scared/afraid anymore but at the same time I wouldnt want to put even more of a burden of my mother,it wpouldnt look good if your kid killed themselves I guess, can;t remember where I seen or heard thta, but it stuck with me, if I WAS to decide to "end my life" it would most probably be by hanging, there is a forest ntot far from where I live and I can't stand the thought of trying to overdose on drugs or with a plastic bag taped over my head, too much room for someone interrupting and then being left with brain damage or something similar, thanks if you have managed to read through this clown fiesta of a post ,r
