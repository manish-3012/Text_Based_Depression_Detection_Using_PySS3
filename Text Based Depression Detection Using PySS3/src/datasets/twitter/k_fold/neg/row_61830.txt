betrayed my reason to lifegot too drunk. fell asleep.
and in doing so i fucking left my girlfriend with no way into my apartment. jumping from the balcony is looking more and more promising but iâ€™m too much of a pussy anyway.

i donâ€™t want to leave her but at the same time she deserves so much more. everyone would be so much better off without me that i hate myself for not going through with it. i just want to stop being such a disappointment. she is my world and i keep fucking her over with stupid shit like this. and the worst part is that she doesnâ€™t even notice that iâ€™m a huge piece of shit to her. my life is pretty much like this account: a throwaway.
