Things DON'T get better.Hmm. I wish I could put together a coherent rant. I didn't. 

I've read personal development material for years. I've desired to improve. I have improved. I finished a qualification I hate. I slept with more women. I re-orientated my entire life to make good changes and... it's been 3 years since I started trying to improve and things are worse. 

THINGS DON'T GET BETTER.  AT SOME POINT YOU'RE JUST FUCKED. Not everyone but if your at the bottom rung, incompetent and unlikable why bother? 

Now I understand writing a whiny post and gorging myself on other depressive posts is self-indulging and pathetic. I don't care. I've pushed myself into reality enough times for things to not work. 

What can I tell you? Just give up.   
I don't want to give up. I know things can get worse but I'd rather die now than wait. 

I'm going to make a plan to kill myself for hope (I won't execute too scared) or find somewhere I can bury my head in the sand like the army. I dunno. 

Don't tell me it's worth going on. I don't believe you.
