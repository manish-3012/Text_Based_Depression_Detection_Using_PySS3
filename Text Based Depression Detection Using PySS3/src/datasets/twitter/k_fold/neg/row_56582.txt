How do you get help for a seriously depressed family member who refuses to do anything about it?This is reposted from /r/askreddit.  

We have a family history of severe mental illness. I believe my mother may also be bipolar, or severely depressed. I'm not sure what the definition of suicidal is, but I called my mom the other day and she was in hysterics and repeating "I don't want to wake up tomorrow, I don't want to wake up, I can't wake up." She has a history of threatening to kill herself, though it's not frequent. Every time I suggest that she seek help she becomes furious with me. I am deeply concerned, and I live about 1000 miles away. I'm frustrated and scared for her and angry that I've been the one who had to deal with this so long when she needs help. Your advice is really appreciated.

I think I should have called 911 the other day but I wasn't thinking that fast. I did call my best friend from high school who herself is bipolar and she went over to check on my mom and stayed til mom was asleep. We talked after and both agree she needs help.

Many thanks for your replies. It is much appreciated.
