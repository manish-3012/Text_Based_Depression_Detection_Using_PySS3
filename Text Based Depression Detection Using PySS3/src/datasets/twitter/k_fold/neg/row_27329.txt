Iâ€™m giving it until late May.If this isnâ€™t over, then I need to die. I canâ€™t take it. My mental illness is so bad from this and I canâ€™t do it. I canâ€™t not see my friends all summer. Summer was my light at the end of the tunnel. I canâ€™t have it be gone. I canâ€™t do this. Iâ€™d rather die.
