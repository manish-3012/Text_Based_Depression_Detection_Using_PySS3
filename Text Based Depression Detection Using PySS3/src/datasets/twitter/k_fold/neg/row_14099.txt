Grieving and feeling sad all the timeEvery since my dad passed away I felt like a cloud of sadness and despair came over my life. Sure I can be happy in some moments but once itâ€™s passed and Iâ€™m alone, Iâ€™d feel sad and fantasize about killing myself to end the pain and join him in death.

When he was alive, I drank and partied for fun and to be happy. And now when heâ€™s gone, even drinking and socializing do nothing for me and feel like a chore. 

This whole ordeal has drained me of my confidence and left me full of self doubt. Iâ€™m feeling so ugly and worthless now.

Itâ€™s been a few months now since he passed but the sadness still lingers like a shadow. I just want this sadness to go away.
