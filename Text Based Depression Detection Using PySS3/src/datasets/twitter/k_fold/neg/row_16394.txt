Fuck it all...If you read my post history, you might see something that explains it.

  
I just cant take this. Ive lost everything... And now all of fucking reddit is on my back too. I just feel like im fighting a loosing war here, i keep getting messages from people on how shit i am as a human from the guys from r/AmItheAsshole. I did one single fuck up and now literally every comment is hate... "This is probably why you only have one friend" "Yeah you deserve this"  


I just wish that someone was with me, but every person is against me. Im used to reddit being helpful. Being able to make me feel human, now i feel like a monster... I usally use reddit to get away from the shit i experiance. Now its just following me here...  


Ive lost my only friends, I keep getting mentally abused by my stepdad... it sometimes even goes physical yet the police doesnt do anything. And neither does CPS... they just said "yeah big things will happen really soon..." its been over a year and gotten no responses...  


I cant take this... I have nothing positive anymore. Everything ive had has just dissapeared. My friends, my safe space, whenever i leave my room, or hear footsteps coming close to my room im literally afraid that he will go into my room... I cant take this shit... ive tried so hard to make it through, but it only gets worse and worse and worse...  


Goodbye.
