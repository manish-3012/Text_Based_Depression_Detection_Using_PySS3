Iâ€™m about to see one more film, then Iâ€™m leaving.Iâ€™m going to the movie theatre in about an hour and half to see Isle of Dogs. Iâ€™ve always loved films, especially animated ones. I want to experience it one last time.

Then Iâ€™m going to go home and say goodbye to my dog. Then Iâ€™m going to end it. Finally end it. Iâ€™m calm for the first time in a very long time. I canâ€™t say Iâ€™m happy, but Iâ€™m not afraid.
