I think the only reason I haven't yet is family and fear.I'm scared of what's after this. I'm christian -although I also intend on being on the right side of history if you get what I mean- but that dosn't stop the fear. And I know it would absolutly distory my parents. Sometimes I wish I didn't have anyone who cared about me so I didn't dissopoint them.
