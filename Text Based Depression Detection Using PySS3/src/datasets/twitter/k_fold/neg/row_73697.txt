I don't even understand whyWhy do I constantly have thoughts of all the different ways I could die? I don't actively want to kill myself.   I certainly don't want to feel alone anymore and I don't want to try anymore.  But I don't want to end it.  I don't understand why I feel this way.  Different things happen and make me think that dying is the only way I'll ever feel better.  But I can't make myself want to do it.  It's like I'm just destined to be miserable my entire life.  I don't remember any part of my life when I didn't have these thoughts.  I dont remember how to have fun anymore. I don't know if I ever did.  I work, I come home, I go to sleep and repeat.  I try to go to the gym and I try to clean but I'm never completely successful.  My only friend is my boyfriend and I can't tell him all of this.  He will never understand.  We have talked briefly before but he just doesn't get it.  Today I asked him to go to a specific place with me and he said no because he was going to mow the lawn. I got home and he was having fun with his friends. It hit me hard.  Im not mad at him for it at all.  I'm just sad and defeated.  Like I want nothing more than to have fun again. And try to do things that make me happy.  And to spend time with people.  But it's so hard to just say that. I don't want to flat out say "I need you to spend time with me." I just want someone to make an effort for me without needing to ask for it. I don't want to be a burden by asking someone to spend time with me.   I don't know how to make friends at my age.  I try and it gets nowhere.  I don't blame anyone but myself for all of this.  But when I'm alone, which is most of the time, those thoughts of ways to die won't go away.  Medications have helped numb me before.  But I don't want to get by through taking antidepressants.  I want to just live.
