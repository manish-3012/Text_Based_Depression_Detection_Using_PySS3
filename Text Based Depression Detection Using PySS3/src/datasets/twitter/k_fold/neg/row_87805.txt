Loss of my familyI had an appointment with a new psychiatrist. A change is made to my medications. He removes my anxiety medication. I have a disagreement with my wife. We agree no more corporal punishment. I am quite distraught. I notice my ability to concentrate has greatly diminished.

I tell my psychologist about my disagreement. My wife puts duct tape over the mouth of one of our children. Later she says it is a joke. I do not think it is funny. A few days later I tell my psychologist I was upset about the duct tape. She notifies the state's Department of Children and Families. They come to our home that evening and interview everyone. They tell my wife she has to take 2 classes. They suggest we stop all corporal punishment. After they leave my wife tells me I can not live there anymore.
