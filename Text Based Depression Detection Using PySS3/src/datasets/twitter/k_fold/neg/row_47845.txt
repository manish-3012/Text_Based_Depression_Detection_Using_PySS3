Hey world, a questionI am curious. I think a lot of you people who read and try to help have been in the position of wanting to commit suicide before.

What has someone said to help you? Most things people say, I've heard it all before, it means nothing...but the fact that someone cares does mean a bit. But have any words ever touched you? Can you share with me? Something to think about?

I've thought about suicide for years of my young life. I don't know if it will ever completely go away, but even if the words that helped you were specific to your situation, maybe they'd give me something to think about when all I can think about is wanting to die.

Edit: Okay, multiple questions...but basically the same.
