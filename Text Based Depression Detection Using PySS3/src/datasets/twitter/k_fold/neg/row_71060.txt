Any Canadians know if you can get medically assisted in suicide at the hospital???I know thereâ€™s a way for people who are severely ill and suffering with no chance of recovery to be assisted in suicide by doctors.

Iâ€™m wondering if they accept normal people who donâ€™t want to live anymore? I couldnâ€™t find an official answer. Iâ€™m guessing no, which sucks.
