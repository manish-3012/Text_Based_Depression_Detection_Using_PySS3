If all else fails, Iâ€™m jumping off a bridgeI got it all planned out, this pandemic forced me home early and thereâ€™s so much shit going on. Parents separating but not divorcing is the messiest family situation of all time. Dad tells me momâ€™s just using me as a little birdie while everyone else says he deserved everything thatâ€™s come to him. Whatever, I canâ€™t wait to go back to school overseas. And I canâ€™t wait to jump off that fucking bridge and splat my brains across the train tracks. No one fucking cares anyway so everything will be temporary. Even the â€œgriefâ€ and â€œpainâ€, deep down everyone will be happy Iâ€™m gone and not bothering anyone anyways. Iâ€™m a sad sack of shit and I deserve to die
