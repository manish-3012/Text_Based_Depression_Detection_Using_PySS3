My life is falling apart and I'm giving up.My job is garbage, I can't afford a decent place to live, or much food, I won't be able to afford school next year, my parents have disowned me and refuse to help. I have a history of depression and self harm. 

I don't know what to do anymore and don't see much point in going on. Nobody would miss me anyways. I haven't talked to anyone outside of my work for almost a month because I can't bring myself to go out.

This isn't so much a cry for help as it is an opportunity for me to vent, and just to talk to someone, anyone really, about what I'm going through.

Thanks for reading.
