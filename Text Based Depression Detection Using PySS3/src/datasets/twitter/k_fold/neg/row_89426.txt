I must be very desperate to write here...I'm in tears while I write this. I tried everything imaginable to cheer myself up but the thing is, no one wants me. I recently ended a long friendship with my former best friend, that caused other friends and even my girlfriend to distance themselves from me.
I was alone afterwards, I had no one, not in my school, not even in my own house. I atleast was able to talk to my sisters about my problems but they flew to the other side of the world to have better lives, while I was still stuck at home with my shitty family.
My parents don't understand my problems, they just thought I was a little bit sad and bought me a plane ticket to some run-down eastern european country. I am now on my "vacation", I have no one to talk to and even my parents didn't want me, so they sent me to some other country hundreds of kilometres away from home, where I can't even speak the language properly. Right now, I am sitting in my hotel room, alone, and contemplating suicide. I can't stand this place or my family anymore!
