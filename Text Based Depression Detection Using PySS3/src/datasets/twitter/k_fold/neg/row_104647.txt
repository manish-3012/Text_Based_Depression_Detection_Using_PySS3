Scared of being like everyone. I hate it. I hate being like everyone else. I'd do what I can just to be unique. Even if I have to be sadder than my classmates. Or maybe not like the same things. Avoiding talking about my interests so others won't try to copy them.

I had the habit of carrying a notebook for story ideas or just random shenanigans. But when one day my friend went all, "Maybe I should bring a notebook like you? Your habits are rubbing off me." I was just done. It was extremely painful. When others try to walk beside me, I try to atleast be a few inches ahead or behind. As long as they aren't walking the same place as me. When people follow me going somewhere, I hate it. It's not that I hate people or I want to be alone. I just don't want them doing the same thing as me.

It has gone to a point where I want to be depressed to be different. To hurt myself (I haven't though due to being afraid of the pain that comes with it). To fail a class or exam intentionally(despite being smart).Or to avoid situations where these things happen. I mean, why live when all you do is be like someone else? Why stay alive if you are simply a copy of another? Better just let the original live and you go ahead.

Well, it hasn't gone far to an extreme extent yet. I hope it doesn't. Probably not the right thread but I can't think of an appropriate thread. I just kinda wanna rant? I don't really know. 

Curious though if this feeling happens to anyone else.
