Chronic intractable pain and suicideThe doctor's aren't helping anymore.  I don't know what more I can do, me crying in a wheelchair and pleading for any quality of life is meaningless to seemingly everyone. Honestly the only reason I'm still here is, the fear of the end of my life being more painful then the pain I dealt with every day. I honestly am too much of a coward if it's anything but falling asleep and never waking back up. But the thought of waking up again for an indefinite amount of days, months, years, knowing each night I will get less then 5 hours sleep and will wake up gasping in pain with my heart racing and sit doing that awful pain-moan that sounds like demons you hear in the ER/A&amp;E sometimes... I cannot do that. That thought, that I'm stuck here and everyone around me is healthy and fine and has an almost perfect life and I will wake every morning into a new hell makes me so angry I want to hurt others and that's terrifying, I never want anyone to suffer even a fraction like I have, ever. I don't know what else to do. I don't think turning up at the hospital and saying "I'm in so much pain I want to kill myself" will earn me anything but a psych ward stay or at least a 72 hour hold, and I doubt the psych ward would clear me to be able to go with my physical issues - Id probably get thrown into a top floor for an embarrassing 3 days and never be able to return to that hospital bc the nurses will think I'm crazy and never take me seriously again. My sort of only options are live in a waking hell of constant physical pain or make an attempt which will probably be agony, and might even fail and leave me more mangled. 

I've never had less of an idea on how to carry on living.
