Iâ€™m done.Iâ€™ve been fighting depression, ptsd, anxiety and a range of other things for too fucking long. 
As a result, Iâ€™ve lost all contact with friends and I donâ€™t have any family except for my wife. 
Last night she told me she wants to have sex with other people. 
My one support who I thought I could trust has just driven a knife straight through my heart and I canâ€™t handle the pain. 
I know how Iâ€™m going to do it, itâ€™s just a matter of collecting the supplies then going through with it. 
I hope you all find peace here in earth or the after life. X
