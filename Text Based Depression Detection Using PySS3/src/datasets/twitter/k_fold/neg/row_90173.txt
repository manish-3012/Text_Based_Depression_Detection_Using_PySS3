Is it bad to embrace my "illness".I've been soul searching for years now. Ever since i was 19 I've known i'm not who i thought i was. I have generalized anxiety disorder and have slipped into psychosis a couple times.  I've been really focusing on exploring my mind as of late. Discovering things that both make sense and terrify me at the same time. I've become obsessed with psychology and understanding the mind. This obsession seems like a problem to me. I question everything i think. I'm self aware of every feeling i have. I see myself in other people. I see my problems in other people. I see through other peoples facade's. It's exhausting. i'm only 22 and i feel like i'm treading into waters most people my age couldn't comprehend.
