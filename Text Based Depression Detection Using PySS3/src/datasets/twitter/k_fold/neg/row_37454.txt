Can't Stand It Anymore.I'm 18, I hardly had any friends in high school, I'm not good at sports or video games. I Get average grades when it comes to school. I can't remember the last time I was happy. The simple fact that i will never be great or even good at something kills me. I just hate myself and there is only one way i can think of to stop hating myself.
