plz I need helpIâ€™ve been depressed lately. The most Iâ€™ve been in my entire life. Iâ€™ve been like this for the last few months. To the point where I want to harm myself again and my eating disorder was in full swing. It was bad but not to the point it is now.
My boyfriend broke up with me last night. We were together for 3 years. We were supposed to move in together and Iâ€™m completely fked up right now. I keep hoping heâ€™ll reach out to me, which I know is just desperation at this point. I just seriously need help and I donâ€™t know what to do. I thought Iâ€™d post on here. I donâ€™t even know what to ask or what I need but I donâ€™t want to tell my family because they donâ€™t react well whenever I talk about how I feel. But I feel so messed up. I am scared and lost and I just want to die. I was going to hurt myself, and I knew it would be bad so I came here instead
