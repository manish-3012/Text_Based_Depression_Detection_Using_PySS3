Religions...?I've heard about lots of different religions (you probably have too) but I'm growing up in a Christian household but I really don't want to be a Christian anymore, I don't think it's right and I have so many questions about it and half the time I don't understand it. I'm trying to search for a different religion but if my mom finds out she'll most likely kill me. But I'm taking that risk and asking YOU if you know about other religions or are a part of that religion, and please explain a little bit about it and I may research it more... so please... give me some suggestions.
