Preparing to execute myself tonight.I use the term execute because I am guilty of being a failure of a human being. My wife said she doesnâ€™t love me anymore today, and that just was the last straw. I fail at everything I do, Iâ€™m lazy, selfish, and every time I try to change and be a better person I let her down. 

So tonight after everyone else goes to sleep Iâ€™m gonna paint my garage with buckshot and my brains and be done with it. I am a failure, I suck as an attorney, a lover, a father, and a friend.

Itâ€™s time to pay for my failures, as this is what is expected of me.
