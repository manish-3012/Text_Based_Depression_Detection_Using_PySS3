I tried to hang myself and my throat did bleed a bit...Even a day after that, I still had some blood but it was almost nothing... but my question is.. why did it bleed? and is it normal to have a sore throat after almost 4 days? I've tried this twice before but it never happened. Sorry this may not be the place to ask/say this but I don't know where and I'm kind of curious/scared.
