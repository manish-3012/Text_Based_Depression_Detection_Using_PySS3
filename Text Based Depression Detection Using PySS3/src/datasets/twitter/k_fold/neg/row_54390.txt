Iâ€™m barely holding onWow. I never thought I could feel so low. Honestly if I didnâ€™t have such a big family and if I didnâ€™t love my mother more than life itself Iâ€™d blow my fucking head off. But that would destroy my mother and I could never do that to her. All she and my dad have ever done is make our lives incredible and full of love. I just want to make them proud but I feel like the worlds biggest fuck up. I used to think people who wanted to kill themselves were fucking cowards but I hate this world with all my heart and I understand now. 

Except I am a coward and I donâ€™t think I could even go through with it. Iâ€™m too scared to find out whatâ€™s after. Iâ€™ve been religious my whole life but man sometimes I cry out to God and feel like he never responds or I donâ€™t hear it. Idk where Iâ€™m going with this Iâ€™m just....tired. I need help.
