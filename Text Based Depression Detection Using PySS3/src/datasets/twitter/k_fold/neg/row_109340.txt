Struggling with life. (20F)Hey..I've finally decided to post in this group about how I feel and what I am going through. I am going to make this short,  so that it doesn't feel like I am saying to much. As you can see,  I am a twenty year old female and I am trying to live a positive and happy life. (It is NOT working out for me.) Between the stress of working full time,  being a full time college student to become a nurse,  to taking care of my mental health,  everything is getting overwhelming for me. I am also in a new environment,  with a family that took me in,  after being mistreated and abused by my own family. It hurts to know,  my blood family doesn't want me...all of my life,  I was a blacksheep...(what I mean is,  they always leave me out of things,  accuse me of stuff that I never did,  spread lies to the entire family,  where most of my other family members disowned me or started fights with me for no reason,  they always said how much they hate me and that I didn't matter to them.) I was also abused for a very long time,  my mother allowed her friend to beat me,  when I was nine. Then 16-20,  allowed her own husband (my step dad) to beat me,  until it caused injuries that I had to take of by myself. They have always treated me with hate,  unfairness and I had enough. For years,  I went from house to house with family members to strangers....and now I am finally at a home,  where I am being treated okay. In May of this year,  I have finally found my first boyfriend. Little did I know,  he was mentally abusive. After five months of dealing with his screaming,  anger,  language,  hateful and cruel words,  and so much abuse...we finally broke up. The blame was on me,  apparently it was my fault that the relationship was bad. I had depression,  had my days...he only made it worse. I stayed depressed,  got more insecure,  stopped caring for myself because of him. I even became suicidal and self harmed. Well,  I was that way but it got more intensed. I had enough,  and even though I gave him everything,  loved him so...he didn't feel the same. With that,  I am still being bullied,  tormented by others...even strangers...I barely have friends,  I try to stay home if possible....because I am broke,  hurt,  scared....after everything that has happened,  between being sexually assaulted,  abused,  bullied and losing my loved ones....I am not in a good mental state. 

I know that I've said this was short,  but when I began to talk...I couldn't stop. Anyways,  I am done venting....
