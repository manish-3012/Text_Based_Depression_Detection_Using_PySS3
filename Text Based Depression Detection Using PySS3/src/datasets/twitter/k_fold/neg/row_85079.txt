Thereâ€™s something wrong with meAny time something bad happens, my immediate reaction is â€œkill yourselfâ€. My mind goes to dark places on the regular... I wonder how long itâ€™ll take for me to use the razor I hid in my room... I need help that Iâ€™m not getting because the wait lists are all 6 months long... lifeâ€™s a bitch and then you die. Sorry for the rant. Iâ€™ll delete this in the morning
