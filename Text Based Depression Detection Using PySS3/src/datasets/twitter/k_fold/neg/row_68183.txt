Reddit, I am going to kill myself tomorrow night.I can't bring myself to jump from a height and I don't want to do anything dramatic like slit my wrists or throat or anything that is going to draw a lot of attention.

I have opted for over the counter sleep pills and vodka, the come in boxes of 20 and I know of 3 shops I can visit to get 60 (they will only sell you one box at a time).

I'm probably going to take all of them with about 1L of vodka.

My only concern is that I'm either going to survive and be a complete vegetable or end up in incredible pain and submit to it, resulting in a trip to the emergency room.

I was also thinking about leaving a note but things are so complicated I think it will just make things more painful for those I leave behind.

This has been premeditdated for months now, this is not just a spur of the moment descision. I have never tried anything like this before.

So, I guess I'm asking, I am likely to succesfully end my life or I am just going to cause a big mess.
