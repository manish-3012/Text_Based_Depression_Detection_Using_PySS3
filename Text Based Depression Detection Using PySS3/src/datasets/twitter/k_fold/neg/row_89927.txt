the emptiness inside mejesus christ  
i hate this  
the emptiness is overwhelming  
i cant feel anything anymore  
i cant do it  
i cant handle this  
i cant fucking do this  
i cant keep living like this

i feel like im losing a part of me everytime this happens  
soon enough there isnt going to be any of me left  
i dont want to get there

i dont want to anymore  
i cant do it  
im going to leave soon  
not sure how  
but i will do it

i cant do this
