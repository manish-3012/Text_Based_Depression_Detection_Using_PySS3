Last post on here for a whileHey everybody (or anyone reading this),

I think I've posted here too much lately. I just want to apologize and wish everyone a good day. I did have a list I wanted to share regarding what I'm dealing with. If anyone has time to share advice, that would mean a lot because I'm done with trying: 

* I feel wrong and/or lost (religion, major, sexuality, how to conquer my life)
* Self-esteem/self-respect issues
* I think I am getting worse
* Emotionally unstable
* An intense self-hatred (appearance, constantly dismissal of myself, personality)
* I feel I donâ€™t deserve what I have
* Iâ€™m not as social as I want to be
* I feel Iâ€™m not living up to my motherâ€™s standards
* I am no longer sure about my major
