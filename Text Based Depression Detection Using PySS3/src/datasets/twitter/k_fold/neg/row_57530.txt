I called the suicide hotline and they laughed at meIâ€™m posting this because I realized I am not alone after searching the Internet for similar stories. This happened three years ago, but it still haunts me and I canâ€™t turn off my mind today so here we go.

Iâ€™ve struggled with anxiety and depression forever and itâ€™s been pretty severe in the last few years of my life. At the time I called I was dealing with a lot of stress including discrimination in the workplace, but that wasnâ€™t the reason I was calling. 

This person already laughed at me for this so what do I care telling you all this. I had an abortion and I hated myself. Iâ€™m not saying you should hate yourself if you have had an abortion (please donâ€™t come after me).

I called and was distraught and said that I had an abortion and this girl just straight up witch cackles at me. I immediately hung up because it was terrifying. Has anyone else ever had anyone straight up laugh at you when you called the suicide hotline and they laugh at your reason for calling or being upset? Im aware abortion is a controversial topic but isnâ€™t that insanely inappropriate to the point where itâ€™s damaging? I have not called since. 

The suicide hotline to me is a complete farce. Shouldnâ€™t people who are answering calls from suicidal people should be more qualified than a bitchy girl who needs to fulfill her community service credits in college. 

Also I have called other services like local hotlines that have been SO much more helpful than the national hotline. They can refer you to local services that provide medication or counseling. I hope that helps.
