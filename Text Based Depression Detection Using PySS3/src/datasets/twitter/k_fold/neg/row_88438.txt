Just as a warning and I 'm not sure what we as a society want to do with this.

Posting in here is being used as a tool for other redditors to discredit what you have to say.

There's an over all bigotry against us.

The word the use is "mentally ill" but we also know that this is their bigotry.

I used to think that they refused to value us because we are here but now I realize we are here because they refused to value us.

  
There is no mental illness only exhaustion 

They simply wear a person down over time.

They know we are unhappy but no one takes any responsibility for causing our misery.

Why can't the understand the difference between oppression and depression?
