[Belgium] Girlfriend (29F) opened up about thinking about suicide and being sexually assaulted 3 years agoGood day everyone,

I am a bit at a crossroad here, and I do not know what to do.

Last night, my girlfriend of about 2 months, opened up about being suicidal. This might be important to the situation, but we haven't said I love you yet or really came out as a couple. I am leaving Belgium in a few months and I am still juggling about how serious this relationship is.

1) I asked her why she was feeling sad and that she wasn't in the same mood as usual. She cuddled my up on the couch and we stayed silent for a few minutes. She then said that she feels like she doesn't matter and it would be better if she wasn't here anymore. She is struggling a bit with some government bureaucracy and she just started a new job that she starts to appreciate... I think.

She mentioned that in 2015 she was sexually assaulted (molested) by her supervisor at an old job. She thinks it would have gone worst if a person didn't walk in. After a few months, she did a complaint to the supervisor's boss, but she was told to suck it up and that it won't change anything, that this is the way life goes pretty much. So she closed up. I asked her if anybody else knows about it and she mentioned 2 friends and myself.

2) I asked her if she ever really thought or came close to end it, and her answer was 'yes a couple time' and  "a few months and a year ago". I told her she was important and that it wasn't her fault. We cuddle some more.

3) This morning everything seemed fine until she life my place, she became in that mood again and we embraced for a bit. She got emotional and I said I wanted her to speak to someone. That I will be here for her if she needs me. I asked if she wanted a phone number to call and she said yes. I forwarded her [www.preventionsuicide.be](https://www.preventionsuicide.be) .

4) No one knows about the suicidal thoughts but me. I went to read online, but I am still at-lost about what to do. Should I contact her sister, brother, parents ? Call the emergency ? I do not want to downplay this, but I do not want to be reach out without her knowing and maybe making things worst, i.e. lost of employment, having family try to get her help and her not wanting them to know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not from Belgium initially and I do not know how the system or government handles suicidal people.

I hope I can get some advice from this subreddit. Obviously this is a throw away account.

Thank you guys,
