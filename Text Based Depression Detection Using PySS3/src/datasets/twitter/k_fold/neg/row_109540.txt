ByeIn this life, the only constant is yourself. The world doesn't care about how sad you are or how lonely you feel. Things don't happen like in the movies. There aren't always happy endings and for many there aren't always happy beginnings. You may die sad and lonely and the world could care less. Miracles dont happen. We live in a world where luck is the driving force behind our lives. If you don't have it, then you're alone. We either attempt to make our own destinies or we let chance do it for us. The world is a cruel place though. Why we were brought into this life in the first place is still a mystery to me but if there's one thing I know in this life to be true, it's that all you really can count on is yourself, and even that's not true sometimes, and that's why I can't do this anymore. All I ever feel is a hollow, empty pain. Chelsea was the last straw. I'm a failure at everything I do. I know I'll be alone for the rest of my sad life so what's the point of even continuing. I'm so, so very lonely. Every night I close my eyes I pray that I'll open them to a girl I love next to me but it's always the same empty spot. I fell hard for chelsea and that was the happiest I had been in months. I thought maybe there would be a light in my life, a Beacon of hope in this void that is my life. I shouldn't have allowed myself to get my hopes up again. I really thought I could be happy for once, but when I realized she doesn't feel the same way about me, that pit in my stomach became a crater. What was left of my happiness has been torn to shreds. This life is a joke and as time has gone on I've only grown sadder and lonelier. I try so hard to keep this happy facade I put on going, and I'm sure on the outside I seem happy to you all, but on the inside I'm hollow. I cry myself to sleep most nights and I dread even waking up to repeat another day in my miserable, lonely life. I really thought I'd have a chance at happiness here but God has once again played me. Once again my hopes have been built up just to come crashing down around me. I can't do this anymore. I'd rather not feel at all than feel this way for the rest of my life. They say it gets better, but I've felt this way for months and it's only gotten worse. Taylor, you've been the best of friends to me and I can't thank you enough for being with me through this hell. Good luck with your future, and don't let kaitlyn go; she's a keeper. Mom, dad, eric, Ashley, I love you guys so much. Don't mourn me. This is a better path for me than what I was on. Thank you for all you've given me. Chelsea, I hope you find someone that treats you right and that feels the same way about you as I did. Hanging out with you provided me with some of the only happy moments I've had recently and I thank you for that. All I ever wanted was for you to be happy. I'm sorry you guys have had to read this but I'm in too much pain. This is truly the only way out. Please, live your lives to the fullest and do what I couldn't; be happy.
