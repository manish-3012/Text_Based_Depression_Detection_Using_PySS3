An affairI found out my husband is having an affair with his work partner. They have been saying â€œI love youâ€, itâ€™s physical and emotional affair and they see one another daily in a one on one situation. I found out a month ago and he said it ended and he would work on us. Last week I found out it was not over, he was telling me he was working overtime, but he was really going to her house and sleeping over there and spending our money in taking her on dates and on hotel rooms and hundreds of dollars on flowers and trinkets for her. We have two young kids and my sole identity is my family. The first time I found out about this, I wanted to die. I walked to the railroad tracks and just laid down and was waiting on relief from this pain. Then i chickened out. I walked home and stayed home from work the next day and I was sick that whole week with grief. (I donâ€™t know if it was from not sleeping or not eating or being completely fried stricken or a combination). I ended up losing my job because I just couldnâ€™t force myself to go and I couldnâ€™t stop crying. I thought things were getting better between us, he was trying and being supportive and romantic and kind and basically everything I asked of him, but he was STILL having this affair and going to her home and taking and sending nude pictures of one another. Iâ€™m just so completely in this awful grief. He threatened to send me to an inpatient facility tomorrow but I will be killing myself tonight to escape all this pain and grief. My children are young enough to only remember the sweet and fun things about me or not at all. Everyone would be better off without me. My husband has already moved on, it wonâ€™t take long for others to move on also I just canâ€™t anymore. I canâ€™t stop.
