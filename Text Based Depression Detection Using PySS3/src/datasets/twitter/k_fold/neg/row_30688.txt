I just want my suffering to endAll I have heard my whole life was that Iâ€™m a disappointment, you are a waste of space, you will never amount to anything, and why did even bother with you. That has been my whole life hearing all that from my dad I donâ€™t remember the last time I have been happy without spending time playing games or with friends because that is the only time I feel some amount of happiness in my life. My father thinks so little of me since the day I turned 14 he lit me to work which did help me out at jobs but I had barely to any social life the friends I had have never been good enough for him the girlfriends I have had have never been good enough to him he blames me for his financial problems when I pay for everything myself and how I do nothing for my family when all I do is work work work and nothing is ever good enough for him not once has he said he is proud of me not once has he said you did a good job. All he says to me is negative things that are eating away from the inside out. I came so close to ending it all my junior year of high school I put a revolver in my mouth and spun the cylinder with one round in and pulled the trigger to a dry fire. I donâ€™t see myself living past 25 honest to god. Everything that I work towards and touch I fail every single fucking time I donâ€™t see my life going anywhere my suffering keeps getting worse and worse. I just want to end it
