The best thing about living alone is if I were to die, no one would notice for days or weeks.I live alone in a small 1BR apt. No friends or family around me, and I barely communicate with anyone. So if I were to finally be able to die, no one would even notice for days or weeks until the smell of my dead corpse bothers my downstairs neighbor enough to call the cops.
