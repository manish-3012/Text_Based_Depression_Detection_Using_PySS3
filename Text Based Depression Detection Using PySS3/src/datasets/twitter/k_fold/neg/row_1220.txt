Life is too muchIn the last 5 years my life has been hell. Went into business with family aged 21, got fucked over,  cheated and ripped off by a lot of people, nearly had my marriage split up over it. My stress and anxiety levels have been cranked up to the max for so long, I don't remember what happy feels like. My family betrayed me and abandoned me, haven't even bothered to contact me in over a year.

I bought a house with my husband, I thought having something to focus on would make me better. It was a terrible idea, the house is so fucked. I think I'm going to go bankrupt trying to fix it. My husband moved to the other side of the world for a new job, and I'm meant to go over too so I have two weeks to try and finish it, find a renter and get ready to move to a different country and I just don't see it happening. Ive already injured myself trying to do all the work that needs a team by myself.

Basically I feel like I should just give up now. I keep trying and I either fuck it up or get screwed over and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of putting on a happy face, I'm sick of being positive for other people and I'm sick of being in pain all the time. I want to finish it but I don't want to upset whoever will find me, that is literally the only thing that stopped me tonight. Still trying to be too damn considerate of other people. So I guess I'll just go down a bottle of wine and see what tomorrow might bring or if I'm lucky I just won't wake up.
