HiBeing lonely is hard. Knowing you're alone is even harder. People are always there for you, and there's always support, but none of that matters. I just want friends again. I just want to be her friend again. I was so abusive without even knowing it, so caught up in believing my popularity could save me from any situation. I'm 16 and doubtful that I'll make it to 17. I have plans, and I know things do get brighter and better but I have no internal happiness. Nothing makes me happy. I smile, I laugh, but it doesn't matter. It's so dramatic. Living is hard, dying is easy.
