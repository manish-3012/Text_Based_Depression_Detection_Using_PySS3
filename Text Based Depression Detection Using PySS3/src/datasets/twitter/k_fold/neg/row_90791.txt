How to deal with angerI tried to kill my mom and I today. I didn't mean to, but we kept arguing about the same little point. I said something she didn't agree with, and around and around we went. I am okay with what happened, although I don't like that I did it, but I don't know what my dad is going to do. I just want to get better. Started Cymbalta like 10 days ago, switched from another drug that we found out wasn't really working that well.
