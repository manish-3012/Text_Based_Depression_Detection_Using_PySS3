Suicidal breakdowns.I donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s a name for them but Iâ€™m going through one right now. It feels like Iâ€™m drowning and all I want to do is just swallow a bunch of pills and go to sleep.

I keep telling myself all these lies about how itâ€™ll get better but I know these breakdowns are going to keep happening until Iâ€™m too weak to get through them anymore. Itâ€™s only a matter of time.
