No interest in myself or real lifeI play video games and watch anime a lot. I enjoy other worlds much more than my own. People tell me about the good qualities i have and how i am good at my job and such. But none of that matters to me, because this world is boring, and shitty. I always tried creating imaginary friends and characters and pretend to live with them in a different world, until i have to wake up to go to class or work. Iâ€™m 22, male, and i really wish i could just die and leave this world, or at least go into a coma. 

I have tried for years to find reasons to like life and this world, but to no avail. I have trouble finding the right combination of meds to take with my psychiatrist. My therapist tells me i have an addiction to video games, but its not like theres anything else i like in the world (ive searched and tried). Iâ€™m not sure what to do. I have important responsibilities i HAVE to do (not want to), and id much rather stay in bed and escape this shithole of a world than do anything
