Feeling utterly hopeless. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't want to live either.I've been having a damn rough time lately. I'm currently in my mid-20's and still living at home. I decided to go back to school to try to become a doctor, but my grades are simply not good enough to enter the competitive medical school process. I've been lying to my parents the entire time, and I know they will soon find out. We are already sort of strained in our relationship. I want to become a doctor very badly, but some days I don't want to get out of bed, I feel so awful and just sad. I wish I had someone to talk to, but I witnessed how my family stigmatized my own sister's bout with mental illness. I work at a hospital and can see the doctors and providers making fun of people with suicidal tendencies. They don't give a fuck if they get help or not. 

To top this off, a girl I previously dated told me there was no possibility of us ever getting back together. I took this rather hard. I was head over heels for this girl. She was the only person I seemed to connect to. I don't have very many friends since I moved back home, so she was a welcome change. After she told me I had no chance of ever reentering the picture, I drove to where we had our last date and walked around, quietly sobbing. I felt so broken. I still do. 

I often just wish I could go to sleep and never wake up. That's my fantasy. I don't want to kill myself, but I certainly don't want to live, either. I tried calling the veteran suicide hotline (I served), and the guy was of no help whatsoever.  One of my hobbies is to read books on history. I try to remind myself that Lincoln and Churchill, great figures in history, were severely depressed, but it doesn't make me feel any better. Everyday, I wish I could just walk into the ocean and never come back up. 

If you made it to the end of my sad ramblings, I want you to know how much I appreciate you.
