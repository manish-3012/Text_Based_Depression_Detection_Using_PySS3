I'm just out of the strength to do this.This is my first post here, and I'm hoping my last. 

Today I did extensive research on exit bags. I have set aside a day to clean myself and my home, and then just... breathe until it's over. 

I've been fighting my demons and mental illness since I was a child. My first suicide attempt was when I was nine, and at that time I had a loving family and everything going for me.

Despite trying every mental health resource available to me, there have been no improvements for 25 years of my life. I think that's enough suffering, especially since being metally ill has taken every decent part of my life
