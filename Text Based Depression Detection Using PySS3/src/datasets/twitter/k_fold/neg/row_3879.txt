I'm going crazy.I went to a comiccon and they were selling these really fancy knives and other weapons for collecting. I couldn't stop looking at them. I'm too young to buy them plus my mother knows I used to self-harm and she would never let me buy one. I don't know, they just made me feel really really weird, my adrenaline kicked in and I can't stop thinking about how I felt when I was holding them. Having a whole collection of knives would be awesome. I feel like I'm going crazy.
