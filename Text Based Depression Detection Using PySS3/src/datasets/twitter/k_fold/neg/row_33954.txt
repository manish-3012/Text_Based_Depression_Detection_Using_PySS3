Iâ€™m insignificantThis earth is just a tiny spec compared to the universe. Nothing I do now or ever will ever matter, because one day everyone is going to be gone and nothing any of us did will matter. I could kill myself today and nothing will change. My family would be sad, but for how long? Once my parents and siblings die my name will be forgotten and everything I ever accomplished will go with it. Once i die Iâ€™ll be forgotten as if I never existed in the first place, so why not just end it now?
