I texted everyone 'I love you' and I wrote the note.I'm usually really good about asking for help, but this time I just told everyone I loved them, missed them. Some people I said I would see them tomorrow or that we should really meet up soon.

I wrote down all of the things I would miss about living. I told them I was sorry. I told them I felt guilty about leaving too soon. But then I told them I feel guilty for being such a burden all the time. My longterm boyfriend told me that I'm the reason he gets angry and for the first time I didn't have it in me to argue.

I'm the reason my mom cries when I don't answer the phone. I'm the reason my friends always check my arms for fresh marks. I'm so tired of feeling responsible for them. I think we'd all feel a lot better if I was just gone.

I am going to miss birthday cake and ice cream. Sunsets. I am sad for the first dates I will never go on and the first kisses that might have followed. I will miss my cat. I will miss trashy reality TV shows.

But I will not miss feeling sad. I will not miss hospitals and emergency rooms. I will not miss therapy appointments and "hold on pain ends" posters. I will not miss locking myself in the bathroom with a pair of scissors. I will not miss crying myself to sleep.

I hope they know I love them. 

I hope they know how hard I tried.

EDIT:
Called mom and a friend. Talked it out for a while. Ignored loser boyfriend for most of the night. Didn't have the heart to throw the note away. Can't sleep now. 

There's a lot going on. Dropped out of college, switching therapists, fired from my job. It's all falling apart at once.

I'm just trying to get to tomorrow. Thank you for seeing me. Thank you all.
