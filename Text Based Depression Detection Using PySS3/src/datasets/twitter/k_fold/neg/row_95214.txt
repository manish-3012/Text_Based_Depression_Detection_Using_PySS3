Help me pleaseI wanna end myself

I make my family angry, I accidentally hurt my gf, Iâ€™m dull and have emotional issues. I just feel like it isnâ€™t worth it anymore. Iâ€™m 18 and can barely take care of myself. I feel useless. I try to do better but itâ€™s like smashing my head against a brick wall. At this point I just want to end it. I donâ€™t know what else to do. Iâ€™ll just keep on hurting the ones I love. Even when Iâ€™m trying to help. My dad hates me and my moms in a different province. I live with my brother but I only make life more difficult for him and his kids. I just donâ€™t see it as worth it anymore. I do more harm than good.
