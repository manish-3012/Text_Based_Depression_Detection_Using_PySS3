Nothing left to live for... (Non-lethal suicidal thoughts?)I've thought about suicide at least once a day for months.

I've never really feel like I'm an actual danger to myself; I don't believe in religion or any version of the afterlife and therefore am not really in any rush to bring the end any faster...

But I wish I would.

I spend every day in constant emotional agony. I'm barely twenty-one, and yet I feel like my entire life is over. I've compulsively slammed the door on every chance I've ever had for happiness.

The only person I've ever really loved, my best (and honestly: only) friend of five years, turned out to be a near-sociopath. Lying and cheating on me for months, even though I knew well enough to tell when she's lying. And it's left me this emotionally broken husk of a human being.

I failed two classes last semester, because I couldn't even manage to muster up any reason to care enough.

I spend most days entirely in bed, completely unable to think or do anything else.

Talking to family members makes me feel sick. Talking to my closest friends makes me feel sick. Talking to /people/ makes me feel sick with anxiety. I trust no one, and I want to meet no one.

It just feels pointless. Like everything I do will end in misery,  and I desperately want to die. I won't do it... but I also can't keep going like this...
