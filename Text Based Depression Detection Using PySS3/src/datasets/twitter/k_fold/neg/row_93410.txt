Im going to sleep tonight i need somone to talk me out of itThis is my first post on reddit literally ever 

Hey reddit

I would say that the suicidal thoughts started when I was in 6th grade when people started judging you on ur looks not personality. Well there was one goddamn fucking problem with me that everyone thought they should exploit I was too skinny. They started teasing me about things that weren't even true like how I never eat or never work out. Well truth be told I always worked out and eaten trying to get bigger. I had friends so I didn't even care at the time then fucking highschool came. My life went down hill since the first day of freshman year of high school. I lost all of my so called friends because I wised up and realized that they weren't really my "friends" they didn't call me friend they called me punching bag. So when I entered high school my friends spread rumors about me, everywhere about my sexuality, and crushes. But the worst part was when they organized a fight between me and a bunch of jocks. All they did was tell them some fake ass story with a bunch of holes In it and they all come and beat my ass twice. 1 person who weighs a 100 pounds versus a 300 pound behemoth. I now have no self esteem ,friends,  or love life the way I see it is I have no future with myself as of right now I'm now a junior in highschool who weighs a 120 lbs and I still get bullied by even freshman. I dont see myself getting any friends in the future and definitely don't see myself with another girl. This story is probably hard to read but please, bear with me ive got no one else to  talk to but reddit 

Thanks
