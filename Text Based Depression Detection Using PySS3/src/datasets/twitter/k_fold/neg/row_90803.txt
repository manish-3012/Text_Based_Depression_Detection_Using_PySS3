I am so conflicted i have no way outive done nothing but burden the lives of others through my depression i am so insignificant worthless and powerless and i dont want to live after this year I cant even cry properly anymore as soon as i open my eyelids i already feel that overwhelming dark heaviness and to think that my mom struggles with this too makes me want to die even more I dont want to live Being alive is not for me i am so alone and isolated i dont know how to function normally I keep having these vivid visualizations of me getting hit by a car agonizing on the floor after overdosing or slitting my wrists its to the point where i look at dolls and i feel so much envy and jealousy because they dont have life
