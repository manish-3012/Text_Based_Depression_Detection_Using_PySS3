I lost a beautiful, loving, caring girlfriend of 6 years due to my financial and emotional stinginess with her. I really don't think I deserve to be here, I am too ungrateful.We had 2 cats and 2 dogs, a beautiful home and I didn't make her feel special like she asked me to. My gifts were always bought last second, my cards were not very thoughtful, we would pretty much split all the bills.  I thought being loving and caring with our animals, respectful and complementing her was enough. But I could've told her how beautiful she was more often, taken her out on more dates, not split everything all the time, I could've done so much better. She didn't ask much of me and I just didn't put enough effort. 

There's just so much more and I can't even get myself to write down more details and ways I messed up. But she was amazing and I truly fucked up a beautiful thing. 

Now her love for me is completely gone, she has lost respect for me and even cheated towards the end before breaking up with me with how fed up and tired she got. 

Now I'm back at my parents, without our cats and dogs and her. It truly is over and I honestly just don't care for trying anymore. My mom is worried but her husband seems to be getting annoyed at my inability to push forward. My ex just no longer gives a fuck about my existence. I'm ashamed of how I acted and how ungrateful I was with everything I had.

She is 26 and I'm 31. I honestly don't have it in me to keep going. I'm  even glad she will now get to be happy and possibly meet someone who values her more than I did. But I just feel so much guilt over how I took her for granted. I just wish I could make it up to her for the rest of our lives but it's so late now.

How could I be so fucking stupid. Someone like me with so much to be grateful for and take sit all for granted like I did should not be here.
