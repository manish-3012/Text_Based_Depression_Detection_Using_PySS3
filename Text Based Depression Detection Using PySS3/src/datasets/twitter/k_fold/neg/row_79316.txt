Why should I live?14,losing my teenage years ,socially VERY awkward,,got no talents,no friends,a failure at life,I fuck up whenever I try to do anything,ugly face,everybody hates me,I never felt loved by anybody,I don't know why I should live,there's no point!
Don't tell me to live to 'not make my parents sad',when I suicide,all they'll think about is that I'm going to 'hell'...                            

I guess life isn't for everybody.
                                                             
Fuck school,fuck religion,fuck life,fuck everything.
