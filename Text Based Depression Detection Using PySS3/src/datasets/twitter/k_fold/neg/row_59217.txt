spending our "15 month anniversary" without youever since we stopped talking on a daily basis, things have been getting harder and harder. if life wasn't hard already, things are getting worse. my family, my workplace, everything is making life harder and more despicable, and i feel like collapsing without you, but today, today was probably the worst day yet. i just want to wake up again to your messages, to wake up and have you say everything was just a bad nightmare. i miss you so badly, and i love you so much. my love for you hasn't faded one bit. i don't want to live anymore.
