GF of a year told me to kill myself and I still keep going back to her, can anyone explain whyWeâ€™re both 18 I told my girlfriend things id never told anyone before like how when I was 8 I tried to take my own life with pills but pussied our and just ended up being sick and throwing up for a while, how I was depressed thru middle school because I never fit in and how I drill contemplate suicide sometimes. 

We got into a big argument a week or two ago over text and she told me to kill myself and that next time I have my Glock to my head(my uncles Glock he keeps in a safe) to stop being scared and pull the trigger

I told myself after she said those things I was done and I hated her but itâ€™s been so many days and I still keep going back to her and calling and texting and I know itâ€™s bad and she said she just blacked out but every time I see the messages they make me bawl my eyes out. Is there a description for being overly attached to someone even if theyâ€™re bad for you? Thanks for reading this I needed to tell someone other than my myself in my head
