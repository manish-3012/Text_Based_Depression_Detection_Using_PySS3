No will to do anythingThird day now that I canâ€™t gather the strength to get out of bed. I havenâ€™t eaten. I havenâ€™t done anything. I just have this overwhelming cloud of depression over me. All I can do is cry then feel numb  for some time.  I hate struggling with mental health. I feel like Iâ€™m a freak. I hate that people only want me around them when Iâ€™m upbeat. My boyfriend left me because of my depression ðŸ˜” I struggle so much to stay in reality.  It sucks
