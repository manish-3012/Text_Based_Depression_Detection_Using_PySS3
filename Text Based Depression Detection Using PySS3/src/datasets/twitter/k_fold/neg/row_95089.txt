I need to feel alive againI need to feel alive again. I don't understand why any of this is happening. Why I feel numb. Why I feel like I'm not alive. Why I feel inhuman. I'm never there, in the moment, living life. It's blocking me and placing guilt upon me. The guilt of wasting peoples time, space, and money to keep me, a dead person inside a loving corpse, alive. I can't deal with that guilt anymore...this is it. I'm offing myself if this isn't done by the end of the month.
