I desperately want to die.I am a trans woman, two months into my transition.  I hate almost everything about my life.  

I don't know that I will ever pass. There is a good chance I am giving up my life as a 'normal' male and trading it in for a life of unending pain, ridicule, and alienation.  

I feel as though I am a burden to all of my friends and family.  I am depressed constantly and every time I speak with them I feel as though a never ending stream of complaints and sadness spews forth from me.  I don't know how they are still dealing with me.

I love my wife very deeply, and while she is supportive, she has been clear on the fact that she does not want to be married to a woman.  I accept this, and support her decision/need to move on.  We are attempting to maintain a friendship, as she is one of my biggest supports, and I feel like I need her to get through the transition.  At the same time, she is already dating someone new (who happens to be a co-worker), and it is destroying me.  I came home the other night and they were on the couch together, just holding hands, but that simple gesture nearly broke me.  Every time I make progress towards being OK with where they are, and the process of separation with her, she takes another step farther away.  Each one of those steps feels as though it is stomping my soul, and any possibility of happiness into oblivion.

I feel as though there is no where that I belong, no place I will ever find love, and that I am completely and utterly alone.  

I get through each day by waking up and forcing myself to get to tomorrow, simply so that I can do it all over again.  I don't want to continue however.  I want it to stop.
