T's advice brought me back to suicidal thoughtsI hadn't had suicidal thoughts in a long time and T wanted me to push my boundaries and said I HAD to do it 10 minutes a day no matter what. Within 2 I was crying, within 5 I was having my first panic attack in months. I was set on continuing because T said I had to but my partner got mad at me for it which just made everything worse. My brain is screaming at me to die and there's nothing I can do.
