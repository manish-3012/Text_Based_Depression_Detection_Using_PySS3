Ruined my favorite shirtI fell asleep at 3am with a gun next to me last night.  I woke up at 6am for physical therapy.   I wore my favorite shirt.  I hesitated, because the new tech is an idiot and stretches out my shirt collar so she can put electrodes on me.   But I decided I didnâ€™t think she be there.  

She was.  Sheâ€™s awkward, stares at me for entire sets of exercises.   I finish and try to leave early.  But the physical therapist pressures me into getting the TENS machine.  Sure enough, the tech stretches my shirt collar out to my shoulder so she can shove her hands down there.   Itâ€™s a baggy shirt, why couldnâ€™t you just go up the sleeve like a normal person.  

Sure enough, permanently stretched.   Doesnâ€™t fit anymore and the collar is flared out on one side.   It was old enough, the elastic is a lot more fragile than the other shirts of mine sheâ€™s ruined.

A stupid fucking $25 piece of cotton T-shirt I got as a gift, the texture fit and style of which I canâ€™t replace.  Not that Iâ€™d get gifted anything anymore anyway.  

And I just want to die - it almost would have been better if it ended last night.   I try to make progress with my health - or anything for that matter - and all I suffer is more casualties.  

How does a person not know to stretch out someoneâ€™s shirt collar ??   Is this not a common problem for everyone ?

Holy fuck it seems so stupid and it makes me feel awful.  Pure fucking awful among everything else going on.   I have very few clothes I like anymore.
