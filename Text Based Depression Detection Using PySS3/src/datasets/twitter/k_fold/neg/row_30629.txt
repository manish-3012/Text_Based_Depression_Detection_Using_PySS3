Today might be the dayAfter a few months of herpes outbreaks and fear I'm gonna transmit it to my girlfriend. I think I want to go ahead and end my life because I cant stand to lose her over this and I dont wanna go on living and having to disclose to people after we're over I think I'm gonna start divvying out my person belongings to family (I have no friends to give anything to) and go get a motel tonight and blow my head off. Dont see too many options left for me and I think I've seen enough in life
