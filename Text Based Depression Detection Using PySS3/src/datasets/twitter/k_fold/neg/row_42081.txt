My 25th birthday is in a month.And I hate it. I havenâ€™t accomplished anything. Everybody is always sharing good news. I donâ€™t have anything to share. I have a stupid disease that causes me to gain weight in my midsection and I also grow facial hair. I have another condition where I have huge scaly patches all over my head &amp; this condition is also causing my hair to fall out. I hate my life. Itâ€™s so pointless. Every time I say Iâ€™m the family disappointment or that I wish I was dead, everyone thinks Iâ€™m joking. Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m fucking screaming out for help &amp; itâ€™s not taken seriously. Why the fuck did I ever have to be born? Was I put here to be the family embarrassment? Every single day just gets worse and worse. I know people say it gets better but it never does. The only way this gets better is if I die.
