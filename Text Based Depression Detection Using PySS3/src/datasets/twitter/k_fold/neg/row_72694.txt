Help me, I need to escapeI'm 25, pretty sick of my life right now. Been working for the last 3 years. Lately I've been feeling worse than usual. Every day is a struggle and nothing makes me feel good. I feel stuck. 


I have constant thoughts of killing myself. Sometimes when I drive I just want to crash my car into something and hope I die. This happens at least once a day.


I don't have to kill myself to escape though, I have around $25k saved up. I can go anywhere I want in the world and just... chill there while I get my shit together. I'm sick of working, sick of being around the people I'm around, etc.


I don't consider myself a traveler so I have no idea where to start with this plan. Help
