I tried.....Please just help me, I am 11 and I havenâ€™t slept in 24 hours. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me, I canâ€™t sleep I start to break down and cry in class, and I havenâ€™t eaten in 2 days. My parents are getting worried and I canâ€™t stop thinking about dieing. I want to die I want to stop feeling sad, what is wrong with me?

I want to talk to someone anyone at all, Iâ€™ve tried to give my mom a clue but, sheâ€™s looked pasts them. A note of my pillow, a desperate text for help, me sobbing in my room. Nothing.

I have asked and asked again â€œCan I talk to someone?â€ And she just reflects it changing the subject.

JUST HELP ME
