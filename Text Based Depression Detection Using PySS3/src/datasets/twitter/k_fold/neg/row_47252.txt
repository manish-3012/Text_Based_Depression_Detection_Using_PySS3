Why do I even bother? Nobody even cares about meHonestly I don't know where to start. I've been like this for a few years now. Thought it would subside by now. Let me cut the point. I don't want to be alive. I get it I get it. You either are going to say "I don't care" or call me edgy and emo. But trust me, I just want to be free. I'm tried of life, tired of people, just everything. It's gotten harder to distract myself from everything. I've just been like this for nearly 6 years. Nearly jumped off a bridge when I was 11. Do you get the point? I'm not depressed depressed, I'm just in the middle. I feel like I trust people online more then my parents, or anyone irl. I just want to end everything, but I'm to pussy to blow my head off. But I can't be alive. Where the fuck do I do? Nobody needs me, I'm not needed anywhere people use me for shit and then just leave me. Do I just end it all? I can't live like this, on and off suicide thoughts with no intentions on doing it. Suicide hotline is the biggest joke don't believe what they say about it. People say they care about me when they really don't. I would type more but why bother as nobody cares about this. (Sidenote: Not that anyone cares but I've cried 3 seperate times writing this and it only took 10 minutes to type it all. Again, I'll explain more in the comments if you want, ask question I'll try my best to answer.)
