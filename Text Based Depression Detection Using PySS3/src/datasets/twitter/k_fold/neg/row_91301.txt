I donâ€™t know what the point isI donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting. No value will come from venting my pain. 

Iâ€™m so tired of waking up every day. Iâ€˜m sick of going to work and living my life. I see absolutely no true happiness in my future, everything is tainted by a medical condition I have. Iâ€™m in almost constant pain, often debilitating. Iâ€™m only 24 and it feels like my body is falling apart. I feel like Iâ€™m just waiting until I find the straw that breaks my back. 

And no one gets it. No one understands why I might find death preferable to life, because *they* enjoy life. Their perspective is completely different. They always try to prevent you from killing yourself and Iâ€™m so sick of it. If I want to die thatâ€™s my choice. 

I tried to find a therapist, and I went through 21 before I finally found one who agreed to meet with me. I donâ€™t even know why I tried so hard to find a therapist though, I donâ€™t believe that theyâ€™ll help the situation. No one can help the situation. Iâ€™m just broken. I hate who I am.
