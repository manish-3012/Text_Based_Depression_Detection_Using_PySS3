You matter to meI was born into a broken family. My mother was raped by her grandfather from the time she was two until she turned 12 and he died. She was scarred her whole life. She married my asshole, narcissistic father and had three children before divorcing him. I am the middle child. Being the middle child, I was ignored the mass majority of my childhood. I loved my sisters, and we were close. Up until four years ago, everything was okay. Besides being stuck in-between my mother and fathers fights, life was alright. Then my older sister got into a car accident. She died instantly. Her and my father had not talked months prior to this. My mom quit her job, I turned to drugs and alcohol, la-de-da. I stopped talking to my dad. He did nothing but call me stupid, tell me I was a worthless bitch who didn't deserve anything, and leave me bruised. My younger sister stays with him, and I stay with my mom. We break even more every day. My mom is buried in debt. We're barely scraping by, and she doesn't work because she is too depressed. My older sisters best friend, and a close friend of mine died in a bus crash recently, also. My best friend moved to another state, and another friend of mine hung himself. Life has done nothing but shit on me. I have thought about suicide. It would be nice, wouldn't it? To show everyone how much they really need me? I'm the rock. I can't show how broken and depressed I really am, because if I'm not the one comforting people and absorbing all the toxicity in their lives, then who will? But if all the death surrounding me has taught me anything, its that life has value. My shit life, your shit life, it doesn't matter. I genuinely cannot think of anything that I would want more than to see the people on this subreddit wake up one day and realize what it took me so fucking long to learn. Even if no one else does, I care about you. That probably doesn't mean much coming from a random person on the internet, but I would give my life to save you. I would do anything to put a smile on your beautiful face. You matter. You're important. Maybe I'm being naive and people will scoff at this idiocy of a post, but I had to get it out there. I genuinely love you and value your life. Just hang on, friend. Greater things will come.
