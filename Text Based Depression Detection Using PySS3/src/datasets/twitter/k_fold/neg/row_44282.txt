Suicide Date setI'm 26. Been experiencing depression  since I was 13 and was diagnosed bipolar 2. I have multiple suicide attempts. At a young age I never felt like I was going to live very long. My life has always been this vicious cycle of a long period of depression and sadness followed by what appears to me getting my life together then it seems to fall apart again. In my teens I gave myself a sorta deadline. I'd get my problems in order and have a good life by my 27th birthday or I'd take my own life. I have 3 more months... Half of my life battling demons I don't understand. I feel too tired to do this anymore.
