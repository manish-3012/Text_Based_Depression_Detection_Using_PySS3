Time-bomb?For a long time, since I was maybe sixteen (I'm 23 now), I've been pretty sure that I'll  kill myself. Maybe not now, maybe not for ten or twenty years, but it'll happen eventually. Every time I'm particularly unhappy or when something upsets me, I start to compulsively think about ending it. 

Every move that I make feels like an increasingly desperate attempt to postpone it. I just feel broken and inherently flawed, and I don't think it'll ever change.
