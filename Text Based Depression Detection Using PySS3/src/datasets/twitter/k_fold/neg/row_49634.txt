the unknowns about what happens "after"I want to be convinced that suicide will bring resolution but for me, resolution specifically means an end to all awareness and being. I want no signs that I have ever existed. But, my fear is that there is, in fact, an afterlife where we continue "existing" in perpetuity or worse yet, we end up reincarnating back into the physical world we thought we had just left behind. 

Frieda Kahlo had said something to the effect that it would be a horror to die only to find yourself reincarnating back into the same existence. 

Not that I'm religious but I do understand that there is a possibility that some religious explanations of the afterlife are accurate. Then there's actual accounts of individuals who have experienced minutes of clinical death and reported either lights or just an overall feeling of peace accompanied by absence of feeling. 

A peaceful existence independent of feeling is not really what I want. I just want the lights to go out. The fact that we have no way of knowing what we're signing up for with a big decision as suicide is very frustrating. How do the rest of you reconcile with the fact that there are no guarantees that come with death?
