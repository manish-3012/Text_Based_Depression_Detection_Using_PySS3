June 6th. Maybe sooner. My final day here.Iâ€™m not putting up with this anymore. Iâ€™m tired of my abusive Father who I have no choice to put up with. Iâ€™m tired of being trans and not being able to do anything about it. Iâ€™m killing myself within a month. Maybe iâ€™ll find one of the guns, maybe iâ€™ll take a bunch of pills and see if it actually works this time. Iâ€™m not doing it. No more. The 6th is my 18th birthday. I have no way of moving out, not only because I canâ€™t find a place but I donâ€™t make anywhere near enough money to. Iâ€™m just going to die and everyone else will finally be happy. Making other people makes me happy, so death will finally bring me my happiness. I donâ€™t know if iâ€™ll leave a note or not. The only people who will miss me is my girlfriend, but sheâ€™ll move on and find someone better. My cat will miss me, but over time sheâ€™ll forget about me. Goodbye all. Fuck this cruel world. Iâ€™ve seen everything in life and itâ€™s not a good thing. And regardless what iâ€™ve been told. Things NEVER get better.
