I am not adjusting wellI've never actually posted on Reddit before. I don't post on social media often - I'm insecure. I don't really want people to see me. 

I'm really struggling. Ever since I was a kid, I've had a difficult time handling and regulating my emotions. I haven't actually been diagnosed with anything, although I've been in therapy off and on several times since I was little. I know I am depressed, and I am almost 100% certain I'm also experiencing generalized anxiety disorder. 

I can't function. It seems like every year brings something newer and more difficult without something good in equal weight. I can't pretend that there aren't good things in my life or that I don't have opportunities. I just feel so heavy. All the time.
I started dating my boyfriend a little under a year and a half ago, though we've been friends for over six. He's amazing, he truly is, and I have no idea where I'd be physically, mentally, or emotionally without him. A couple months after we started dating, he confessed that he was struggling with depression (which was ongoing for him, as well) and talked about suicidal thoughts. He didn't have much of a support system where he was going to school and ended up moving back into his mom's house. He has a good relationship for her, but he was basically in the same situation, just a different place. He and I were "long-distance" at the time, but could usually see each other twice a month. Every day I would wake up, go to work, go to school, come home and do homework, then talk on the phone with him for hours at a time while we played games together. Video games aren't really my thing, but we found some that we both liked to play, plus it gave us both a way to distract ourselves. Sometimes he would disappear for a day. Sometimes I could tell he was extremely drunk when he texted me. Sometime the things he said didn't make sense at all. He was hurting. It took a toll on me even though I was willing to do anything to help him. It killed me to know the person I loved was hurting and that I couldn't do anything about it.

I was focused on him, but there was still so much else I needed to pay attention to. My longest, truest, best, and most fulfilling friendship fell apart and I don't know if we'll ever be friends again. I moved out of my abusive stepfather's household to a new city with her after I graduated high school - we lived together for nearly four years and were friends for almost six. We weren't mature enough when we were younger to communicate when things were wrong in our relationship, and so neither of us said anything when we were displeased with each other. It built up. We got in arguments about money - she rarely paid rent on time and we were getting shutoff notices from our utilities. I got home one day last January after my first day of the new semester, working, and running errands all over town without a car to find a shutoff notice for the electricity after getting a notice from our landlord the day before. I felt out of control, like I was being overlooked. She didn't seem to care. I couldn't move back in with my parents like she could if we got evicted and couldn't find a new place (which was likely). Something in me snapped, we argued, we stopped talking, she didn't pay, she told me she was moving out, and that was that. We've talked a few times, but I'm still angry. I'm sure she is, too. 

My boyfriend moved in, and things were good for awhile. I finished my last full semester at the community college I was attending with only one summer class left, and with good grades. Our apartment was starting to feel like home, and it was so good to finally have him by my side. His mental health got better. He found a job here that he loves and has been happy and healthy for over seven months now. 

Summer was when my mental health got really bad. I started seeing a therapist again at the end of April. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been helpful, but honestly sometimes I can't focus enough to try to change what I'm thinking or feeling. The only thing that gets me out of my head is distraction, and I'm convinced the buildup just shows up later. If one more person suggests I meditate, I swear to God...anyway. ALL of my friends moved away, aside from the friendship that fell apart. So now I am mostly alone and feeling guilty for putting my mental illness on no one but my boyfriend. I started at a four-year university this semester, and I am not adjusting to it. I feel out of place, I feel weird, I feel unfocused and less ambitious and driven than them. I'm intelligent, but I can't focus on anything anymore. I'm so tired all the time. I'm only taking 11 credits but I feel like I'm constantly dragging my feet. I was working 30 hours a week, managing the coffee shop where I met all of my friends that I made here. I had to quit, I just couldn't do it anymore. In retrospect, I left one of the only safe places I had left, no matter how much it stressed me out. 
Suicide is always at the back of my mind. I haven't talked to anyone about it, not even my counselor. I'm scared to give up any freedom I have by admitting I have these thoughts. I haven't told my boyfriend, but I'm almost certain that he knows. He called off work the other day because I was in such bad shape and knew I needed someone to be with me. Sometimes it doesn't even come from a particular stressor. Sometimes it just starts - I feel heavy and my throat swells up, and I cry all the time. I cry so much. I can't stop. I hate being in public, especially at school. I don't know how to move or how to interact with people. I'm so tired. No one I talk to understands. I can't make myself understood. 
I don't think I'm going to kill myself. I've made it through hard times before, although they didn't last this long and weren't as intense. I'm going to Planned Parenthood to change my birth control method next week, which I'm praying is going to help. I have to find a new counselor because mine is no longer going to be counseling. If I'm still having trouble after being off the pill for awhile, I'm going to ask for a prescription. I need to be out of this hole. I need to be lighter. I need to find some sort of light in the world again.
