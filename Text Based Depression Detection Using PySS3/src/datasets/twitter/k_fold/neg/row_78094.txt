Turned away from the ERSo, I tried to kill myself with pills two nights ago.  My friend called 911 and the police took me in cuffs to the ER.  I arrived in a psychotic state, and was put in 4-points restraints.  I thought at least they would keep me for the 3-day observation hold (and maybe, just maybe, that I would get admitted and finally get the help I really need), but as soon as I came somewhat back to "normal" they released me and sent me home!  

I've been in the ER before and felt like I had to lie about how I felt to be released, promising that I felt "much better now" and such.  This time, I was totally honest - "Do you feel better now?" "Not really." "Are you still suicidal?" "Yes." "What do you think you'll do when we release you?" "Get some sleep and try again tomorrow." "Okay, discharged, then!"  

They acted like I was attention-seeking.  They even asked me, "Are you the type of person who likes to be in the hospital because it makes you feel safe?"  Well, NO - I'd love nothing more than to not need to be in the hospital.  But isn't the hospital where you're SUPPOSED to be when you're not safe?  They made me feel like it wasn't even a real attempt - like I was a bored housewife who'd accidentally taken my allergy pills with Gallo.  

Then, to fucking add insult to injury, the next night the police came by my house AGAIN because apparently my upstairs neighbour reported that they were afraid that I "might be suicidal."  

I AM suicidal, for god's sake!  Except that I'm trying not to be; I really want help.  

"If this is an emergency, call 911 or go to your nearest hospital."  Yeah right.
