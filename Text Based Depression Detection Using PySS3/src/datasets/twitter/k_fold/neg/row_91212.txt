I'm feeling alone.So, I don't really know what to write other than I'm feeling alone and worthless. All of my friends turned their back on me because they don't want to deal with the depressed heroin addict. I've been clean for awhile due to money issues but I just got a job and soon will have absolutly nothing keeping me from her sweet release. Every night I contemplate ending everything. Every night I settle on ODing when I get my first paycheck. By morning I think it's rediculous I ever thought that way. I just don't know what to do. I want to die but I don't want to die. What's the point on keeping on when every day I think about heroin, and everything I lost to her? Fuck.
