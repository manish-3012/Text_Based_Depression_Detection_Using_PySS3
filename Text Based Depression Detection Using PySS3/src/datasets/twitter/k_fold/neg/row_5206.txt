Don't ask about reasons and my life,pleaseIs suffocating to death inside a plastic bag less painful from being hanged until death?
I just wanna die and sadly i don't have a gun or some cyanide or somthing like it,and im afraid of jumping from a bridge or a rooftop(and i hate the mess it'll leave)so i guess the easiest ways for me are these two,if you guys have a knowledge about how much pain they'll cause please tell me which is less painful
(And sorry about possible grammar errors,im not very good at English)
