Will the hospital actually help?I live in Ontario, Canada and I am extremely suicidal. I have a plan but I donâ€™t think I could follow through HOWEVER my partner just left me and I am going through some of the hardest shit Iâ€™ve ever dealt with and I have nobody to talk to and I donâ€™t know how I will ever move on from this... My whole life is in shambles and I have no will to live... It has been almost a week and I canâ€™t shake the suicidal feelings...

Will the hospital actually help or am I just making the backlogs of people worse? Will they just tell me it gets better and send me home? Will I come out worse? I donâ€™t know what to do
