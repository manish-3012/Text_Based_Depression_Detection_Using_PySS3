Why does life usually screw the nice peopleI've never thought myself as a bad person, I've been kind to those few i call friends and family yet how have these so called friends paid me back, they've used me and thrown away like trash only appearing when they need me it's not fair, i've never ever hurt anyone, I was bullied from school all the way to my first year in uni. At 21 I've realised my whole life has been one big disappointment plus i suffer from social anxiety. I don't think I'll make it threw uni.

With this lock down I'm stuck home with only a computer as a friend no one but mum checks up on me, i wake up everyday to nothingness, the loneliness now hurts physically i can barely get out of bed or eat. Happiness seems like a luxury I can't afford, all i want is a friend even one who really cares I'm so alone. I know everyday could be my last, the noose is ready and the note prepared, i just need the balls to go through with it.
