Terrible Suicide Case?  I am a weak and small person that know one respects.  I am treated like shit and abandon by society.  I am aggressive to people.  I think about murdering and killing others.  I take out rage on myself and pretend to slaughter the people that constantly disrespect and hurt me.  I like the grey sky that gives the depressing tone.  I like gore and violence and doing things that I find somewhat happiness towards but I fall into this void of grief and sorrow.  I am a hopeless one.  I am loading the bullet and not caring for what anyone thinks.  I don't care for life anymore.  I am accepting my fate.  I am glad that I am choosing to kill myself because it gives my a mature understanding of the cold and brutal reality of the human race.  I don't go to counselors or therapists. I like being this way.  Cold and sad makes me feel happy.  I have lost interest in friends, activities and prefer to be alone.  I am a sad and pathetic human being and wanted to say goodbye to the ones I cared about which is practically 0.  I am a loser that hangs myself with a guitar string and is bullied daily.  Thank you for the some out there that might of cared.  I fell safe on the internet but not in real life.  I hope my death is brutal and long so I can feel as much harm humanly possible to I die.  I don't care if there is nothing after death.  I am just typing to I feel a feeling in my heart.  Goodbye.  3/5/2020 suicide date
