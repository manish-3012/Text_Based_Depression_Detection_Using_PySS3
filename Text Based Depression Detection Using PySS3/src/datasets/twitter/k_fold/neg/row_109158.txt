ADHD Med Withdrawal...I take Lexapro and went off Concerta 5 weeks ago cold turkey.  I was taking one 54mg and a 27mg plus 10mg Methylphenidate later.  Anyone else quit stimulants cold turkey, share any tips?  The depression is hard.  I'm not thinking of hurting myself I just thought this would be the best place to start.
