I am real and not an imaginary burden - this is why I choose suicideHi ! 

I am 25 years old. 

Every day I am a burden for my parents and family and friends and this is why I decided to commit suicide. 

I am at a college I just can't take anymore. 

I have mental issues I can't deal with anymore.

And (most importantly) I am poisoned with regret and guilt every single day. This has to do with my past: there are so many things I have done wrong and so many things I wish I would have done differently and I just can't take this thinking anymore. 

Because of my regrets and guilt, I have a binge eating and binge drinking habit. Basically I am just one step away from drugs, but the point is that I still waste my parents' money because of these self-destructive habits and there is nothing I can do about it, I tried so many times to change myself and I just can't and I am tired of myself. 

So many times I have wanted to change and then I just end up being the same and I just don't want this anymore.

Thus, I decided to commit suicide in a few days. This isn't an impulsive decision, I have been thinking about it for years. 

I remember a childhood in which I was so different: I was balanced and strong and smart and I had things to give to this world and I loved doing things and living life. Now I'm just doing one stupidity after the other, I am a compulsive maniac, I am binge eater, a heavy drinker, a self-destructive college student and I know I just won't change. Every time I tried to change, I just ended up being worse. I become aggressive with people and I am harsh with them, not because they would have done something wrong to me, but because I am miserable and in pain.

I just wish people would understand suicide a bit more. I just wish some of you would stop thinking that all of us are self-victimizing idiots - we aren't, we sometimes truly just want to clean this world by getting rid of our filthy existence.
