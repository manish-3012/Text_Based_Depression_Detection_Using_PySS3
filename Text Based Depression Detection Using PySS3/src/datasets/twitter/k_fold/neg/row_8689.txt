Crashing from a manic episode and need a reality checkI've been changing my meds for what I initially thought were just depression and anxiety for the last few months. The most recent antidepressant I started on triggered a manic episode that has lasted for about two weeks, but is finally starting to taper off...I still haven't been eating or sleeping, but the unusual energy is burning off. I've already been prescribed a mood stabilizer, which I've been taking for about a week now, but it hasn't done anything yet. I'm still having a lot of racing, intrusive thoughts. Not necessarily suicidal ones, but lots about dying or people I care about dying. 


Does anyone have advice for dealing with unrealistic, intrusive thoughts while I wait for meds to help? It's been pretty worrying to still be feeling this way as I'm crashing back to a low. I don't have a plan to do anything, I just am especially scared of making stupid decisions as I try to force myself to stay manic for the sake of productivity as I'm crashing. I honestly haven't been able to help but to poke at it because the last couple weeks have been the most productive I've been all year.
