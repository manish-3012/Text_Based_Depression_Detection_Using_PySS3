I really want to kill myself but I don't know how to.I have come to the conclusion that I want to kill myself, and the thought of doing so makes me really happy. I'm not trolling or anything I just want to kill myself and I don't want to talk about why because the advice people give me makes me feel worse. I don't own a gun and I don't live near any tall buildings, and I really want to kill myself and I don't know how to do it in a way that is fool proof and a guaranteed death. I know this reddit is not for posts like this but if anyone can point me into a direction where I can find a way to kill myself at home that'd be really appreciated.
