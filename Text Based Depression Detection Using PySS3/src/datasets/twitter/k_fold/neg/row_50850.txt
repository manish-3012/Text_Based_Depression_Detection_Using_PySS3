Is it bad to have these suicidal thoughts tonight?I just canâ€™t make these thoughts of how useless and weird and stupid and pointless and ugly I am out of my head. Itâ€™s Christmas Eve and I spent it with my family, so I should be happy but I just hate myself so much still.

I donâ€™t wanna have suicidal thoughts on Christmas but Iâ€™m really deep in a depressive state and have been for months. I just want it to end and Iâ€™ve been trying to make strides to improve my life and myself but I still hate my life and I donâ€™t feel anything Iâ€™ve done has actually worked. 

I just want to talk to somebody tbh, Iâ€™m so lonely and my family and friends I donâ€™t really go to for this shit because theyâ€™re not the most selfless or caring of people.
