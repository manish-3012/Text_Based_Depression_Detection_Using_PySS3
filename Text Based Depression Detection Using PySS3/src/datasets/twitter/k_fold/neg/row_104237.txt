He's filing for divorceI have nothing once that goes into effect. No job, no money. No car. No house. The minute he hands me those papers, it will be that night. May be today, but I doubt it because he says he isn't coming home tonight. Of course he isn't. Tomorrow? I wish its tonight. This pain is too much. It hurts to even breathe.
