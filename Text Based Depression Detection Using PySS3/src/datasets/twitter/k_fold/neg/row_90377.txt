So i was single and numb all these yearsSo i was single and numb all these years. But around a month ago a girl came into my life and we talked for a couple of days and she said that she had a crush on me and proposed me a couple of days later and we hung out a couple of times and even i fell for her hard. And now she breaks up with me saying she doesnt see a future with me. And its all because of me. I was too insecure and did drugs. Idk what to do now. I cant get over her, I dont want to.
