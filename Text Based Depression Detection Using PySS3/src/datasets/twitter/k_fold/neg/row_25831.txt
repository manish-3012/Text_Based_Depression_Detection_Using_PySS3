Do people who have a fear of heights jump?Just curious because I often think that maybe the way to go is jumping off from a bridge, but one of my biggest fear is heights. Hell, I can't even look outside a window of a second floor building without almost passing out.
So I'm wondering, do people who have this fear jump or do they use other methods? I know it seems absurd to care if your intention is to die, but if I do decide to jump, I want it to be 100% my decision. not because I got so scared and slipped off when I wasn't ready yet.
