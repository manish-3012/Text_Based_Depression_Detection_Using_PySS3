Some wordsHello guys, sorry for my bad english, im mexican so i cant writhe good? Well maybe in a few days i end my life, you know i made a mistake and break with my girlfriend, i have a very hard case of depresion on that time and now is even worst, i was getting money for a computer so i can get my heat on other things, it was stolen in the way to the store... I hate this life so much, im trying to do the things rigth with my ex but i only hurt me so much, i leave it because i dont want to hurt it when i was so down... I made a mistake and im paying for it every moment, life dont have sense to me, i always look for the people you know making jokes and  that stuff so they can be happy and forget there problems,  now that i need they... Well im alone. And dont mention my family because they are part of the problem... Its a beautiful day to die...
