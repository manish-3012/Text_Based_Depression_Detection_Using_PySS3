Why do I even exist?Feels like I'm used as a punching bag for other people's emotional baggage and then thrown out into the cold like an animal. Is this what I'm here for? I have 3 people relying on me emotionally who would be devastated and have no emotional support if I died, but 0 of them I can go to. I feel like I'm a dropbox where people drop their negative emotions until I'm overflowing with them and can't breathe. Do I even exist beyond that purpose to these people? Why am I even here?
