I want to be important to someone, but it seems like that's not a possibility at allBecause, ultimately, what do I have to offer to people?

I'm too much of a socially incapable idiot to be able to form a meaningful relationship with anyone, there is nothing interesting about me that would have anyone want to interact with me, and I'm constantly too overwhelmed by everything around me / myself / the world in general to do anything to make myself interesting. 

I'm not a misanthrope by any means; I hold a deep love for people, especially so for those I consider close to me. There are people who I love being around, love every single engagement I have with them, but it always seems like these engagements become much more enjoyable/important for me than they are for others. 

In the end, I think I'm just a "secondary" person, at best, to those around me. Everyone always has someone better to turn to.

I've put so much effort into building, maintaining, and strengthening relationships as best I can over the past few years, I've demonstrated strong love and appreciation toward those I care about, and despite this I still feel like my presence in this world is worthless and entirely unnecessary. Nobody reaches out to me if I stop being socially active and isolate for awhile, for the most part I'm always the one who initiates conversation or anything at all with anyone. 

I can't force anyone to find me important, and I don't want to push or guilt anyone into anything. I'm not angry or bitter toward anyone, but, despite being useless human garbage with zero good qualities, a selfish part of myself just wants me to matter to someone.

I don't know if I want to die but living feels more and more like a bad idea every day.
