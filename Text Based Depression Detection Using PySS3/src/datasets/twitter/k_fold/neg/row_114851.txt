Honestly, what's the point of my existenceThis isn't even a post fishing for sympathy or whatever. I genuinely don't understand why i'm here.

I'm 24 years old, and bring no value to anyone on this earth. I live with my parents. I dropped out of high school. Hell, i don't even work. Like literally, except being a burden, i bring nothing else. Burden on society, burden on my parents, burden on myself. Is this called being suicidal? Not sure, don't care. 

To top it off i got all these chronic health issues that will follow me for life. So enjoying life solo isn't even an option.

I think it's about time i consider ending things, even if i am too much of a pussy to do it. Someday i'll gather the courage. Thanks for reading my venting, cheers.
