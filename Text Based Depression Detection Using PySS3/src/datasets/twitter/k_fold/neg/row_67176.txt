Counseling Red FlagsHey all. So I want some advice on what criteria have to be met before counselors have you involuntarily hospitalized. Iâ€™ve been seeing a counselor at my campus for a while now, and Iâ€™ve talked to her about my suicidal thoughts. She assured me Iâ€™d basically have to tell her I have active plans before sheâ€™d have me committed, but I know it may not be that rigid if she has genuine fears for my safety. Explaining my situation is probable easiest here. 

Iâ€™ve had a pretty bad bout of suicidal thoughts lately, and I think I know of an event that probably triggered it. I recently came into a bunch of hydrocodone from having multiple surgeries in a short span, and not using all of the pain meds. I wonâ€™t lie, having something so readily available does kinda intensify the thoughts. I want to be honest with my counselor about these things, but not at the cost of my freedom and lifestyle. Should I tell her or not? 

Iâ€™m sure a lot of you nice people are going to say I should tell her everything, but I have too much going on to be hospitalized right now. Itâ€™d really fuck my life up, so Iâ€™m avoiding it for now. Would these admissions be probable cause for her to have me committed?
