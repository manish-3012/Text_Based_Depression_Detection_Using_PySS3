Iâ€™m too pathetic to liveI ran out of cigarettes today and I cried because I realised Iâ€™m 20, and smoking cigarettes. At least I was until the United States Federal government banned me from doing so, which sucks too. 

Aside from my addiction, I have many other reasons to kill myself. I was recently told that I am on the autism spectrum, which really upsets me. Iâ€™m too sensitive and it interferes with my life. I havenâ€™t been able to switch jobs because I struggle to even speak half the time. I just think Iâ€™m being dealt an unfair hand right now. I mean it doesnâ€™t help that I canâ€™t find a boyfriend because my gnarled teeth, crater face, and ratty hair all make me a really ugly girl. 

Autistic, ugly, broke, and constantly suicidal. I donâ€™t want to live my life like this anymore and I feel so content with just ending it. But part of me keeps me going. This concoction of pills in my system right now is unlikely to kill me, and I know that. Part of me just prays Iâ€™m wrong and I get a dignified, painless death.
