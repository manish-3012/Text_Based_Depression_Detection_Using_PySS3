I'm going to finally do itI can't take this anymore. There's absolutely nothing wrong with my life, but I'm still miserably depressed, anxious, and want to die. I don't think there's a point to living if I have to live like this. I've wasted 20 years of life hoping that tomorrow will be better, when clearly nothing is going to change. I think I might finally be broken down enough to do it.
