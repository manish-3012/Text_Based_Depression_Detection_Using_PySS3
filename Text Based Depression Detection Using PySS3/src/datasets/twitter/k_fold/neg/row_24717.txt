Always feels as though one day I will kill myself as its gone on for 6 years now.I hope theres someone who can help me shake this feeling that Im not supposed to be alive. I have been in the hospital twice and seen over a dozen counsellors and it feels as though Im losing the will to get back up and get on with living. I have not worked a regular job in my life and make very little money, my mental state is so erratic but to me it makes perfect sense. I am transgender and my family dont accept me, I moved back home after graduation and have been swinging between being able to accomplish anything and wishing to not live another second. My family and friends no longer reason with my suicidal ideation and it worries me when I get back into those lows i wont be able to reach out to them. 

I live in the UK, I will be sanctioned before I do kill myself but its a miserable comfort that that is the only thing stopping me. Theres only so many times i can build back together the mental health fortitude to move forward in life and i see myself reaching that limit soon if nothing improves.
