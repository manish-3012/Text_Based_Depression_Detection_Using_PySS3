Past the point of no return...At age 20, I did something unspeakably deplorable, immoral, unethical and just downright sick. The people around me, unknowingly, have always cheered me on as a good person who goes out of their way to help others. Yet if they knew of what I've done, one thing in particular that crosses my mind daily; they would condemn me... even kill me. I was so scared of my heinous act, I ran away from home and tried keeping a low profile somewhere trashy. It's not enough though. I feel like my only options now are to either end it all or get a complete identity change. I'm taking plastic surgery, a shaved head, a changed name, and running further away. Having no money makes that a huge struggle. Even when I was on the phone to my mother, someone who has always been kind, concerning, and transparent in the sense of not judging others, I broke down in a pool of tears just as I was about to spill what had happened. Because I know how disappointed she will be. I know how disgusting what I did is. I'm still looking for ways to redeem myself, whether by blood or karma inevitably rearing is head. I can't ever sleep. The guilt, shame and remorse for what I've done are too much. There's nothing to overreact about, nothing I can do to alter the past, which is my only wish. I can only die for what I did. Painfully. What I did is going to dictate my life for the rest of it and has impaired me any chance of having a future. I cannot live with myself. I've had people physically restrain me from killing myself. Even my housemates steer the opposite direction because they see what I've done to my health and that I've genuinely lost all will to live. Changing my identity won't clear the burden. (I carry that with me everywhere yet always refuse to talk about exactly what it is and where I went so horribly wrong.) But it would give me a chance to feel safe. The hardest part would be cutting off all my friends and family. Real good people too. So respectable too. There's no way I was brought up where in any world it was acceptable to do what I did. Not that I deserve any good that comes my way. I feel so disgusting I don't even put in good health. I broke my ceiling light trying to hang from it, and I just can't take the strain of what I've done anymore. I'm nothing but vermin that unnecessarily takes up space on earth. Once people have discovered the truth, as it's floating out there, dangerously close to my social circles too, and words DO travel. People speak up. I know once it's out there and I've gone through with killing myself properly, no-one will miss me. I overshadow the good I do in life with something so terrible it puts me in a spot beyond redemption. Where people will all agree just how much of a deplorable and revolting case I am. I'm terrified to go on living. I can't run away without running into myself. I am not overreacting or overthinking when I say this is something BAD. And I deserve to die by fire because of it. My closest friend who I semi-opened up to (without stating exactly what it is.) seems to think it's not how it is in my mind, but she's dead wrong. I am so scared about the future. The past is a disgrace. And I can't enjoy the present. I feel my only option is death at this point.
