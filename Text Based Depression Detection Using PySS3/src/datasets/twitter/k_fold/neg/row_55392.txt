A cry for help without anyone listening.Whoever reads this; please tell my family I'm sorry.
Hey! I'm 24 years old. I have 2 daughters, a son, and an unborn child inside my tummy.
Well you see my life is a wreck.
My eldest daughter's father cheated on me. He did that when I was only a month pregnant with our daughter, turns out he had another girl pregnant as well and chose her than me.
My second child's father left me. He chose his friends and stayed single, leaving me with his daughter and a daughter of my own.
The father of my son and this unborn child abuses me mentally, over and over again. Accusing me of things I did not do and destroying my morality every passing day.
I'm fed up with everything. 
I have $400 debt in electricity due today, $300 debt in my eldest tuition fees, and $800 debt on our rent.
I just can't take anything anymore. I tried to be alive for my kids but I don't know where to go. Where to search for the money needed. I tried asking for help but no one cares to listen. I'm tired. I'm so tired.
Sorry, I love my children so much but I just can't take it anymore. I'll end my life.
