The one time I stopped some one from committing suicedThis is a really short story, sorry, but it is one of my favorite stories

Sorry about the crap grammer and spelling btw

I had just gotten out of in-patient and was just put in out-patient. I was scared of everything and dealing with really bad PTSD from my bio-father. I was one of the youngest people in my team so in was even more scared to talk or even be myself.

There was this one not there who was constantly talking about killing himself because of his family. After about a week of being there I finally spoke up. This was a 6 week program and he had already been there for 2 or 3 weeks by the time I got there. I had spoke too him every day that he was there until he left. I told him to defy his parents (who wanted him dead) and sisters (who wanted him to turn 18 and leave already) and live. To defy even himself and live. To live a long life and prove that he was more than trash to his family.

On his last day he gave me the longest 5 second hug (we weren't allowed to make physical contact beyond that) and told me he was going to live.

He was 15 and I was 14 and was invited to his graduation last year. I was the only one in his family there.
