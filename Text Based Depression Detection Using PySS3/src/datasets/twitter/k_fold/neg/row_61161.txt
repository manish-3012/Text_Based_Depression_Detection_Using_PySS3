whore myself, or suicide? should I do a coin flip?decisions, decisions. there is no in-between. i've tried to look for work (who isn't!?), but i simply can't make enough to get myself out of survival mode. in some cultures, you would be honorable to not surrender to such a "shameful" life. however, in *my* culture, in *my* timeâ€¦ i'm running out of options. i hate little shame. i have little ego. i will do just about anything at this point, to survive on my own. i have no identity anymore, so i don't have much to lose at this point. i don't need friends. i was never the type to covet money, but i need a lot of it to get out of an abusive situation fast. i cannot go to shelters or couch surf (I simply do not trust human beings anymore and strange places). i need to make it on my OWN or my health will continue to decline. i need enough money to pay off debts and maintain my health insurance. i personally see no shame in sex work, but there is no going back, once you dip your toe in (at least virtually). this is not ideal, but my life has backed me so far into *this* corner. 

so what would you do? is life worth living if you are so broken in every way, that you would sell yourself off just to get ahead in this rat race? or at this point would you just say fuck it? I will lose friends and family if I do one or the other. the little bit I have of myself, I will lose. Most importantly, I am angry at a God that still in 2015, people fall into this dangerous life and some not voluntarily. What is worse? Killing myself? Or sex work? I hate that it has come to this decision. i've been mulling over it for years at this point. hoping, praying for better opportunities to come around. they rarely do. i can't even enlist because of my medical history. anyone else ever fall this far down the rabbit hole?
