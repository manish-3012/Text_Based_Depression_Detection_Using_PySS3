Need advice regarding a friendI've just found my friend's Reddit account and a few weeks back they posted how they feel depressed and no longer want to live. Obviously I need to talk to them I just have no idea how to start the conversation. They don't know I know how they feel as they have never talked about it before. Any ideas on how to bring it up and start the conversation?  Help would be much appreciated.
