It really doesn't get better, doesn't it?Starting to lose track of how many times I've let myself get talked out of suicide now. I always hear the same thing: "It'll get better." 

No.

It doesn't.

In all honesty, it really doesn't. 

As of right now I'm fifteen and I really don't see myself making it to adulthood, or even the age of sixteen or seventeen, for that matter. In the past two or three years, it would be a reasonable guess that I haven't gone a single day without thinking about killing myself. I can't remember anymore happy thoughts. I exist to suffer. I have no talents. My grades are slipping. I'm not going to get anywhere in my future. So why even remain on here on Earth if my existence servers no purpose?

It's getting to the point where I can't even distract myself from horrible thoughts via activity. Gaming and socializing aren't even remotely fun anymore.

I also really hate when people say suicide is selfish. No, no it isn't. They're not the ones who has to sit and suffer through every single day. They're the ones who have passions, dreams and an actual future. And they're making me suffer by continuing to let me exist. They're actually the selfish ones.

Honestly, I'm contemplating just driving off a cliff or jumping off a bridge at this point. Yeah, it's violent, but it'll get the job done, right?

Peace out.
