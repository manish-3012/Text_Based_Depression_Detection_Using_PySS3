I think I am going to kill myself28 year old male here

I don't know my father, he left when I was 7 years old. He was a negligent, disconnected alcoholic. When I was a kid my mom used to abuse me relentlessly. She would beat me with belts and extension chords, and punch me in the face and tell me I'm stupid, and burned me with cigarettes a few times.

It's taken me years to pay off student loan debt for a degree that is completely useless. I live in poverty, and just hurt my knee a month ago, so now I can't even do the manual labour jobs I used to to get by.

Everything just seems completely hopeless. I have no clue what I am doing, I am totally atomised, I have no family and no support. I live pay check to pay check because cause of living is so high, that even though I work 60 hours I week I am just barely scraping by. 

Whenever I start to get ahead something bad happens. 2 months ago I had to shell out over 1000 dollars to get my car fixed. I needed a new control arm, plus new tires, plus alignment and a tow. Now I need a new muffler, and to pass an emission test, or I cannot legally drive to work when my knee gets better.

I am grinding like a mad man, but shelling out for physio therapy to get my knee fixed is costing me a ton, but if I don't do it then I'll be laid up in bed for months and then I won't be able to work, and then I won't be able to pay rent.

I have 46$ in my bank account that needs to last my the rest of the month.

Life is just exhausting. I work as hard as I can. But I can never pull myself out of this pit.

I'm not sad or anything, just hopeless. Not depressed, just stuck.

There is no escape for me.
