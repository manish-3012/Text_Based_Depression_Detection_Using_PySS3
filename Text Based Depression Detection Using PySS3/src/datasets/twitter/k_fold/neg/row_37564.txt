Losing my sanity, fast...I'm sixteen years old and have been diagnosed with Psychosis NOS(not otherwise specified) by doctors. Having trouble keeping a hold of my reality and sanity at the moment and do not have anyone to talk to anymore...To put it simple the other side of me has planned to commit suicide on the 26th of December and I am afraid I will not be able to overcome and stop it. Don't want to die, just need someone that has skype and is willing to spend a few hours diving down into the depths of my distorted mind and try and pull me out before there's too much damage. if you're up for it and please pm your skype name and i will add you.

Please help me, I don't know how much longer I can stay sane.
