I Did something unforgivableI Did something horrible 4 years ago and im worried what effects It Will have. I feel so ashamed and i can't tell anyone. If i do. I Know i Will have  noone. Because of me My whole family is shatterd and My Mother blames the person i wronged.
What Did i do? When i was14 i had oral sex with My then 6 year Old sister. And i have heard that kids that have any form of sex with a "adult" will have a alot of mental problems. I regret Every second of It. I don't know If i can handle Living anymore. Also i have no sexual attraction to children. I just don't know why i Did it
