Needing to escape...Hi fellow redditors,this is sorta a throwaway account so thats why you won't find any other posts.
But yeah, just need a stranger to talk with, this is just me suffering from first world problems i guess. I have a older brother whose married and planning kids next year and I'm in university with no job, girlfriend or even many friends who'll talk with me. I think I'm starting to spiral? (I hope that didn't come out with me sounding like an attention whore) Failed a class last term, got fat during the holidays, got into a fight with my mother because I'm denying help to get through this class. 
This is the same prequel to before I left engineering for business 4 year ago. Those weren't good times and I have no where left to fail towards.
