I think I actually enjoy being miserable and depressed.Itâ€™s my default way of thinking. I think I actually like feeling sad all the time. And I feel weird if Iâ€™m not feeling this way. Is that just the vicious cycle at work and my bodyâ€™s way of trying to compensate, or am I just that much of a fucked up masochist?
