Let me start by saying Iâ€™m grateful for everything I have and things could always be worseBut Iâ€™m 25 and life definitely didnâ€™t go as planned. My father doesnâ€™t give a damn about me, my mother who I was extremely close to passed away when I was 17. Very humiliating/abusive relationship soon after.

Took a job I never dreamed of growing up (gave up on my dreams), making alright money, but the satisfaction is not there. I donâ€™t hate it, but itâ€™s a very male-dominated field that I donâ€™t know a lot about, leaving me feeling isolated and useless. 

I walk around most days feeling like some kind of ostracized creature, comparing myself to every female and how theyâ€™re so much better, so much cleaner (I get filthy at work), and so much more feminine/prettier than I.
Having a stutter and really bad anxiety will do that to you. 
I also feel like if maybe I had a dad who cared my confidence would be better. 
If my mother was still here, she would definitely know what to say to make things better. But sheâ€™s not.

I would like to go back to school for something different, but I have no idea where to start. 


Iâ€™m okay (just okay) most days, but thereâ€™s always a voice in my head telling me â€œyouâ€™re worthlessâ€ or â€œfuck it, swallow all the pillsâ€.  Some days like today theyâ€™re all I hear.
