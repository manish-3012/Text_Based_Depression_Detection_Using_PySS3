I understand why people take other people out with themPeople are so fucking cruel. No one cares about anyone else. 

Obviously I'm not going to kill anyone else, but I understand it. 

The only person who cares that I'm suicidal is my roommates cat. Haha...i just called him a person. It's odd because I'm scared of cats. But I'm sitting here hyperventilating and sobbing, and the kitty keeps scratching my back....scratching in a nice way. I can tell he is trying to comfort me. He'll probably lick the blood from my wrists. Cats do that, right?  It's making me sad that the only person who validates my existence is a cat.
