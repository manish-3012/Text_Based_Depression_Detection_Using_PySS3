I am no oneI am 31 years old. I work full time and then some in social services. Typically I work 50 hours a week but I can barely make ends meet. I took a week off in July and without the overtime I took such a financial hit I almost couldn't buy food- and I didn't even do anything or go anywhere, it was literally just a staycation where I mostly played video games or went on walks to the park. 

I'm 31 with a college degree and I have to get a second job and essentially work 7 days a week so I can save money. I have no life now because I can't afford it. I'll have no life then because I won't have time. And it is an endless cycle. I am tired. I feel heavy. Air hurts. My skin feels raw. And as much as I want to feel guilty, I can only feel at peace in the knowledge that sometime soon I will die and I will be the one to do it. That when it is over everyone else will be sad but eventually they will move on. They'll get on with their lives, and I will no longer be the fuck-up burden they feel obligated to invite places or required to talk to. They won't have me to support financially and emotionally. What I hope to gain is freedom, and I hope to provide it as well. 

I do not like who I am. I am not happy. I have not been happy for a very long time. I have always been unsuccessful in relationships. I try so many things and can barely rise to mediocrity. And when people say I'm good at something or they like me it just feels like a lie. It feels like they are making fun of me. It always has felt that way. And I'm tired. And I just want to be done now.
