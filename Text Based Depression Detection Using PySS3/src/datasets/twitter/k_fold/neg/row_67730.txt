I'm so doneI'm so done with everything. Everything keeps getting worse and I need to do something. I need a therapist but I can't even make an effort. Thinks just keep getting worse and worse and I have so much to do. I wonder if it's all worth it because right now it's really fucking tiring and I just want to die alone somewhere without hurting anyone. Not that I can do anything right now or make that happen.
