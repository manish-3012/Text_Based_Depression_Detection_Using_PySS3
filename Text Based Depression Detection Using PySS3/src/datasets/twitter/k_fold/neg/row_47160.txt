I have no interest in bettering myselfWho cares? I donâ€™t want to be happy anymore. I refuse to live 40-50 years of more regret and pain. Desensitization is right around the corner. Who wants to breathe without living? Iâ€™m sitting here on Halloween day in a dark room with no TV on...just thinking about suicide. No plans. No girl. I have friends but Iâ€™d rather isolate myself. I have a good support system but that wonâ€™t save me. Idek why Iâ€™m posting this. Maybe a cry for help? Even if someone reaches out Iâ€™m still dead. I wish I could at least make my suicide beneficial to society. Maybe something heroic? Let me be a guinea pig for some breakthrough treatment that has a high fatality rate. Let me be a suicide warrior. Every day my fear of death lessens and my yearning to die increases
