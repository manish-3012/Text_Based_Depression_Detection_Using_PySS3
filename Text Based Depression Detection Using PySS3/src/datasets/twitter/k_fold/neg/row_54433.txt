being alive is just unfortunatei have a place to live (for now) but iâ€™m miserable here. iâ€™ve got food but canâ€™t bring myself to eat most of the time. thatâ€™s it. thatâ€™s all iâ€™ve got. i have 2 friends who hardly talk to me, the only one who hasnâ€™t left me yet is my fucking dog. 

iâ€™ve tried getting help but psychiatrists donâ€™t like when you respond with â€˜i donâ€™t knowâ€™ to everything, even if itâ€™s the truth. 

i donâ€™t want to be alive. things arenâ€™t gonna look up for me. itâ€™s all getting worse and at least if i was gone it would be one less person to pay for.
