Music that helped me cope.Been going through a really rough patch recently. Here's some music that helped me cope. Maybe it'll help you cope too.


Friend Please - Twenty One Pilots 

Neon Gravestones - Twenty One Pilots

One More Light - Linkin Park

1-800-273-8255 - Logic

Don't Try Suicide - Queen

Far Too Young To Die- Panic At The Disco

Goner- Twenty One Pilots

Hard Times - Paramore

Crawling - Linkin Park

My Blood - Twenty One Pilots

That's pretty much it. If you're having a hard time, try listening to some.

(Don't Try Suicide has some iffy stuff)
