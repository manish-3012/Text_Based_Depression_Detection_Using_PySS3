Making stupid mistakes and being unable to feel anythingI posted this same thing in OffMyChest, but I just needed the chance to have more people hear me, because I don't know what to do. To preface, I'm diagnosed by bipolar and have a history of self-harm.

Ive never really done a throwaway thing before, but this has honestly gotten to the point where I can't handle it anymore.
I've been abusing DXM for a few years now, to the point where I started using so much that it was hurting me financially. So I started just stealing the stuff from pharmacies. I know this is wrong, I know that I shouldn't do it and I really, really resent myself for it. I feel like a monster every single time I walk into the store, and I still go through with it. Then I spend the next couple days not being able to sleep, terrified Im going to get arrested and ruin my life.

I want to stop. But I find myself constantly needing the drug until it drives me nuts. I can't enjoy any of the old things I used to love: writing, reading, playing sports, running. I can't do anything when I know I won't be able to get high later. I worry I'll never be able to feel anything ever again without the drugs. And that makes me feel so nihilistic, so that I can rationalize going out and stealing again.

I wish I was a better person. I wish I was a stronger person. I'm trying to be, every single day. And I'll make it a few days, a week, sometimes more. And then I realize it's been that long since I felt anything resembling something good. And I give in. Which isn't an excuse, and I know that.

I'm just waiting for it all to collapse. Everything I worked so hard for: a top university education, all my jobs, my creative writing success. All of it to just disappear when the cops grab me, or when I get myself hurt on the meds, or whatever.

And the worst part is knowing I deserve it. And that's what fuels this self harm stuff. Because I see everything being so nasty, and knowing it's something I could have prevented. It just hurts all the time. I wish it would stop hurting, and I wish I could improve myself. But sometimes I feel like the damage is done, like I've already destroyed my life and I'm just waiting for the shoe to drop.
