If it's too much for you, think how it must feel for meIf you can't have a conversation with me because I'm too depressed, think is must feel to be depressed.

If you can't stand to see me in so much pain, think how it must feel for me to be in so much pain.

If you're frustrated that none of your solutions work for me, think how frustrated i must feel to know that there are no solutions for me.

I know others need to practice self-care. I know others sometimes need to remove themselves from the situations. I don't want anybody else to feel as do.

 But if nobody else can even stand to be with me for an hour, why should I stand to be with myself for any longer?
