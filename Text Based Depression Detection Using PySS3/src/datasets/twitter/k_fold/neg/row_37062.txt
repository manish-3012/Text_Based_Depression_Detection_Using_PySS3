I guess after all we're just animalsMy expectations have been crushed. Evolution has made people so individual to the point of complete selfishness and greed. I'm disgusted for being human and I just want to end it. Worst part is that I don't have the guts to do it because I'm scared of what will happen if I do it so that's why I'm asking for help here. These thoughts are eating me. Can I really live with my expectations of being human crushed?
