Iâ€™m not strong enoughAnyone have advice on taking that leap. Every person in my life reminds me Iâ€™m too weak to finally do it. I hate myself more and more every time I talk about it. And Iâ€™m a fucking extrovert... so I punish myself every time I talk about it and feel stupid. Which is every single time, as I know talking will never change anything. 3 cuts at least. I have to show them Iâ€™m not begging for attention. I have to. So they know Iâ€™m serious. Iâ€™m not that person. Never have been. But I have to show them Iâ€™m strong enough.. any one have any exercises to build up strength? Iâ€™m desperate. I just got hospitalized yesterday. Told them about everything. My numbness, the pain, the meds not working, my anger, bitterness, my lack of motivation, and then went to sleep... and they let me go... so much of a failure not even medical professionals can help me. Please help me. At this point all I hear is â€œyou arenâ€™t trying hard enoughâ€ or â€œyou know what your doingâ€ I done being doubted. Iâ€™m fucking over being told I WANT to feel dead inside, self medicating and cutting just to feel something. Anything helps.
