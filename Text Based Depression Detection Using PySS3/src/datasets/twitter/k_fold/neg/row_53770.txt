Plan RuinedWas going to OD this weekend but those plans have been thwarted. I wish I could say I was surprised but I'm used to the disappointment at this point. Nothing ever goes my way when I need it to. Now I'll have to live through all these emotions again and tiredly make it through another week with higher than usual anxiety. I'll probably have a heart attack before I can do the job myself ðŸ˜‚ Oh well. Gives me a little more time to say goodbye. I just hooe I have the strength to pull through another week and don't just lose my shit
