Really broken right now.I lost the love of my life. I cant trust him, and either he's in as much pain as I am or he never cared at all. Either i made a mountain out of a mole hill, or he really did love me but decided that long distance would never work and moved on.

I've struggled with depression and disordered eating well before I met him. But I have been working on it for the past year and made some progress on both, but I've given up.

I have work tomorrow. I have an advising session for my program tomorrow. I went to the doctor today to get a prescription, i ate some food today. But i.cant.do.this.anymore.

 I'm 98 pounds, and all I want to do is die tonight. 

I know I am a good person, and I would hurt others if I did this. But god this pain is too much. I can't see my future. I'm not strong enough.
