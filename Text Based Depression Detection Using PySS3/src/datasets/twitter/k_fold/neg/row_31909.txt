They don't care until you're goneNo one cares about me, normally I'd be fine with this, but having seen and read about so many suicides its constant that no one cares until you actually do it, and the fact that I'm crippled by double mental illness if I miss a tablet the size of my pinky nail makes me regret life every day. I haven't been able to talk to the 3 people I actually trust in months, even they avoid me, they notice my depression but don't do anything more than a pill, and when I die they'll say it's out of nowhere. I have money, I have distractions, but at the end of the day I get one step closer because my life isn't worth living
