I'm not going to kill myself because I can't leave my kids.  But dammit, I wish I could.I'm a shit person.  I have no excuse.  I don't have super terrible trauma, a history of abuse, or a better story for feeling terrible then the thousands of others who find themselves here.  I think the only reason I don't off myself is because I'm too chickenshit to get the right shit to do it right the first time.  No cries for help for me, I'm just to lazy and paralyzed with guilt to get the right shit to do it right.  If I could get over traumatizing my kids for life, I'd be done.  All the other 4 people in my life would move the fuck on, and be happy to do so.  I haven't done anything so wrong that I can't undo, but I have wasted 32 years of my life doing nothing that anyone would remember.  My husband puts up with me, at best.  I hate myself, I've tried therapy and medication, and I still hate myself.  I'm alone in my head because I know better than to talk anymore.  I am only around because I can fake a reasonable amount to love my kids and see how they turn out.  But I'm getting tired, very very worn, from the act.  I'll last long enough for my two girls to reach high school, and subsequently hate me, but them I'm done.  Everyone will be better off with me as a burden on them.  All the talking I do.  So, this is a letter that I would never write.  Because when I throw in the towel, I'm not offering the rest an explanation.  I just needed a single place to put my thoughts because it's always been about me.
