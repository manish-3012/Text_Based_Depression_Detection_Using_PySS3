My depressions winningI was in a psych ward last week for suicidal thoughts I was released after 7 days and the day I was released I felt better but now that Iâ€™m out Iâ€™ve lost all my friends including the two friends who I was closest to in life, I feel so sad now I just want to end everything, I want to go to sleep and never wake up or just have everything go pitch black
