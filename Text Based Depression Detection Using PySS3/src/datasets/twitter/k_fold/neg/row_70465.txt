Diabetes + Alcoholism + Depression = Ticking Timebomb, right?So it goes like this. Diagnosed with Type 2 DM about4 years ago. Doc prescribed Metformin and diet and exercise. Doesn't work. Every a1c is in the 13-15 range. My script for Metformin just ran out and I'm saying fuck it to that. 

At the same time, I've been taking Effexor 300 mg for about 5 years for depression. My insurance decided to stop paying for that in April and I went off it cold turkey in May. That was fun. 

My vision is continually blurry and I'm thirsty all the time. My blood glucose won't read on my glucometer. My shotgun has been loaded under my bed for a year, and the only thing stopping me from putting it in my mouth is the fact that I've done so a hundred times but I always chicken out and I hate myself so much for that. 

I stopped drinking in January. The only reason I ever drank was to work up the nerve to Mill myself but I always got scared that I would survive or that it would hurt for too long. Well I'm not scared anymore and I'm starting to feel ready for a little hurt. Shotgun in the mouth is pretty foolproof right? 

I've been wanting to do this for seventeen years, so I probably won't, but I really fucking hope I do it this time. It's so goddamned embarrassing walking back inside with the shotgun and putting it away each time. I'm so fucking stupid.
