The battle of trying to convince myself it'll get better is being lostI'm so tired, I'm always tired. Tired of being tired, tired of being dissapointed. I cry to and from work now, used to only be at the end of the week but now it's just daily. I really do try and be positive, but there's not a lot to be positive about left. Ever since I started this new job everything has become worse, I'm so tired, two of my friends have moved away, my girlfriend has become so distant she's borderline non existent outside of a few texts. I'm filled with such dread all day every day, I'm miserable. There is no passion left in me, no ambition. I'm nothing and I want to die more than ever.
