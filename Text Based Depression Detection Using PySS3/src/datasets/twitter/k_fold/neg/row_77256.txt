Finally done. I've isolated myself and ignored everyone who was close to me in my life for a long time. Purposely being alone for almost 2 years, maybe longer, maybe not. 

I hate everything about the world, about other human beings, even about Reddit now. Everything is just shit. Pure shit. I hate it all and if I don't get rid of myself, then the only hope I have is that some fucking nukes take the earth and everything out at once and rids the universe of the scum that is humanity.
