both of my parents are dead, being forced to move to new statethis weekend, my mother died. my father died 6 years prior to this. i have to abandon everybody i know in the town i live in right now to live with people who i don't like in an entirely new state. i am 16 years old and i basically had no say in any of this. i feel as if i have no choice but to kill myself.
