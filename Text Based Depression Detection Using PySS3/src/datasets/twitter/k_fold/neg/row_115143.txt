So I wanna kill myself But I really don't know if I should Do it, I've been Feeling Like This Since 2012(I'm 17 at the time of this post in 3 days I'll be 18) At first I thought It was A phase that would Dissapear as I grow Up, And It did dissapear but this last two years I've been feeling Like Killing Myself And In Every Hard Situation That I Get In I feel like I should Kill myself to get out of it.

Lately I've been In a lot of trouble, My dad found out I smoke weed And he got so mad he almost kicked me out (he actually did it, but the neighbours called the police because I'm 17 and he can't kick me till I'm 18), also I've been lying about doing good in college when I actually failed 5 out of 7 classes (Because I didn't like what I was mayoring in) and he will find out about it maybe tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, I'm pretty sure he's going to kick me out, and I'll probably have to go on to live with my aunts, but I really don't want to, as much as I hate my dad's mega strict rules I really love the lifestyle that he provides for me, I don't have everything that I want but I live good, and If I go on to live with my aunts I'll live on my own probably I'll have to work on a job that only pays me like 500 usd a month, even though here in colombia that's a lot of money for an 18 year old without a degree, I really don't wanna work my whole life in there, also I really don't think I could, because they only hire people to work in there for 1 year and then drop them.

I really don't have goals in life apart from getting money and smoke weed, but nothing besides from that, I mean sometimes I think about trying to become a rapper or a utuber since those 2 things are my only passions but it's really hard to make it out in both of em, and here It comes the reason of the title of the post, I wanna kill myself so I won't have to go thru all of this, but I really don't know if I should do it, I mean it's not like I'm scared of death, it's just that I don't really know what my future will be, I'm scared that i'll never be nothing in life and I really don't want that for me but I don't have any options, my dad won't pay more for my education since i've let him down so many times that he's just fed up with me not trying to study, and I don't have nobody else besides my aunt's.

I really need someone to guide me through alll of this because I really don't know what to do now
