Suspension hangingIve already tried the gas route and it didnt work. I really wanted to use this method bc you just go to sleep. My next choice would be suspension hanging. Ive bought the rope and i cut the toe end of a sock off and put the rope through it so the sock will be where my throat is and tied a slip knot for the noose. Ive read that a rope can dig into your skin while hanging and that some people pad the rope, hence the sock. But it seems like it might pad too much and the rope wont be able to constrict as well?
