I think I'm going to commit suicide.I'm being screwed over by my depression. I've been cutting again and I can't bear to tell my boyfriend that I'm thinking this way. I feel useless worthless ugly stupid terrible but no one is around to listen. My boyfriend works 12 hours a day 5 days a week and he's always tired, and often napping so I can't exactly reach out to him. And my parents aren't being supportive of me, they are just so busy with their lives and the new baby that is coming. I feel like I'm losing my choices, and that soon I won't have any freedom, and that I will always have to be the babysitter for my parents and I will always have to do things for them. And what's the point of living if that's all I'm here for? I can't take it anymore. I've already written a note and I think I'll do it.
