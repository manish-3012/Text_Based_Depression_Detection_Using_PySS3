I'm not sure if I'm suicidal or if I'm just being self destructiveI've been having a really tough time recently. Everything just feels overwhelming and like I should be handling it better.

 

My spouse also suffers with depression and anxiety and also seems to be having a 'flare up'. I guess the difference is that they express themselves, at least to some extent to me. They have outbursts and tell me what they're feeling. All of which I understand, support and know is needed for them to say.

 

The problem is that I don't feel I can do the same. I feel like it would burden their already struggling mind. They're suffering so much and I don't want to make it worse. But now I'm stuck feeling all of these emotions with no outlet whatsoever. I've been crushing up high doses of diazepam and taking Co-codamol to try and dull the feelings. I know I've been taking way too much but it's the only thing that gives me any relief right now.

 

I've also resorted to self harm again. A few cuts are deep but most are surface. I've been trying to hide them and my spouse doesn't seem to have noticed.

 

I feel like I need help but I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm teetering on the edge. I don't have anyone else I can reach out to. I just feel alone while also feeling like I have to make sure the person I love doesn't feel like that themselves.

 

I would appreciate any advice anyone has to offer. Thank you.
