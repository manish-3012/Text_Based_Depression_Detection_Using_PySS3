I canâ€™t sleep at nighti cant sleep at night, all i can think about is going into the garage, getting into my car, and letting it run. then i think about what if it doesnt work, how it would ruin my career, make my life worse.
for the job i want, i canâ€™t be on any meds. i think in certain situations, some antidepressants are ok, but it is extremely regulated. i havent gotten evaluated, but i know im not alright. im self aware, i notice i have happy days, and then extremely low points. like tonight, for no reason at all, i had a good day. then i feel alone, and i can hardly hold back crying, and want to die. my boyfriends lying in bed next to me, asleep. he took me out for dinner, whats wrong with me? i feel like im wasting my potential, i never apply myself, i have a horrible self image and an eating disorder that creeps up and hits really hard when im stressed and no one knows. i nearly cried tonight when we ate something that triggers my ED, and hid how upset i was infront of my boyfriend. My boyfriends trying to be better, he took me out for dinner im guessing to try to be better. because i said im falling apart here, ive given you everything and i feel empty, i need love. we have a dead bedroom, and we were so happy, we were so happy and i still felt that excitement even when im so sad and hes lost it for me. except he says it isnt me, its his own mental health, which makes it worse, because now i feel guilty hes sad, how can i expect him to worry about me when hes at a low point too? but i cant help to feel so alone right now. 
none of this even makes since im just struggling so hard, i feel so alone. i feel like i wouldnt know where to start if i told anyone close to me. no one has ever seemed to take it seriously when ive tried. im so lost right now and i use to be so happy.
