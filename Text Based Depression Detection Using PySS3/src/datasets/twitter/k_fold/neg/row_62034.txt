I. Hate. People.Another day I got made fun of and mocked publically. My words twisted, to fit the bullies narrative. People agreed and laughed.

No longer in contact with friends. They all hang out without me these days.

Its 5:01 am. Work in 4 hours. Can't fall asleep. Holding back tears.

**Pain.**

Music is helping, but can't completely write off what I'm feeling.

Took half a xanax. Thoughts becoming cloudy. Still can't fall asleep.

Tried to read a book. Can't concetrate on the words because of the pill.

**Pain.**

Should I end it? 

House roof is pretty high, spiked wall below, certain death if I aim for it.

What would happen to my mother? Who has made it her mission in life to help me overcome this suffering?

How would she feel if she found my mauled corpse on the sidewalk?

Would she cry for me?

Would she feel what I'm feeling now?

I don't want you to feel like that mom.

What about you, dad?

I left the university midway. You never said a thing, although I know how much you want me to go back and finish it.

You try to teach me all you can so someday I'll be as skilled and capable as you.

That will never happen. We both know that. I'm just not good enough.

**Pain.**

I could use a knife. 

Quick stab to the throat. I could take a big xanax dose to make the execution easier. 

Like the japanese pilots in ww2.

How about you, Bella?

You would nudge my door open in the morning with your little nose. 

You would know something was afoul with your keen sense of smell.

Would you lick the blood? Would you bark? 

Would you weep like the day we took you from your mother and brought you home with us?

**Pain.**

Why should I go on?

All passion that once drove me has faded, like cig smoke in the wind.

Funny thing is, there is virtually no reason for my feeling this way.

I have a stable job, almost no debt, my own car, my parents fairly decent inheritance for when they are gone.

Why does it feel like I have nothing?

Where does this emptiness stem from?

I can't even remember how it started, like it was always with me.

**Pain.**

You will come to my room in 3 and a half hours to nudge me awake to not be late for work. You will find me awake, ask what's wrong, I'll dodge the question, as always.

I'm not feeling well, I will take the day off.

Speaking of work, how about you, Laura?

You have your fair share of problems. Survived cancer at only 24 years old, became sterile cause of that, and yet here you are, the true backbone of the company. Everything would collapse without you.

You called when I didn't show up for work.

What's wrong?

Feeling sick, will take the day off... again.

Alright, I will file the paperwork for you. You aren't mad at me or something right?

No, of course not. Just dealing with personal stuff.

Ok, well, get well soon.

Thanks, see ya next week.

...

But will you? Would you blame yourself if HR announced my sudden departure?

I wouldn't want this burden on you.

**Pain.**

I could do something drastic, take the highschool bully down with me.

I know where you live, Jake. I know where you work.

Would a bashed skull make up for when you took a soccer ball and kicked it aiming for me during lunch break?

Would a stab in the back make up for when you made the whole class laugh at me when you called me "pregnant" because I was a little chubby for a 7 year old?

Propably not, I would need to do a lot more to pay you back in full.

But I won't. I won't transfer my suffering onto someone else, like you did. Even if you caused it.

And that's why I won't do it.

I need to be strong, not just for me, but for those that depend on me. 

But no matter what, this **pain** just doesn't go away.
