I'd like to learn about ketamine treatments and any personal stories from anyone who has undergone treatment.I've seen a few pretty inspirational anecdotes about people going through ketamine treatment and about how **huge** of an effect it has had on their lives. I've found a few treatment centers not too far from where I live, and I'm interested in seeking their help. It's expensive - which fuckin sucks! - but I might be able to take a loan from a friend or relative, considering the purpose of the loan. 

I'd love to hear from anyone who has been treated with ketamine, your experience through the process, and how your life has been since. Thank you - love all of you!
