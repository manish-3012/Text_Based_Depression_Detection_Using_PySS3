Can I go yet, please.I'm having such a up and down year this year but mostly down, the only good thing to happen was I finally got a girlfriend after idk how many years but with the good comes the bad. The last couple of days has been pretty stressful and the only ways I feel like they can end is with suicide or running away from my house ( basically suicide where I live) I've had school stress me beyond a limit I didn't know existed and to put it on top of that I'm getting in so may arguments with my family, and to top all of that off my gf is not having the best time mentally as well as she is getting stressed too with school and much much more and I just want her safe and okay because she means so much to me, I could care less about myself because I want her happy and her okay and idk what to do anymore, I want advice but I doubt I'll get any but when can I go away for good.
