ReliefSome times my mind runs and I can't catch it
What is the purpose of reflection if it only leads to more tension
A flawed perspective
In the mirror is only a death wish
The possibility of it getting better
Is respecting the present
Some times the test seems more then the question
Having responsibility towards your self is a blessing
I see every day in every face a glimpse of this depression
Is it me or is it them that falls to the pressure
I question where I am daily and honestly it never seems to lessen
I fall victim  to my own thoughts
The contest of contesting
