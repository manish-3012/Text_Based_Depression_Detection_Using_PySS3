Could be homeless soon...thinking of ending it...I could end up being homeless soon as our landlord is selling the house to move in with a woman he met a few weeks ago.

I just got back from meeting with potential roommates and I got rejected by email.

I am not responding to them as I know I would not say anything nice.

I posted on Craigslist but I have a Emotional Support Dog so I know it will be harder to find a place, plus I have a eviction on my record because my abusive Mom thought it would be a good idea to be evicted so we would get two more weeks in the house.

I am honestly thinking of ending it.  I donâ€™t see a way out of this and I cannot live with my Mom anymore as she is abusive and toxic.

I wish I was dead.
