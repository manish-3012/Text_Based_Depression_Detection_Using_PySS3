Idk Why I Cut MyselfThe other day I was sitting alone, pondering what all my life has and will amount to, when I started to cut my wrist. I really don't know why. It honestly didn't even feel like I was making myself do it; it just kinda happened.

I've been struggling to see the light at the end for about half a year now. I did this for three days and then a friend noticed the cuts and I decided to stop.

I'm going to try to see someone. Maybe it was just teenage angst getting to me. Or maybe it was a byproduct of my hurt.
