I feel like a ghost on campusIâ€™m at a big college but I literally feel like a ghost I mean I see people everywhere either with a significant other or just a friend and they all seem so happy meanwhile I just go to class and sit there then go home I just donâ€™t get along with anyone and I know Iâ€™ll die alone at this point I would welcome death because itâ€™s like Iâ€™m dead already
