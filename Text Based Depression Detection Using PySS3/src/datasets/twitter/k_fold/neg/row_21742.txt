I don't want to go back to that place.I used to think about ending it a lot. Over the years I got a little better, had a three year relationship, was miserable but stable. All the while I had serious erectile dysfunction, but in a long term relationship I was able to get around it sometimes. I'm 23. Now that the relationship is over I'm as depressed as ever and dating is horrible. I don't have a problem getting people to want to fuck me but I spend all my time worrying about sex and how I can't do it. I finally went to the doctor today and he said that my problem is really abnormal even for someone with anxiety and I got a lot of tests and referrals. I'm seeing a girl I really like and she's so supportive and sweet, but I feel like half a man all the time. I can't find a job either, and all I want to do is get drunk until I can't think.  Finally took the first step to get better but all I want to do is stop. I feel fundamentally broken. In a stupid self-indulgent way I just want to stay broken, like I can't possibly be worth the effort for someone. I want to push her away and rot from the inside out by myself. Everything seems cold and I can feel myself falling backwards. Thanks for reading.
