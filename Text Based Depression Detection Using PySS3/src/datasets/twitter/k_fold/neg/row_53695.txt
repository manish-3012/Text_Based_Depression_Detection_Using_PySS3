My mind wont Shut up. I want it to stop... i hate who i am... why i was... what ive done. i want to erase my existence, i want to delete my actions. or make the things ive done.... go away... i want to scrub every evidence of my being and existence. i want it all to be gone, i want to be gone. i want to get away from all of this..... these thoughts.... i hate it all, i hate everything. i wish i could go back and undo everything. start over. most of all i fucking hate my self. i deserve to die, no body like me deserves friends, family, anything. i deserve to rot. i deserve to be shunned. i deserve to be punished.  


i just want to be erased...  


my existence should just be deleted...
