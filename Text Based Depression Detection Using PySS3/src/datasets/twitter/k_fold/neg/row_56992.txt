26 year old burnout and have finally realized I am not cut out for life.Let's get this out of the way first: 26-year-old kissless friendless virgin who has never had a job and is still in college trying to get a bachelor's with a nearly unhirable 2.6 GPA, all paid out of my aging parents' dime. Objectively a failure and a loser on every level. 

The only joy I get out of life is consuming passive media like games, TV and novels to vicariously escape into a world where my life isn't garbage. My plan was to coast to graduation and get a middling job, but I've finally come to realize that my entire approach to life was destined to fail from the very beginning. 

I'm a lazy piece of shit who never developed any work ethic and am reaping the consequences for that. I was bullied throughout my youth, sure, but I never took the extra step to actually improve myself and be the best I could be. I was content being a fatso without developing real hobbies, never leaving my room unless forced to do so, scared to talk to people. I am about to graduate and have spent these last 3 1/2 years on a college campus staying inside my dorm room not speaking to anyone while barely passing or failing my college classes. No one here even knows my name. 

Now after reflecting on the few job interviews I have gotten, I have realized that the real world is designed to sift through the worthless riffraff like me. They want people who are passionate, who are motivated, who have vibrant, social personalities. Me? I'm a walking husk who would burn out of any job I'd luck into getting just like I've burned out on everything else, because there is nothing in life I am looking forward to. Not a soul cares I exist besides my parents, and deservedly so. I am a human being with not a single positive quality.

My mother will be passing soon from terminal lung cancer and I will take my own life soon after she's gone. Thanks for reading.
