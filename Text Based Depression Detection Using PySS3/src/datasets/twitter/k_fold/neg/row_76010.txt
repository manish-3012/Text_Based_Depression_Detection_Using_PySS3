I'm a failureI'm 16 and I'm a complete failure. I'm not good at anything. I suck at school, I suck at relationships, I'm lazy, I'm a unlikable bastard, I'm alone, and I hate myself.

I am failing at school because I'm unmotivated. I just go and sit though the day then I come home and do absolutely nothing. All I do is spend time on the internet and video games. I don't have any friends or anything, and I'm not going anywhere in life at this rate, and I lack any kind of drive to work. I just don't have the energy to try. My mother called me a disappointment and a failure yesterday, and as far as I can see, she's right. I am completely useless. My grades suck, I'm alone, and I'm not good at anything.

I have no one who cares about me. No friends, nothing like that. I'm sure that if I would put a gun to my head and pull the trigger, nobody would miss me. And why should they? I'm a unlikable person. Nobody likes me.

I'm so alone. And I would probably be better off dead. It's not like anyone would miss me.
