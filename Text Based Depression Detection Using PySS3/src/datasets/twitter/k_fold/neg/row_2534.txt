like its the right time to end iti didnt honestly see my life going this far and i feel like ive now just reached the end of a book or game. like i wanna stop. nothings supposed to happen next and i dont know what to do. these last couple days i feel like ive been through every emotion ive had in my lifetime yet ive just calmly accepted it, like its supposed to happen. maybe im having an existential crisis. but i feel like i should just end it now while the going is still relatively 'good'
