I'm very tiredOver the past twenty one years of my life I have been sexually assaulted or raped by my best friend, my cousin, and a violent schizophrenic at an emergency mental ward; had my best friend commit suicide because of me and lost almost all of my friends because of it, sunk so deep into my years long depression that I forced the only boy who has ever cared about me to realize how irreparably awful and broken I am, had my own mother and stepfather kick me out of two separate houses for being pansexual, been confined to a mental ward and then hospital that left me with trauma that I no longer feel safe seeking professional help for, dropped out of school because I could no longer handle despite having, according to my family, "no real problems," and suffered for two years from an undiagnosed chronic I illness that leaves me nauseous, exhausted, and in pain from the time I wake up until the time I go to bed.
I honestly can't continue to live like this and there is no one left for me to turn to, so here I am, hoping strangers on the internet can listen to me like no failed relationships I've tried to tend to in my life can.
There is so much more but it doesn't even matter I don't think I want strangers to know this all of this anyway I already feel like there's too much here anyway.
I just want to pass away quietly and have all of this be over. I've been through so much in the past year and there is nowhere left for me to go I don't even know why I'm doing this there's no one left who can help me anymore. I've been hoping my mystery illness would kill me before I had to do it myself but here I am, staring down a choice between either a bleak death or an ever bleaker life. I've lost everyone close to me and those who I haven't I refuse to poison with my presence any longer. I told my now permanently ex boyfriend I wouldn't make it through the summer and now I know for a fact I'm right. Thank you for listening to me anyway.
