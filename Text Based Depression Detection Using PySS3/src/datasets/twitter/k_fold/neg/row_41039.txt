My brain wants me to post this hereI'm so tired. All the time. Even when I'm sleeping I'm tired.  
I've decided I'm going to kill myself soon. I've watched videos online. It's no where near as painful or prolonged as I imagined.

&amp;nbsp;

I have another root canal infection. It's the tooth next to the tooth that had the first root canal infection. What a coincidence, right? Similarly, the tooth next to the filling on the other side of the mouth is developing into a root canal infection as well. All in all it'll take about $3,000 USD to fix. Oh, I also learned about some kind of additional fee you have to pay if you lack health insurance. I don't know how much this fee is but supposedly it increased recently. Minimum wage in this state amounts to about $1,424 USD per month. If I were an actual human being with bills to pay I imagine it'd take 6-12 months to save up for the dental work. The infection won't wait. My paranoia says it'll reach the jaw in 2 weeks and the pain will become unbearable. Realistically it'd probably be 1-3 months. I don't plan to wait on it, either.

Grandma moved in. The floor is still bare wood. Rats still shit on every surface in the house. Shortly after moving in she let slip a sarcastic remark that granted me wonderful perspective. My mom doesn't believe I was raped. She thinks I'm making it all up. You see, months ago when I was having (yet another) crisis I reached out to grandma in desperation. I told her a little of my story and asked her to talk to and try to convince mom to stop letting the rapist come over. She sympathized. The next day she sent a text out of the blue saying I have no right to come between my mom and the rapist. I impulsively deleted the text because just knowing it was on my phone was making me upset. I considered the possibility that my mom had secretly gotten a hold of my grandma's phone and sent the text herself. I also considered the possibility that grandma had kept true to her word and had a sit-down with mom, but through talking to mom she ultimately came to the conclusion that I was making everything up. It's nice to finally eliminate the first possibility. I'm not making anything up.

&amp;nbsp;

That's the way this world works. I should know that. I do know that. I don't know why I even thought of the first possibility; it's far too kind to me. Fate is a wonderful thing, isn't it? She spoke to me. Fate. She's never spoken to me directly before, but she has now. It was in a dream, or more accurately that state of consciousness in the morning where you're not quite awake but you're not asleep either. Fate told me December 14th. December 14th came and went. I convinced myself I needed extra time to finish some anime series I've been wanting to watch. Then I convinced myself I needed to play a new videogame for a little bit longer. I'm really just a coward. A lazy coward. The kind of coward that doesn't fight the enemy, but doesn't run from the enemy either. Running takes too much effort. The kind of coward that literally does nothing. Irresponsible. Shameful.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't think Fate will speak to me again.

&amp;nbsp;

I finally have an opportunity that comes with a slight possibility of making a tiny bit of money (wow, the adjectives). The task is to rewrite a game an online acquaintance made. I normally enjoy this task immensely. I rewrote a majority of the game of my own volition a length of time ago. I can't seem to muster the energy or focus to accomplish this task now, though. I probably won't finish.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been hearing so much about tradeskills: roofing, welding, plumbing, etc. I think it might be nice becoming an apprentice to a patient master. I don't have a driver's license, I'm the clumsiest I've ever been, and I utterly lack common sense when it comes to practical skills. I can't imagine doing well in any tradeskill. I heard about another interesting job too. I don't remember exactly what the job was, but it was something to do with crisis management and disaster relief. For a second I thought I might do well in a job like that since I'm already so detached from reality, but then I decided such a job probably requires a lot of social interaction and I can't do that. Same goes for becoming a paramedic (not even considering the cost of education and training). I suppose programming remains my only plausible path. I'm frustrated that I can't translate my skill into income. If it's not my social anxiety then it's my lack of motivation. If it's not my lack of motivation then it's my lack of focus. If it's not my lack of focus then it's sheer laziness. This chain is so unbearably frustrating.

&amp;nbsp;

I've thought about finally giving in and submitting myself to inpatient services. I know that entering inpatient services means I'll be exiting homeless. I'm certain my mom would refuse to take care of me afterwards. The justification would be that I would now be healthy enough to live independently. I know very little about inpatient services, but I do know they aren't miracle factories. They probably are debt factories though.

Background: I am a 23 year old male living in my mom's (unfinished, uninhabitable to all but mold and pests) basement. Aside from a brief 3 month stint in the military (I wish more than anything that I could've lasted longer), I've never had a job, attended college, or lived anywhere else. I've gone to a mental health crisis facility a few times. I've tried so many medications but gained only horrible side effects. I had a horrible experience with case management services. I tried long-term therapy but that ended when my (trusted, respected, lucky-to-find) therapist said he felt he could no longer help me. I've reached out to all family members. I have no friends.
