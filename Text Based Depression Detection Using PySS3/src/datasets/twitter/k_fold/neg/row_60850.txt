Am I selfies for considering suicide?I made a throw away account for this.
Iâ€™m and 18 year old girl, Iâ€™m not sad or depressed or anything like that, I feel accepted and liked by my family and friends.
But honestly Iâ€™m just tired of living, like whatâ€™s the point of it all, nothing? I donâ€™t really feel like my life is to any greater value, and the world would be fine without it? (Idk if this makes sense to anyone but I think it does) Like why canâ€™t I get to choose the way I want to go out?
