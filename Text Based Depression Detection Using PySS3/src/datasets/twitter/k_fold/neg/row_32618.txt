Progress (maybe)What's up my fellow depressed people? Too cynical? I'm gonna try to get my haircut. It's been months but....I have to keep trying. Atleast that's what I tell myself. I'm numb, I've lost all energy and my identity is no more....I remember seeing a drawing of a wolf walking in a circle. It's paws bleeding as it endlessly walks the circle over and over again. My last sense of hope snuffed out last year. I just want to feel again....to be happy. I feel like I fell back first into a spirling abyss. Time rots everything even hope.
