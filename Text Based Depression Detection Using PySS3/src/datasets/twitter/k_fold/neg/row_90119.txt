I'm a drunkAll I do is drink and make my friends dislike me every time I interact with me. It use to be that I was the life of the talk, and would be the person people would look forward to talking to... Now I'm the person most people don't want to interact with because of my drinking. The only time I feel like I can interact with people is when I drink and the only time I can talk with people like a regular person is when I drink. I have the solution if I need to use it, but I'm not a pussy, just need someone to talk with. My friends say I'm bi-polar when I drink, and personally, I don't know if I am. Just need someone to talk with on the phone or voice.
