I genuinely want to be gone from this world, and the lack of resources to do it are disturbing and unethical.All these self help books, "inspirational" be yourself with no shame meme/posts, help lines, etc and there is still a complete lack of help on wanting to end my life effectively, and I don't understand why. Jesus, even a post on here simply asking about writing a note was pulled by mods a couple days ago.

If I was elderly or physically ill no one would question that death is the only remaining option... but because I'm in my 30s and relatively physically healthy I'm supposed to suffer just because?

There's nothing for me here, and I'm terrified of messing up my attempt because it will only my my life even worse. I'm researching methods and there is definitely going to be a timing element to everything...and all I can think is that I shouldn't be struggling as much as I am to make this happen. There's a million therapists and medications that are already proven not to work, and there is no chance of me getting "better" so why aren't alternatives an option? Is it because I actually SHOULD be ashamed despite all the cutesy memes? Because society has some delusional obligation to make sure living is better no matter what the quality of life is? I don't even want to hear the "but people will miss me" bullshit. I miss my grandmother, but it was her time to go- we all miss people when they die, but immortality is not the answer.  Now is my time. And it's not fair to be so alone and fearful of someone finding out before I can execute it.
