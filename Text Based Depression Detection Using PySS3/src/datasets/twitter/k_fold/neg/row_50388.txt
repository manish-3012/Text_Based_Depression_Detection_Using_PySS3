Howâ€™s this for an idea? Plz read ðŸ™ƒMy ex girlfriend is an immigrant to my country. Sweetest person Iâ€™ve ever known. Just a super shitty family.      Simply put, we both got our hearts broken through the process of dating and the brake up. 

I just got a sweet paying job. (Personally, I donâ€™t really care.) I was thinking Iâ€™ll save as much money as I can. Spend nothing on fun. Just essential for as long as I can. Leave everything to her in my will. I know she needs it. She wonâ€™t take it if I am a life. This way I can leave her one last gift.    She could use it to buy a home. I know how much she wants her own house 

Ps. Is it stupid I still love her even after all the crap we went through?
