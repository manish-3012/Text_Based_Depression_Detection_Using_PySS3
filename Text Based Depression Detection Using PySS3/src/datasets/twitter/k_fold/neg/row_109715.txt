I'm tired of everything, seriously considering to just end it all...so, lately i've been feeling really down about everything. it's been something i've dealt with for a long time, but now it's just unbearable. i'm just a pathetic 22 year old loser with basically no future, no friends, nothing... i don't care about anything anymore, just spend the nights by myself crying... help...
