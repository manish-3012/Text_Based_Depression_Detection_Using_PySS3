So LongTomorrow is my last day. I'm going to wake up and call my closest friend and tell him I love him. I'm going to finish writing my note and then watch my favourite film. I'm going to kiss my mum and dad and send them out of the house. I'm going to order my favourite food and eat in front of the TV with the AC on. When I get tired I will leave the hallway light on for my parents and retire to my bedroom. I will set my note on my little table, shut off the light, crawl into bed and go to sleep forever.  I hope death is a wonderful painless dream in which I do not have to think. I hope there is devastation and celebration in my wake. 

Goodbye All.
