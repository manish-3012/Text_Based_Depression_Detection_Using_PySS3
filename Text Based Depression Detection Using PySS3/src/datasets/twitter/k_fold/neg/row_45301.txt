How do I go on?I feel defeated. I've had so much shit thrown at me, so many people betray my trust and I'm feeling like it's just too much. I've tried medicating, exercising, eating right, counselling etc and it doesn't change the fact that at the end of the day I am so alone. It hurts and I don't want to hurt anymore.
