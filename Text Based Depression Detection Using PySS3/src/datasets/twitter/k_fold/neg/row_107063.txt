Can't push throughI've been depressed for 4 years. Recently it's got worse and I've changed medication a couple months back to try and get back on my feet. I thought it was working. But my boyfriend left me a few days ago and since then I don't know who I'm living for. I feel so lonely. My friends are trying to help but I feel like I don't even like them anymore. I have no idea what makes me happy or what to do with my time. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up again
