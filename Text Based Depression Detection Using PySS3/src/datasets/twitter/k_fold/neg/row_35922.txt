Hello Reddit. Let's talk. At least, just listen.I am an 18 year old male. Several months ago, I ended my two-year relationship with my fiance because she cheated on me twice. It was the most difficult thing I've had to deal with in my entire life. I spent three months crying about it non stop and I lost 30 lbs. During this time, all of my closest friends have moved several hundred miles away from me to either go to college or join the military. I feel like I have no one left and everyone is moving past me while I'm standing still. However, I recently found an old childhood friend on facebook and I met with her yesterday at her house. I personally thought that it was the best thing that has happened to me lately. She told me however, that she isn't interested in me. I felt absolutely destroyed. I just feel that I'm not going to become anything that society wants me to be. Maybe ending it all wouldn't be a bad choice. I'm sorry if I am wasting anyone's time here, ask me any questions you may like. Criticism about me will most likely reconfirm my reasoning, and just push me further.
