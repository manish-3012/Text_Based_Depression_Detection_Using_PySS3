Wife left me and my son is goneWife of 17 years decided to cheat on me and tell me she doesn't love me anymore in the blink of an eye. She hates our son, loathes his existence since the day he was born. But has taken custody of him with no way for me to ever get him back. I have no reason to live anymore. My family is gone. My immediate family died off years ago. I am absolutely completely alone. I am getting drunk right now with a noose ready in my late fathers bedroom. I hope Christianity is wrong about suicide sending me to hell, because I would very much like to see my father again. He was the only person who ever loved me, faults and all.
