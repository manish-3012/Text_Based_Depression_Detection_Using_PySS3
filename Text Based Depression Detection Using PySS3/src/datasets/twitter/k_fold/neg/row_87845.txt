it's insidiousI've dealt with a handful of genetic disorders for a while, as well as depression from life, but this weekend I got hit with a cycle of depression that I thought I'd be completely fine. I prepared myself. Got my favorite foods. Found some new games to distract myself. Hit up my friends for company, and that's when it all fell apart. my friends are shallow trash and I'm sick of them. No one wants to talk about what's really going on. They're all so goddamn happy and they just want to talk about small talk and it's hard for me to understand them. It's hard for me to understand small talk and to understand the idea that everything is "okay". Nothing has been "okay" since I was 12 years old, I've had to deal with bullshit in my head as long as I can remember, and I guess since they're so goddamn normal it doesn't register to them as important? It's sickening, I know they have empathy, I know that they know that it's important, I know they know that I'm depressed and suicidal sometimes, but it's like they DON'T CARE. They're so obsessed with their own lives they can't give a shit about anyone else for a moment, and it's sickening. It's sickening because I do want to die sometimes but I'll be goddamned if I ever let another person feel that way. I'll do everything I can, spend every last dime, spend all my time with someone who's suffering. Strangers even. But the people that are supposed to love me... they do nothing. And I hate to feel like this but it's so normal to think, fuck them, I can't wait to off myself so they have to live with the guilt for the rest of their selfish, shitty lives. That'll show them what's important. It makes me feel unbalanced and I don't like that, but part of me just wants to tell them to go fuck themselves and bite the bullet myself.
