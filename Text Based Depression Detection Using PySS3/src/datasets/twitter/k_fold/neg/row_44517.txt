I don't even know what to say.I'm in my mid 20's and my parents still provide for me. After losing another job I decided to move back home, and, of course, they welcomed me home with open arms. They feed me and let me live rent free in their home until I can get back on my feet again.

Which will be never, because I'm a hopeless loser with no future inany job that doesn't involve flipping burgers. No insult to anyone who works in food service, I worked in FS for more than 8 years and I fucking hate it. I'm not going back, and I'll never get a job in another field.  


The down side to this all, other than the crippling weight of mooching off my parents while simultaneously failing them, is that I have no income of my own. This means that I cannot do either of my two favorite activities, drinking and smoking weed. Which brings me to why I wrote this post.

I just walked downstairs and stole a bottle of wine from my mother so that I could get drunk for one night. What an absolute piece of shit

I know my parents love me, but if they knew who I really was and what I am they wouldn't. I want to show them so they'll finally give up on me and let me die in peace.

The way I see it there are two options:

1. Improve myself and my state of mind so that I can finally stop being a burden on my parents(obviously completely impossimble as I am worthless)

2. Kill myself and stop being a burden on my parents
