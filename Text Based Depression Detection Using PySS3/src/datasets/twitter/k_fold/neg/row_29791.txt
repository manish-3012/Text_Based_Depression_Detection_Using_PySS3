I just can't do this anymore.I am going to rant. You don't have to read it. I assume you won't. Please talk to me. I have nobody.


I don't feel okay at all. I'm an 18 year old who feels like an absolute fuck up (who has felt like this since I can remember). And every single time somebody brings up my age and school and friiends in my head I just go off an think to myself "well i'm missing out on all that". Nearly every night I'm driven to tears because I'm missing out on such a huge portion of my life because I'm too fucking anxious and because my fucking brain cant' produce the right chemicals and I have to rely on a pale little off-white pill to help me survive. Not live, I fucking survive every single day trying to prevent myself from causing harm to *me*. I feel like a machine, it's awful. Nothing affects me anymore. My uncle is dying. My girlfriend is getting incredibly irritated by my jaded nods to her concerns. I fear my mother hates me. I miss my former friends. I hate my clothing, I hate my hair, I hate my body. I'm fucking ugly and everyone just absolutely LOVES to bullshit that I'm not to my face then go off to spurt shit like "oh you shouldn't drink so much alone because you might hurt yourself". Well I'm slowly approaching that moment in my short life. There isn't anything to live for I feel. I don't feel. I can't do this anymore. Please give me advice. Yes I got help and I stopped because I felt so absolutely guilty that I'm stuck on my father's insurance paying for it. does anyone even care about me anymore? i can't even hear myself thinking these antidepressents ruin all creative flow. i used to write. that was comforting but now i can't even formulate an interesting sentence for someone to read and i'm so afraid that my dog is going to die soon i just can't bother with these worries right now i had a panic attack during lunch today and some girl laughed at me
