not emotional i just want to die suicide is on my mind a lot lately... for the most part i can put it off but then every now and then it sounds to good. A nice easy way out for this life. I don't know how people find a drive to do something they like. why can i not find this drive, this unwillingness to do something with my life. 20 already and i'm still lost.. people say it's pretty normal to go what i'm going through but i'm not so sure. i have no goals and no desire to live. Nor can i think of any or feel a passion to do so. Life seems fun but i just cant understand it. I'd rather fall into the abyss then sit here thinking about doing it all the time... If i can never find passion what's the point of taking up all the resources of such amazing people who dont take their life for granted. To me my best option is to waste myself.
