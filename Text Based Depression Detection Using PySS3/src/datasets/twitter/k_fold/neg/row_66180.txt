It was only a matter of timeIâ€™ve been abused, bullied, ostracized, ghosted, and forgotten. I became very bitter and believed that people are inherently bad but Iâ€™ve come to realize that the common denominator is me. Iâ€™m a truly repulsive person to the core and itâ€™s really no wonder Iâ€™m such a pathetically lonely loser. With the exception of my immediate family, no one will miss me.

Iâ€™ll never be a functional person and Iâ€™ve always known it. I have been delaying the inevitable out of a mixture of cowardice and false hope but now itâ€™s painfully obvious that thereâ€™s nothing left for me. Years of depression and anxiety have taken a heavy toll and now Iâ€™m very ready to be at peace. Iâ€™m so very sorry for wasting everyoneâ€™s time.
