I don't see the point.I'll just try to keep it as short as possible I don't wanna bore anyone. 

I've had demons. We all do. But no matter what I do, they'll never go away. Been suicidal since I was 13 but I don't think there's any point in living anymore. I don't have it as bad as many here, but I feel hopeless anyway. 

Just some plot points if they interest you. Been bullied from 1nd grade til 1st year of High School, it was a catholic all boys school, bullying was so bad it made me resent Catholicism. It's like a trigger word, if I find out anyone is Catholic, I immediately don't trust them. Sorry if you're Catholic and this offends you but that's how much the bullying rewired my brain. 

Found God, became born-again but it wasn't enough. I don't think anything is enough. My demons were always here. I found refuge in this woman I loved, but she never loved me back. Now, I started reeking of desperation, I sought love in the wrong places, and now I'm convinced no one out there will accept anyone because I'll never be good enough for anyone. Only good enough as a friend or a best friend. Close, yet no cigar.

Currently, graduated from college and am a radio DJ, but I keep on getting shit from my mother. Tells me it's not a real job, the verbal attacks now starting to hurt. I don't know why else to keep on living, because I've never lived for myself and always felt a necessity to live for them, to simply exist because they want or need me to. 

I think the best way to describe my situation is "the world expects too much from someone who never wanted to be here anyway" and "lacking the will to live, lacking the courage to die". 

I just wrote this so in case if I do end it all, there's a big fucking clue right here in this post. Thank you.
