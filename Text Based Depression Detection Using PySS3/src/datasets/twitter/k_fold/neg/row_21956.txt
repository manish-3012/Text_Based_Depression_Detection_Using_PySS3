Every day for 4,808I have wanted to die.

I had a few suicide attempts, i don't regret them, and the most successful attempt involved me being saved by someone who committed suicide a couple years back. I'm jeleous amd pissed as fuck at them.

My body, my choice means I should be able to kill myself. The system of you are not allowed to die, but fuck you sit there as a mess is trash. 

Worst part is how contagious its been. People fail to make me happy, and in return get depressed. Yes O am on meds, but have medication resilient major depressive disorder.

The only times I have been happy the past few years has been to alter my state of reality, so that the 24/7 intrusive thoughts can't find a way in. If I am forced to live then put me on a thorazine dri0 so I can be a zombie until the world lets me die.
