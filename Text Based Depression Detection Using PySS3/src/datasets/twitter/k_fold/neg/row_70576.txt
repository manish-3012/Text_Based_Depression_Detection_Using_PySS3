Anyone else sometimes "feeling bad" reading posts here ?I see so many sad storys from kids that got beaten by their parents, backstabed from friends, their family dies or something else that is really terrible.
And I am sitting here with honestly no excuse than myself.
Feeling like a piece of shit that does not deserve to life since he had all opportunitys.
So many people would wish to grow up like me with amazing parents an amazing brother, friends in school but over the last years I somehow kept growing more and more apart from reality somehow, if that makes sense.
3 Years now out of School with no friends 2 failed college attempts and the 3rd currently running and its looking bad.
If someone would ask me " What is wrong, how do you feel?" I dont know what to answere.
It hurts me that I have no friends but somehow in my experience when I was out with "friends" in Highschool and everybody was drinking and talking and I just sometimes sat at the table talking to nobody , than those were the moments where I felt REALLY alone. Not the endless evenings I spend alone infront of my computer doing nothing.
I dont know what I want , I dont know whats comming, It just feels so painful somehow.
You probably have no Idea what I am talking about since I dont even know what I am talking about and its hard for me to write this in english but I really wanted this to get out.
Have a wonderful night everybody.
