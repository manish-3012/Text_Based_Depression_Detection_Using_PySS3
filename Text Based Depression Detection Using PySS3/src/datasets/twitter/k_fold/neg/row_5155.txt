Feeling BadI keep having suicidal thoughts because I'm stressed out trying to balance work, school, and a relationship. I don't even really feel like I'm at my lowest but I can't stop thinking about certain things, one of them being suicide. It's like an obsessive thought. I self-harmed a couple of days ago to alleviate some of the anxiety I feel when thinking about suicide. I don't think I'll actually do it, but I've been sabotaging my grades because I have so little motivation to live life and take care of my responsibilities when I feel this way. I don't know how to snap out of it. Finals are in two weeks.
