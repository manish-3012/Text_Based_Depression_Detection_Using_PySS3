lost and flooded by depressionEnglish isn't my main language sorry for the mistakes and incoherence. 

Just finished high-school I think it is in English.Â Â  I'm nowÂ  18yr I made it through even tho I have dysgraphia and dyspraxia. I have a supportive mother and a sweet gf and good friends but

It has been 2 or 3 years since I think about killing myself In anyÂ  possible ways.

One day I had cut my veins under my wrist and I felt nothing on the moment I just looked at my blood falling on the ground. 


I Lied to 2 therapist cause I can't describe what I feel and don't want anti depression medecine. 

Not finding any interest in studying more since I dont know what I want to do With my life. Since I searched for everything I could do and didn't found anything worth it. 
I Have everything I need to be healthy and accomplished in life but don't feel like I want to live. 

well I'm lazy I guess but if everything stopped right now I won't be disappointed even if I was a billionaire I'd prefer everything to stop, For me. 

I see death as some sort of eternal sleep were u don't have to think, act, or do, anymore. 

I don't know what to do with my life. 

We will all die anyway because of climate change or something else 

So I might die tomorrow from '' an accident '' so my family won't have to think to much about it, And they'll probably think I was just unlucky.
