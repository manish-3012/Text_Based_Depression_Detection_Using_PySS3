I love the feeling when I've made a planI do nothing for a few days and wallow in my own depression until I finally make the choice to end my life. Then everything feels so nice. I feel actual happiness that I almost never get. 

I've made preparations, tied all my loose ends, and typed out a will left open on my computer so it will be found. This time I'll succeed, I know it. I've failed many times in the past, but I was going about it the wrong way. I can't wait to be gone, I hope it works.
