I think I always knew it would end like this.I always try and trick myself into thinking thereâ€™s hope.  Maybe my family will care and stand beside me as I get help. But it hasnâ€™t happened. 

It makes you feel like a burden. When every time you ask your mom to talk to  a doctor about you feel, she sighs and gets annoyed every time you ask. Even though itâ€™s important and you know youâ€™ll kill yourself eventually without it.

I canâ€™t hold on anymore. Every day gets harder the longer I go on. I think itâ€™s time I sort things out and figure out how Iâ€™m gonna do this.

I think I always knew Iâ€™d end up killing my self. I just didnâ€™t think it would be so soon. I just want to matter to them. But all I do is make everybody miserable with everything I do. Itâ€™s no wonder my family doesnâ€™t care.

I guess weâ€™ll see if I figure out how everything ends. Iâ€™m done living in a recurring cycle of misery and guilt. Maybe Iâ€™ll finally be gone for good.
