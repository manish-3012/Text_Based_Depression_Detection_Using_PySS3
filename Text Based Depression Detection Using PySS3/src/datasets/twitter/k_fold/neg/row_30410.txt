Why am I having these thoughts?I feel like at this point there is no other choice. 
Let's start with the about me. Dropped out of high school, had a kid. Went to college, flunked out. Got a decent job, got laid off. Got a dui, three years later because of financial instability, and I still haven't gotten it taken care of. After 2 years of being single, I fell in love with a beautiful girl that always did her best to take care of me. I neglected her and myself and she left me. 
The worst part, is now I'm getting my legal affairs in order. I'll be able to find a better job. I'll be able to be independent. Things are actually looking up. But I doubt I'll actually do anything. Everything I have ever done has ended in failure, who's to say that won't change.

I've debated it for the last few years honestly. Even had been evaluated after telling someone. I put on a show, so as to not be committed.

The only real fear I have is for my son, but I'd rather him growing up to his stepfather, than to grow up watching me failed.

I just feel like a ship without a rudder, I'll never get on course. At this point, I'd feel more productive to sink.
