I cant get out.I cant do this anymore, I constantly lie and I seriously cant help it I don't control what I say or do anymore and all i'm doing is just hurting people and I need to stop myself and i've tried so hard but I cant stop myself anymore and its the only way, I cant live with the lies and the pain I cause to people and its making me feel so depressed and im constantly fearing that somebody will find out my lies. I don't know why I lie but I cant help it and this is the only way to stop the pain.
