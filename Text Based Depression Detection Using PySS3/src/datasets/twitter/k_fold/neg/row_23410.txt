Is it weird Iâ€™m not even sad about it?I feel good. Iâ€™m bingeing Netflix for now. I have food, got paid yesterday. I could go anywhere if I wanted to, Iâ€™m not even stuck here. I could go to so many of my favorite places. 

I am comfortable, for all intents and purposes. Yet, deep down, here I am. And I know. Iâ€™ve always known Iâ€™d be here. I always end up back here, no matter how many times I push on, I end up back here. 

Itâ€™s ok. It has to end sometime. The ups and downs. The ride does eventually have to stop.
