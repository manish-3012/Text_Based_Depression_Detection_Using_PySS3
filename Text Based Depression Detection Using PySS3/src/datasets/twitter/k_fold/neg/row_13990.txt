"attempting" suicide is the only way to get them to understand and help me.I'll start out by saying that i am severely depressed, and in extreme suffering everyday, I am suicidal but I can't actually bring myself to do anything,  I just want help but my family refuses to believe that I'm bad, they stick me in useless therapy for years only for me to drop out bc I'm still in a bad enviroment. I dont want to really explain my situation because nothing is really going to stop me from doing this. I just want to get their attention and for them to finally realize that i'm sick and need help and for them to get help too. I've tried so many times for years to but they don't believe me.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I just want to swallow whats considered to be a lethal overdose of Tylenol and then call an ambulance. I just want to know what to expect.  I just want help from people that can see that i'm not ok instead of writing me off as just a little sad before I actually do end up committing suicide because there is nothing left for me.
