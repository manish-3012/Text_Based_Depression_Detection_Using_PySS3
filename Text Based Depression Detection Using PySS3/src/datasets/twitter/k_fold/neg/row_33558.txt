Checking myself in to a hospital on fridaySo after about 4 attempts by overdose in the past 3 weeks and constantly feeling like shit I have decided to go to the emergency room of a hospital.

I figure I should go to get checked out and see if any damage was done. 

I'm just really nervous and will probably attempt again on Friday as I am alone that day.
