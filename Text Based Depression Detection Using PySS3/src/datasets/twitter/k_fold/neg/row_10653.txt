I want to end it I donâ€™t care anymore and no one else doesIâ€™ve wanted to kill myself since I was 13  Iâ€™ve tried a few times but never been able to get through with it. 

I told my parents they said I could talk to a therapist I said I would like that and they said they would handle it. Nothing happened no therapist never came up again. Our school did a mental health test I told our counselor she didnâ€™t care.

No one cares

Iâ€™m turning 17 in about a month 

I just want to sleep forever
