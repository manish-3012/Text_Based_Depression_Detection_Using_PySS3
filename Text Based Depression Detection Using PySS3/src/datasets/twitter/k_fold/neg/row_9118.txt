InevitableI'm nearly 36, failing my way through college, going to be thousands of dollars in debt with no degree while I can barely pay my Bill's. My kids don't need me anymore, and don't really want me either. No friends besides a few online folks and no relationships since my marriage failed a year and a half ago. It is inevitable I kill myself just like my mom did, it's just when can I make myself finally do it?
