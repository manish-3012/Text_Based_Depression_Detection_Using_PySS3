I am this closeI've had enough of this shit. No friends. Family doesn't give a shit. Girlfriend dumped me for maybe the only guy I would have considered a friend and has been harassing/abusing me about it since. Harassed at work. Harassed at Uni.

Why the fuck am I supposed to even try and fight this shit anymore? All I can think about aside from how **FUCKING** angry I am is how much easier it would be just to flip my car into a pole and be done with it. I am so fucking close now. You know what? I don't want to talk to a fucking psychiatrist about it. I tried that shit for 3 years after my only other girlfriend (and friend) killed herself and it obviously hasn't fucking helped. Meds don't work, talking doesn't work, exercising doesn't work, writing doesn't work, **nothing** fucking works and I've had enough. I am so very fucking close to doing this again and there is no-one in my fucking life to stop me anymore. Fuck all of this shit.
