Found out I am on the autism spectrum, suicide is the only option.Born with is essentially a birth defect. My social retardation has lead me to squander so many potential connections with people because I was not aware of my condition. Now I'm in a spot where I will soon no longer be able to connect to people. Because of my flat affect and struggle to put on a normal face, people don't like being around me, no matter what's on the inside because it's completely irrelevant if I don't fit in. 

As far as love,a concept that I can't even comprehend, I will never experience it. In my age bracket, how you are in the inside is #9999999 on the list of things that matter when you want to start dating. It's all about everything external. How attractive you are, your status, etc. If you don't appear normal (neurotypical), you're fucked. Doesn't matter AT ALL, what's on the inside. They're not interested. I want to die. Living is inhumane. I'd have already done it myself if I wasn't a coward. I would step in front of a vehicle, but I'm too much of a weakling to want to trouble another person, especially the city workers that have to clean the human excrement off the road.

No mental hospital can make people like me, no medication can make me not stumble over words. As long as I am stuck like this, the only thing I'm good for is being taken advantage of by normal people.
