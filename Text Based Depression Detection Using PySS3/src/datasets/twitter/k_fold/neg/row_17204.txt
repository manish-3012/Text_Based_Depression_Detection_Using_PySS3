Almost jumped down my staircaseI didn't want to jump down the stairs but down the whole staircase. We have a circular staircase (idk how to describe it. There is just a hole in the middle). It's 3 stories high. While walking all the way up something just came over me and I started leaning over the railing further and further. Lost balance. Almost fell. Idk what I was thinking. I just wanted to end it. I would normally think more rationally before I try something but I was just completely calm and my mind was empty. I am suicidal but I'm probably not gonna do it because I'm too much of a pussy. But this time I was completely collected and stone cold. Has anybody got an idea wtf was going on. I'm scared of acting on another impulse and I sure got more reliable ways to impulsively off myself. I'm also kind of an alcoholic and I'm even more impulsive when drunk. Idk. Help?
