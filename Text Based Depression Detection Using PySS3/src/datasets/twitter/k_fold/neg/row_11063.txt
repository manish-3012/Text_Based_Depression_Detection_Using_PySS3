BlahI feel hopeless.

I have no idea how to make close friends, and that's all I actually want. I have no support network, and it makes it hard to see the point in even trying to be productive member of society. 

I don't have any passions. My career path makes poor money. I don't even remember what it's like to really laugh. I separated myself from countless unhealthy people, and now I'm left with no one. Part of me wants those people back, but I know they only escalate these awful feelings.

Yes I am, and have been, through many forms of therapy, medications, and most mental health help available.

Suicide is just always this little voice in my head telling me it can make all my problems go away. Even if my problems didn't exist, I don't feel enough joy or peace to make life seem worthwhile.
