I need to man up and commit suicide. The only thing that makes life worth living and tolerable is being high on drugs or alcohol. And that has to end.EDIT: Currently am high on vicodin and xanax. It's the only reason i care enough to stay alive. It's the only thing that makes this hell slow down. Maybe I can OD one day and it will kill me. here's hoping i die tonight.

My family is  disappointed in me. They'll at least be able to seek religious peace in their God when i'm dead. Everything I do is "incorrect" now. It's not an acceptable way to live. I ''have to change [my attitude, the way i do things, how hard I try]." 

I give up. I'm tired. Everyone will *literally*, *objectively*, be **better off without me in the world.**

All my friends will. They won't admit it, but they will be better off when I'm gone from this world. It's better this way.
