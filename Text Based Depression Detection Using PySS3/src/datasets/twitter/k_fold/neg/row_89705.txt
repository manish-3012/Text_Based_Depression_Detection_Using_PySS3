I am having suicidal thoughts [18 M] after my gf of 14 months left me and blocked me out of her life [19 F]My girlfriend of 14 months left me a month ago, we've talked on and off for a month, she blocked me and deleted all our photos together and wants to forget me, she says she feels nothing for me and wants to forget about me, she blocked me. 
I am thinking of killing myself, everyday I am depressed and I can't eat or sleep, I cry all the damn time and I feel so alone and worthless right now, I cared about her and looked out for her always but she says I am a liar and a manipulator and that I hurt her, I don't have any friends and hardly any family, she was my entire world, my entire life
and now she never wants to see me again and doesn't care about me.........I want her back, I don't know what to do, I feel like I want to die, maybe if I told her that she would at least become my friend ? 
I desperately want her back in my life :( 

tl;dr: My girlfriend of 14 months is gone and never wants to see me again and I am having suicidal thoughts, I don't know what to do
