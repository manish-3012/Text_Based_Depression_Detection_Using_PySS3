I feel like I am a dissapointment to myselfI've never belonged to any group of people ever since I was born and I was bullied through my first 16 years of life. I'm addicted to gaming, extremely lazy and I've lost all my motivation. I currently live on my own and work as a waiter, which is the most inhuman work experience I have ever had in my entire life, because people treat you like a slave and don't care about your mental or physical health. I also have insomnia, I can't sleep at night so I just play video games all night or watch some stupid videos on YouTube. I haven't found a career I want to pursue in, I have no hobbies except gaming, I am really anti-social because people have never treated me well, I am not good at having long and active conversations and I just think that I don't belong amongst others. I also haven't felt love for someone after 5th grade. I am quite emotionless. I just feel nothing. I have a massive depression and I am very frustrated because I can't change my life because it just seems to lead nowhere.
