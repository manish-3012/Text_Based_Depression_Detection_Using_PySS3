Tomorrow will be my birthdayIn 20 minutes (July 29) will be my birthday. If you don't remember me I made this post https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/38ovbm/how_to_deal_with_this_situation_get_out_please/  Also more negative stuff has happened since then, my mom saying "she doesn't care about my situation and i need to get the f out" then dening she said that and slapping me in the face, and she still is constantly shit talking about me, I have nothing I can do, I honestly feel like killing myself on my birthday. Really don't see any other options at this point.
