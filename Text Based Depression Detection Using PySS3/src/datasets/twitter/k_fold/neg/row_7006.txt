This will likely be my last message on the internet and IRL.I don't know why I'm doing this. Maybe I just need to leave one last word for people to read.

The point is just that I'm done. With life, the world, and everything else. None of it is for me as I've come to learn. I don't want to exist. Simple as that. I've posted here before saying I had a date set but I delayed the decision to see if things would improve. They haven't. I'm done fighting to get better and tired of constantly losing at everything. It's just time to give up now.

It'll take too long and it'll be way too painful to wait for a natural death, so I'm doing the logical thing and ending my life on my own terms. Just need to get a few more affairs in order and I'll be ready to go. 

Funny. Feels like I'm preparing for a trip.
