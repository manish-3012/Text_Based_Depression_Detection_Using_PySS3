Apparently I just have to change my way of thinking in order to not be depressed.Well anyone on this page knows that is bullshit. I'm on hella anti-depressants rn and I'm still feeling this way. The psych has upped the dose on one, and says that therapists he' contacting for me will reach out to me this week. 

He said that two weeks ago and I haven't heard from anyone. I'm not even mad because the fact of the matter is no one really cares, even doctors. Everyone's just trying to make money of others for their own gain with minimal to no care about anyone else.

My friend recently told me that I need to reach out when I start to feel badly, not when I'm about to end it all. I told him that no one knows what to say to me. They all try for an hour or so but I'm so sure that there is nothing to live for, that the convo always ends with: 

*"I don't know what to tell you, but you have to turn your thinking around."*

So I don't tell anyone. Not my mom, not my friends, not my boyfriend. After all, **no one knows how to help**. **I don't think I can be helped.** I think about death more than I think about anything. I've researched how lethal certain bridges and building are around me. I cant legally buy a gun until 2021 due to the 51/50 called on me back in 2016. Maybe that's something to look forward to. 

I'm not going to go into how my life is a shit hole, you just have to turn on the news and look at the state of the world and how people treat each other. Pain is forever and happiness is fleeting - its been that way my whole life. 

Life is suffering and I'm fucking done. Now i just have to decide if I want to die on the pavement or in the ocean.
