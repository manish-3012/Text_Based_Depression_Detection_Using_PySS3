Is it me or just middle school drama??Today i've been ignored by my friend (MA), dissed by my other friend (LK and LD), saw 3 girls that i thought were somewht my friends talking about me (or it looked like it) and when i said hi to them they gave me that faked.. annoyed looking smile and waved, plus i wasn't picked by anyone to be there partner in gym, than my other friend (GB) got mad at me cuz i thought my friend (AE) was my partner when really she was partners with GB so she gave me the like 'death stare' than my friend said she'd be my partner than ran off and was partners with someone else so i was all alone. Its almost the last day of school and i really dont wanna end the year lonely, i've always felt like i've never had friends even though everyone says i'm like 'THE POPULAR GIRL' cuz i have a lot of 'friends' but i feel like they're always gossiping about me and just pretending to be my friend. is there something wrong with me, cuz i've never been this... i guess betrade(?)
