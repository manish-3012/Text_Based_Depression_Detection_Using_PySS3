I been suicidal, So I went to bahamasThe entire trip, I felt super depressed. I just saw everyone with their family or love ones. I think I was the only solo traveler. The entire two weeks felt like hassle and chores, I forced myself to go out everyday. The check in and out of hotels, the trips. I just felt exhausted and wasn't having any fun. I was in one of the most beautiful places on earth and I didn't enjoy any of it. 

I lost interest in everything
