I want to existIâ€™m trans and bisexual and right now I really just feel completely and utterly hopeless, for the first time in my life. I donâ€™t even know what else to say, Iâ€™m just fucked. Every single thing in this shit ass life causes me pain, it doesnâ€™t make sense. Iâ€™m always anxious or sad about something, and now I finally start to pull my shit together for once in my life, and then this Amy bitch comes along and wants to smash it to fucking pieces. I donâ€™t know what to do. Thereâ€™s no way I can handle this anymore.
