The suicide hotline is a jokeI waited for over an hour for the texting portion. After it said it connected me, there was no response. The hotline is busy now. I was disconnected 3 times. There is no help to reach out for. No one cares and nothing is getting any better despite my best efforts. I just want to check out and end all this pain
