Is life meant for everyone?I know it might be an overused quote but recently it feels like it speaks to me alot. Over the time I started feeling less in general. Have almost no real friends. Parent don't really know what to do and here I am just waking up hoping I won't next day. Recently a rough break up from an relationship and right now I'm just alone have no one really. Have some 'friends' who joked about killing myself so won't see them much. 

I dont see a meaning in life. We wake up work try to enjoy our spare with the people we love over and over again. Every day is like a drag. Anyone else experiencing the same state of mind?

Any tips on how to enjoy life?

I'm seeing a psychiator but right now I feel like the only thing that stops me is because I don't wanna hurt my parents &amp; brother.

Thanks for reading.
