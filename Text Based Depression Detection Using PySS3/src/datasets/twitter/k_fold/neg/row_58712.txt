Itâ€™s decided.I know what bridge Iâ€™m jumping off to kill myself. Its tomorrow morning, around 9:30. Iâ€™m writing this around 11 est. Iâ€™m 18 years old, first year college student and I canâ€™t see myself living by the end of this year. 

Iâ€™m so distant from my family, I never felt like I belonged. My friendships arenâ€™t genuine, thereâ€™s never a follow up to hang out. I hate my physical appearance, short, skinny, ugly, crooked teeth, weak.. Constant comments from people around me talking about my height or arms, I know theyâ€™re laughing at me. I hate myself so much. 

Iâ€™ve never belonged with any group, people just donâ€™t like me and Iâ€™ve tried so fucking hard. The fire and drive I used to have is all used up. I know itâ€™ll break my moms heart but if Iâ€™m dead I wonâ€™t have to think about it. Ive wasted so much time feeling like this Iâ€™m tired of dragging it on. Life is hard and not for everyone, especially not for me. Reddit, it might be too late for me.
