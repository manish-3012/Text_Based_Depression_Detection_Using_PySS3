I know it's stupid but I just want to dieI'm graduating with my master's this weekend but I don't have a job and my major isn't very marketable. I have a little over a year of work experience from while I was in school but that little doesn't seem to get me anywhere (I've been actively applying to jobs for months). Honestly I just feel like I'm completely useless and I already can't stand the boredom of having nothing to do. I have no idea where I want to live (I have family I could live with but that comes with its own problems) or what to do with my time so I'm just stuck in my apartment alone all day every day. I also have a phobia of driving so I'm too scared to go anywhere really. I'm on meds and seeing a psychiatrist regularly and everything but I just want to die. Everyone says they know I'll figure something out but it's just so hard to believe. And I don't know how to get through the sheer monotony of life anymore. Then if I ever do get a job, there's the endless monotony of the rest of my life. I just want to end it. I don't know why I'm still here.
