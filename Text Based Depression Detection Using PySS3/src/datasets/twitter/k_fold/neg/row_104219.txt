I feel like I'm smotheringI don't know what's wrong with me.  I just feel like like I'm in the middle of a huge implosion.  Everything feels likes it's crushing me.  I hate feeling this way.  I think about suicide on occasion but I don't know that I could ever do it.  I just want to take an unlabored breath and feel happy without feeling bad about it or waiting for something horrible to happen to me because i almost relaxed.  Kind of pathetic!!  But that's me.
