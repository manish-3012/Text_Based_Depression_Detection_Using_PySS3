all i ever wanted was someone to tell me i don't deserve any of thisthere are no words for what i have been through in the past 23 years. the worst things in life have happened to me over and over again.

i have no one to support me. my family and friends have all rejected and abandoned me.

they tell me everything is my fault

they tell me i am worthless

they tell me i deserved it

finally, i believe them

i can't do this anymore, it's too hard

find my cat a good home

absolutely no funeral or memorial service of any kind

sprinkle my ashes on the field i got married in. i was happy there once.

i never thought my life would turn out like this
