I'm going to let it kill meI have anorexia, depression, and severe anxiety. I tried to hang myself on April 18th but my ex fiance found me and I was sent to a hospital. The whole ordeal scared him too much and he completely ended our relationship. He wont even see me and says he is furious at me. I'm furious at me to. He was my guardian angel, I love him with every fiber of my being and I ruined everything.  I had to move back in with the person who caused my childhood trauma in the first place and have simply been being yelled at for my feelings of wanting to die. I'm going to let my anorexia kill me. I'm so exhausted of fighting everyday. I'm so sorry. I love you.
