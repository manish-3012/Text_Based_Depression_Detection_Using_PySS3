I don't get it.  I really think I deserve it.I really feel like a terrible person.  I think we're all terrible people.

As a teenager I sliced my wrists to hell, stitches and ER multiple times.  Hazard of growing up with Hawthorne Heights I guess, AMIRITE?  Lulz, course I'm right.

Despite knowing I'm a terrible individual not worthy of life, some motherfucker on here is going to try and rationalize to me why I should continue living.  I guess, I just want to know why.  Why is life so precious, and what makes it precious to you?
