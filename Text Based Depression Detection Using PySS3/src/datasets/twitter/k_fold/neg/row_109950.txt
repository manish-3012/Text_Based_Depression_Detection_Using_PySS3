Guys, I really need your help...For the last three months or so, Iâ€™ve been taking care of a friend who just moved to California because of her motherâ€™s job. She has low self esteem, depression, stress, and ocasional suicidal thoughts, it really scares me that she might do something while Iâ€™m not able to take care of her. Her parents donâ€™t really care about her, they see that something is wrong with her, but they do nothing and even pretend like nothing is wrong. I encourage her to talk to a professional again (last time was around three weeks ago in a video call because quarantine), but she doesnâ€™t want to, she says â€itâ€™s not necessaryâ€ and then I try to explain why it is necessary and important to do so, that the last time she talked to one she started to feel a lot better, but she just doesnâ€˜t listen to me. She feels lonely because â€nobody talks to me anymore since I movedâ€,  and I try to tell her that she is not completely alone, that I have been and will always be there, but that does not help much. She doesnâ€™t accept my compliments, I know, I canâ€™t force her to do so, but when I say something to compliment her, she just continues to say a lot of shit about herself. Her dad is sick of coronavirus (she luckly isnâ€™t for some reason)... Maybe, Itâ€™d help a lot to meet new people and so, but, yâ€™now, quarantine

I think Iâ€™ve done all I can. Iâ€™ve shown my support and love, caring about her daily, encouraging her to talk to a professional, â€œeverything will be alrightâ€, and lots of more things that would take me a lot more to write.

It breaks my heart, I really want her to be happy again.

If you have any experience with this kind of stuff, Iâ€™d really appreciate you comments, If you donâ€™t, but you wanna leave a help, youâ€™re welcome too.

(Iâ€™m a girl too, in case youâ€™re wondering)

Thanks in advance.
