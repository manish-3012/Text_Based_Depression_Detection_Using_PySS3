Things took a dark turn...I planned out my death, picked a date, and made a list of things that I need to do before I die; I was ready to go. Then I started thinking about what I was leaving behind. My mom, my dog, my cat. I started thinking that, with a few modifications to my plan, I could take them all with me. The worst part is that the thought of committing murder-suicide doesnâ€™t freak me out as much as it should. It actually makes *sense* to me. So, I find myself wondering: Do I go through with my original plan? Do I go to the hospital and admit to having homicidal thoughts? Do I kill myself, my mother, and my pets? Iâ€™m not sure what to do...
