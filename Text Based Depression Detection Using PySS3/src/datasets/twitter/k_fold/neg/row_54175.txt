First Post: A RantIâ€™ve had this reddit account for about 6 years now and am now breaking this lurking streak of mine to make my first ever official post here because I canâ€™t keep any of this in anymore. Last year in the month of November something happened to me. I donâ€™t wish to talk much about it now because I feel like it has been overly-discussed in my life and it just makes it emotionally tiring to mention the specifics of this incident again. But ever since then, for the past 8 months or so I have never wanted to leave this world so badly. I used to talk to my closest friends about this and ranted to them whenever Iâ€™ve felt my lowest, but I think that eventually theyâ€™ll get tired of me doing so, and hence Iâ€™ve since stopped. After all, they have their own lives to live too, and frankly I feel that they are all too busy to care. I donâ€™t blame them though. Anyway, as a result of that, I have never felt more alone the past few months. Everything that I have been feeling is kept inside of me and thereâ€™s no one I can really talk to. Yet, despite feeling lonely, for some reason I choose to push away those that care, opting for isolation instead. Occasionally I deactivate my social medias, delete the apps, and turn off whatever notifications I have on my messaging apps. I donâ€™t talk to my family much anymore, and find it really tiring to even answer back with a simple â€œyesâ€ or â€œnoâ€. 

Many times Iâ€™ve thought about ending my life, but I never seem to be able to find the courage to do so. Often I would sit at my balcony at home just finding the courage to push myself off the edge. Iâ€™ve tried constantly over and over again â€œresearchingâ€ on ways to kill myself, tried mixing alcohol with my medication and thinking up ways to leave this world. I find that suicide is constantly on my mind. Iâ€™m currently serving my National Service in the military now, and in the past when Iâ€™ve handled live rounds, the thought of everything ending with the simple squeeze of a trigger often drifted through my mind. Thoughts of hanging myself in my bunk in camp were common too. Iâ€™ve recently started self-harming, something I havenâ€™t done to myself in 4 years. I feel like the only reason why I havenâ€™t ended myself yet though, is because of the people I care about as I donâ€™t wish to cause any inconveniences or pain to them. But I can feel this sentiment slowly going away and that it just isnâ€™t worth it anymore. Doesnâ€™t help that they are slowly drifting away from me. Honestly in the past, I have always thought that suicide would be the way I would go. After that incident last November, that idea seems way more believable now.

Sleeping is hard for me. Often I canâ€™t seem to fall asleep at night, whereas in the day all I think about is sleeping. When I am not in camp, I tend to drink as much alcohol as it takes to fall asleep, else I would lay awake for hours. Every night I go to bed wishing that I wonâ€™t wake up the next morning. And when I do, the feeling is horrible. The simple things irritate me, but sometimes I am just too tired emotionally to care too. I live the days of my life right now with a huge lack of motivation, feeling as if I am a zombie of some kind, just sleepwalking through the days. Iâ€™m always on either side of the spectrum, either I donâ€™t feel anything or I feel everything, and itâ€™s really tiring either way.

That concludes my first ever reddit post.
