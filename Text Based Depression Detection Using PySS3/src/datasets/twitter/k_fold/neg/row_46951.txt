17 years old, already failed at life. Body dysmorphia. Can't fit in.I'm a 17 year old girl. I get shit grades because I'm a lazy shit. I've been sexually, emotionally, physically and verbally abused from when I was 7 until I was 14 and a half. But then my mom moved so she only just mentally fucks with me from across the country. I haven't seen her since.  I'm tired of bottling things up. I'm having a lot of problems with accepting my body (I had an eating disorder last year) and my sexuality (don't know if I'm bi or a lesbian, because I really like my male friend) I have a 2.96 GPA and I had to quit cross country. I feel so lost and sick around people. I always act normal though. Above all, I feel like shit because I don't have "real problems"

I love life but I'm exhausted. I can't handle going from this really dizzy euphoria that makes it hard to concentrate and loving myself and everyone around me for 1 month to being depressed AGAIN for 3-6 months. Its been like this since 7th grade. I mean, I'm still down to earth and introverted but I don't know what's wrong with me. Also I feel like stupid shitty Holden Caulfield because I'm surrounded by sheltered people and I grew up too fast.
