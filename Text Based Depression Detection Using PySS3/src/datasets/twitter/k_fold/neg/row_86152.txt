Finally think I'm ready to just do itI feel like tomorrow is the day that I finally want to end it all. I'm tired of feeling unloved, stupid, useless, worthless. I think it's best for everyone that I end it. Nobody loves me or gives a crap about me therefore I feel as if I have no purpose in being here. I've thought about it on and off for the last 5 years and now I think I'm finally ready. I'm afraid but once it's over it's over and there's no more emotional pain.
