feeling suicidal more than ever... canâ€™t even go for a walk to escape my mind.my life has not changed much since the epidemic, because I never lived my life in the first place. Iâ€™m at home 80% of the time (100% now), no friends, etc... the only change is that my family are now self isolating at home. Theyâ€™re talking about how lonely, depressing and isolated they feel, when I feel like that every day. 

I usually would go on walks for like an hour, I went on a walk today, and not even 20 minutes of walking I get stopped from the police asking where I was going... I told them Iâ€™m just getting exercise and they advised me to go back home. So now Iâ€™m locked inside my house and my mind. I know we are all struggling in this world right now, but I really didnâ€™t think my life could get any worse.

I want to die but I canâ€™t even find a chance now my family is home and police are patrolling the streets...
