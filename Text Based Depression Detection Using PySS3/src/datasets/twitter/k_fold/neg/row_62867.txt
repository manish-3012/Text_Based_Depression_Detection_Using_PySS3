Went to the bridge that I've been writing about for two yearsIt's always been my bridge of choice, how I planned on going out. The first time I mentioned it by name was two years ago in my writings. I never went to it, though. It was a two hour bus ride and I was often too tired to deal with it.

But I went today. Not with the specific intent to kill myself, more so just to see it. Just to see the bridge I've been wanting to throw myself off of for two years.

And it was a fucking beautiful bridge. The view was amazing. I looked down that 200 foot drop and my only thought was "Well, that doesn't look as far down as I thought it would look." And there was this sort of odd comedy in it. I laughed. I found myself fucking laughing hysterically and I had no clue why. I stood there for half an hour, just laughing to myself and looking down. It looked so fucking easy. It would take maybe 5 seconds to climb over the railing and disappear. I could've been gone, just like that.

But I stepped away. Because I don't want to hurt my friends by killing myself. I bought myself a milkshake instead, and went home.

I started this journey at 5:30 in the fucking morning and just got home an hour ago. Fuck dude, all that work for nothing I guess, huh?

But it felt like.. This may sound weird but, it felt like meeting a friend I hadn't seen in a long time. This... This fucking bridge.. I talked about it for years but never fucking saw it. And now I have. And it was fucking beautiful.
