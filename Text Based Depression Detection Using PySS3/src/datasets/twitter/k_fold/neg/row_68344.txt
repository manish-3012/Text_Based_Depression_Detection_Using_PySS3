What's even the fucking point posting on hereIt's not like anyone's going to read what I say on here or whatever I try to post on here my posts get overlooked I'm on my last legs I can't go on anymore I don't know what else to do I don't know how to reach out to anyone else I'm so done I'm done with all of this it's like my life is some big cosmic joke and God is a huge bully and enjoys torturing me and making my life worse and worse and worse and more difficult. I can't take it anymore. I just want to die. I want to die. I want to die more than anything else. Death I would welcome with completely open arms none of this is fair. I tried reaching out. They won't be able to say I didn't. I tried reaching out. It doesn't work for me for some reason. Who am I supposed to reach out to? This is too much
