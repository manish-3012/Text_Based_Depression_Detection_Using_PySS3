Genuinely trying, and everything still goes wrong!I'm one of those "lucky" people who has health insurance through work. BUT I have to pay $45 to see a doctor, then $90 to see a specialist (therapist, psychiatrist, etc). Then the meds aren't covered. I barely make enough at this job to pay rent and gas, and sometimes go hungry. Can't afford the meds or therapy.

My gf offers to help pay. I finally accept her help. The doctor I've been assigned to is in another county, and only available from 11AM-2PM Tue-Thu. Somehow I got assigned a Dr 40 miles from work, 58 miles from home, and at a time I can't reasonably reach. And if I don't see him, I can't get a referral to anyone who can prescribe meds, or go to a therapist.

My kids live with their mom, and I pay child support. Got my tax return stolen last year for being late, even though I've never missed a payment. I have to do a monthly check in too. Got told today that I am "not in compliance" and that I'm subject to arrest if I don't turn in paperwork by noon tomorrow. I have been in compliance the entire time, made payments on time, and turned in all paper work early.

I am so fucking close to actually killing myself. The pain of cutting, hanging, or strangling can not even come close to the pain of trying to do the right thing.
