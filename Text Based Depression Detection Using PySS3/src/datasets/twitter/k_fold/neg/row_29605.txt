I'm at a complete lossI've (18M) thought about ending it all multiple times throughout my life and i think that right now i'm as close to suicide as i've ever been.

I've dealt with depression since my father died about 10 years ago, since then i have rarely felt happiness. I don't enjoy anything these days and just long for sleep. My peers don't seem to grasp the severity of my issues, the girl i like barely responds to my messages and i'm afraid that i will lose the few friends i have because were all of to different colleges. 

Once i lose them i don't think i will have the will to keep living so i'm asking you, reddit, to give me a reason to keep going.
