I'm just completely lostIâ€™m at a point where I donâ€™t know what to do.  I am 26 years old, and after being in and out of school for years, I finally finished my undergrad degree 8 months ago.  Iâ€™m a foreveralone.  I have no friends.  The few friends I used to have will no longer speak to me.  Iâ€™ve never held or kissed a girl before, though I obviously desperately want to.  It isnâ€™t for a lack of trying; I am always invisible or a creep, one of the two.  On a rare occasion Iâ€™ll make a female friend, but that never lasts very long.

I live far away from my family.  I still havenâ€™t found a job, not even a part time minimum wage shit job to pay my rent.  My mother pays my rent and Iâ€™m grateful, but her generosity is wearing thin.  Iâ€™m about to be thrown to the dogs.  Iâ€™m completely alone and I have no money.  I donâ€™t even have a computer; Iâ€™m actually posting this from a university computer lab.

Aside from my job search I donâ€™t do shit all day, because I donâ€™t find anything enjoyable or fulfilling.  As a result, I donâ€™t even attempt to make friends anymore (as if I wouldnâ€™t be cast out again anyway).  Iâ€™ve been miserable and alone my entire adult life and made no personal progress in it, despite my efforts.

I donâ€™t know how much longer I can go without killing myself.  School gave me some focus, and for a while I was content to just piss everything away without caring whether or not I lived or died.  But now I really want my life to end.  Badly.
