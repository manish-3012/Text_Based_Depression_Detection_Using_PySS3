No one deserves the mental weight that comes with having me in their lives.Iâ€™m just a fucking burden to everyone in my life. My parents barely talk to me anymore. My sisters havenâ€™t talked me me in weeks. My rapid cycling has me by the throat and Iâ€™m suffocating. I just want this feeling to go away. But that wonâ€™t happen unless Iâ€™m gone. I just wish I could go to sleep and not wake up tomorrow.
