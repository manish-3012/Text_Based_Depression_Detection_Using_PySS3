Plans for the weekend.I wanted to end it all this weekend seeing as my parents were in Liverpool and it was just my siblings and I, but my sister had friends over, so there was no way I could.

I'm planning to end it next Saturday. I know how I will and I have easy access to what I'm going to use. The thought of dying still scares me, the thought of doing it myself more so, but it'll only be a few seconds of pain.

I'm not writing a note. I don't even want to. Who would actually care what I went through? Who would care to read it and actually take it to heart.

The only defense I have against it is, "people would be sad." but the only reason they would be sad is because they wouldn't know what to do after someone nearby died.

I don't know if I'll make another post. I've said everything I've had to. I wish you all the best in dealing with any depression issues you may be facing. Please, try to avoid a fate like mine. You don't deserve it.
