How do I feel better?The more I try to talk to people the more I realize how alone I am. I tried to do better these past months. But I came to the same realization a always come to. If I don't feel this loneliness, this sadness, I don't feel like me, and if I feel otherwise then I'm not me and I'm doing something wrong. Maybe I just need to talk to someone. I don't typically talk about how I really feel to people. Seeing words on a screen that tell me someone cares keeps me sane for while I guess.
