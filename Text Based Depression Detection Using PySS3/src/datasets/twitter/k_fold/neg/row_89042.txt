My father wants to gift me a gun for Christmas.To start this post, my father is conservative in his thoughts and beliefs. He has always instilled the idea that my life as a women must be getting married to a man and starting a family from there. He has never really wanted me to persue much else besides that, and gets upset as he thinks I am wasting my time. He called me the other day and we had our usual conversation of him being nosey, and he mentioned that he wants to give me a handgun. He thinks I need it for protection since I don't have a man to do that. I understand his concern but my problem is that I can't trust myself with one... I can't explain how I feel to him because he doesn't think mental health is to be taken serious, it's a joke to him. He doesn't understand what a trigger that could be. I can't say no to him regardless, so what should I do once I have it? I need advice.
