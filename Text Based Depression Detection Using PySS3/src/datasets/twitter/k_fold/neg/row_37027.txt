im so tiredim on mobile and don't know how reddit works too well so excuse any mistakes or if I do something wrong..Im just tired. I dont want to live anymorr Im trying to take into consideration that I've started new medications that can make me suicidal, but I feel like I always feel this way anyway. Im just tired of fake friends. Im tired of failing. School. Hurt. Abuse. Lots of abuse. Text that the world would be better without me

i want to cut. i want to purge.

I'm tired and truly convinced that my only purpose is to be abused and no one will ever care what happens

I've done what everyone has told me to do &amp; that's to go to therapy and report it etc etc but I get nothing

so what's the point of continuing when this is all im going to get
