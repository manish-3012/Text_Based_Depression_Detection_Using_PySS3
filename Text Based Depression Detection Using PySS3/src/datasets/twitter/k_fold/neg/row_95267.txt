Struggling this holiday seasonI've spent the whole day wondering why I even bother. I hate these thoughts. I've been sick for the past few months and when you've been sick this long (had an infection misdiagnosed and messed with my ears, throat, inner ear, and a lot of stuff until they caught it and it needs surgery), it really starts to wear you down. Waking up every day dizzy or in pain with blinding headaches or blurry vision, unable to think straight. Work hasn't been too happy or understanding about the recovery either. 

 Plus my family is far away and the girl decided the day before Thanksgiving to tell me she didn't want to date anymore because of me being sick (even though I was originally invited to Thanksgiving with her, that was rout of the question now). 

Throw is a couple of weeks back one of my best friends died and the death of my mom's passing is this week (to be fair, three of my immediate family died around Thanksgiving).

My closest friends are out of town and this just sucks. I usually struggle a bit with SAD, but it has been literally years since I've been this bad and keep having thoughts of suicide.

Sorry, I needed to vent.
