I donâ€™t really know if this the appropriate sub Reddit but itâ€™s the only one I can think ofIâ€™ve been having a hard time enjoying myself. A really really hard time. By this I mean I think people I hang around with trigger this weird anxiety that makes me believe they hate me. Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™ve been feeling like this but it sucks. It leaves me torn because I wanna hang with people but I know how Iâ€™ll end up feeling. The things that keep reminding in my head is when my exâ€™s mom said I wasnâ€™t a good person. Then my sister. Then my gf. Obviously something is up so I started my journey on trying to better myself and Iâ€™m still left with this lingering feeling that no one likes me. I love my gf so much sheâ€™s such a beautiful angel and I want the best for her. Just recently sheâ€™s said some really hurtful stuff to me and it just bums me out with how I already feel about people hating me. I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel so hopeless and disgusting. I really want to continue this life because it does have some really amazing moments but it just psychically hurts. Itâ€™s strange, nothing psychically hurts, but my soul hurts. Iâ€™m not the best looking either and recently Iâ€™ve become really insecure which is not in my nature as I never real cared what I looked like. Itâ€™s odd. I just feel alone.
