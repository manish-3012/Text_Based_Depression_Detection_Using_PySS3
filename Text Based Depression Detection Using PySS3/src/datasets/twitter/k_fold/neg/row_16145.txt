I Just Want To DieI have been constantly putting off suicide in hopes that things will get better but it just all seems so hopeless . My life is pain and it's all my fault. I can't find the motivation to do anything. My grades are slipping, my physique is a joke , and I'm just overall a horrible person. I've been useless in this world and I'm such a demotivated loser that I will be nothing in this world.
