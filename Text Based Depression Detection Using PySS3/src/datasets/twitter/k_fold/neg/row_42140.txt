At the end of my rope (literally)Okay so backstory Iâ€™ll try to shorten it:
I meet a guy (ftm trans) he has a lot of mental illnesses like me, suicidal. depressed, anorexic. We hit it off and we start speaking. He lives in Vegas me in England so itâ€™s difficult but we make it work. Then he gets raped by his friendâ€™s friend while his friend (call him J) is out getting food. I try my best to help but I do a lousy job of consoling him and then I get a text one morning saying he doesnâ€™t want to be with me anymore. Okay I freak a little and get mad, but I calm down and then he blocks me on everything.

So that was about a week ago, since then Iâ€™ve started cutting and smoking again, I keep going to hang myself but I pussy out because Iâ€™m too scared of my mum finding stuff on my computer (just like embarrassing shit like memes and old photos) and my sex toys and stuff under my bed. Pretty stupid reason I know but it keeps me alive I guess. Anyway, I talk to my ex (call him E) on Instagram on his old account he didnâ€™t block me on. Iâ€™ve been spamming his anonymous Tumblr ask me thing basically every day begging him to come back. We talk and itâ€™s clear he hates me and has started talking to J. I donâ€™t know what to do, I feel like the conversation is going okay but then out of no where he blocks me on that account. Now I have no way of speaking to him and this guy was the only person I loved. Iâ€™m bouncing around all these ideas in my head right now and my legs are cut to shit and Iâ€™m scared I donâ€™t know what to do.
