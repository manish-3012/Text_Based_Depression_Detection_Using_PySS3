One Big Lie. Life, in general, is all one big repulsive lie. It is constantly manipulated by powerful hierarchies, and other highly intellectual money grubbing people. Everything in this daily life is corrupted and taken advantage of for the worst. I'm tired of living in this cruel and corrupted world where the rich and intelligent prosper while the dimwitted and poor suffer (such as myself). Corruption is contagious throughout careers and jobs, educational institutions, businesses, governments, and the list goes on and on.

There is no control or balance of life when it comes to the common population. The people with the smarts and currency are the ones who decide what is balanced and acceptable. Charles Darwin was right with his theory of Natural Selection; the weak die while the strong prosper. Even parental figures are corrupted to the point where they make rational and irrational decisions for you because they want you to achieve what they want you to achieve.

Well, I for one am sick of everything. Behind all the subjective great things in life, lie the bigger evil things. Nothing is sane or right or anymore. I refuse to live in a world where my moronic, physically unattractive, non-athletic, low financial status self has to scrape by to live a supposedly "awesome" life while others can get what they desire in the blink of an eye. But then, there's also the scenario where you can attain everything you desire and still feel incompetent.

There's a math proof term for this, a Logical Contradiction. Everything in life is but a Logical Contradiction. Nothing is part of the concept of Tautology. To summarize, I'm walking out of my life earlier than most. I will be committing suicide at the age of 17 years old. And I want to do it this weekend. So, yeah.
