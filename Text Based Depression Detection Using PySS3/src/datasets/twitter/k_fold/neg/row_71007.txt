Current thoughts, am told to get this stuff out, I just don't know what to doI resent existence because existence is pain 
Parents actively chose to have me knowing the risks of their genetics and upbringings
I was young enough to not realise this and the fact that they did this to me
I never asked to exist I was unwillingly forced into it and now I have to deal with it because of societal constraints 
I have to take drugs to suppress What's real so I can fit in and live this stupid lie everyone tells themselves 
The only freedom is non existence, and I can only do that by dying 
Anything other than this minds tate is a chemically induced lie
I'm stuck between guilt for the potential to hurt loved ones and my hatred for myself and existence and am forced to try and conform to pretend that I believe it
I'm too much of a coward to overcome animalistic survival instincts
I'm too weak to take the step to end the pain because I've been suckered into the lie and I can't escape it because they've forced it into my head 
I feel like I can't do anything to change becaude I don't believe it will ever change 
Every time this goes away it's only temporary 
Nothing is permanent and nothing is under my control and the waves are too much for me to ride along in a measured way
I'm lost but no one wants to really listen because they don't believe that this is what I'm truly experiencing and it hurts because they say they want to help me but it never works and now I don't trust them because it feels superficial 
I hate this existence but it never changes and I just want it to stop 
All they tell me is to just deal with it until I die from something out of my control
Just because I grow old doesn't mean anything other than I'm still lying to myself about the pointlessness of existence 
Nothing I will ever do will mean anything enough to anyone 
I can't live for myself and I can't live for others
I'm just doing damage control and I'm stuck and there's no way out 
Nothing helps really but I'm too much of a coward to end it 
I'll probably send this to someone because that's what I'm 'supposed' to do but all it will do is make them upset and cause more pain which is my fault 
I can't do anything but cause pain or lie to people that there's will go away or that it's worth it
Nothing ever changes
All that will happen is this cycle will repeat until I die and I can't make my living worth this 
I am never going to bring others into this world and feel like I want to take others out of it at this point but I'm too much of a coward to do that to myself let alone others
