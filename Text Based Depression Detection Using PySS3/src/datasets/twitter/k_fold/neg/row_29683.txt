Can you get Baker Acted if you call the suicide hotline?Dumb question, I know, but I need to make sure you canâ€™t before I make the call and r/nostupidquestions doesnâ€™t allow suicide-related ones. Tried Google but it keeps redirecting me to feel-good articles and stuff. Iâ€™m too chickenshit to try anything and thereâ€™s nothing in my apartment that would make it quick and painless, but still, I need to talk to someone tonight or I might slip back into my old high school coping mechanisms which would just... not be good for me or anyone around me. So yeah. Can I get Baker Acted for calling the hotline?
