What else can I do? I've never been so worried.In the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, my brother (who turned 18 a week ago) was admitted to a "Behavioral Health" facility for attempting to commit suicide. I stayed at the hospital with him for about 5 hours until they transferred him from the ER we were in to the other facility. Since then, none of my family members or I have heard from him. The only reason I know that he is even there is a text I got from him as soon as he arrived. 

Also, my dad got a phone call from a physiatrist there, and when he answered all she said was that they were looking for a family member of my brother's. When he identified himself as my dad, the lady said "Oh, I was looking for his sister" and hung up on him. She called me and was asking lots of weird questions about how many pills he told me he took ect. The weirdest part was she asked "Well, how is he doing now?" I informed her that I hadn't talked to him. She immediately said "I'll call you back" and hung up. I never received a call back. 
My mom called the facility and they can't even confirm if he's a patient there or not. If I hadn't been in the hospital room with him at that exact moment they said the name of the place I would have no idea where he is.

I guess my questions are: Is it possible they aren't LETTING him call us? Or is this more likely his choice? Why would a doctor call me and my dad but not really explain anything to us? I know he's 18, but he's a senior in high school and still very dependent. Is there anything else I can do or anyone I can call to see if he's okay? I know 72 hours is customary, will they just kick him out the front door if they think he's ready to go home?
