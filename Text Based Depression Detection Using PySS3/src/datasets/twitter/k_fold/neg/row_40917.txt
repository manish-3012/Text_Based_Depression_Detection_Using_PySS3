When do things get better?Throughout high school I had a only 2-3 friends and was never really liked by anyone. I knew that people said bad things about me, I just blocked it out. I had a girlfriend my first year of high school that I told everything to and after we broke up she told people my deepest darkest secrets. I enlisted in the Army Reserves to try and maybe make my life better but Iâ€™ve been in for almost 5 years and it only makes me hate my life more. Iâ€™ve been out of high school for about 3 years and Iâ€™ve dropped out of college and had to move back home because I canâ€™t afford to live alone. I feel like a failure in the eyes of my family and friends. I stopped going to church lately and donâ€™t feel motivated to go again even though it feels like itâ€™ll make things better. Iâ€™ve been dating a girl for 2 years and Iâ€™ve loved it but in the past few months it feels like sheâ€™s just trying to get rid of me. Iâ€™ve applied for promotions at work that would finally let me move out and make things better but Iâ€™ve been turned down for all of them. It just feels like nothing good happens in life and I often think about ending my life just so I donâ€™t have to feel like a disappointment anymore. It feels like ever since middle school I havenâ€™t had any successes. I donâ€™t want to live a life full of rejection and disappointment. Iâ€™m afraid to kill myself because a small part of me thinks that if I do die I might make those around me upset by my death but a larger part of me thinks that it would be a relief. I feel like Iâ€™m on the downhill slope but I never peaked. I want to end things before I get to the bottom.
