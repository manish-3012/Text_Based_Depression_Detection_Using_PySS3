I tried, please listenThree nights ago, I had a panic attack and called myself  9-11. I was taken to Merryfield hospital and spoke with a social worker and promised to show up to an intake appointment the next day. I didn't, the next night, I tried again, but my boyfriend called 9-11 and I was taken by an ambulance that time. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, and I'm sure most of you have too. I can't tell you there is a light at the end of the tunnel or that you are going to be okay. But I can now be realistic and share some facts. If you hot that point and think you are going to end it here and now please call 9-11. They aren't going to book you or hold you, they aren't going to shoot you up with sedatives. They will take you to the nearest mentally facility, talk to you about what they can do to help and what they can offer, and they will listen for as long as needed, then they will pay for a taxi for you to go home. It's much better for the alternative, and it really helped to assure me I might be like this, but I don't need to be, especially without exhausting all other options first. Friday I'm going in for intake, and I'll be prescribed anti-depressants. I'll be shown support groups I can go to for free or low-income, and I'll be able to at least TRY and get better. I don't know if I will, but I want to try. Please, please call 9-11 if you reach that point. In a few days I'll scan in some paper work I got for supper and therapy so maybe some of you guys can utilize it too. I'm really begging you, please listen, call if you need help
