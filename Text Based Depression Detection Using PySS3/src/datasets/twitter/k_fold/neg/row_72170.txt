SuicideThere's not much I can say. I really wanted to just end it all last night and I chickened out, but that doesn't actually mean I don't want to die, because I do.

I'm just scared to do it at the same time of wanting it and there's nothing I get to look forward to in the future. I know someone will say so, say I have so much ahead of me but I don't. I know how it's gonna turn out and it's ugly and depressing to realize.
