Iâ€™m 18 and am looking for some encouragement to give this life another try despite all the guilt and mental illnessIâ€™ve wanted to kill myself since I was about 12 due to what I believe to be my mind just not working the way it should. Everything just feels bad and I donâ€™t know how to deal with it. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized before and itâ€™s only gotten worse since then. My main problem is guilt, my cousin killed herself years ago and I felt like I couldâ€™ve of prevented it, I still feel like I could have prevented it, then my basically best friend killed herself in 7th grade and itâ€™s all my fault. She told me on many occasions that she wanted to or was going to kill her self and I brushed it off and told her to just try to be happy. I was so stupid and I hate myself for it. A couple years ago my grandma killed himself after years of alcoholism and mistakes. I should have loved him more, I should have called him that night, he got in a big fight with the family and I got so mad but I didnâ€™t want this  Another thing is my great grandma lived by herself and basically only my grandma( her daughter) visited her sometimes. She always begged my to come visit and I never did and I mean she really did beg. She died a couple days ago and despite living 10 minutes from her I havenâ€™t seen her In maybe years and now sheâ€™s gone. I have always struggled with major depressive disorder and I think itâ€™s becoming too much. I want to give this life another try but I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m good enough too, despite being young I think I might have made too many mistakes. I donâ€™t know if I can be good. I love my family so much but this is too much.  The thought of leaving my younger siblings behind with no explanation breaks me but itâ€™s all so much. Iâ€™m sorry if this is unreadable I just donâ€™t know what to do
