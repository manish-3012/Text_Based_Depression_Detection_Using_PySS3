Trans and miserableI'm 30, trans, stuck in a dead end job, and I can't take the constant judgement from everyone around me.  People either see a tranny they wish would kill themselves. Or they see a trans person who's not doing enough to help other trans people.  I can't take it anymore.  Every day I log in and get constant reminders that so many people would be happy I died.  A tranny.  A white devil.  A penis.  Maybe I can finally make someone happy because I sure as shit can't make myself so.

A few years ago someone hanged themselves from the train trestle near my work.   I've been thinking about that a lot.  Theres a hardware store nearby, it'd be easy to buy some rope and finish the job.  At least I'd have a nice view.
