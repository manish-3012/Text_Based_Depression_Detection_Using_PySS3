the only thing i can control is if i am alive or deadiâ€™m 18 and i donâ€™t have control over anything substantial. my parents are forcing me to go to a boarding school that:
-doesnâ€™t let you have your phone
-doesnâ€™t let you have any internet access asie from youtube and schoolwork (and you have to be there for at least 6 months on your best behavior to have access to youtube) 
-doesnâ€™t let me talk to anyone on the outside except for emailing my parents (and the emails are read by the staff at the school)
-has staff watch over everyone every second of the day and night (even when youâ€™re sleeping), you have to be there for at least two months theee weeks to be allowed out of staffs sight for 15 minute increments
-donsent allow you to leave except on school breaks, even then sometimes you canâ€™t leave
-doesnâ€™t let you swear at all, even if youâ€™re not in school
-has staff that make up rules and abuse their power
-favors the staff over the student 
-treats staff like impenetrable authority figures and whatever they say is be all end all
-you get your internet access taken away if you try to go on social media or do anything not related to schoolwork/youtube
iâ€™ve tried not eating iâ€™ve tried cutting iâ€™ve tried everything and i canâ€™t control shit. after telling my parents iâ€™d rather killl myself than go back to school, my mother replied something along the lines of â€œwell if you try to kill yourself youâ€™ll be out somewhere where youâ€™re even more miserableâ€
my parents donâ€™t give a fuck about how i feel because â€œiâ€™m a senior and i shouldnâ€™t move schools in the middle of senior yearâ€
i canâ€™t drive because i was at that school for the past year and a half, i have exactly $151.34 to my name so i canâ€™t afford to move out
i canâ€™t drop out because my parents wonâ€™t let me stay at home if i do 

on top of the whole school thing, my boyfriend is â€œtired of my shitâ€ â€œall he did was say one thing and i have to be a little fucking babyâ€ 
iâ€™m in love with him but heâ€™s so mean to me. i canâ€™t break up with him because he goes to my school and i donâ€™t want to deal with having to see him all the time if weâ€™re broken up.

i cant go to the hospital i canâ€™t do shit because if i go to the hospital i canâ€™t go to college next year and thatâ€™s my only chance to escape but i donâ€™t think i can fucking make it to next year

i have no reason to be alive and i canâ€™t control shit in my own life
