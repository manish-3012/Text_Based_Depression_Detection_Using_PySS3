Is there anyone out thereI'm sitting on the bathroom floor crying and I'm sure someone will hear me but I don't want them to.
I just want to scream.
Everyone keeps saying I'm so brave and all this bullshit for running away from my abusive home but everything is somehow worse now.
I have no job, I have no skills, this isn't even my house. I'm so tired. So tired of trying to do the right things that everyone says to do and getting nothing and going nowhere. 
I want it all to end. I'm tired of hearing how things get better because they don't get better for me.
