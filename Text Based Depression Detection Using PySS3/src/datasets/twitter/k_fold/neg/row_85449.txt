Extending my life for a few years then...Ever since the quarantine started, I haven't had a good night sleep. I can't cope well during this lockdown and my thoughts have been too overwhelming and because of that I can't focus on my online classes anymore. Failing one of my subjects greatly affected me. I have been suicidal everyday. Few weeks ago, I tried hanging myself once but the pain hurts too much that I couldn't continue. I really want to go somewhere far and end myself. But lately, I've been seeing images of my siblings grieving... I love them and I don't want to cause trauma to them since they're still young. I also feel bad for my parents who've been always great yet here I am being an utter shit worthless. I've been extending my life until both of siblings finish college and then maybe I'll take my own life again.
