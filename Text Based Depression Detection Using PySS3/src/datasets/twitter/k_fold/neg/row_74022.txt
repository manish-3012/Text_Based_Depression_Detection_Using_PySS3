Mom has come to terms with her illness and death... she's only 50This is going to sound like something straight out of a soap opera, and for that, I apologize.        
My mom has been suffering from a mysterious illness for a couple of years now. Sometimes her stomach causes her so much pain that she's completely bedridden and unable to eat. We've gone from doctor to doctor to doctor, but to no avail. The more time goes on, the more she ponders (out loud) the idea of suicide.        
It was the most intense a couple of days ago on vacation. She and I were chatting late at night while we futzed around on a puzzle. She began reminiscing about her childhood and parents, which always manages to strike a serious chord with me. Her parents were often incredibly abusive towards her and her sister growing up. She was in so much pain that night, and I felt my heart breaking for her like never before. I was silently crying (she didn't realize) as I asked her if she felt incredibly lonely or depressed (both to which she responded yes).        
She went back to talking about not wanting to live anymore, when I asked about what my six year-old brother in particular would do without her. She explained that I was already mothering him so well, and that she was not worried for him at all. It was a compliment, but I felt so crushed by it. I'm only sixteen, and I've finally learned to manage what used to be unbearable mental illness. My parents used to have to act as anchors in the family, but as my mother gets sicker, that responsibility has fallen on me. My mom used to be so happy and loving, but now I find myself having to reach out to her and mediate between her and everyone else.        
I never was the best daughter, but I can't live without my mom, and I can't live seeing her suffer her whole life. I don't know what to do anymore.
