I donâ€™t think my parents would care if I diedIâ€™m 16 and I just got my SAT back. 1410. My parents said theyâ€™re disappointed but my sister scored the same. They told me that I should be happy theyâ€™re disappointed because it means they think Iâ€™m smart. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve struggled with them before but they donâ€™t know Iâ€™m suicidal and even if I did, they donâ€™t think depression exists. I canâ€™t run away and I canâ€™t be self sufficient.

Why shouldnâ€™t I just end it?
