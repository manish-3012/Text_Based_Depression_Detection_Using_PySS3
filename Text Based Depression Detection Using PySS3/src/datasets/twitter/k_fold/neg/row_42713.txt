I don't wanna dieBut I don't want to live either. I've been trying to hang out with other people but they either always say their busy and I see them out with my other 'friends' the next minute, or they are actually busy. And none of them try or make an attempt to see me or even talk to me, I always have to contact first and half the time they don't even bother to respond. And the few that do it's usually on Snapchat saying "streaks". Nothing makes me feel wanted on this Earth anymore, and especially this summer.

I Don't feel like I'm really anything anymore. I feel worthless. Maybe it's temporary though, even though I have felt suicidal in the past for more serious reasons. These were people I hung out constantly in highschool and I thought we were good. I thought they liked me for who I actually am, a weirdo, but maybe this is also just a chance for them to avoid me. I've told someone that I thought I was close to want to kill myself and that I feel worthless because nobody wants me to see me in real life once more, but they don't respond.

I guess that's what it was that I'd want to get off my chest, not really well written or serious yet I'm crying constantly because of this. Oh well.
