Thinking about killing myself tonight.I'm a 26 year old male. I have severe epilepsy, as well as bipolar disorder. Genetically, I'm at a high risk for schizophrenia developing within the next few years. I have no social life, and no real interest in developing one for the most part. I'm not in contact with my family. I just can't see any reason for me to carry on.
