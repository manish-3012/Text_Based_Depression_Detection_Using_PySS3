If I had a gun, I would have done it tonightI've been struggling with depression for a while. A recent breakup kind of triggered it. Last year, I had a massive breakup, after a decade-long relationship, from which I probably never really recovered, before jumping on this new relationship.

This is not even the worst I've felt recently. There's almost a calmness about it now. I just can't see a way out. All things that I haven't done over this depression period have piled up and now the pile is about to come down. I can't burden my friends and family with my horrible mood and constant whining self. I tried my best, but I don't know what to do anymore.

I kind of need a miracle, I guess. Something that would make things be different when I wake up. But I don't even believe in miracles. I don't take these words or this post lightly. I didn't want to bother anyone over here. But I need to tell someone that I really would have done it tonight if I had a gun. I really would. And this is horribly scary.
