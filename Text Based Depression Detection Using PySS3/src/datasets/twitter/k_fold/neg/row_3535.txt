Every day is unbearable.I made a post very similar to this a year ago and sadly I was in a much better place back then.

Diagnosed with arthritis at 13/14, spent a year self-harming before I plucked up the courage to ask for help. The day after my first psych appointment I took an overdose. My entire teenage life was spent watching my "friends" have a normal life whilst I watched out of the hospital windows. I've had to deal with a bunch of useless pricks in my medical team and it's been a constant battle to get any kind of help. It has drained me completely over the years.

After a really bad turn of health last November I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, which really helped my mental state. 

Then thanks to a bunch of highly incompetent doctors I've spent the past 3-4 weeks in bed in excruciating pain, I'm on the strongest painkillers they can give me that isn't morphine. 

My grandfather, the only person I'm close to in my family just got admitted to the Intensive Care Unit this evening and I'm so scared of losing him. All along he's been the single reason I haven't attempted anything seriously. I can't disappoint him. I don't know what will happen if I lose him. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this.
