i feel like life is pointlessi have always had issues with suicidal ideation. the last time i went to the hospital was because i almost swallowed a handful of klonopin but got scared and didnâ€™t. and turns out you canâ€™t even overdose on klonopin so it wouldnâ€™t have worked regardless. anyways, i have bipolar disorder so my mood goes up and down quite often. however, i have been on zoloft and that has helped me stay neutral for a while (2 weeks) but iâ€™ve dropped back down again and iâ€™ve had huge urges to cut and really bad suicidal thoughts. i donâ€™t want to die but i also donâ€™t want to live. if that makes sense. i donâ€™t have an interest in doing much. not even fun things. much less work and try to build a career. all i want to do is lay in bed and try to forget that life is real. i am 23 years old so i need to get my shit together. but i donâ€™t have the drive because i donâ€™t have the interest. life doesnâ€™t appeal to me.
