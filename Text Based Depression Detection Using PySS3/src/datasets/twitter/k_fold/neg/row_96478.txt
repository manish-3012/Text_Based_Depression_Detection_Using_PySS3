Im running out of ways to convince myself life is worth fighting for.I don't know what to say anymore. To anyone. I can only come to the conclusion that I can't fix my mind or my life and that the only clear option is to go on my terms. I had to watch one of the closest people to me die very painfully from cancer two years ago and now I have been diagnosed with early stages. I am 'young', but I can't seem to get insurance no matter how hard I try for the last year. All of this not including the fact I was diagnosed with as bipolar last year after a stay in a psych ward. And I can no longer afford the medication that was finally helping because I no longer have insurance. I haven't been able to hold down a job for more then 6 months at a time because eventually I lose my mind and and start having panic attacks before work and even if I can manage to drag myself in, it's very noticeable and I usually get reprimanded at some point for being to emotional or sad and am threatened with losing hours, causing me to hate myself even more and very quickly I get much worse to the point I stop showing up thinking them to be better off without me. I am currently on my second month of staying with my mother because I found cameras set up in my house recording me (my roommate apparently thought we were more and decided to make sure I didn't cheat) and I had no where else to go, hoping it would be a short stay but knowing because of my abysmal credit I was going to need to substantially increase my savings to cover all these moves plus things left behind. I was forced out of my most recent job because I tried to be proactive and talk to my manager about things i was having trouble with (tension between staff not involving me) and how it was starting to make me not able to preform my job, his solution of a public discussion of course bringing me into the situation. Then I found a new shit job but fuck I got to get a place to live right? And the day I start work I get a text saying my grandfather has died. So needless to say I fucked that job up. Now my mom. I want so badly to have this relationship that is in my head. And I thought we made so much progress. And believe me I hate myself for needing to ask for help. (I mean I hate myself for a lot more but...) But she's pretty disgusted with me. I mean I am disgusted with myself. I don't think I can fix it. When you get in a car accident your insurance company will total your car when they decide the damages are greater then the car is worth. So isn't this the same?
