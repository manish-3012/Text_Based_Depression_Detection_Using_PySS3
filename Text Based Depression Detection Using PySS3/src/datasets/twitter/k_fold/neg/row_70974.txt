Feeling horrible after a breakupMy boyfriend broke up with me 2 weeks ago. I went to Prague after that and when I got back we met and everything seemed to be going good, but he snapped again and yesterday told me he's going to find me a replacement and then he blocked me everywhere. He's been emotionally abusive for a while now, so it's not a typical breakup. I kept going back and forth for a while. Since yesterday I'm crying and shaking, every part of my body hurts like it never did before. I've never, ever experienced such emotional pain like now. I'm vomiting but not eating. My head hurts, my ears hurt, just everything. I had very strong suicidal thought yesterday. They went away but now I'm again feeling like there's no way I'll get through this. I just don't know what to do. I'm all alone, I don't have any friends. He's the only person I had for 2 years now - that's also part of why it was impossible for me to walk away. I'm so isolated and I just feel like I won't get through this. I don't know what to do. I keep trying to connect to him, but as I said everything is blocked. I've never felt so helpless in my life.
I just don't know what to do now. I can't stop shaking and crying.

It's very hard to breathe right now. I just want this pain to end. I don't know what to do.
