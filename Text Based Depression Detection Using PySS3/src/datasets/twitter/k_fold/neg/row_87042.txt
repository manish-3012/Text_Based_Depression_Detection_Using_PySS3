Genuine concern for a friend, what should I do??I'll try to make this as short as possible but with the most information.....
A close friend of mine (26/f) sent another friend a text warning of suicide.
She recently quit her highly stressful, and time consuming job and went abroad for 2 weeks, evidently in search of some solace.  She's still there, but moved her departure date up a few days because she's unhappy.  Turns out that she was looking for something in taking this trip, but it only strengthened these thoughts she's been having.  In the text message to our friend, she mentioned that she's going to break up with her boyfriend (who she loves dearly), so he's not the one to find her. She has a history of depression, and her mother has attempted suicide in the past. 

If someone could lay out an appropriate course of action I would really appreciate it. I read some of the resources, but like anything all scenarios are different and I wanted to detail this so I could be sure I take the necessary precautions/actions.
