I'm sorry.The more I'm on this planet, the more I want to end my life. I don't have a purpose to live anymore. Everyday is just suffering for me, the only relief I get is just fantasizing about me dying and my mom realizing what the fuck she did. She picks and makes fun of my mental health constantly. My dad is dead, my mom was cheating on him two years before he passed away and she's already been asking about marriage two weeks after his passing. 

I have severe body dystopia, my mom also pretends to support me being transgender but she turns around and starts picking on me for it. She picks on me because of my mental health, making fun of my sleeping patterns because of it then screaming at me about the fact I can't sleep. 

I don't have a lot of true friends that actually give a crap about my mental health, I'm teased a lot at school and my band program because I'm mental unwell. The friends I hang out with accept my personality, but they never want to hear about my poor ass mental health. I tried killing myself over he summer, but no one seemed to listen nor care.

The only person I care about in this world is gone, which my mom picks on my father also. I've been molested by my old step father (technically my bio father, but he's SUCH a piece of shit that he doesn't deserve the title of a father.) my mom never made a police report until 8 months after coming home with bruises on my body from a beating that my old stepfather gave me. 

I want to end my life on the spot, nothing in life is enjoyable. I've stopped most of my hobbies thanks to my poor mental health. My hobbies and escapes from the position I'm in amount nothing to my past. I'm a worthless piece to society, I've been wanting to end my life for the last 4 years.
