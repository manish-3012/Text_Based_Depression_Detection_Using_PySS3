I'm finally at peaceI realized, truly, without a doubt, all the people I hurt in my life, are happier when I'm not around, I slowly quit talking to everyone these past 2 years, and no one noticed/cared. the few I did talk again, hated me so much, I feel so happy, almost giddy, that they will never have to deal with me again. their lives will truly be better.

no family, no friends, no lovers, no coworkers, no mentorees, no one looking up to me. I'm living in isolation, and no one will care if I'm gone. i'ts fucking pathetic, I kinda wonder if I'm a sociopath or born without a soul, not that I believe in god anymore anyways, as I'm just a horrible person, who doesnt know how to help others, nor take care of himself. at least this decision is finally the right one.
