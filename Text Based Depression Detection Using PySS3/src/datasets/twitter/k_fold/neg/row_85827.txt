I am a social failure and am close to killing my self because of it.I don't talk to that much to people very often. I tend to keep to myself. I am a 19 year old male virgin and I feel like I haven't done anything with my life. I came from a wealthy family, I get good grades, and I have an internship this summer at a very good company in California. I got bullied throughout high school multiple times, most of the time the insults were directed at my race. Senior year alone I was probably made fun of at least 100 times...
 I am very insecure at this point and even though I am able to hold a conversation I just believe that no one would want to talk to me or associate with me. I only have two people in my university that I consider friends and even then I don't interact with them much. With girls I am a failure as well, I haven't called or texted a girl in months and I believe that I will just die alone and it will never happen. I haven't even hugged or kissed a girl ever in my life. I also believe that I am doing something wrong and that I am not worth anything at all. I am starting to hate everything about me, and cannot find one thing that I like about myself. Sometimes I just look in the mirror and just start thinking that I will never get friends or a girlfriend or get married or anything and I end up crying for a couple of hours. I am literally crying as I am writing this since this is very hard for me to write. I've told this problem of just being a social failure to other people and they basically didn't care that much and thought it wasn't that big of a problem. But the pain is real and it hurts so much.
