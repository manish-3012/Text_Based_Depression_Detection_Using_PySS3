Will they remember me if I go?I have two little brothers, a four-year-old and a two-year-old, and I love them more than anything in this world. Frequently, when I think about ending it all (whether it be serious or in passing) I think about them and how it would hurt them. But then I wonder that if I happened to off myself now, would they even remember me? I just don't know if it's enough to hold onto. It sounds terrible, but they aren't *my* children after all. And the truth is, I'm just not happy with my life. I don't want to do this anymore. I feel tired, sad, worthless, and like living just isn't worth it. I feel alone and unloved. I just don't know what to think or do.
