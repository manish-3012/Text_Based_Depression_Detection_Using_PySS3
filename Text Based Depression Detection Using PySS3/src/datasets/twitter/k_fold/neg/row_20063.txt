No HopeIn the grand scheme of things, I dont want to live anymore. One semester of college and I'm already done with it. Sure, why not take a break? But after one semester? My family would think im a loser and this will only affirm it, plus what would I do? Work the minimum wage job I already have? If I try to go for an associate's in something, would that even work?  I want to fucking kill myself. I'm not cut out for life and that's the truth. I'm sick and tired of having hope then losing is, it's an endless cycle. I'm done. Sure family and friends would be upset but they'll get over it, I mean why is death a hard concept to conceive? I'm dead, and that's it. And I cant really talk about this with anyone because it's just, what will the other person do? I appreciate and support and love but it's just, what can you really say to a person who's suicidal? Plus, I dont want to bring them down with me. I dont see any reason to live, I already see my future as absolute shit. I'm just a hopeless screw up who shouldn't have been born.
