Been shittier than usual lately.My week typically involves a number of times where I feel like absolute shit. Ever since, I wanna say Sunday, it's been constant. I've not only relapsed into self harm after several months of on-again-off-again (maybe once a week, once every week and a half, really inconsistant), but I've become obsessed with this idea of going out and trying heroin. Fucking stupid idea, but I can't help it. I mean, I've already decided that one day I'm going to end it (whether from depression or just because I want to go out on my own terms, euthanasia or something), why not try something that could kill me? Hell the only thing stopping me from doing it is funds because I'm a broke college student who won't even be a college student much longer. Well, that and I don't think I could find anyone to tripsit me, make sure I don't OD on accident (although I'm not sure I care about that), since all my friends are pretty straight laced. The idea of no pain at all sounds so attractive.

As for the self harm, honestly the last time I stayed clean for more than 2 weeks was last summer for about 2 months, ever since then it's been sorta on-again-off-again, but I did it Monday night, Tuesday morning, and I'm about to do it again now. It's been a while since I've done it so often, I'm looking forward to it, as morbid as that is.

Fuck it, I'm gonna shut up. You people don't wanna hear me whine. I'm not ending it all just yet, but lately it seems to be a thought more often than not.
