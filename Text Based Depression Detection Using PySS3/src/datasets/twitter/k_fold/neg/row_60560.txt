I'm not sure what to do. I just want to vent.I'm sorry... I really need to tell my story to someone.. the real story and proof is provided throughout if need be. I just... I need to vent. 

about a year and a half ago or so I was shot in the spine with a 12 gauge shotgun firing .00 buck at point blank range.

Despite the news [reporting it was an accident](http://www.wmcactionnews5.com/story/31888695/accidental-shotgun-blast-injures-picayune-man) it was very much not an accident. I lied to everyone including police about the intent of the shooter to protect my family. I was afraid my brother who suffers from mental issues would murder my killer after I died. I had a 6x5 hole over my spine. I wasn't expecting to fight off the shooter, nor walk a quarter mile to safety, nor live after that. So. I lied expecting I'd be dead. 

I've got pellets all over my body. On my spine, in my spine, on my kidneys, blah blah blah. I came out the coma to the voice of someone I loved. I had so much before he took it all from me.... I had a life. I had a home. I had friends. I had a girlfriend. I could walk without a huge ugly fuckin' cane. I had a PlayStation that I had to sell to pay bills! My other PlayStation was stolen while I was in a coma by a different "friend" who knew I was down and out and my house would be empty. I used to be able to game on my PC but now I'm stuck in a bed! I can't have wired peripherals and you can't game on subpar wireless shit and the wireless ones suitable for gaming are out of my **zero dollars per month** budget.  I have nothing I enjoy. No hobbies. I have a bed and four walls. 

I used to be the [life of the party](https://i.imgur.com/CKLG3mc.jpg) I carried 260lbs of beautiful woman around on my shoulders for fun. I stood tall at 6'8 and 350lbs. My footsteps boomed across the room as I entered it, and people called me "Big B" I was the massive friendly giant, fearsome and regular party bouncer, but incredibly teddy bear like. 

I never drank alcohol, I never smoked any drugs. I did everything right. I was a good kid. Fuck me, I can barely walk and they have to stand over me just to get me to take narcotics to this day. That guy that shot me... I was giving him shelter. I didn't even know him. I just knew he was a drunk/high kid on something called **Spice** which turned out to be a fatal error. He was homeless and had no where to go. I let him stay on my couch. 

I remember it so clearly. Every time I close my eyes. Every time I try to sleep. Every time I hear a loud noise. Every time someone walks behind me. constantly. It haunts me. **BANG** and then I hit the ground. My ears ringing, I stumble to my feet. I can't hear what he's saying. I kick him in the chest. **CRAAAACK** Right hook. What do I do?^"Grab the gun, grab the fucking gun."  

I press the slide release, pulling the pump backwards to me. Smoke is rolling off the barrel of the shotgun. A single fat shell ejects onto the ground. *plink, plink, plink* it sounds as it bounces off the floor as it falls.  I push the pump forward with what feels like all my strength, like I mustered everything to do that. Then as soon as it comes forward... it's like... i don't know a drug or something. It's like the world was in 1080p and now it's in 4k. It's like everything got saturated, every sound and smell became 1000x more present. I had the strength of like, at least 1.5x what I normally had. I mean I felt like I could fight a bear with my own hands and nothing more. I pull the barrel to the right and immediately pull the trigger in an attempt to take his life. 

**click** empty. I turn it around to bludgeon him with the butt. At this point I'm certain he's going to take the gun and finish me off. But he doesn't as I'm looking down at him I hesitate and he starts wheeping, sobbing, crying on my legs like a baby. You know how like... when you were a kid and your brother hits you too hard and starts sort of beating them self up or trying to cry with you to make it appear as if they too are hurt so you don't call mom? that's sort of what he did. He was totally fucking wrecked on this drug and was trying to apologize. I could hear him clearly now. I couldn't really understand but I... I knew he was sorry. So I snatched him up by his shirt collor and said "Get a fucking lawyer retard, you just fucking killed me. I'm calling my mom. I have to get out this house or I'll die." and I carried him to the front porch, and threw him forward off the raised porch deck into the yard. I walked a quarter mile up the road and found help, instructed them how to treat the wound while I waited for my mom and the ambulance. They flew me via helicopter somewhere safe and I at some point went into a coma and came out a week later and walked out the hospital shortly after that. 


I can still walk and shit. But my life sucks. Sometimes I lose all feeling at the wound and below, and lose motor control in my legs. But for the most part I just walk around all crippled and shit with a cane. I see a therapist and physical therapist and three surgical teams, and a bunch more medical experts. I have the best of the best healthcare. But none of it matters. They are doing a myelogram or something like that on my spine in a few days... anyways, the doctor doesn't seem to think optimistically and every other doctor sort of agrees, I'll always be like this and surgery is pushing my luck and I should be greatful for where I am and that I'm alived and not currently paralyzed all the time and shit. But man. My life sucks fucking hard and I just needed to get this off my chest. I just needed someone to hear my story even if they don't believe me. My mom and dad think I talk about it to much because I always try to bring it up to them, and my mom and dad also don't seem to believe it's AS bad as it is, but man, this shit hurts. BAD. all the time. I can't even describe it. It's the worst pain imaginable and only my doctors seem to comprehend it. I felt like if I didn't talk to someone I was going to implode. I was going to do something drastic. But typing all this has made me feel a little better. It's so hard. I hate my life.
