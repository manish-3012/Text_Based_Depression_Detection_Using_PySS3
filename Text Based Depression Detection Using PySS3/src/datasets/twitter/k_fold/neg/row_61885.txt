Why is killing yourself so hard?Why is trying to kill yourself so hard and scary? Iâ€™ve tried killing myself so many times that I lost count and all of those attempts failed cuzâ€™ I was too much of a coward to kill myself. Why is it so scary when you are actively trying to kill yourself and why is it not scary when you are just thinking about it? If only I had the fucking courage to actually take my own life but I guess I suck so badly and Iâ€™m so incompetent that I cant even properly kill myself.
