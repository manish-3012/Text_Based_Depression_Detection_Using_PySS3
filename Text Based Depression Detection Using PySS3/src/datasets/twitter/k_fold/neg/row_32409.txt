why is it so hard to dieok heres my life story (sometimes i can be sarcastic)

I got born (sadly) to an abusive mom that always talks down to me (and also is a moron,) and a nice dad who cares about me boom bam my parents got divorced because my mom is a child of satan! Anyways she got custody of me and my brother, oh no! At least I have a brother to talk to right? Then he killed himself :( So now I'm alone; and even though my mom gets to save food whenever I get sent to my room the rest of the day \*pretty often cuz even when i dont screw something up then shell start a meaningless arguement\* anyways because of quarantine me and my 1 friend don't get to talk much so in other words my dads the only guy who actually cares about me.

The best metaphor I can make of this is:

Life's like a medicine, but it doesnt work, is incredibly boring for TONS of time, and has only bad side effects.

The only good quality I have is cool I'm kinda smart for my age which means practically nothing considering I learned it all in 2 hours of khan academy, so not even impresive.

basically a crappy abusive childhood goes into a crappy college and a crappy job and finally you die I already knew that when I was 10 but scared of the afterlife being worse so I didnt do a 100% lethal method of suicide (which I now regret) I guess I am just a loser so thats cool!

Anyways I'm turning 12 in 6 days so screw life 

I know I probably should seek help and this isn't normal but thanks Einstein for pointing that out anyways I'm not telling anyone I know about this or they'll just freak out/ not care \*cough cough my mom\* 

If you read this all for some reason then tell me one reason why I should kill myself tomorrow

besides "keep trying because sometimes you will have a good day!!!1!11!!!1" 

yeah the moral of this story is you know your life is crap when you're 11 and looking up ways to commit suicide painlessly

Oh I almost forgot why I made this

so basically people were saying hanging works well so I googled thick ropes and its 50 DOLLARS like omg also my mom doesn't own a gun and I can't get any pills besides tylenol which it takes lots of time to die with a tylenol overdose and doesn't always work so help how do I?
