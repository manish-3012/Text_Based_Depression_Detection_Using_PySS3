I honestly donâ€™t feel like livingI feel so down, like everyone knows me as strong, but Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m tired. I feel like nothing ever goes right for me. 
I feel alone, everyone around me has a significant other, and Iâ€™m the last one left. I donâ€™t understand, everyone around me tells me Iâ€™m so pretty and they are proud of me. But how come no one wants me? Why am I never good enough for anyone? I lost many friends this year, because apparently Iâ€™m too much. 
I just donâ€™t get it. I never mean any harm, why do people not like me. I donâ€™t want to be fake, but if no one likes me for me then whatâ€™s the point.

I also have started drinking a lot, to ease the pain, but it doesnâ€™t help. I donâ€™t know what to do. A part of me says â€œeff it, youâ€™ve been through worse sh**â€, but a part of me also says â€œgive upâ€ whatâ€™s the point?

Iâ€™m never good enough, Iâ€™m never the one, who would miss me? 

I hate feeling this way, but itâ€™s becoming stronger now. 
Iâ€™m not doing well financially, I try to do the best I can, but itâ€™s never enough. Iâ€™m so alone, even though I have a huge family. No one knows I am dying inside.

Help!
