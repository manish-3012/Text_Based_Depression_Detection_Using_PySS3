If this isolation stuff lasts beyond June, Iâ€™m going to kill myself.I have no friends, and my entire family is already dead. Iâ€™ve been depressed for a while (in fact, Iâ€™ve been known to go two or three days without eating much beyond coffee and alcohol) and for a while I could hold myself over with small stuff like spending the weekends in the desert or mountains or going to the beach. Or just sitting at Starbucks reading while listening to music.

But thatâ€™s all over now. I live alone and aside from work (because as a mechanic Iâ€™m â€œessentialâ€) I literally have no human contact with anyone. Iâ€™m just stuck at home watching TV and masturbating. Even if I walk outside, Iâ€™m just surrounded by goddamn concrete and Iâ€™ll get yelled at for not â€œstaying safe at home.â€

And thatâ€™s another thing, I literally do not understand why I cannot just drive down the fucking interstate for a few dozen miles. If no oneâ€™s in my car with me, and I donâ€™t leave my car, how the fuck am I going to infect someone or get infected? Does the pavement of the interstate have coronavirus too? Does my car?

And Iâ€™m sure someoneâ€™s going to respond with â€œblah blah blah thatâ€™s not a good enough reason to kill yourself.â€ even though I donâ€™t need a â€œgood reasonâ€.
