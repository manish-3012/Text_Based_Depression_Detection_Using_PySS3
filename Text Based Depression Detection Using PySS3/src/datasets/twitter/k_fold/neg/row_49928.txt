I'vw got no fucking lifeI have no social life outside of school and in school I've only got like 6 friends who only two I could say trust and one of the ones i trust im not sure even likes me very much. Im also jealous of my older sister her grades are perfect, my parents care about her more, she has a boyfriend, friends in and outside of school and is invited to social gathering outside of school \(like parties\). Even with all of that she is depressed, for not having friend when she has a larger amount and more trustworthy and close friends than me. She has always been better than me in everything we've ever done.

 For the last three years my grades have been going to hell and I'm unmotivated about school. My dad doesn't care about anything that I say. My friend one of the trustworthy doesn't accually care about me, we rarely hang out after school and we don't have much in common.

I've got no future, I chose a shit program for school which doesn't have any job possibilities and I've got shit grades wich just continues on dropping.

Sorry if this is incomprehensible but I was just writing everything I could think of.
