scared to live but terrified to die.ive struggled with suicidal impulses and general anxiety for as long as I can remember. Ive never had an actual attempt to kill myself because im scared of pain and even more scared of failing. i guess that makes me a coward. im now 21 and my only support system i have is my boyfriend. i only have one other close friend and were not even that close, a family that doesnt care about me, and no direction in life. i love my boyfriend to bits but im terrified of losing him which may or may not be imminent depending on how the next day or so goes. i dont know what i will do if he leaves me, i literally feel like if that would happen id break in a way that cant heal. killing yourself over a breakup is so fucking cliche but i almost done care anymore.  guess im getting a little less cowardly. 

i dont feel like i can talk to anyone in my family about this &amp; ive started therapy with my campus therapist without their knowledge. I haven't been since the semester ended in December and if my boyfriend would leave me i dont think id have the motivation to go to class and succeed. which means no more therapy. my family cant afford a therapist and most definitely cant afford a trip to the looney bin. 

i feel so trapped. ive started thinking about a plan, who i am going to write letters to, and details regarding my funeral and what is to be done with my possessions once im gone. im so scared.
