Reddit (especially commenting) seems to be on the fritz tonight.If your comments aren't showing up (or if you can't see replies to your post), this seems to be a reddit issue, affecting all of us. It is not a sign that you're being ignored or anything. So stick with us, and hopefully reddit will get fixed up so we can converse properly.
