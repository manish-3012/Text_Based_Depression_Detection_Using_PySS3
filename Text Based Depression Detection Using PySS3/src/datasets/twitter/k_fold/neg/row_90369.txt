Is this it? Is this my life? It seems like Iâ€™m just a waste. I wasnâ€™t made for this worldHello everyone, Iâ€™ve realized the severity of my life right now. They say loneliness is as lethal as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. I think theyâ€™re absolutely right, nobody I know knows how much Iâ€™m suffering right now.

Iâ€™m 18 but I feel like the rest of my life is already set in stone for me. I donâ€™t know if I want to live the next 40 years of my life (even if it is 40, maybe less) alone. I think that there is nothing left to live for anymore. Whatâ€™s the point of going to college and getting a job if Iâ€™m missing relationships? 

Iâ€™ve tried meetup for friends, tinder for girlfriends, nothing has happened. Iâ€™ve tried clubs and activities. Iâ€™m just so unrelatable, no one approaches me, Iâ€™m shy and Iâ€™m scared to talk to new people. 

I think two people are born in this world, winners and losers. Iâ€™m in the second category. This place wasnâ€™t made for me and I think I should leave.
