Just need to get this off my chestI've never had a friend, none. Not even in kindergarden and I'm on the autism spectrum so who would want to be friends with a fuck like me. I'm in my last year of highschool and never had a friend or talked to anybody because I'm mute and have had severe anxiety all my life. I've been molested as a kid by both my father and various strangers. I've been hit and suffocated as a child by my father because he thought it was fucking hilarious. I am a piece of shit. My father no longer hits me or dares to touch me because I'm bigger than him now but he still emotionally abuses me and tells me I'm a waste of space and to hang myself everyday. The only person who ever showed me love is my mom and she would fucking hate me if she knew I was gay. 

Sorry for the unorganized sentences I'm just over with my life, therapy hasn't worked nor medication or the tiny bit of love I've gotten from my mother. I've been prepping myself to be tolerant to blood and have chosen to go the absolute most painful way out because that is what I deserve even in my last breaths. My birthday is coming up at the end of March and I'll being doing it then. Happy fucking birthday to nobody. I know nobody bothered reading this garbage so I'll add that I may end up making a real account and just hanging out here on my bday. Later.

Hope things get better for other people, I'll donate whatever cash I have saved (300$) and leave my clothes to a shelter that might need them. The only birthday I'll ever have and it will be my last too.
