Somehow I always mess it upIâ€™m so sick of everything. Somehow I manage to screw it up every time, Iâ€™m stuck in this dumb cycle and I hate it. I donâ€™t want to live anymore, I honestly donâ€™t have a single thing to live for. Iâ€™ve sat and thought about it for hours on end. Not one thing comes to mind.
