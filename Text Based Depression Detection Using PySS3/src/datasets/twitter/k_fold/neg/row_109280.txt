Three years ago, this subreddit supported me when no one else would. Thank you.Three years ago, I was in the worst place of my life. I had undergone a prolonged and horrific traumatic experience the year before, and then was thrust back into normal life as a "typical" high school student. I was surrounded by people who supported my abusers, and felt that what had happened to me was my fault (and people supported this idea). 

And then, I had a glimmer of hope that was so wonderful and unimaginable that not only would all my troubles be subsided, but I felt that it would make all my troubles *worth it*. But alas, I made a very stupid mistake, and I alone sabotaged myself. 

I joined Reddit and found this subreddit, and [cried for help](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1swjeq/what_do_you_live_for_when_you_dont_have_anything/?). Redditers were patient and understanding. 

Of course, I thought much of what they told me (it got better, other great things would happen to me, I would learn to live with my regrets) was bullshit. It annoyed me at the time, though I was warmed by the fact that people sought to comfort me. My mind was going in circles. It was stagnant. I had never experienced that. It was a very dark time.

I had to push through another year - and it was perhaps the hardest year of my life - but somehow, I made it through. You couldn't pay me anything to relive that time. Through fantastically random events, I got the opportunity to leave home and have a "fresh start," and then went off to college, where I was able to think with a clear mind. It wasn't an easy transition. It was easy in some aspects - I wasn't homesick, like others in my college freshman dorm - but looking back on it, it was an adjustment. 

I am now much further into college. Wonderful things have happened in my life, and I truly do like living. It's not that I get up everyday and short, "I love life!" But three years ago, if I had a chance to just disappear and stop living in a small, painless instant, I would take it in a heartbeat. Now, I would not. I have had opportunities that are very different from the one I messed up. I can't compare them to the one I lost - it's not that one is better than others; they are merely different. I have been honored to have wonderful experiences that I couldn't have imagined three years ago. 

Back then, I wracked with guilt and shame, hatred for myself and for many others. I hated when people would say, "It gets better" because I felt it applied to everyone, but me. But it did. Things did get better. 

Thank you all for your patience. Thank you all for your compassion. Thank you all for your empathy. 

It has literally meant the world to me.
