It's my fault for not trying harder and self-pitying myself all the time.I just need to grow a spine and fix myself. But i don't think i even care enough to. I guess i just want everyone else to solve my prob lems. I'm disgusted with myself.

I don't know if this is real or if it's the narcotics talking. I suspect it's the former. I'm just a terrible person who needs to grow up. And i don't think i care enough to try. i'm pathetic and disgusting.
