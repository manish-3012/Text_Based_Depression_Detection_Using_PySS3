My kids have kept me aliveAnd for a long time it's been enough. 
Took a gun into my car tonight after an argument with my current gf who cares about nothing but herself and her selfish relationship with our infant son and pulled the trigger with it next to my head. 
Closest I've came and I hoped it would scare me but I'm wondering why I dint just aim left a little more.
