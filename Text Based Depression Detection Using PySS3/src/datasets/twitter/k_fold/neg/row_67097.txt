I made my final decisionSince I have everything I need. Tomorrow is going to be the day. I have left a note for my family just letting them know Iâ€™m sorry. Itâ€™s strange, Iâ€™m actually looking forward to it and the thought of ending my suffering puts a smile on my face. No more pain no more loneliness, just freedom. Everything is in place and ready to go. I feel bad that Iâ€™ll hurt those who care about me but at the same time I know itâ€™s going to benefit myself. Thank you to those in this community. For those who have responded to my post before, thank you.   11/04/1997-10/20/19
