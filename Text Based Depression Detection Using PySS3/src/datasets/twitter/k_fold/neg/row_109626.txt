How am i suppose to keep going.Get bullied at school, get depressed. Too scared to tell family (they wouldn't/didn't belive me). Bullying at school goes on for 3 years finally get of to a new school new people actually make couple of friends but it isn't enough they think im funny but ive always been a fucking joke. Still get bullied but by less people, one night lil bro is being a cunt dad says we gitta settle this with an arm wrestling he fucks me up (lil bit of me likes to think that the surface was soft and small) ive just lost to my 3 years younger fat lil bro now my fucking faimly is taunting me everywhere i fucking go im a failure and get shit from it. There arw still things that i enjoy like playing games watching shows drawing and writing but those are such a small part of my shitty life. The only reason y i havent killed myself yet is bcs i like making thins like drawing and writing but. It dosent seem worth it no one will ever regocnice my work and even if they did, it would probably turn out that its complete shit. The reason to keep going is fading how do continue? Should i continue?
