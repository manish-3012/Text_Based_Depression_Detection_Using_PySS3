Anyone think life is just too much hassle?Donâ€™t feel like talkin much. Tried to find other hotlines online. All american. Iâ€™m not. Life is dark and I canâ€™t be bothered anymore. Donâ€™t want to hurt people. Donâ€™t know what to do. Itâ€™s all so empty. I donâ€™t want to worry anyone. So I say nothing. Feel really alone- my own fault though. Anyone else know how this feels? So empty and hurt at the same time. Just want to give up.
