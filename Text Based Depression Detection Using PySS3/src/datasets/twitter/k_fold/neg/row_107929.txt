Iâ€™m hurtingBeing lonely is giving me physical pain and making me sick. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m supposed to hold on when nobody has ever cared about me. I have no friends or romantic parters in my life and I just donâ€™t see the point in continuing on if my whole life is spent staying up until 3 am trying to cry but not being able to.
