Fuck.

tl;dr I'm an orphaned unemployed high school dropout that hates his worthless friends that don't want to do anything but get white girl wasted every single day and I isolated myself from everyone I liked so I wouldn't bother them, now I'm left with my dying grandfather that is unbelievably understanding and supportive and he won't just call me like the trash I am.

I'm a pampered little brat, and I always have been. I've always been given anything I want and too much freedom. When I was 3 my neighbor would have me play doctor with her, we would take turns lying down on a bench in her backyard and "inspecting" each other's genitals. On the good days, her turns were longer. I hated being on the inspection table I hated how she would prod me and pull me but I didn't have a choice, you can't say no to your friends. When I was 6 my mother found out what she was doing to me and we moved away. Into a newer, more suburban complex. It was nice enough, until I started making friends at school. My friends didn't live very close, but I was a smart and responsible child. There's no way *I* could get in trouble. So, I packed my yugioh cards and gameboy into my backpack and headed off into the beating sun to play with my newest, bestest friend ever. About half way there, as I was walking by his house I noticed a man tip over a box and spill out what seemed like thousands, if not millions of yugioh cards! It would've been hard to clean up by himself, and the man was visually grief stricken  so naturally, being the goody goody I was asked if he needed some help. The hollow pits on his charred face lit up, and his mouth opened into a smile which seemed to shine as bright as the sun. "Oh could you please? Feel free to help yourself to some to, I was gonna sell them anyway." SCORE.

For him, of course. I feel sick.

Someone tell me it was all my fault. Tell me I deserved everything I got. Tell me I'm supposed to be this miserable so everyone else can be happy. Go ahead and tell me.

Why the hell did I have to be born?
