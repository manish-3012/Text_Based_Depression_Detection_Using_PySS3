I want people to like me and understand meI'm in LA for a convention and I help run a booth there. Never done this before, was nervous and I decided to try not to care of what other people think of me. Then the people started coming in and I had to talk to them. Pretty much everyone didn't understand what I was saying,  I guess it's because my voice is too fucking soft and I fucking speak too damn fast. I even tried to speak slower and louder and sometimes they still don't understand me. It's annoying. I want to be heard. I want to socialize normally, I want friends. How do I make friends that way? 

Now I'm at the motel room again teary eyed like my previous post on /r/self. This trip to LA is fun. I should be happy, but I'm not. 

I was considering suicide so I'm posting here instead but I can't do that to my family. 

I can't afford a therapist btw. 

I wish my Internet self was like my outernet self.
