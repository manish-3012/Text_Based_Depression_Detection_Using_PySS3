I don't think anything is worth living in this world.For a while now, I've held the view that we as humans just happened to be created in this world and that ultimately, nothing matters, including who lives and who dies. I used to find this comforting, but now it hurts and I can't stand it anymore.

All the good things are outweighed by the unimaginable amount of suffering everywhere. What's more is that it doesn't matter if I live or die, and if there's this much suffering, I might as well die. I've tried convincing myself otherwise, but nothing works. Nothing at all. If something makes me happy, it doesn't matter. If something makes me sad, it doesn't matter. Nothing matters at all, and nothing is worth it. I might as well die.

I'm also pretty useless to society. I'm cripplingly socially inept and don't know how to do most things that I should, things that adults are required to do (I'm 17 in four months), and I have trouble learning. I've also gotten very lazy and don't even have the motivation to go to bed before 8 am or wake up before 4 pm.

These thoughts and feelings have been festering for a while, and tonight they reached a peak because I stupidly decided to play Doki Doki Literature Club, which explicitly shows a suicide. Now I can't stop imagining killing myself.

I'm sorry if this is too long.

TL;DR: I don't think the good things matter in this world since they're outweighed by the bad things and I see no point in anything.
