don't know what to doi've got things that i want to do in my life but i have no idea if it's gonna work out. it probably won't. i have to apply to college and that's terrifying. i might not get in and if i do i might not like wherever i go. it's expensive as fuck. and i have an idea of what i might like to do as a career but it very well might not work out. and in any case it's so much waiting in the meantime. my sister might be dropping out of college soon. i don't want to find myself where she is. maybe i should just kill myself.

it seems more and more appealing the more i think about it. i've been thinking about it for years. maybe i'll never get better. maybe i'll be a wreck forever. i don't want that. if i kill myself, there'll be no more stress, no more anxiety, no more self loathing or pain or hiding things from my family and friends. just blissful silence.

i can't decide what i want. i don't want to hurt my family more than i already have but i don't see a way out. i can't live in the same house as my sister again and she might move back home. i just don't know what to do. every night i cut myself and it's never enough.
