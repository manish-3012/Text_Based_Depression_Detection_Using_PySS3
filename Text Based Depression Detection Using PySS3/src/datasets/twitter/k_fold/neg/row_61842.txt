Help Me.well. I have made a huge fcking Mistake. Feels like my whole life is a mistake. Short Version: Ive got bullied since im 13, have seen my first gf getting tortured because we were together, tried to kill myself 3 times. than around one and a half Year ago i changed school, yeah pretty much changed my life beat the shit out of the depression and had a good year. Well since half an year thoughts were coming back. Moods came back. Fast forward, about 2 weeks ago, i started avoiding Humans. was out in the forrest most of the time, or locked me in my room. Last Friday i met a girl, she is from an (almost) neighbourcountry and we have almost the same Problems, well in some Parts. In some parts we have different Problems. Anyways, i had never allowed anyone, not even friends or parents, to get a place in my heart, to be important for me. now here she is, crushing through these walls in one week. I were breaking down even more last week, ate and drunk almost nothing and im pretty down. Shes probably the only thing keeping me alive. But she is slowly breaking down too, she plans to suicide in the next days and it feels like i have somewhere lost her. We were talking about her finding a new home, away from her abusive Parents, shared plans of just running away. Well, since yesterday she suddenly completly changed, she dosent really respond, and everything i know is about her suicide Plans. Im about to skip class next week to visit her, even if its pretty stupid. I'll have nowhere to sleep there and im not even sure about how to get there or how to get back. On the other side i cant lose her. 
Right now everything is to much, but i think that if i lose her i will go too.
