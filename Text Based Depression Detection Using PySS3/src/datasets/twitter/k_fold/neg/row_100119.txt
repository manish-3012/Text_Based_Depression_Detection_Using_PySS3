My first post.Hello everyone,

(F 28) I am fairly certain I am going to take my own life November 16th 2020. I have had a long battle with depression, PTSD, and Borderline personality disorder.  Last year on October 23 I tried to kill myself, and they put me on Prozac. 


I refuse to go into the reasons why, just know I am pretty certain. 



I have already called the funeral home? And paid for my cremation, and have everything planned out. 


I just wanted to give some advice to those suffering in silence: It gets better, not for me, but it can. Try every avenue to get better just keep trying.
