CW: Vague mentions of assault, suicide, can't really think of anything else

I just calculated my GPA and feel like absolute shit.

    I'm a sophmore in high school. I have a 1.9 GPA. Allow me to explain: I'm by no means trying to insinuate that school is for everyone, i know plenty of people who go to vocational school and they do what they love. That's good!

    But here's the thing. I live in New York, and all I think about is moving to the Village and working in the UN as a lawyer or internal affairs officer, everything that requires hard work basically. I read voraciously, annotate my poetry books for fun, write (badly albeit some people have told me it's good??), and absolutely love buying old film cameras, taking them apart, trying to distort the film, trying to figure out how things work.
     But i have a 1.9 GPA. I think i'm an idiot, but the 3 therapists, 2 psychiatrists (plus the one at the mental hospital lol) and the one neurologist i've seen all say i'm "intelligent" "mature" and "insightful". For one, I think i'm just pretentious and good at acting, because I really don't feel intelligent at all.
 I just calculated my grades and it averages out to a 1.9 I have, as follows:
English 10: 68
 History 10: 83
 Freshman math: 49 (i got a 22/100 on the midterm) 
Chemistry intro: 54
 Spanish (my first language that i am fluent in): 68

I don't understand. I don't. I go to my teacher's office hours, I get tutoring for 2 hours for 3 classes every week, I study 3 hours a day, and nothing works. nothing. works. I scored 96 percentile on the english SAT but what does that matter? I'm lucky. My grades show that i am by all means useless to society.

I am surrounded by people who are incredibly talented. All my friends (not kidding) have 3.0+ GPAs. My boyfriend's in Trig and is in all AP classes and goes to a specialized high school. My parents had good grades and went to good schools. I don't have a sibling but if i did i'm sure i would be the runt of the litter.

All of those aforementioned people tell me i'm so well read and cultured and well spoken. Well, thanks i guess, but i can't focus for shit. My parents have taken me to doctors and they diagnosed me with Psychotic Bipolar, severe ADD was always suspected but they can't give me stimulants because that would literally get me hospitalized. (ampthetamines+psychotic tendencies= doesn't look pretty, trust me)

Because of the crushing weight of my failures I feel like i'm running away from a bullet train. It'll catch up to me eventually and I know it. I've already had a psychotic break just because of my grades. The fact i've been assaulted thrice doesn't help (that's a different story and i don't feel like going into it). I live on the north side and I can't tell you how many times i've walked over to the bridge and just stood on the walk way looking down. I hate taking the subway because i'm afraid one day i'm just gonna throw myself on the tracks.

It's gotten to the point where i literally start screaming and pulling my hair out before math class. I didn't go to school a couple of days ago because of that. When i'm at school I usually have to leave halfway through and i get sick in the bathroom or get a blinding migraine. I can't live like this, at all. My disability (which im being medicated for) is just so difficult to deal with, i mean psychosis, really? i've had delusions of grandeur and paranoia more than i'd like to count. And despite all the shit i have to put up with I get yet another weight on my chest.

These grades are perpetually hanging over me and reminding me of the grim future that lies ahead of me. It's inevitable and I honestly can't picture myself graduating highschool, or being alive at all.
sorry if this broke any rules. i'm stupid
