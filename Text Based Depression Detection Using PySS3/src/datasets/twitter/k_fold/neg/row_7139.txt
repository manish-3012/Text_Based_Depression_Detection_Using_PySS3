Iâ€™m tired.Iâ€™ve worked so hard to get to the place that I am now, and still feel like it will never be enough. I feel like since I was young that I knew I was going to â€œgo out by my own hand.â€ It might sound crazy but I feel like somewhere deep down Iâ€™ve always felt this way. Iâ€™m so tired of feeling anxious to the point of being physically sick. Iâ€™m tired of the contest barrage of thoughts. Theyâ€™re always going. I canâ€™t get my mind to stop. I just want it to stop. I just want to be happy, for once. I want to feel genuinely happy. I want to feel something other than wanting to die. I feel like everyday Iâ€™m drowning. Everyday Iâ€™m falling deeper and deeper into this hole that Iâ€™m digging for myself and I canâ€™t stop.
