Facebook acquaintance seems to be planning suicide. I don't know him well enough to have a talk with him. Advice?An acquaintance from high school has been constantly posting about the fact that he can't get a girlfriend and that he feels worthless. He ignores everyone's advice, and has recently posted that he wants to die and that "I'm glad I won't be seeing this winter" 

I know he won't listen to anything I say. What can I do?
