I am not good enough, I dont have the confidence for anythingEvery time I do something i screw it up hurting and affecting myself and other people. I dont have the motivation for anything anymore and I'm not good enough for myself or other people. I've ran away from home once but I'm too much of a coward to commit to anything. I've constantly hurt friends and family members sometimes for the sake of being an asshole. I will never be good enough or taken seriously because im a joke and i've always been a failure, no matter how hard i try its too late and i will never be able to turn myself around
