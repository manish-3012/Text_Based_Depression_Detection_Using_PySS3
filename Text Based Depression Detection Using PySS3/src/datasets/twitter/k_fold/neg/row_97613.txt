I wish I would be in a fatal accident.Every single day I read about innocent people being killed. People who want to be alive. I would do anything to be in their position. If I could take the terminal, fast growing cancer away from someone I would. If I could be in a head-on fatal collision on the freeway because of a drunk driver, I would. I am literally begging to die. I donâ€™t know if I could go through with suicide because knowing about the pain scares me and I donâ€™t want my family or loved ones to blame themselves. But if an easy, relatively painless method of suicide presented itself to me, I wouldnâ€™t look a gift horse in the mouth. Iâ€™ve just been dealt a really shitty hand at life and at 21 years of age, Iâ€™m fucking exhausted. I canâ€™t keep up this charade much longer.
