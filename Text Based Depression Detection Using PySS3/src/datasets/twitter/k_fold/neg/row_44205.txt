Goodbye for everyoneSorry the bad english, I'm Italian.
Hi. Yesterday i tried to kill me, but i didn't manage to do it. I tried to hang myself, but the rope broke, then I fainted during the impact. Today I will jump from a big building. My mom doesn't want to give me an iPhone 6S and my Gamer Computer. I need it. All my friends have iPhones and Gamer Computers.
