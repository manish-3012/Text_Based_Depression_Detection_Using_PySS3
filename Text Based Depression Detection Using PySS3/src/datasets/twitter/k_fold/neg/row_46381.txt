my life is never ending painmy dad killed himself 34 days ago, my brother died back in may, and now i might die today. Im fucked up mentally from the trauma i endured, my mom gave me C-PTSD so bad im pretty sure im schizophrenic and bipolar now, insomnia is a nice cherry on top. The stress im enduring from my dads death brought the gross thoughts back, i shit diarrhea and get chest pains and headaches from it all.

im only 27, im in the prime of my life and im stuck in the countryside in the house my dad killed himself in, with my car totalled. And my brother shoots dope in front of me every night. Im expected to start off square 1 and walk to work while he makes dope runs everyday in a truck in my name and title, but since it was technically my dads he bought off my brother he thinks i should just get fucked.

on the 24th itll be my birthday, ill be alone destitute and bored again but it wont be because my dads in prison this time, its because he killed himself and made me find him. Ill see you soon father, the only person who truly cared about me backstabbed me, this world is too cruel for me any longer. Ill never be happy what the fucks the point anymore.
