I attempted about 4 weeks ago. I just considered it again but this time not feeling scared about it.I'm 17F. I've got 0 friends, 0 social life. I fight with my mom and she tells me she can't keep this up anymore and wants to put me on drugs, which I don't need.

I spend my days playing videogames and watching YouTube/movies and masturbating. I'm not a whore.

I attempted suicide by pills, but that didn't work, mostly because the pills were 4 years out of date and had probably weakened. I was hospitalised for 3 days.
I've considered it every day since then, multiple times a day, though I've always been scared of it. Scared of the outcome.
Two hours ago I considered it again, but this time, it was different. I planned out everything in my head, I still remember it and I wasn't scared. I could see my body laying on the concrete after I had jumped, but I wasn't scared. It gave me a sense of protection somehow. I felt safe.

Now afterwards, I'm not really scared, though I want help, but am not prepared to get it myself. I just don't know if I should jump or not. It feels like everything would be easier that way, for everyone.

Let's say it like this. If I had a sharper knife than the one I got lying under my pillow, I'd slit my throat instead of my thighs right now.

Thanks for reading. Hope you get to live this wonderful fucking life everyone seems to be praising ðŸ™ A-fucking-men
