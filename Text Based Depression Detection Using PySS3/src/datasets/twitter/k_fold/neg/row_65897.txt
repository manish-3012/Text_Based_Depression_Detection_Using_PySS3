Is it okay to tell my suicidal friend this?Will it help in any way for me to tell her that if she dies, I know for sure I'll kill myself too? I'm not fabricating any part of that. Some days I feel like I'm barely hanging on and losing her would make me go off the edge. I'm so sad for her and I wish I could help but she's been struggling with these issues for so long and I just want her to be happy again.
