When the thought of continuing to live becomes more terrifying than dyingSlowly approaching it. I've never felt this physically ill in my life and the discomfort won't fucking stop. And the nurse reads my mails and doesn't respond to them. Doctors don't care. Why is it on me to care? Why am I the only one who fights for me? Why won't anyone else care?   
  
This isn't a life I want to live. Mental pain is one thing, but when my own body is shutting down I take it as a sign that I should call it quits completely.
