I feel numb.I work 80 hours a week to provide for my wife and son. Last night my wife blindsided me and said she wasn't happy and it's over. My whole life is my family and now it's gone. I have nothing, everything I worked for was for nothing, I have failed at life. I can't tell anyone what I'm going through because I use firearms in my profession and if anyone found out, my licensing would be revoked, weapons would be taken and my career over. Its getting harder and harder every day...
