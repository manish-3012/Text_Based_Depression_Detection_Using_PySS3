Sometimes it's just impossible to escape this life filled with pain and love.I often feel completely useless and fixate on how much I should die. But then I have to remind myself that it really doesn't matter what I do with my life because the world wont remember me either way when I'm gone and that is fine with me. I just wish I could exit earlier.
