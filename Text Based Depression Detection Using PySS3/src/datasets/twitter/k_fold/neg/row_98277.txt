No one of importanceI'm no one special,  so I can't write a special note(adjust your expectations accordingly).that being said I can shed light on my decision, I won't justify this and tell about the details of my pain because at the end of the day they aren't anything special or unique but it is both acute and constant. My pain has shaped me in positive ways it gifted me with a backbone and a quiet tenacity but it has also made me weak and brittle in ways that twisted me and make me unfit for this life.i find that as strong as I feel is inversly proportional to how weak I am. I recognize my failure to my family and Hope specifically I take responsibility for this.i recognize I am inadequate and lacking the things that make up a person of value. I can't teach values I don't have, and I refuse to drown those I care about in my own deficiencies. My mind is a rotting tooth(best excised). In understanding me through this letter i am conscious of the pain my decision may cause, I only hope you can find the positive in this pain. A man of greater character would not have made this decision, but he wouldn't have to. My choice is no one's fault small or large and was as inevitable as the setting sun. I will miss my family.
