I just hurt myself. Regretful and scared...I purposefully slammed my head against a door after trying to drink a bottle of medicine a few hours ago. I did not feel anything through all the crying but now a few hours later I am in a lot of pain. My head hurts in several different areas except for the part that was actually hit. I've been  able to google on head trauma and write this.. I am very scared about what consequences may come.
