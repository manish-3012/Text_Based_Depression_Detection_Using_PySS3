An untold suicide story.This is more my dad's story but it's stuck in my head.

My father has always been pretty active in our community, he'd chat with pretty much everyone in the neighborhood and he's a really sweet person. A couple of years ago he and a group of friends with whom he hikes every sunday, started to connect more with a lady in our street, let's say her name is Eve. Eve had a happy and energetic dog so my dad asked if she wanted to come on their hikes because the dog would like it. She was very hesitant but decided to go anyways and she continued walking with my dad and his friends for a couple of years.

After about a year my dad told me that she was very depressed and that she didn't have much family or friends so he really tried to make things better for her, he invited her over for dinner etc. But he also didn't want to push her into things she didn't want.

Another year goes by and we are on vacation during christmas time. We're just hanging around in the afternoon and my dad gets a call, I'm sitting next to him on the couch. I could hear the voice say "Eve killed herself." And my dad was just silent. I could see instantly how emotional he got. He walked outside and continued to talk on the phone. He walked back in and told us "Eve comitted suicide, I've got to call some people because her dog is crying so loudly and he doesn't have anywhere to go."

My dad and his friends all went to her funeral, and they all cried for her. The dog was taken in by one of the guys. I still wave if I drive past the cementary.



I myself am suicidal and it felt... strange to suddenly not have her anymore. But she was a very different person. Do you guys have any stories like this?
