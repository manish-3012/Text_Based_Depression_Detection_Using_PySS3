How do you cope with the fact that you gotta wait for years for something that may or may not happen without feeling you better end it now?I'm 22, due to different reasons I'm stuck working at home, I like my job, I give my mom a place to live and we share some good moments, the thing is I've never had a girlfriend and I don't like any major in college so I have no social interactions aside from 4 older women at work and family, every ad I watch, every TV series, every movie, every couple I see remind me: You're so shy and full of anxiety and depression that even if you got a chance of talking with someone you'd screw it up or end as just a friend like before, that's what makes me wanna end myself, I don't wanna suffer for years and years for something that maybe never comes
