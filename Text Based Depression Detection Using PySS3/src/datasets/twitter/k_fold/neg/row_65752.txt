I think I am going to snap tonight and do it (someone asked me to post it here)I hate myself. My toxic mom also helps to pour chemicals into an open fire (she loves to live her anger out on everyone else). My brother just laughed at me when I started crying in front of my family (I was extremely embarrassed and disappointed in myself for doing so). Dad just told me to stop. 

Iâ€™ve lately also thought way too much about humans and life in general and I just feel like Iâ€™m a misfit. Iâ€™ll never experience the things â€œnormalâ€ teens/adults will and it eats me up, especially when my younger brother tells me how he has done this and that with women. I have never belonged here and never will. Iâ€™m so tired and all of the days seem to be blending into one. 
Iâ€™m struggling lots with remembering tiny facts people say during conversations (no memory). I constantly feel pressure in my head, like someone is trying to smash my head with their two hands. 
My mum constantly says that my parents spend so much money on me and due to this canâ€™t do this or that (they say this to show how much they care about me through spending money but for me it sounds different.). I feel like Iâ€™m just a waste of money and everyone would be better off without me. 
I have no energy. Iâ€™m just so tired and want to get out...
