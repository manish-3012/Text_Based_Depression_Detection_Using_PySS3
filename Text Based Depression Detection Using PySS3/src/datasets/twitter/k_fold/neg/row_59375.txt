Thinking of killing myself if my gf decides to end it for another guyIt's not as simple. It never is. It's not as easy as people say. I've made a post in relationship_advice about my situation if anyone cares to read it. 
Don't tell me that love is not worth dying for.
Don't tell me that losing a gf isnt worth dying for. 
Don't tell me to seek professional help coz they never help
Don't tell me that suicide is selfish for the people around me.
Don't tell me that I'll find another one coz i dont want to. This is the only girl i want
Don't tell me this girl is stupid/idiot/and i should dump her

Because to me, this girl is worth my life. No other past relationships has been this great. 

I love my girl so much. It's not an obsession. We were both so happy in our relationship. I have never been this happy. Now this guy comes in and she's attracted to him and she doesn't know what to do in her mind. She asked me for some space for a few days to give herself some time off to de-stress. I have faith in her. I know that there's a chance she will pass because i know she thinks it's terrible for her to like someone else. 

But if in the worst case scenario. I'm gonna end my life. I don't know when and i hope it's not soon. I know people will be hurt in me dying. But if I'm in so much pain i want to disappear forever and not endure the pain. If I'm in this much pain right now and nothing has happened, then The torture of being in pain after the worst case will be unbearable. I've been through suicide a few times in the past and it's slowly becoming a good idea for me.....

Lets see whether I'll be here for an update after a few days...

I want to talk to someone...not professional. Someone?
