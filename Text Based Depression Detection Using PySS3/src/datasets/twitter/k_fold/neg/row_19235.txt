A Year LaterI didn't think I'd post here again but I'm desperate. In the year since i last posted, I've grown shallow and empty. 
My natural response to everything, is to kill myself. Food is cold? No problem, I'll just kill myself. 

I'm alone and the isolation is killing me. The voice in my head is killing me. I want to feel human again.
I want someone to talk to me again, someone who isn't a dead person talking in my head.

If this keeps up i will just jump. I'm on the edge right now. I don't fucking care anymore.
