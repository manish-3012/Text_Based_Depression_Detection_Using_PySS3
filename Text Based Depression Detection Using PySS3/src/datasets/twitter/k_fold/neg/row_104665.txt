EmptyThat's all I feel now.

Throughout the past 2-3 months, I've been chasing a girl. Lame as hell, right? 

Finally I decided to tell her my feelings and she explained that she used to feel the same way but had recently stopped. I was willing to accept that, but less than a week later at a party she started cuddling with me and telling me how she was confused and I make her happy. This continued for a few weeks up to now. She talks to me like it never happened and tells her friends that we are just friends, since most of them were asleep and never saw us. She tells me not to touch her, even in like a casual situation like stopping her from falling after tripping. It's the weirdest thing and has hurt me so bad as I thought I may have had a chance and have pretty much been crushed every few weeks. We're going away to college in just a few weeks and it just makes everything hurt and I want it to stop. I want it to all stop.
