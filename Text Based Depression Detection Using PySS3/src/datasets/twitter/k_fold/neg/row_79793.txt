Just one question. I'm suicidal myself and feel insulted everytime someone is dropping a line like: "Hey, let's talk" or "It will get better, I promise". How it comes you people don't get it that people like me are done talking and things only got worse over the years? Just curious, because reading these lines is bringing up thoughts like: "Ending it? Now more than ever."
