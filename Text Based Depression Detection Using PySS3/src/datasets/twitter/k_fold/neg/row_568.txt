directionless with nobody to talk to.My name is Saomi. I have spent all of my 27 years floating through life with no direction. I have never been someone who had friends, lovers, or an exciting life. I want to live so badly. I want to go out late at night dancing. I want to talk to everyone I see and learn about them. I want to create lifelong friendships. I want to see the world. Lose my virginity. Become an artist. Fall in love with life. However, I know that while these are fun thoughts, I know they are pure fantasy. These things will never happen to someone like me. If I haven't done that stuff by now, I will never be able to shed my shyness, my inhibition, and my lack of action to accomplish a life well lived. Instead of continuing to enable my fantasy life I've decided to kill myself to end the pain and dissatisfaction. Just posting a bit of my swan song here. stay cool everyone.
