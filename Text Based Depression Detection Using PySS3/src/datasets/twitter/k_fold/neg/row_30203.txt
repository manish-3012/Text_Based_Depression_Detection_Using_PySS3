Iâ€™m disgustingI donâ€™t deserve to change. I have all the opportunity in the world and I barely try. I pretend to not care on purpose because Iâ€™m fucking disgusting and horrible. I donâ€™t deserve to change and I want to die already. I want to be a better person but itâ€™s only to sustain my flaccid  ego. I deserve to die. Iâ€™m fucking disgusting and I deserve to die.
