Going on 5 years of being alone. All my friends have moved on to happy and healthy relationships. I have tried and failed so many times I lost count. Tonight I had 4 different women that have been courting all call me a waste of their time. I sit all alone without even a friend to talk to.Maybe I wasnâ€™t meant for this and I need to give someone else an opportunity.
