This poop just ain't fun anymoreMy friends hate me, I don't have the drive nor motivation to study for any of my classes so failure is pretty much inevitable, waking up and falling asleep are both incredible hurdles, I feel incredibly demotivated to talk to my ltr partner because I can never get more than like 3 words out of him, i have a lot more to list off but I don't have the energy to do it none of this is fun anymore so I'm sorry for rambling and wasting your time
