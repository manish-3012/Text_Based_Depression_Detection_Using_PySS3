My best friend committed suiciude on Sunday.I lost perhaps my best friend, one of the only people that actually seemed to care about me. Only two days after his 18th birthday. I remember talking to him the day before it happend. He seemed happy and content with life. I can't help but blame myself for not noticing something was wrong. For not saying or acting diftently perhaps he'd still be alive. I'm in a world of emotional hurt becosuse I never had a chance to say goodbye or tell him how much I truely loved him. Please to anyone contemplating suiciude reach out to someone anyone. Even if you think there's no one, someone cares about you. Someone loves you. The emotional pain and distress you'll put everyone through isn't worth it. 


I'm gonna miss you so much buddy. ðŸ’™
