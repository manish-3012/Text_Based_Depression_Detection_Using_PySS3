Discussing life insurance, mentioned mental health, was informed that it was fucking weird and I needed to shut up.Yesterday, I was discussing with my husband of 2 years that if I die, he should have enough in my life insurance to pay off everything and have a good amount to live on for a year or two with no income. I mentioned that itâ€™ll also pay out if I committed suicide (as long as there have been no changes for at least 2 years, my life insurance will pay out for suicide, I checked). 
Husband doesnâ€™t have mental heal issues. Never has. And thatâ€™s great for him, Iâ€™m glad he doesnâ€™t feel like I do. But when I mentioned that no matter what (accidental death or suicide) heâ€™d be ok, he kept telling me to â€œshut up, itâ€™s weird that [I was] talking about thatâ€ and that people â€œdonâ€™t talk about that, itâ€™s fucking weirdâ€. 

I feel like it hit me twice. Like one: because Iâ€™m just trying to make sure heâ€™s ok financially no matter what, and two: it might have been nice to talk about things, like maybe I wish I could have told him that these invasive thoughts are everywhere and I canâ€™t keep them locked away because itâ€™s too hard but I canâ€™t talk to a therapist because Iâ€™m afraid of them forcing me into a 72 hour watch. 

How do you guys handle these things with spouses or SOs?
