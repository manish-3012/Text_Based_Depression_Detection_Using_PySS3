I'm DoneEverything is horrible. I'm a broken mess. Everything that has gone wrong is my fault. I can't love myself. I can't tell anyone. I can't get help. I've fucked up everything so badly there's no hope in fix it. Time is an illusion. Life has no meaning. I've been battling my own death for 3 years. I'm a mistake. I'm a cosmic joke. I'm asexual. I can't do anything right. I'm non-binary agender. I can't do anything right. I'm bad and I know it's true. People try to help me an I push them away. I don't deserve your energy, because I'm a black hole. I'm tired all the time. I'm 19 and I failed my first year of college because I couldn't even get out of bed in the morning. Now I have debt. I have no job because I'm afraid of failing at that too. If I get a job and it goes horribly like everything else I wouldn't survive it. It's  lose-lose situation. I FAILED. It's over. People trusted in me. People believed in me. And I FAILED. I'm a speck, on a smudge, on a particle, on a grain of sand, on a beach, among billions of beaches, so what does anything matter anyway. I'm done. I wish I'd never been conceived. I'm gonna fix that mistake. Fuck this reality. I hope it was all a simulation, because then it might make sense why my life has been such a sick cosmic joke. Goodbye everyone who knew me, but never knew me. You know nothing about me, and maybe that's all by design. This is it for me. I've had the rope for years. I'm done. Life is suffering. I'm killing myself. It's finally happening.
