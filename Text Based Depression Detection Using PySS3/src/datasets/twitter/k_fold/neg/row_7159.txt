I feel completely hopelessmy(22f) Muslim parents locked me in the house for more than a month now because they find out I was selling my nudes for extra money to get independent and I was smoking. they tool all my device I only have this old computer that I use it for studying

I had a bf that I break up with cause my family threatened me if I don't do that they will ruin his life, I left my religion 3 years ago,

I am going to counseling with a religious approach and he told me something like addicted people doesn't know drugs are bad for them and you are like this  maybe you don't know how bad was selling your nude was and effects you

I can't tell my therapist  anything I don't trust him and my family

I'm doing self-harm for more than two weeks its the least thing in my life that makes me feel much better

my mom keeps praying to god for my sake and cries a lot I feel so guilty

I tried so hard so I can be able living my life the way I want but nothing goes right and everything seems so wrong now

I really want to kill myself but my mom probably kill herself too she is so attached to me I feel so baaaaaad ughhhhhhh why I can't do anything right
