Iâ€™m 15 and honestly just have no will to live anymoreItâ€™s like... one good thing happens and then a million shitty things happen and I canâ€™t seem to get one moment where I am ever truly happy. Then Iâ€™m constantly anxious and paranoid, plus Iâ€™ve been hallucinating. 
Whatâ€™s the point? The only reason Iâ€™ve stayed here past 12 years old is because of my sister and now sheâ€™s a little brat who hates me because all I do is stay in bed. My parents donâ€™t say it but I know they are disappointed and wish I was a better child. 
All I have is my girlfriend who I canâ€™t even say is my gf because her fucking ex might swoop her off her feet again before I get the chance to even kiss her for the first time. 
I canâ€™t open up to anyone close to me because to me itâ€™s not opening up itâ€™s just dumping all my problems on them. 
I just wish I didnâ€™t fucking exist, that people didnâ€™t care about me and that I could die, or start self-harming in peace again. I mean I did relapse but I canâ€™t even relapse on my wrist so I doesnâ€™t hurt as bad I have to cut on my thighs. 
I just want it to be over. All of it. My depression, my anxiety, my fucking undiagnosed shit, my family problems, I wish that my ex had never molested me. I just want it to be over and I canâ€™t talk to anyone but internet strangers about it. Iâ€™m pathetic.
