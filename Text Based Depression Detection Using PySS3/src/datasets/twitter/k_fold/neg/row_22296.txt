I donâ€™t know what to doI have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while and sometimes oddly, they actually give me peace to sleep at night. My wife is pregnant and struggling with it. I lost my job do to cutbacks recently as well. Itâ€™s depressing. I am trying to find us health insurance but I canâ€™t. She is on edge everyday and today she told me ruined her life. I guess her life was ok as long as I had a job and insurance. I donâ€™t know what to do...seems like a dickbag move to leave a pregnant woman and I know Iâ€™d constantly be judged for it. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s just time to go different route. I constantly thing about suicide...when I wake she when I sleep. Itâ€™s always there. I just donâ€™t know what to do....
