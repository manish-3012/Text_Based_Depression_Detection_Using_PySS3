So my mother just told me that if I'm going to kill myself, I should make sure I put my car in my boyfriends name first, and that she won't keep my pets but she'll make sure they go to good homes. Then she called me a bitch.Stellar parenting, right there. I really don't know why I bother trying to talk to her.
