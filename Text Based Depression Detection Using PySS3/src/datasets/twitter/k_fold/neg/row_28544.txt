7 days until I kill myselfSo my Iâ€™m only posting here because Iâ€™m curious about what people will say to try to stop me from killing myself so I guess I need to tell you about the position Iâ€™m in. Well the main reason I wanna kill myself is because Iâ€™m bored, nothing I do makes me feel anything I have no emotions left in me, I donâ€™t love anyone in my family (they arenâ€™t bad people I just donâ€™t give a damn what happens to them), I donâ€™t enjoy doing new things or any of the things I always enjoyed doing like playing games and hanging out with friends. Iâ€™m not popular or have any money (familyâ€™s not that well off but not in a bad position either) Iâ€™m not good at really anything other than being a dick to most people at school (not a bully but just donâ€™t get along with that many people) I also hate putting effort into anything Iâ€™m lazy and Iâ€™m okay with never leaving my room and socializing cuz whatâ€™s the point when I donâ€™t feel anything. I really donâ€™t want to offer anything to the world even if I could because as I said before I donâ€™t care about anyone, in fact I feel like I would wanna maybe murder someone before I die but as if I would considering I would have to put effort into it Iâ€™d rather not leave my room. Iâ€™m just gonna wait until the first day of school then Iâ€™ll kill myself either by filling the house with gas the setting it on fire or drink a *chemical cocktail* I made witch has some real nasty stuff in there so yeah thatâ€™s pretty much it.
