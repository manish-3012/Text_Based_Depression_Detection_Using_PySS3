Another suicidal nightThere is nothing good about me. I'm just a worthless piece of shit who's lazy most of the day. I really want to sleep right now also but can't. I just wish I had someone to appreciate me and tell me that I am special. I wish I could just sleep through the whole day without question just to releave my mind of the pressure. I hope next time I sleep I don't wake up so I don't have to deal with everyone not caring about me. Everyday I feel a part of my soul die.
