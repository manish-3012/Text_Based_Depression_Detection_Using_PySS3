Thinking about killing myselfI have been dealing with depression for quite a while. Ever since my grandfather died 3 years ago I couldn't deal with people in general. I'm 19, graduated from high school last Sunday after 12 years of being verbally and physically abused by literally everyone. Had to change schools countless times, but nothing ever changed. This past month has been the worst month in a long while. My girlfriend left me 'cause she 'didn't feel love for me anymore'. We dated for 4 years. My best and only friend shot himself while I was walking to his house since he was depressed. I talked to him on the phone and 3 minutes later I found him dead in his home. I got kicked out of my apartment, got locked up in a jail cell 5 times, got beaten up a lot of time, etc. This made me think if someone up there doesn't want me to have a happy life and I was thinking about killing myself. Please help.... I don't wanna do it, but I don't see another way
