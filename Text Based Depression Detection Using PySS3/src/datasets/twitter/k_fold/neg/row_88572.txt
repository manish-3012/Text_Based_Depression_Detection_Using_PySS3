I'm not going to today...but want to so bad!I so badly want to leave here right now. I just need to say that. I want to leave before I lose everything. I am in pain constantly. I already know I need to go. I know how I will go. I have no future, but more and more pain and even worse than it is now.  I just have one person in my life that complicates things on so many levels. Please I just need to say that here. It hurts so much.
