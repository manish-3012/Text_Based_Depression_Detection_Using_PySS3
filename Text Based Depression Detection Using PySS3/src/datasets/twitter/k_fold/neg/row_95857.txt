I'm tired of trying to be "Good"Everytime I try to be good I get reminded of how I should be bad. When I got laid off even though I didn't deserve it. When my mom comes home and the first thing she says is if I have a brain, the fact that I'm 24 and have a disability so getting a good job is hard, I feel so useless, I don't want to have to worry or be alive...I want to be my old self where I didn't care I did what I wanted and everyday I tried to die either by fighting,shooting or causing problems. I don't know what to do I don't want to be "Good" anymore it sucks and I'm done with it. WHY DO I EVEN TRY....
