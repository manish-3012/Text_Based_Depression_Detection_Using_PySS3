Laughing at the thought of finally ending my misery (TW)I think I try to be optimistic, maybe Iâ€™m lying to myself. Doesnâ€™t matter. I think Iâ€™m happy in my misery, maybe thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m laughing. I want to mutilate myself but thatâ€™s kind of an inconvenience if Iâ€™m still alive and end up in the hospital. I really do wanna live though, thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so fucking funny. 
I feel like somethings missing from my life. I know there is. I havenâ€™t worn Invisalign in over a year and I feel like I should be wearing them right now or else my teeth will fall out. I shaved my head and Iâ€™m not happy, I dumped my boyfriend and Iâ€™m not happy, I gained weight and I thought I was happy but Iâ€™m fucking not and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever will be. 
I want to vomit because thatâ€™s the only coping mechanism that works for me
