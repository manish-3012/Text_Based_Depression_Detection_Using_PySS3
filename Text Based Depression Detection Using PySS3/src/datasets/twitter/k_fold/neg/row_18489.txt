Just can't handle the anxiety and depression any more.My anxiety is so bad that it is nearly crippling. I actually felt good last night after so long and I thought I was making some progress. New meds. Lost a little weight. Cut back on drinking. I went to bed last night and I said I was going to have a good day off. Woke up at six with the anxiety back full force. Felt like I was going to vomit. I'm so tired of living like this. I just wish I was single with no kids some times so I could just kill myself and not feel this way anymore. I can't though because I'm afraid of what it would do to my family.
