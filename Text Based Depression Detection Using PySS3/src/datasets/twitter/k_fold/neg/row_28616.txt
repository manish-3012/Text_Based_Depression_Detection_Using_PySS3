Never posted here before, but I need to.I feel like such a burden. Iâ€™m newly wed to my husband and I feel like whenever Iâ€™m around him, he just tolerates me. Same goes for his mother. We live with her while we save money to get our own place. Iâ€™m working two jobs and I feel like a failure. I feel like Iâ€™m tolerated but thatâ€™s all. I try reaching out and talking to my family, but I feel so ashamed, because I have a great life. I donâ€™t even deserve to be depressed or deserve to live. 

Iâ€™ve sought out help a number of times but thereâ€™s this voice in the back of my mind telling me that Iâ€™m not worth the help and Iâ€™m a waste of time. 

I have so much pain that I canâ€™t even bear to look at myself. I hate myself for feeling this way. I know the pain would just all go away if I was gone. 

I wouldnâ€™t be a burden. I wouldnâ€™t have to be tolerated. I wouldnâ€™t have to feel anything anymore. 

Everyday I wake up and think of ways that I could kill myself. Itâ€™s a constant pros and cons going back and forth in my head. 

Itâ€™s a never ending cycle. I admit Iâ€™m depressed so I talk about it, but then I feel like Iâ€™m complaining because no one wants to hear about depression or suicide, then I feel like a burden, and then I keep thinking about how it would just all go away if I died. 

Help.
