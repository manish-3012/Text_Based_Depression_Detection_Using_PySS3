I said "I'm sorry".I was so desperate for human love that I asked her out. My best friend.

She said no and I was mean to her for it. 

But even if I was rude, does that mean I'm unforgivable?

Yes, according to her. 

It doesn't matter that at the time I would have killed myself over her. And nearly did. 

It doesn't matter that I still want to kill myself over her. 

It doesn't matter that I feel awful about it and all I want is just to be her friend again.

It doesn't matter.

 I don't matter. 

The nicest person I've ever met hates me. Because of my fuck up. It's all my fault. Everything has always been my fault. 

Even the nicest person I've ever met can't forgive me. Why should I even fucking TRY?

It's a good thing that I have easy access to a gun. I'll be able to wipe this little mistake off of the face of the planet, just like that.
