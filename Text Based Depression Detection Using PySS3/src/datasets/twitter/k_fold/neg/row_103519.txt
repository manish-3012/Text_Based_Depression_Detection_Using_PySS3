It has been 15 years and I have no desire to suffer another...I know this will sound like a cry for attention, but really I would like to be convinced that its worth continuing. Right now, I have a plan to walk over to the 4 lane road near my house and simply jump into traffic. I just got my permit (it's my birthday, finally old enough), and it says organ donor on it so if I die my organs will at least be put to good/better use. I simply don't think it's worth it as I don't have any friends, and my own family doesn't even care about me.
