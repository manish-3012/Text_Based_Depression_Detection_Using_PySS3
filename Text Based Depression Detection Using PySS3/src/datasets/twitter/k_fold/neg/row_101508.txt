I find that the more time I spend alone, which I have been in my room for a year now, I find I become more good at things?My imagination and creativity, is very strong. Everything goes on in my little world in my head, but I refuse to go out and have a strong hate towards people who are social. I myself can't be social and don't have a girlfriend but imagine myself in those situations and that is all I need. I just feel rotten but feel that everyone is different and I'm just 1 in 7 billion that no one will ever understand what goes on in my mind.
