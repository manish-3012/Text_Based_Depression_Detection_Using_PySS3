is this normal?these past few weeks have been extra tough.  i have a normal life, a family, few friends, a loving girlfriend.

but every now and then i get to the point of wanting  to just get away from everything. just a moment of peace.

there are days when people around me are having a hard time and I'll  come and help them but when  i have a hard time people dont help me out. they see me as someone who can handle it, i cant. I'm  slowly dying and im slowly murdering myself with alcohol and vices.. yes thats how i get by. sometimes when i really get drunk just lock myself in my room  and think about ending my life. just for the sake of peace
