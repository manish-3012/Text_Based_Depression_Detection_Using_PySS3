This is who I am now. This is life. And I don't want to live it anymore.This depressive episode has been going on for the past two weeks, and it has only been getting worse. Everything around me is going to shit in one way or another with no way of recovering. It's completely hopeless to look forward to anything that can be an improvement without strings attached. I'm too exhausted and depressed to do my basic college work or take on any creative projects or maintain my friendships. My ADHD makes the brain fog in my head Tok unbearable to live with. Even the things that should be bringing me joy, whether it's video games or talking to friends or whatever, just makes me numb at best and anxious and depressed at worst now. I'm having multiple times where it's just too much to even get out of bed; the sorrow in my heart is making it too much to bear. 

It's all just way too much to describe to anyone that can actually get how I'm feeling. I attempted to describe my issues with a couple of people, one my boyfriend. I feel like my one friend sees me as a completely different person, and I pretty much completely alienated my boyfriend. Also, it feels useless to talk to my therapist now since he'd just be disappointed in me after I told him I was feeling better at some point. Even trying to vent to people that want to understand doesn't help. 

At least every hour that I have been awake, I've been daydreaming about taking a gun and blowing out my brain stem. I probably can't do that though, so I'll need to improve if that time comes. I've realized that at the age of 25, I am the person that I am now; there is no growing up. This is my life, and it will only get worse. I need to jump out of the burning building before the fires burn off more of my skin and flesh.
