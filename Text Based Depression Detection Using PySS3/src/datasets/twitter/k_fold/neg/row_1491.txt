I'm just fucking done. I'm going to kill myself after class.I've spent the past week trying to finally get my life under control and so much has gone wrong. More than usual. It's like the world's way of saying "Fuck off and die" and it's working. I want to. I can't take anymore of this shitty fucking year. I'm fucking exhausted. I'm on my way to class right now, but when I get home, I'm ending things for myself before someone else gets hurt. I'm always hurting myself or hurting others. I'm tired of that. This'll hurt less.

 To everyone I love, I'm sorry I couldn't fix all of my mistakes. I'm sorry for everything. You all deserve better. I love you. I always have and always will. I'm sorry if I didn't show it.
