Rocks fall, and nobody cares if I dieI don't have a suicide note. I'm not going to bother going through my possessions. It's time. 

My boyfriend is going away to Scotland for four days. Tuesday I'll do my nights at work with a smile on my face and then then on Wednesday morning I'll end it. 

I have fucked up everything in life simply by existing. Four time survivor of sexual abuse; a mother who told me not aborting me was the biggest mistake of her life; three fucking university degrees and I remain the most beige and stupid person anyone will ever meet.

It's never getting better. I've been on ten different meds. Countless therapy. Inpatient stays. Staying sober, and using substances to block it out.

Being tortured is great when you're 17 and able to be a manic pixie dream girl. When you're twice that age? Nobody has empathy.

Nothing fucking works when you're bipolar and BPD and are a jigsaw piece that doesn't fit anyone's puzzle. There is nothing about me to love, and even my ugly face and fat body isn't enough to have someone even want to use me for sex. The world will turn fine without me. I can't see anything other than a net gain from my loss.

The blackness always used to frighten me. The lack of being. It feels like the most welcome power down button in the world right now.

72 hours until my mind is silent. I can't fucking wait.
