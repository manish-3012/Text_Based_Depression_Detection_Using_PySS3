So tired of mental illness romanticizing and vilificationThereâ€™s so. So many people who romanticize mentally ill characters in media. People with sociopathic or psychotic characteristics are always seen as villains, seen as monsters. And then people act like, â€œoh, heâ€™s so psycho, heâ€™s so hot!â€ Acting like those unstable characteristics make them attractive because of the risk thrill. 
But then, someone whoâ€™s actually mentally ill, someone who isnâ€™t textbook hot or doesnâ€™t show their mental illness in an â€˜attractiveâ€™ way. They meet them and call them insane and crazy, treat them like shit because of the very same things they called hot. 
Iâ€™m tired of it. I just want to be seen as a person.
