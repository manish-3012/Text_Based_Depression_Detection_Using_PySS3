Vaguely suicidalDonâ€™t really know if Iâ€™ll ever do anything about it. But I feel empty and alone and I donâ€™t enjoy anything anymore. I feel like I just experience every day and Iâ€™m not even there for it

I just feel numb. I donâ€™t have anything to look forward to. I opened up to it about my friends back around Christmas and all I felt was judged and the sense that I just overwhelmed and scared them. 

Thatâ€™s all.
