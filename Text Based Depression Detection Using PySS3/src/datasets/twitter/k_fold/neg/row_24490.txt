i want to kill myself again and i donâ€™t know whyi first tried when i was about 6-7 by ingesting soap
iâ€™ve been wanting to kill myself ever since, 11 years of wanting to die
i skipped school today just to have the house to myself while i did it but before i ingested all of the pills i started thinking about it: why do i want to kill myself? iâ€™m in the best place iâ€™ve ever been: a boyfriend that loves me and a home, family is supportive, iâ€™ve got friends. what makes me want to die so bad? i feel guilty for wanting to die

i donâ€™t know wether iâ€™ll kill myself today, but if i do, i wonâ€™t even know why i did it
