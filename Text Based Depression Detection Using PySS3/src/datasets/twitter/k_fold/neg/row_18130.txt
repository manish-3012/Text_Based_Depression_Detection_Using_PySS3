I lost my hopeI posted on this sub few days back. At that point i felt hopeless and didnt know why i existed, although i feel the same way the only thing that changed was i lost two of my very close friends, and the reason was my mistake. I dont know what to do anymore. If anyone has any way of ending life peacefully it could really help me out
