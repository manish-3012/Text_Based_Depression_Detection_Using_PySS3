Tomorrow or TuesdayYou know. I've posted for awhile.  I think I'm ready. I'm just looking for a good place to do it! I'd love to do it in downtown Los Angeles. Or suicide bridge in Pasadena. But any place where I can reflect. Then take my plunge.  That would be awesome. Please post places that would be great and the reasons why. I don't want to be talked out of it. I just want to hear places. It's going to happen... so just shit up and let it happen. Thanks!
