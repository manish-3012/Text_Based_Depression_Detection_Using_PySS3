I feel like a big ball of furyThat is the only feeling I seam to feel any more. Pure undying hatred for everything. I don't want to hurt others I just want to put myself out of my own misery. From the moment I wake up till I'm in bed again I imagine my brain my splattered against the walls. I don't see objects any more, I see methods of how to finish. 

I don't know what to do any more.
