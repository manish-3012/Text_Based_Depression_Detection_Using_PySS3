I don't think I'm gonna make itEveryday the main emotion I feel is despair. I'm spending this Christmas eve at my mothers house who emotionally abused and manipulated me and my sister, while claiming the mantle of perfect mother. That is after she left my dad for the neighbour. I have terrible social anxiety, terrible focusing problems effecting my schoolwork, and I've been depressed to one degree or another for as long as I can remeber. Their is no light at the end of this tunnel. The past is awful. The present is awful, the future will be awful. If it won't be tonight, it will be next week. If not next week, next month. I've held that razor to my wrist several times before and didn't do it. I'm not sure how many I have left, and I hope the next one is it.
