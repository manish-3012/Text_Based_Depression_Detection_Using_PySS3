I won't bother you with some emotional post about how worthless life is. But if someone wants to talk for a little bit, I wouldn't mind.I've been pretty suicidal for about a year now. Haven't told a single person except my younger sister (and best friend) when we were drunk. I can't bring myself to tell anyone just because I know how selfish and narcissistic it is. If I do it, it's going to be completely private and with as little attention as possible... but I still might do it. I feel gay for even posting this from a throwaway account right now. I just feel like if I don't talk to someone, soon, it might happen. And (though I'm not sure) I don't think I want it to happen. Nothing is good right now, I mean, at all. But if there's another way out besides killing myself, I think I want to at least try it before offing.
