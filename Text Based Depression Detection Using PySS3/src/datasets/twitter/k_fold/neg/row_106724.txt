It's just getting worseThis whole year...things have just been declining. It's my fault. I tried to get through a depressive episode myself, and it ruined the one person I love and care about most in the world. He did everything he could and I shut him out because I wasn't thinking straight and I crushed him. I crushed his spirit; he is a shell. And he wants space. So I can't help him get through his pain. 


Hope that he will come home is the only thing that is keeping me from ending it, and some days even that is not enough. This is the first time I have actively looked into suicide methods...putting a plan together about how I would execute it...


I am so tired but sleep doesn't fix it. My stomach is constantly in knots of anxiety and I just have a constant headache. I can barely function. I am trying to do things for myself and while I am doing them when I am actually focusing things are okay, but the rest of the time...I really don't know what I am going to do. If things don't work out...I really don't think I will make it. 


I am so afraid to tell a counselor because I can't be committed or whatever happens when they believe someone is high risk. I don't want help, either. I don't see the point of going on if things don't work out.
