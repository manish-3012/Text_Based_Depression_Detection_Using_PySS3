There is no purpose in life.What even is this point of this all? If one has no passion, no goals, nothing to look forward to..
I have seen life and life will not offer me anything that can make me happy. I am just here for the sake of being here. In the end life is your own choice. And what if my choice is to move on and see what's after life. Honestly, what happens after death is the most interesting thing to me. 
It's not a right or wrong choice, wanting to die. It's your own choice.
