Trying to sedate myself to prevent suicideI'm taking enough medication to hopefully knock me out for a long while because this is the closest I have gotten before. I have what I need to end it. I have all letters written and sitting out for my loved ones. I left a paper at the bottom of the stairs for them to not let my parents find me and to call 911. I have been suicidal for as long as I can remember now. I'm 24 f. I'm medicated and in therapy. Been hospitalized twice. I've been abused mentally, physically, and molested by my own cousin as a child from the ages of 3-11. In a relationship with a female that I can't find the effort to even write the details about. I'm being pushed over the edge. No friends, not even my gf as she just told me she is living a double life and lying to me about everything. Nothing is true and nothing is real. It's so easy for people to see someone suffering from a physical disease pass, and for everyone to say they are at least not in pain/suffering anymore. Why can't I have that.
