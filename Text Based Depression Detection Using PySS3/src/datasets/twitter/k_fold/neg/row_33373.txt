I need adviceSo recently it has came to my attention that I have a friend with depression. For the past couple of days Iâ€™ve been trying to get him to talk to someone and get help, but he hasnâ€™t been wanting help and itâ€™s getting to the point where every time a see him, he has a new mark from where he has hurt himself and now I feel like Iâ€™m not doing enough. So please if you have any advice please tell me, I really want to get him help. Thanks and have a wonderful day :)
