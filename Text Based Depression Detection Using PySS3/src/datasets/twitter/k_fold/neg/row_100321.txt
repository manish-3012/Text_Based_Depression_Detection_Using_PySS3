I'm a horrible personI'm a 21 year old failure. I haven't left my house in a month. I've been doing nothing but causing more stress for my family. Literally, haven't been down the block. I just gave up. I've been in the same psyche ward 4 times in 2  
years. It's true what they say, you have to want to help yourself in order to get better. But I just want to die. 

I caused too much pain in this world. Too much hurt. I'm not a good person at all. All I am is a parasite. If my parents knew what I've done they would lose it. I try telling them but I know it'll hurt them. 

I live next to a liquor store and a train station. Soon I'll just get drunk and walk in front of the train. Well. That's all. Bye
