I used to plan my suicide every birthday. My birthday is next Friday.Hey I'm 29 female. I've had suicidal ideation for 8 years. I've been diagnosed with ptsd for 5 years. My 20th birthday I was being held against my will in an apartment by my ex boyfriend. I've held on because I didn't want to miss what comes next. My birthday has always been a trigger. Last year I was living with my brother and wanted to die. But now...it's different. I'm 11 weeks pregnant. I have an income. I have a boyfriend who wants to be a dad. He has a home. And I don't want to die. I want to live for the baby. When I turn 30, a whole decade would have passed since my first attempt. I'm glad it didn't work.
