I'm so alone in this worldOk, I've been pretty stable for the past year. Still problems with depression and anxiety, but most of the time, I felt empty and my mood either went up or down from there. Still, I hated that empty feeling, which may have contributed to my thoughts. This month, I've been feeling pretty suicidal to the point where I had a plan to do it. I've been putting so much pressure on my mother with all my mental and physical health problems, I feel like I should relieve the burden on her and just kill myself. I'm also stressed out with the fact that I stopped talking to my friends due to their toxicity, with being behind on school work, having to prepare for college, and I've been contemplating my future lately. I feel like it's best if I didn't have one, I don't have an impact on this world and no one seems to care about me. I thought I could ignore the thoughts and continue with my life, but the voices came back too. The voices started to tell me horrible things about myself again, and gave me more ideas to go through with it. I tried to block out the voices, my total mood changed and I let it affect the new relationships I've started to form with others. I lost someone I could really count on because I couldn't voice my thoughts properly and I ended up saying something that made me sound like a complete asshole. I just feel so alone in this world, something I always wanted to avoid. I started cutting again, I've covered up the main scars on my legs, and I told my parents that the scars on my arms came from my cat scratching me. I started formulating a plan to overdose again, what I've done on a previous attempt. I started drafting suicide letters. The first time I overdosed, I ended up telling my mother and she admitted me to the hospital. This time, I don't plan on saying anything. I don't want her to find out this time also because I don't want to go back to the hospital, it was a horrible place for me. I was frequently bullied by others in the hospital because I was different and I was sexually assaulted while I was there too. I don't know what to do. I'm on the brink. I can't stop cutting. And now, I have absolutely no one to turn to.
