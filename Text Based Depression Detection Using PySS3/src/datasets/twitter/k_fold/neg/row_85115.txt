Last night I tried to kill myself and failed. I've come away from the experience with a broken wrist a broken rib and 2 black eyes but told the hospital I fell down the stairs so they have let me go

I've been considering posting here for months and months but just don't want to waste anyones time. I'm a 20 year old male and I'm due to go back to university at some point within the next month

My main issue is that I feel completely hopeless and empty even though there is nothing wrong with my life, I dont get on with my family, but who does, but I do have fantastic friends who are always there for me I just don't deserve it. 
I just don't know how I'm ever going to be happy when I feel so empty and dead when my life is so supposedly good. 
I live in the uk and I just wondered if anyone knew if I could get help without paying for it? I really think I need to see someone know knows about this kind of thing, I'm sure my thoughts aren't healthy.  I really can't go on like this the self harm is getting dangerous and whilst I know that now when I get down it feels like the only way, I'm glad I failed last night but what if I don't next time. I just want to feel better but have no idea where to go from here. Any advice would be appreciated so much.
