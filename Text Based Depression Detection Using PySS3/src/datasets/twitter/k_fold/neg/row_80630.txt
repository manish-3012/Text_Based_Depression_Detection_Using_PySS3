Last ask for helpI was told to post on here and I got no help this is my last fucking attempt to just talk to anyone.  
Not putting my story here because I think thatâ€™s what turned people off which in my opinion is fucked.  Iâ€™m fucking done and I donâ€™t care anymore Iâ€™m trying to keep my head up,  I feel my wall that Iâ€™ve built to withstand what Iâ€™m going through keeps getting hit by fucking boulders and over and over something new (not small inconveniences) keep hitting me over and over and fucking over.  If Iâ€™m gone everyone would be better off my parents would stop spending money.  And Iâ€™m going to will them everything that I own.  They have been a great help and I love them so much I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™d have done without them all this time.  And my son I havenâ€™t been allowed to see him since September 11th.  Heâ€™s only one year old and wonâ€™t even remember me anyways fuck it heâ€™ll be better off without me.
