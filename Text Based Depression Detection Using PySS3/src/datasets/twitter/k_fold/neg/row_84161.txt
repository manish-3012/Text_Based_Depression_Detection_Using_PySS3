There's no hope left for me.I'm 17 and going insane. The only thing in my head is constant paranoia and suicidal thoughts. I freak out about everything. I see and hear things that aren't there. I have no one to turn to, everyone has abandoned me. Parents, friends, etc. I live with my grandma and she has given up on me. She told me that to my face. My entire life I've had counselors to try and get me to open up and talk to them, but I've never understood what they meant. I got diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety at age 11. Every girlfriend I've ever had has just used me for sex or a status symbol or whatever. I have one person left who even recognizes my existence, and she's got her own life to deal with. Every time we talk she has nothing else to say but I'm sorry when I bring up my life. Been self harming since I was 13, body covered in scars. Was addicted to sleeping pills for a time, just so I could stay asleep. Now I almost never sleep. No access to any drugs to ease my mind, so I sit here all day with no way to turn it off. It tortures me. Theres so many more details to everything I've mentioned that make it all that much worse, and I'm terrible at organizing my thoughts. I don't need a motivational speech, but if someone could just read this and try to understand. No one else cares enough.
