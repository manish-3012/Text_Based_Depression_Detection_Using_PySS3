My back pain has returned. This time I'm really going to kill myselfI've had sciatica in the past which left me crippled . I've been ok for about a year but now have pain and inflammation again due to trying to do some work at home . This time I'm done . Prepared all my financial papers and debts into an envelope.  I have $69,000 in superannuation that will get paid to my parents and they can use that to pay most of my debts off and funeral . If I don't feel better soon I'm going to kill myself in my car by next week.
