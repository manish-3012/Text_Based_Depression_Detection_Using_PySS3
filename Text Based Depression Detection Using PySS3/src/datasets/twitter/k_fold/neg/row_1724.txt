I want to kill myself one of these days but Iâ€™m too much of a bitch to.Iâ€™m almost in college. Itâ€™s my senior year. I have no idea what I want to do and I still have to take the ACT. Iâ€™m not smart enough for a job that pays well. Iâ€™d probably be stuck in the minimum wage world for the rest of my life. Itâ€™s not hard to get a gun in my state so by the time I hit 25 Iâ€™m ending my shitty life. I cut myself but it doesnâ€™t satisfy my thirst for pain. I want something new in my life and cutting doesnâ€™t give me a rush anymore. It used to make me feel cold but I feel nothing anymore. If I continue to live I will become homeless.
