SuicideIâ€™m 23 year old and I want to end my life, but Iâ€™m scared to die. Iâ€™ve got my self into debt, gambling addiction, cocaine addiction where I am starting to hurt others. I canâ€™t go on much longer. Iâ€™m always last on everyoneâ€™s list but I always help others while in reality Iâ€™m probably suffering worse inside.
