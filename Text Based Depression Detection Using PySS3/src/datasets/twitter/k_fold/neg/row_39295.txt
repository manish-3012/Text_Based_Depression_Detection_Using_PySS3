I canâ€™t wait to die.I deserve death for the shit Iâ€™ve done to people in the past. Iâ€™m a terrible person who will go nowhere in my life and never will. I feel like Iâ€™m distancing myself from friends because I know one day I will finally get the courage to just finally kill myself. 
I tend to get either depressed when I think of killing myself or I get giddy. Recently itâ€™s been a lot of giddy. I think all the bad shit Iâ€™ve done to people before is finally catching up to me. I canâ€™t wait for the day I finally end my life.
