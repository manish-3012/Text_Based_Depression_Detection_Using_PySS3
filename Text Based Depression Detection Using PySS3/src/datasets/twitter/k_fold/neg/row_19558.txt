What am I supposed to do? My brother asked me to help him commit suicide.This happened about two hours ago. I have a background in healthcare and my older brother called me and asked me to help him find a vein to inject a lethal amount of heroin. This is not his first or second.....or even third attempt. I tried to tell him that losing him (one year after losing our father to cancer) would destroy whatâ€™s left of our family. 
He has battled with mental health his entire life and has obsessed over death. He said he was going to get in a car and drive around five hours to my younger brother and mother to do it in front of them so that he could be surrounded by people he loves.  

I think there is a time and place for physician assisted suicide, but this is not it. He does not have a terminal illness. 

As a family member, this is just unreal and unfathomable.....he said if he couldnâ€™t get to my brother and mom (he was under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol) that he would drive to a Walmart parking lot and blow his head off.  I feel as though I could handle if this happens (as horrible as it sounds) but my mom and brother would lose it. 

Is there anything you can do for someone who has stated they have been planning this and has a 6 hour playlist so that they can listen to music they live while they die?
