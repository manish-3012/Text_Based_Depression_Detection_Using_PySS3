What should I do?A friend of mine whoâ€™s been suicidal before and struggles with mental health posted on their Snapchat story a couple hours ago a pic of them crying and the caption was something like â€œIâ€™m done, I fucking hate myself, if anyone needs me I wonâ€™t be here.â€
Iâ€™m concerned for their safety. I tried texting them but no answer. What should I do?
