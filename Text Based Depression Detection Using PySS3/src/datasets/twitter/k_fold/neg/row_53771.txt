does anyone else have a â€œdeathâ€ playlist?its a playlist filled with songs id like to hear as i take my last breath. they arent even necessarily songs that mean a lot to me; its just that if my life were a movie i feel like those songs would be appropriate to play as the screen turns black and the credits roll in. when im really struggling i put on the playlist and imagine myself dying to them and its weirdly therapeutic. i guess its better than actually trying to kill myself
