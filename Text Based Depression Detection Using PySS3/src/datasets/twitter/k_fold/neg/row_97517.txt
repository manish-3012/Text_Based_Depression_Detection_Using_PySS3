I've been suicidal since I was seven. I dont think it will ever end for meI will never fix myself. I'm too sensitive , I wish I could say my abusive parents broke me, but I am too sensitive. People consider what I experienced just to be a normal eastern European childhood. I'm not worthy for the support people receive when they live in abusive households. Everyone in eastern Europe recieved rthe same treatment, didnt they?

Parents are supposed to hit and humiliate their children, arent they? 

I was starting to acknowledge that this "lifestyle " isnt normal, I even refer to them as abusive parents. I ruin everything all the time, I want to die so much. I feel empty. I am empty. I think I should've done it the first time I ever attempted 

No one loves me. I'm not good enough for anyone yo love me. I am not capable of loving anyone

This is a cry for help. As most things I've posted recently. I'm just done with myself and my fucked up issues
