Planning to kill myself at 29hey guys

let me start by a brief intro

im 14 and live in canada. i have shitty fucking parents and i have no life

my life is a repetition of study 24/7 then piano 24/7 and secretly game 24/7 (yes im asian, korean to be exact), swim 24/7 and read boring ass classic books 24/7

so my teenage years are looking like theyre gonna get fucked and i dont think i can handle me getting old as well

so i thought of this brilliant idea that if i dont want to get old, ill just kill myself

before all this, i always thought that death was interesting. i read a lot of articles about death and read philosophical korean manga about death.

im curious to what happens to 'me' after death.

i dont think this curiosity and this low key depression will go away

so ill just enjoy my life till late 20s then just kill myself. 

any1 with me or have any opinions?

I just wanna talk to people
