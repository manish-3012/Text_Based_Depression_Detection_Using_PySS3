Why shouldn't I just end it all?â€¢ 28 years old Male living in Canada

â€¢ Dead end job I can't stand

â€¢ No friends

â€¢ Virgin

â€¢ No high school diploma

â€¢ Family hates me and treats me terribly

â€¢ My own brother despises me and mocks me for not having friends and tells me to fuck off when I try to invite him to talk or spend time together (tried many times to mend relationship, thought I could have at least one friend and it could be my family member)

â€¢ No hobbies, no interests. Pretty much no skills in anything 

â€¢ Trouble learning and focusing

â€¢ Only notable thing is I inherited some money a year ago, around 50k. That's my only "thing" to my name really

Why shouldn't I just fucking end it. I even feel pathetic complaining about it on here. FUCK my life
