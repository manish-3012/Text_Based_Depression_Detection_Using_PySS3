Can't call the suicide hotline cause I have no money, can't use the chats cause they're all full.So now I'm here. I just wrote a suicide note, then cried for about an hour. I wish I had any friends to call. There's one friend that might understand but I'm pretty sure she doesn't like me anymore. So now I'm just crying in bed. I'm not even sure if I'm gonna kill myself to be honest. I'm trying to talk myself out of it (which is why I tried to call, but I already emptied my bundle for the month). It would be nice to not be so fucking tired anymore though. I've stopped crying, and now I'm just numb. I promised the friend that doesn't like me anymore I'd go to a therapist again. I wonder how she'd feel if I killed myself. Probably relieved. Anyway I'm jyst ranting here, trying to keep myself busy until I fall asleep. I can't be alone with my thoughts, after all. That's a deadly risk currently.
