Hurting so bad it doesnâ€™t feel real.Why is life nothing but pain? Why is my mind filled with regretful and painful thoughts which keep me awake? Why does despair and anger leave me bedridden? I canâ€™t even muster the strength to get up and sit at the computer chair thatâ€™s right in front of my bed. I just want to sit here and rot like I deserve to. Nobody in my life is sincere, I feel like Iâ€™m forced into relationships and friendships which make me feel more alone. I want this life to be over quick, Iâ€™m still waiting for things to get better.......
