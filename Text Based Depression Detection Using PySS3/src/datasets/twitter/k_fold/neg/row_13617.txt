17f, Iâ€™m killing myself tonightI actually had a date planned: 30th December. But waiting for that is too painful. Everyday I take about 10 co-codamol tablets (30/500) just to keep myself numb. No one is awake to help me. I am alone. My friends are all aware Iâ€™m extremely suicidal, but Iâ€™m that way every night. Iâ€™m done trying. I donâ€™t want a life, I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s going to be amazing, itâ€™s just too much energy. Iâ€™m just done. I posted something to reach out on an extremely private story I have and a friend of mine said â€œStopâ€ and then went to sleep (hasnâ€™t been online for almost an hour), so now I think sheâ€™s angry at me. Iâ€™m just not supposed to be alive. My existence is wrong. Iâ€™m sorry for being alive.
