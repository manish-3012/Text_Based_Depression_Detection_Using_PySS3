Been cutting my arms and private parts, can't stand living with problems anymore, can anyone please help me?Right now I have severe psychosis, erectile dysfunction and other servere pain that bothers me all the time that I'm going to see a surgeon for in april. But I have been cutting cause I can't stand the stress and I can't go to the hospital cause they will force me to get pills I don't want and the pills make me sick, what should I do?? I don't know how to relieve stress besides cutting, plus I have severe paranoia 24/7, it's driving me nuts.
