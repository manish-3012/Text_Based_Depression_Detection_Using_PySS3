How to stop your suicidal thoughts?Any ideas? Are you fighting them? Trying to stop them? Or you just donâ€™t care anymore? Iâ€™m still fighting with those thoughts but itâ€™s getting harder. Christmas time and all those Xmas songs &amp; decorations are making me really depressed this year as this time of the year was always super important for me and full of love and this year will be different. But all those christmas things around me are making it worse. How to stop thissss?! Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™ll handle it this year.
