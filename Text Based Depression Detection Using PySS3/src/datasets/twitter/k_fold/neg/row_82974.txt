too late to turn backmidterms just passed and im failing every class. i donâ€™t have the will to leave my bed and my family just calls me worthless and lazy. im supposed to graduate this year but its gonna be nearly impossible to bring my grades back up. my family wouldnâ€™t really even notice. i have no friends in school anymore either. they all do in school while i do online. iâ€™ve lost passion in things i used to love. like basketball and video games. a flight to san francisco doesnâ€™t sound too bad. iâ€™ve always wanted to see the golden gate bridge. im sorry i was never good enough.
