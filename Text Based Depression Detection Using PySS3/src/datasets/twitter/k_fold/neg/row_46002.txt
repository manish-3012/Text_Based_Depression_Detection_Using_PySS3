Only Thing Keeping Me Going is Fear I'll Botch It and Make My Life Even WorseI have chronic suicidal thoughts.  By that I mean every setback just triggers those thoughts of "Huh, well you could always just kill yourself," and as my life goes on, that option is seeming *really* good.  Like not gonna lie, if I could guarantee that an Ambien Margarita would do the trick, then I'd be all over it like yesterday.  But life's not fair.  I'd somehow manage to fuck it up and be worse off than I am right now, because fun fact: While Life never gets better, it can always get worse.  *Always.*

It's kinda funny when you think about it though.

Life shits on you repeatedly, day in, day out, and the moment you finally decide to take the Express Route, it'll just shit on you even more.  It's kind of funny in an Absurdist sort of way.  You're stuck playing this fucked up game and if you decide to cash out, well you better hope you're lucky, or else now you get to keep playing with a fun, new Life-Long Penalty attached!  You know, because it wasn't already driving you to suicide in the first place.

Life really is the a cruel joke.
