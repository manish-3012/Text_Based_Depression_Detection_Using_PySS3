Why is it so hard to kill myself?Everytime I'm at the edge of killing myself I back out because I'm too afraid even though I really really want to. The worst thing about it is that my life isn't that bad. I was just doing so well until I fucked up big time on my dream I never will live up to unfortunately. Its torture to see myself go down but I don't have anything to live for anymore.

 I want to just jump off a building but I'm afraid of heights so what if it's not high enough? Any other ways seem painful and I'm too much of a coward to do it.
