Sharing some thoughtsWhat are your thoughts on euthanasia?

This is not a cry for help or anything like that as i know i â€œhaveâ€ to keep carrying this burden for my family &amp; friends, its just something Iâ€™ve been thinking about and would like to hear thoughts on this. Mods can delete if this kind of post is not allowed.

I was thinking about it and couldnâ€™t come up with a reason I deemed as good enough as to why euthanasia isnâ€™t readily and easily accessible. 

I agree a lot of people who are suicidal might not really want to die but live in better circumstances but how about those that really want to die and have no desire to keep doing this. Thereâ€™s freedom of speech and all so why cant people chose when and how to die. Its way better than dying of natural causes or an accident in my opinion. 

Maybe my views are too dark but Iâ€™ve never seen death as a bad thing, ever since i was young, never cried at funerals because the way i see it they get to escape earlier. Ive always seen death as the best possible escape to life. Iâ€™ve fantasized about sleeping and never waking up countless times.

We are all going to die eventually, knowing that fact I think its best to allow people who donâ€™t really want to continue to live an opportunity to die that way there will be less miserable people on earth and only those who are genuinely passionate about living can remain. 

Iâ€™m sorry if this offends anyone but this is truly how i view life, Iâ€™m getting to where i consider it a waste of time (adopting makes more sense to me as i personally think its extremely selfish for me to procreate) This is a reason Iâ€™ll never have kids because i feel im forcing people into existence which is something I secretly resent my parents for. Thanks for reading.
