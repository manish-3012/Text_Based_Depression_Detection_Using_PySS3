Goodbye everyone and thanks for everythingSeeing all you people being supportive and attempting to help other people was a blessing for me to witness. You all seem so kind and it really helped me. But i finally decided that I have to go. The problem is me and as long as Iâ€™m still alive Iâ€™ll cause despair to everyone Iâ€™ve thought about it very carefully and I considered all the options. Once again thank you and goodbye â˜ºï¸.
