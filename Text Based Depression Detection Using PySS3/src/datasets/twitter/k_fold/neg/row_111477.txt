sleeping pills and alcohol by accident please helpok so I was just chillin and drank 2 beers over the course of about an hour, then since I have insomnia decided to take sleeping pills (some CVS off brand Tylenol PM kind). I realized afterwards how stupid this was. it was a total accident, I'm not suicidal AT ALL, and now im really scared. is this enough to do any damage or be lethal?? I know its a bad combo but just how much is necessary. please im really scared to go to sleep. I wasn't drunk when I took them btw.
