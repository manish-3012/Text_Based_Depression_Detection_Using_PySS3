I'm broken mentally. I've been crying all day in bed. I want to die but before I died, I need talk to someoneI don't know why I'm so broken... I really don't know why I just can live my life peacefully. 
My mental is like waterfall. Few hours ago, I was ok but soon I get depressed and can't stop crying and get worried about things which don't happen yet... andy breathing gets harder. 
I'm 31and I'm still like this. 
It's really hard to go through my day. 
I can't stop selfharm because I think I don't deserve to be here. Why am I like this... 
I want to laugh. I want to eat properly. I want to work enough from home but I can't leave from bed with crying.
