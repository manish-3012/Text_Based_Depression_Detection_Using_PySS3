Broke up with my gf and I have nothing to live for. I can't stop thinking about suicide.My gf and I just broke up the other day and I can't sleep, I can't even eat. My mind is playing tricks on me. All I can envision or dream is her being happy with these other dudes and the visions usually end with me committing suicide. I see no reason to live anymore and I often think about suicide. I can't get it out of my head. I feel worthless. I feel like I can't do anything right. I feel like no one likes me and they all just get along with me out of pity. I can't stand living anymore. I don't know what to do.
