I'm trying to fight it, but when the sun goes down, that's all I really want to do: To die.I've made an honest mistake that led to public humiliation. People are still, consistently, reminding me of my mistake and I feel like this nightmare is never going to end. I think it has led me to the brink of depression and all I want to do is die.
