Iâ€™m a lesbian. But I just moved in with my boyfriend.Ive always made it my priority to put others first. I spent my childhood taking care of my drunk mother, and now the urge to take care of everyone before myself is stuck in my mind. I see the way my boyfriend is hurting and mourning over the fact that iâ€™m gay. He says he feels like a placeholder. But the reality is I am terrified to be without him, and iâ€™m terrified of not being around to take care of him. Especially when iâ€™m the one who hurt him. I feel like theres no solution, especially just having uprooted his whole life to move in together across the country. Its like im too selfish and in denial of that fact, that I just hurt everyone I meet without even thinking. My whole life has been suffering, without one single break. I feel evil and sick and so tired. I feel so much guilt that its hard to breathe. I feel like some parasite that doesnt belong here. Iâ€™m just trying to be good but I cant and I dont even have the energy to keep trying.
