I feel I shouldnâ€™t be living if Iâ€™m only looking forward to two days a weekEvery Wednesday I have hockey practice and once a weekend I have a game. I have a couple â€œfriendsâ€ at school but we have almost nothing in common and we just sit on our phones instead. I have friends at hockey but if Iâ€™m only looking forward to two days in a seven day week why should I live? Shouldnâ€™t I be looking forward to every new day? 

I have a bad history at school as I havenâ€™t had real school friends since 3 years ago. I was bullied at my old school because I thought that it might be funny to carry around my dads trump hat. My very liberal school thought otherwise and outcasted me to the point where I attempted suicide and went to a clinic for it. It worked for a while but my thoughts are coming back. 

Yeah I have a few hockey friends but they have each other so they wouldnâ€™t miss me for long. Example of people not caring: a kid my age committed suicide a few weeks ago and he got a few â€œweâ€™ll miss youâ€ posts and a post from his funeral but people got over it pretty quick. I donâ€™t see why Iâ€™d be any different. My parents barely care and always think Iâ€™m faking it because the suicide clinic apparently cured everything for good. I stayed home from school today crying and sleeping for hours after this realization and am now in a probation like standing with my school.  I donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s any way I can be more optimistic. Iâ€™m tired of counting down to every hockey day. I want to enjoy every day.
