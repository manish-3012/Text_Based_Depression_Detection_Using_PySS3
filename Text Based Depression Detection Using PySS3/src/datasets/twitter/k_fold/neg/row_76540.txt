Will I ever get over this?The countless nights of listening to sad, depressing tones and styles of music that leave me wishing I was born just over a thousand years ago. I'ts obviously 2019 now, but for the past four or five years, I've had suicidal thoughts nearly everyday because I was born in this time period, not then. How strange and stupid is that. I'd rather spend my life lying in bed with my eyes shut daydreaming of a life probably sometime around the Viking Age than live. Ever heard of a stupid reason like this before? Not betting on making it past January
