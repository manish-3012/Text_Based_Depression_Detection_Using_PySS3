"I'm so very tired, please just sing me to sleep, sing to me... deep inside of my heart I really want to go." I don't know what to do.Morrissey couldn't of put it better. I'm just so tired of my monotonous life, I've finished school just about to start sixth form &amp; I feel like I'm going mad, it feels like I've been having some sort of suicidal thought whether it's momentary or not every other day for the past month. 

I really hate my school &amp; am partly glad to be leaving but I just can't bring myself to start again &amp; reinvent myself for the next 2 years. I've got my school leavers dance in two weeks time &amp; I'm fucking petrified. There's a girl in my year whom I have a massive crush on, there's just something about her we'll call her "Jane", However when I bucked up the courage to ask Jane to prom she told people that she had no intention of going with me, yes I was angry in the way she went about it but I still ***really*** like her. 

There's another girl who we'll call "Sarah", we met online a few months back &amp; she's the same age, we get on really well, she's really attractive (she's got such pretty eyes) but she lives quite a few hours away from me. I don't know what to do, I don't really want another long distance relationship, my previous relationship was long distance &amp; that was a disaster.

I'm nervous about telling Jane how I really feel in case it goes in one ear &amp; out the other, like the old saying goes *"When you die your regret the things you  didn't than the things you did"*. I'm scared that within the next few days if not weeks I'll attempt suicide because I can't cope with the changes that are taking place around me. I don't know what to do.

*"I'm so very tired, please just sing me to sleep, sing to me... deep inside of my heart I really want to go."*
