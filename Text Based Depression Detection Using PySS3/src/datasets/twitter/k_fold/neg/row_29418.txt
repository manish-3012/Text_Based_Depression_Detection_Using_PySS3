I want everything to endIâ€™m tired of people always trying to talkto me to make me â€œfeel betterâ€ and I always wind up feeling shittier than before Iâ€™m in class right now trying not to cry because I canâ€™t stand living ever since I was in 8th grade Iâ€™m almost 18 now and Iâ€™m tired of people telling me itâ€™ll get better (when it clearly hasnâ€™t) or to find things that make me happy when literally nothing makes me happy anymore I hate myself so much and I feel bad to say this but I envy people who actually have courage to kill themselves
