My only thoughts these days are 'kill yourself'I'm just so over being alive. I've done everything to convince myself that life is worth living, but every single reason I find not to do it I literally don't give a shit about. I don't even care that I would upset people, or that my animals wouldn't understand. What's the fucking point?
