Fuck meSo, it's 4:45 am and I've been unable to sleep for the past few days because I want to slit my fucking throat. And it makes me sad that would think something like that. I tear up then I think about it again and it just is comforting. You know? Like I'm kind of like a big let down. And my future isn't stable. I don't want to be working a minimum wage job the rest of my life going pay check to pay check. I grew up that way and it isn't fun. There is just too much uncertainty and shakiness in my own future, and I like to be certain and know what is going to happen. Which is why I really like the idea of dying. It's certain. I know that I will be no more and fall into an eternal sleep. Fuck that's kinda sad ain't it? Shit. Lay my body to rest. Stop being a burden. Stop crying about these things. It can all end. With peace. And rest.
