I can't do it anymoreI forgot to take my medication today because I couldn't remember if I did it or not. Now I can't sleep because one of the meds put me to sleep and the other contained my paranoia more than I knew. I forgot how I was before the medicine and now I remember. I've been staring at my fucking door for an hour and a half because if I turn my back to my room something will kill me. The light is still on because the dark scared me even more. I forgot how terrible it felt to not be able to sleep because once I pull the covers over my head shit will appear behind me and fucking kill me. I want to end my fucked up life.
