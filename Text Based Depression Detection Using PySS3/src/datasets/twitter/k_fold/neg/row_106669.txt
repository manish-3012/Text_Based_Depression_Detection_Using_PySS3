Waking up cryingAs soon as I wake up I feel so miserable. I hate going through everyday. I hate going to work, I donâ€™t care about money, I have no relationships with anyone. As soon as I leave work I come home alone and I canâ€™t stop thinking until finally I pass out and then wake up and I keep doing this cycle for so long
I just want it all to end. I havenâ€™t been happy in my life and I see no escape
