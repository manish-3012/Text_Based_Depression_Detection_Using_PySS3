needed to put this somewhere.the only people in my life that know about my depression and suicidal thoughts and actions etc are my parents because they â€œsaved meâ€ when i had a plastic bag tied over my head. my therapist for obvious reasons and my friends by accident when i was drunk and had a fuckin breakdown. i donâ€™t talk about it with them ever. because i know they donâ€™t understand and i know it makes them uncomfortable and all they can say is sorry and i donâ€™t want there fucjing pity. the only thing thatâ€™s made it so iâ€™m still living is drinking. it holds me together. iâ€™ve been like this since i watched my older sister pass away in front of me when i was 13.(iâ€™m 17 now). and all i hear is we care about u we care about u blah blah bullshit. but that shit doesnâ€™t mean fuckin dick because i can tell they just say tht because if they donâ€™t say it they seem like a heartless asshole. i fucking hate feeling and knowing all of this. waking up every morning asking urself why ur even here. like what the fuck are u doing for anyone. (this is to me not to anyone reading this sorry)
