Friend ThreadSo many people here are lonely and want just a friend. Why is there no thread for that ? Would help a lot of people. Maybe they can meet up in person if they are near to each other and have a chat. Or maybe I am just too "blue eyed" and it's a opportunity for bad-minded people, don't know but maybe it's worth a try
