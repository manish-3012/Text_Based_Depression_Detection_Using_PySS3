TIE THE NOOSEWhen people ask what is the meaning of their life it's because they have one, but stil don't find it.

When I think about the purpose of my existence, I only found the lack of itself. I'm not trying to find money, possessions, luxury, expesive things, nor status; the only thing I try to find is a meaning. But I found out I'm just a useless number.

I only ever cared about the truth, the balance, the understanding, being balanced. But I failed, I failed miserably, while the rest of the ones around me did not, they failed but raised or found another way to keep their living pulse going.

I'm such a fucking loser, such a fucking idiot, such a fucking stupid. The only reason I would kill myself is because of how much disgusting I'm to myself, I can't tolerate such a stupid creature like myself will ever life. Among my surrouding people, which includes my own self, the only one who deserves being murdered is yes, me, fucking disgusting piece of shit.

I still can't understand how people would ever love me. STOP LOVING ME, YOU'RE THE ONLY REASON I KEEP LIVING FOR. I WANT YOU ALL TO SEE THE DISGUSTING PIECE OF SHIT I AM. OPEN YOUR EYES, AND YOU'LL HATE ME ALMOST AS MUCH AS I HATE MYSELF.
