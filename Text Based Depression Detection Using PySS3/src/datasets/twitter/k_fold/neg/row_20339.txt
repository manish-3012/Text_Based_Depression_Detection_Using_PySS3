It's getting increasingly hard to keep from offing myself.Divorced, living alone, few friends that I rarely see, I get no enjoyment from anything anymore. I'm just drifting through the days. Drinking way too much, if i don't actively kill myself the booze will probably end up doing it.

What the fuck? Why?
