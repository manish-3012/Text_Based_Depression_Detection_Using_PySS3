UglyIt's not hard to say that I'm hyper focused on my appearance. Every few months or so I go through a phase where I scour the internet, desperately trying to find anything scrap of evidence that tells me I'm attractive, and every time I come up empty handed. It's like I just can't accept the truth that I'm ugly, despite everyone and everything screaming at me that I am.

It's shallow and pathetic, but part of me wants nothing more than to be someone attractive, someone people lust after and seek the company of. I don't want to be this sad schlubby mess anymore, I just want to be pretty. 

I think I'm truly starting to realize that I've got no hope, I'm a disgusting troglodyte with a face not even my mother could love. I'm thinking it's time to kill myself, it's irrational, I know, but I don't want to live like this anymore. I'm done.
