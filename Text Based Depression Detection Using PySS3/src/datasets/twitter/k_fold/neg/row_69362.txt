I NEED HELP I'm almost brokenokay I'm bad at asking for help but I'm 18 and on the outside everything looks fine I've got a amazing girlfriend and some good friends but i feel cold and alone inside I feel like i'm dying inside 

And every day gets me just a little closer. I was bullied through high school mostly because well i don't know I'm overweight always have been and i have heart problems (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and I'll never get to live a life that doesn't involve surgeries or pacemakers or medication. I just feel like nothing makes me happy i think back to the negatives all the time and i can't help it.

I think back to school and everyone in my class at the time calling me fat saying i was useless and then walking all over me for the sake of them passing intermediate english I have no real great qualifications my mum passed away when i was 15 

I just feel cold inside all the time the moments of joy seem to be very few and far between i sometimes wonder if i died today would anyone come to my funeral or who would miss me 

I have insomnia so i don't sleep well I have body image issues i hate how i look i hate the scar on my chest i hate that despite having a girlfriend who cares about me i constantly feel she could be doing better than me 

I also have anxiety and deep trust issues due to my ex girlfriends family kicking me out on the streets a year ago and thats roughly when i started to feel anxious and started feeling depressed 

I almost feel wrong for feeling how I'm feeling because i can typically afford to do what i want and buy all the video games i want but it doesn't make me happy and i fear nothing will I've actually been considering suicide because i can't see it getting any better I suppose i just need someone to say something to me to help because i have 2 mindsets right now and I'm scared about these thoughts
