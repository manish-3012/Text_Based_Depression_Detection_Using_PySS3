I need an answer, a perspective on how you feel.I feel damn awful, damn shitty as a human being. 

Why can someone treat someone so nice but the person donâ€™t deserve it. But to those who deserve all our love and care, we didnâ€™t treat them the way?!? 

My grandmother just admitted to hospital today &amp; she is in great pain :( she fell down an escalator &amp; have to stitched up her head. There might be blood clot in her head, still must be under observation. 

All along for my fucking 20 years, I didnâ€™t treat her well enough. Honestly, a bad grandson. Only know how to cherish her when sheâ€™s going through so much pain.

Why does all the bad things happen to those good people?!? Like wtf, some people deserve this, but definitely not my Grandmother. Is so fucking unfair. 

I hate myself for treating the girl I love so nice that Iâ€™m willingly to scarified so much for her but I didnâ€™t scarified so much for my Grandmother even though she did so much for me. I donâ€™t get why I canâ€™t treat her as nice as I treat the girl I love. 

I just wish my Grandmother will get well soon :(
