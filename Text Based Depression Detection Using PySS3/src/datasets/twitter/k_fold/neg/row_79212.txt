I don't stay alive for myself.As the title says, I don't stay alive for myself. I stay alive, because if I died, a lot of people would be upset. Especially the people I love.


I've gone through a lot. I've been abused, I've been raped, molested, slapped, pushed, and told horrible horrible things my entire life. Every day I think of suicide, and every day I feel like I'm going to do it. I don't, but I get close sometimes.


I take medication, but I can't be in therapy due to costs. I was for a while and it helped, but now I'm just worse.


It's gotten to the point now to where I feel empty, and alone. My parents abuse me, my boyfriend is slowly distancing himself from me and I basically push him away, and all my friends have either left, or don't really like me venting to them.


I don't really want to do anything for myself anymore. I don't care if I'm always this way, and if I never get better.


If that means people will be happy, then I'll do it. I don't care about myself anymore, it's all for others.
