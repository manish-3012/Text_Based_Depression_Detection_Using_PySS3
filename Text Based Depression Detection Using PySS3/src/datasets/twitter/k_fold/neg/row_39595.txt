All of my friends are suicidal, and I feel like a poserRecently I've got a friend group, many of them I don't know so well but I have made some really good friends.Points is all of them(us?) seem to have something in common: a not so healthy life style.

Point is they are all pretty vocal about suicide, I'm not.Most if not all of those who sre have committed self-harm(and were open about showing theyr wounds) and I have not(cause I see no point in it.I don't want pain, I want it to end).

Recently the one who I like the most(who I've also fallen in love with if that matters) attempted suicide.I felt awfull all the time.I feel useless, there is nothing I did about it, and I can't bring myself to so anything even knowing how awfull I am cause of it.

On to me: I don't feel like it's fair for me to be suicidal.I feel like I am just attention seeking and maybe I am.

I don't find pleasure in anything anymore, I've lost interest in everything.Nothing's interesting anymore, I spend my days doing nothing and getting bored.

I can't really express or have strong feelings.I feel like a personified reaction of things that happen around me.I've turned to drugs and alcohol cause of it, thise things make me feel stronger, make me feel a little more alive.

Also I'm pretty sure none of my friends actually like me.
