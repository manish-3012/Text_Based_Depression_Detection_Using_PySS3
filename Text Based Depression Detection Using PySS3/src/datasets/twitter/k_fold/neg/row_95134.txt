My dog saved my lifeAs the title says, everyday I count myself lucky to have my dog in my life. I have great things in my life, family, boyfriend, friends and a home but nothing brings me back to reality as quickly as being with my dog. I have been depressed since I was 14, I am now 22. I donâ€™t know what I would do without her. She is the only thing keeping me from doing something stupid. Dogs are cool
