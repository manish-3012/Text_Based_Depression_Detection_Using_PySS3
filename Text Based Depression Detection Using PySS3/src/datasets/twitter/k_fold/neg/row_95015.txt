Wish I could just end this all. I am tired of living this fake life around fake people, tired of putting my soul into work just so I can earn to live this fake life.I know I am being vague, but I really fed up of living like this. I am tired of even thinking about this,  I just want this to end.

It feels like I have reached my mental limit, earlier I used to vent out my frustrations and feel a bit better. But now I have lost the will and energy to talk about this all, it all looks dreamy to me thinking when this will end. I have no desires anymore. If my problems were somehow to magically disappear I still would not like to live, I want to put a stop. 

But I dont have the energy to do it myself, I wish I die.
