Words to hand on to
Things are rough lately and to be honest, I am struggling a lot. Nothing seems to be working out. I feel like giving up majority of the times now. I would absolutely love if any one could perhaps comment a few things to live for or something that makes you happy...just anything. I need hope now. 
(I am so sorry it got so vent-ish. If this triggers or make anyone feel the slightest bit uncomfortable, I will remove it.)
