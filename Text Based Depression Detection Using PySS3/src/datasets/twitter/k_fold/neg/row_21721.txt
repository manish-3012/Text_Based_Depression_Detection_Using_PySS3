I kind of wish other people would (willingly) join me so I had the courage.I really need the courage to go through with this. I've tried to get better but it never lasts. It seems to be the same for many here. All I want is a relationship even for a bit. But at my age that chance is long gone so won't even leave many people behind. A lot of our stories seem pretty much the same and it's clear to me that some of us are not meant to live.
