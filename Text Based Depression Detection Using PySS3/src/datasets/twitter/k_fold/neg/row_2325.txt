5 hours (i hope)Im and indecisive bastard. First it was 25 jan then 1 feb, now its tonight. i made the decision last night, i cant feel much anymore, most of my emotion has been fucked. theres a building near my house which was under construction but hasnt been for i think 10 or 12 years i dont remember. it doesnt matter, im a piece of shit, but it doesnt matter, not anymore. ill jump from the building after tightening a piece of cloth around my neck. i told a "friend" in chat but he said i was joking. i used to do this a lot, say that i was going to die. ive never really had any friends. im 15 and an only child. ive been like this for as long as i can remember. i have a smile painted on my face all day i want to cry but i cant not anymore. i dont know who i am anymore, i dont care either. im sorry im so sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry im so sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry 

I'M SORRY
