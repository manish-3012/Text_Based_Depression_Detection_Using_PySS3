Life isn't interestingI'm coming to terms with an issue I've been having for a while, I have no interest in living. A bit of medical history, I'm diagnosed with ASD, relapsing-remitting MS, severe depression, and moderate social anxiety disorder. I'm a university student who just finished their 2nd year studying computer science, I have a summer job doing IT for a not-for-profit company and I do socialise with friends often (once to twice a week). People say my life is great and I'm doing so well for myself but that feels very far from the truth. 
Truth be told I don't know why I bother getting out of bed every morning, I find life extremely boring and unfulfilling. Any happiness I get lasts for that moment and then it's gone, never staying with me. Life feels like a slog and I'm merely existing not moving forward. 
I've been debating just ending my life as nothing I do can achieve happiness. Why bother continuing a painful existence instead of just ending it?
