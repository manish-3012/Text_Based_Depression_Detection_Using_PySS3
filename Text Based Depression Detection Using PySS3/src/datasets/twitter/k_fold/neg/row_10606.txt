Everything is all fucked upI have no idea where to start. I'm in high school, and I love my family. I fucked up really badly around a week ago, I took three tabs of something that was supposed to be LSD but it ended up almost killing me. I was at my friend's house at the time. I started seizing while I was there, and I stopped breathing in the ambulance so they put me on the ventilator for two days. I came out of the coma and was pretty much immediately put into a rehab facility. Rehab facility locally fucked up and didn't realize I was in high school, they weren't meant to accommodate for that. Now I'm facing thirty days in a facility three hours away and I have no fucking clue how to deal with this. I've fucked over so many good people and I want to make things right but I'm being forced to leave Monday for this goddamn facility. I kind of want to blow my brains out so any help would be appreciated, thanks.
