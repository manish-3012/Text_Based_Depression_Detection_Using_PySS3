I have been told that everything I ever thought and fought for is wrong.I have been told that I have no right to be upset and show anger when I feel I have been hurt. That I should realize that there are people who have it worse and that I should not get upset at
someone, because they are having problems also. Basically I should suck it up and accept whatever happens to me because that is life.

This was the advice I was offered, and it is the last straw.
