TELL ME HOW TO KILL MYSELFI WANT TO KILL MYSELFï¼Œ
BUT I AM AFRAID. 

BECAUSE : I CANNOT ESCAPE FROM MYSELF.

I WANT TO STOP MY FEELINGS. I DONT WANT TO FEEL. ANYTHING. BUT I WILL NEVER ACHIEVE THAT BECAUSE... I AM HUMAN. I WILL FEEL. 

I dont want to feel the pain i have.
I FEEL GUILTY. I HAVE BEEN A VERY BAD SON.. SURE I DID NOT MURDER ANYONEï¼ŒBUT APART FROM THAT I AM THE SHITTIEST PERSON IN THIS WORLD. 

I HAVE BEEN UNGRATEFUL.
I have treated my parents very badlyï¼Œ
i will leave next week move to live alone. I feel so guiltyï¼Œaloneï¼ŒI will never get over this feeling. 

I HAVE USED EXERCISE TO ESCAPE MY FEELINGSï¼ŒI HAVE LEARNT THE HARD WAY THAT MY BODY IS NOT UMBREAKABLE.

I HAVE PUT ON MYSELF... UMBEARABLE RESTRICTION ON EXERCISEï¼ŒUMBEARABLE FOOD IN MYSELF. I FORCE MYSELF TO EAT DESPITE FEELING GUILTY EVERY TIME I EAT IF I CANNOT BURN OFF THE CALORIES.

I CANNOT SIT ALONEï¼ŒI CANNOT SIT IN THE HOUSE I NEED TO BE IN THE GYM. LIBRARY. 

THE THOUHHT THAT I WILL GO LIVE THERE ALONE IN MY OWN APARTMENT KILLS ME. 

- YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HELP ME TO DIEï¼Œ
BUT I WANT TO DIE. 

ITS JUST ONE MOMENT OF PAINï¼ŒTHAT IS NOTHING COMPARED TO A WHOLE LIFE OF PAIN. 

I WILL USE MY BODY UNTIL IT GIVES ME EXERCISE. WHEN MY BODY CANNOT SERVE ANYMORE FOR MY MENTAL HEALTHï¼ŒI WILL KILL IT. I WILL STARVE IT. I WANT TO CONTROL THE ONLY THING I CAN CONTROL IN MY LIFE: NOT EATING. 

I WANT TO DISAPPEAR. EXERCISE IS THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES ME ESCAPE FROM MYSELF. BUT THE FEELING OF RUNNING IS TEMPORARY. IT WILL GO AWAY. 

I WANT TO BURN EVERY CALORIE I EAT. BECAUSE IT MAKES ME FEEL IN CONTROL. I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO EAT 4 MEALS A DAY RECENTLY TO COMPENSATE FOR MY EXERCISE. I FEEL SO GUILTY. I WANT TO RELAPSE INTO MY OLD SELF. I WANT TO BE DEAD THIN. ONLY MY DESIRE TO RUN IS GREATER THAN MY DESIRE TO BE THIN. THAT KEEPS ME EATING EVERY DAY. IT KEEPS ME EATING . BUT DEEP INSIDE. I WANT TO EXERCISE TO DEATH. I DONT WANT TO EAT . THATS WHAT I WANT. IT MAKES ME FEEL SO POWERFUL. 

IN THE PASTï¼ŒI GOT SO UNDERWEIGHT THAT I COULD NOT RUN ANYMORE. 
EVERY ONE TOLD ME THAT I WAS TOO THIN. I STILL CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY. I WAS 48 KG. That is fat for me. THATS NOT TOO THINï¼NOW I AM 52. I HATE IT. I HATE TO SEE MYSELF HEALTHY. IT DOES NOT GIVE ME THE SATISFACTION. THE SENSE OF CONTROL I HAD. 

I AM ALONE. I WANT TO DIE
