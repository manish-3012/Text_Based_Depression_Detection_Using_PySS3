Is there any combination of things I could take and before bed and feel pretty normal but just never wake up??I've been thinking about suicide every minute of everyday for about 4 year now hell I'm not even that depressed anymore as I've come to terms with the fact that I do t belong here this world just isn't for me, however all the suicide options available to me are so messy I don't know if I could go though with one, I really want to take something and just not wake up.
