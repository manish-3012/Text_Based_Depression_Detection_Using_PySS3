I need help and Iâ€™m too afraid to get help.
Iâ€™ve been suicidal my whole life. Iâ€™m also in the army but getting medically separated in 2ish months. I will be getting disability for the rest of my life and the majority of it comes from depression/anxiety/insomnia/paranoia. A year ago I voluntarily submitted myself to the psychiatric ward on post over the weekend because I was afraid I was going to hurt myself. I was ostracized from my unit and made to feel like a complete shitbag, while also destroying my army career and potentially my future in the intelligence field as Iâ€™m still waiting to see if I lost my clearance for going to get help. I was ostracized even further for avoiding everything and every one. My supervisor told me that Iâ€™m not a part of the unit because I donâ€™t talk to anyone or am motivated to be a part of the team but also told me he doesnâ€™t care about me or what happens to me. My commander called me a risk to national security. Iâ€™ve literally never done anything wrong during my time here, have been as helpful and positive as I possibly can be and all that happens is I get shit on. Im just so numb to everything to the point where I canâ€™t even cry anymore. As I said earlier, Iâ€™ve always been suicidal but Iâ€™m at the point now where itâ€™s getting bad enough where Iâ€™m contemplating hurting myself. Iâ€™m scared but Iâ€™m afraid of the consequences of what will happen for getting help again. I donâ€™t talk to anybody here anymore, even the people I considered myself close to at one point. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because my cat and bunny need me. I wish for a terminal disease everyday.
