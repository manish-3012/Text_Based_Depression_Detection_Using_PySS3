Can't copeMy brother has stage 4 cancer and it's spreading. He's so young (20s) and the battle is taking a toll on him. It's also taking a toll on me mentally and emotionally and has been for the past 2+ years. It's extremely difficult to see him suffer and to hold it together around him. He's always been my best friend, we have an amazing bond, it's like we're the same person. 

I have never imagined a life without him and it's getting increasingly hard to cope. I'm constantly crying, can't focus at work, can't connect with others, can't sleep. I used to see a therapist for some anxiety issues about 7 years ago. I know I should see her again to help me with this now but there is also a large part of me that just doesn't want to get help. What's the point of it? To mask my pain until I die? I really don't see a point of living without him in my life... I mean, how would I be able to enjoy anything ever again? He's the best, kindest, funniest person I know. 

Lately I've been fantasizing about ways to kill myself and they are becoming more and more frequent and tempting. They're usually about overdosing on something. The only thing keeping me here is just trying to support him while he goes through this.
