What is the point man, god damn it.Seriously, what is the point. I am low-key having a panic attack right now (Â´â–½ï½€)

This happens from time to time. Right now I am panicking because I can't see anything I do to be worth anything. It's all pointless.

Even if one day I like, become a famous artist, or whatever, i don't see any point. 

Why shoudn't I kms right now? Anything I accomplish has no value. I don't care ;-; I wanna care, but I can't, it is just pointless.

The only thing I can, maybe, see giving me a reason to live, is if I had people that cared about me, like friends or a gf. But u know, I don't really have those :/ people I know are independent, they don't need me.

Goddamnit man ;-;
