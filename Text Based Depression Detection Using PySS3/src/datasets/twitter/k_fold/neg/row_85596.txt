I've dealt with this feeling for so long I feel that its time to finally give up.I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, there has only been a few periods in my life where I could say I was actually truly happy. Recently I have been feeling worse then I have ever felt before, every second the thought of suicide goes through my mind. I have created a suicide plan and I have formed goodbye letters to everyone that actually meant something to me. Now I am struggling with the action of finally doing it. I don't understand why I feel like this. I hate myself and I probably always will. I have no reason to hate myself, I am friendly, outgoing, etc. But I just do.. I don't have any real friends and the real friends I did have are either moving away to live their lives or they are too busy with work to even talk. I've been having the worst luck for the past 2 weeks and it hasn't stopped. I always try and think positive but I can't do it anymore. I want to be nothing. I want to feel nothing anymore. I'm sick of being hurt by people. All they want to do is get in my fucking pants or something stupid like that. They aren't real friends, they are fucking idiots. I don't even want to leave my house anymore, yet the funny thing is I hate my house, I hate being home. I am trapped here. I had my chance to get away and I couldn't do it. I hate myself. I really do. I just want to feel nothing.
