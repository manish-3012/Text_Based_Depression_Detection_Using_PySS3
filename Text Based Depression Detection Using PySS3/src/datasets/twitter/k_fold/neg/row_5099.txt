So if you were in my shoes, and you know that all you have to do is swallow 20 pills and there's a 99.98% chance that you'll feel AWESOME the first 10 minutes, then drugged and tired for the next half hour or so, then lose consciousness after 1-2 hours, then never regain consciousness.  


If you had that ability -no  noose, no mess, no nothing,  No family discovery - do it in the boondocks and have your phone send an auto text to someone that you are dead and are here or here and they come get your remains and take care of them according to whatever rites for your family wants.
