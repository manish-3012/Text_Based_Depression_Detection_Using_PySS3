I just want somebody tell me this is going to get betterA man broke my heart about 18 months ago. It's complicated, and I can't bear to go into the details, but the important bit is that I just can't get over the hurt it's caused me. Every time I start to put my life back together, it's like it falls apart all over again, and it's just gets worse and worse.

My friends and family have no idea that I'm still going through this (in fact, most of them have no idea it happened at all), and I'm too ashamed to admit it to anyone now. I've been in tears again most of today, and I just don't know how much longer I can deal with this.

[Edit] Thanks for the responses, everybody. I'm very up and down just now, and yesterday was hard. One day at a time, I guess.
