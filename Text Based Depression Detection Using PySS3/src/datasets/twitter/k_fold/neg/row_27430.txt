today i learned how to tie a hangmans noose.every day i become more and more depressed. i slit my arm again for the first time in about 7 months. every time i think something goods happening something happens and i just end up becoming much worse than i was before because i got my hopes up. everything hurts so much. no one really cares. i am alone.
