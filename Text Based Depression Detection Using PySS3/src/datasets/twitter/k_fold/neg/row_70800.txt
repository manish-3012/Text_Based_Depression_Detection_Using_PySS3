Really wanna give up just scared to.It's so hard to keep going. The only reason I don't is because I don't wanna survive by accident and be locked up in a mental hospital..... Then I'd have to pretend to be better to try again. Another reason is that I partially fear what comes next. I'm not a believer in God's or after life I've always been an atheist but, what if their right.

I don't really care about hurting anyone with my death mainly because I'm gonna be dead so who cares also, it's not like I'm gonna be missed. 

19 yrs old, never been in a relationship or really cared about anyone and, worst of all I'm a high school dropout from my senior year. I've got most of my credits just like a couple left. I just lost all will to finish. I don't know, I've always tried my best to be a normal person, never been in jail or done any crime for that matter. Not even smoked weed even though it seems like every one is.

A psychiatrist? I don't trust anyone with my family past, and really opening up is what helps but, if I can't why do it? Just be a waste of money and I don't wanna cause anymore weight on my mother. She already doesn't like me as much as it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know why, I would've thought she would at least treat me like the rest of my siblings because I've been though most of our struggle with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Gonna go back a little bit to explain. My father was always very controlling. When he didn't get his way he would get really angry, he mostly take it out on my mother. He always stole my mother's pills for her back pain and, these pills were high end stuff. I'm telling you this stuff could put down a horse (A little over exaggeration). So her doc's would only give her a little bit a month. When she tried to stop him, he would just take them forcefully. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I got older and was able to stand up to him, (mind you he was no little guy) there was finally a little balance in the family. We couldn't just leave him cause he made the money, so that means I had to keep him in check when they would argue or he doesn't get his way. I Had to fight my father and that doesn't really do well mentally for a teen needing a figure. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only time he really sent me over the edge was when he destroyed my laptop. My laptop was the only thing that brought me happiness. I watched anime, and gamed on it. So when he destroyed it i fought him and lost. Looking back i wish I was thinking during the fight, I was just blindly throwing fists and wasn't doing so well.

&amp;#x200B;

I never forgave him for breaking my only happiness, I couldn't just go get another one we weren't rolling in money so I took care of my laptop like I did with any gift i got from my mother. 

&amp;#x200B;

My childhood was always stressful and, eventually I didn't even care to make friends since we were always moving. My siblings originally thought I was the bad guy because I fought our dad. They only recently realized the truth. So even my brothers and sister weren't my friends. It was hard growing up being the bad guy.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually my mother became able to support us on her own so we left him almost a year ago, I also had to convince her to leave him because she.....I can only describe it as Stockholm syndrome. Except he wasn't actually a good guy like in movies.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now even with him out of the picture I'm still under fire. I think my mother blames me for their breakup and I'm treated differently from my siblings. I'm always the reason for anything that goes wrong now. Kinda scared that my mother will go back to him because she wants to.....and waste all my struggling for a life away from him.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really to the point that when I see a cliff it's almost to tempting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that you're caught up. Any thoughts? Questions?
