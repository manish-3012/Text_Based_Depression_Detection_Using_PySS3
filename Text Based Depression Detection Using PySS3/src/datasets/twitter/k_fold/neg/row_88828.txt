There is no point to itI'm so fed up of living like this. My mind is foggy right now and it has been like this for 2 days. I can't even think straight. Nobody in my family gives a sh!t about it, they give a sh!t about my life  but they don't really care what I do as long as I'm alive even if that means living behind closed door for rest of my life but they're frustrated with this and I can feel it when I talk to them but it could be just my reality. 

I didn't make the rules in this society, why should I follow something I didn't create and why should my own family get upset when I don't follow through them?

Why am I cursed with this?

I've been having suicidal thoughts every week for past 4 years, only reason I have not acted upon it is because I'm afraid that I'll fail and wake up in hospital surrounded by loved ones. I wouldn't be able to face them if I fail and they find out.

This is crazy.
