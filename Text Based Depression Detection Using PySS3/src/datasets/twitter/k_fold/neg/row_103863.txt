Iâ€™m done...I give upI canâ€™t take anymore...Iâ€™m done, Iâ€™m just...done, done with everything, Iâ€™m especially done with love...everyone is fake, everyone likes to pretend they care then theyâ€™ll either betray me or abandon me I have absolutely no one now, my ex girlfriend has moved on with someone else, I lost all my friends, my family are barley even aware of my existence and my life keeps going downhill...things do not get better things has only gotten worse for me....I honestly doubt anyone will read this at this point but Iâ€™m done, Iâ€™m 20 years old and all my 20 years Iâ€™ve only gone through hell and Iâ€™ve only been toxic I guess Iâ€™m just doomed...Iâ€™m done, I give up I canâ€™t take anymore itâ€™s time for me to go...to think all this effort I put into my life...only for it to end like this...just how cruel it really is huh...well I guess this is it for me...this will be the last post Iâ€™m probly gonna make before everything ends for me...Iâ€™m gonna attempt to suicide next morning...goodbye...goodbye everyone
