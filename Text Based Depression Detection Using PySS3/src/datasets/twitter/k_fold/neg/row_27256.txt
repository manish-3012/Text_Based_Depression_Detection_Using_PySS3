I want to die but I can'tI have a two year old I can't abandon. It hurts. My husband fights with me and calls me a bitch almost every day. I do not have the financial ability to leave and I don't want to leave but I have the feeling he is over our marriage. I work full time at a job I do not like because I have to be able to provide for my child. The only thing that stops me is my son. I love him and I have to be a good mother. I just want to be done with everything.
