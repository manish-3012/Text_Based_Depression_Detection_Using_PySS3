i don't understand why people want to be lovedi wish literally nobody knew me, nobody cared about me. what makes me want to kill myself is simply the fact that people know me and they have expectations towards me. if nobody cared about me i could just live my life however i want and kill myself when i'm sure i don't feel like existing anymore
