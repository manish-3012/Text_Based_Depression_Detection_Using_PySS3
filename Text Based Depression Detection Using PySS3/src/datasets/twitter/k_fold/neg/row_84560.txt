Why should I keep living? Give me one reasonI'm failing in school, I have no career , I don't have any friends, I've never had a girlfriend despite looking above average, I don't have any memories from school because all I did was learn and go back home 0 socialization, I'm incapable of making friends, and I've tried, a lot. Every day that I wake up I realize that I've got to go through the same loop of hell that I've living for the past 21 years of my life.All I ever wanted was to enjoy my youth, I'm not interested in adulthood at all. So now that It's come to an end with only one year left, I don't see any reason why I should keep living.
