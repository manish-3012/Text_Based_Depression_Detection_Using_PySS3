Diagnosed with schizophrenia. I'm 16.      Hey all. As the title suggests, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia a few days ago. I'm only 16. I've lost all of my friends at school, even those who I thought I could trust. My best friend (or so I thought he was my best friend) told the whole school, and now everyone thinks I'm crazy and should be "put away." 

    I'm so scared, alone, and desperate. I'm thinking about killing myself, I don't know what to do or who to go to! 

        Any advice at all would be very kind and appreciated. Thank you.

Edit: Thank you!!! Thank you all for the advice that you've given me today, it really has brightened my day! ðŸ˜Š
