I don't know what to doI have no money, no job, no one will hire me. I'm depending on my wife to take care of me and shit and I can't provide for her in return. I'm in mountains of debt just from trying to keep life okay for a little bit longer. The only time I feel okay is when I'm high.

I want to get help. I want to get better. But everywhere I turn its just people saying the same thing. The world is one big rat race with no end and I'm the weird one for not wanting to run with everyone else. It doesn't make me happy. How am I supposed to feel good about anything when the world's fucking ending? 

I need help. I can't get it. The only help I've ever gotten came after demanding to be taken into the psych ward because I knew if I was alone for a second longer id find some way to kill myself. I can't get help unless I'm trying to die and even then I'm just going to get stopped and then dumped right back into the situation that got me here.

I don't know what to do.
