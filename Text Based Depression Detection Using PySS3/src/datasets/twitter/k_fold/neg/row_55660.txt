I'm broken.There are so many things wrong with me: depression, can't control my emotions, my mother is a fucking idiot. Recently turned 18 and i feel like i'm 10 because of her overprotectiveness. Been seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist for 2+ years, been hospitalized for a couple of weeks. It kinda helps as it is giving me some hope, been losing that hope for past couple of weeks. Every doctor i talked to says my mother is way to fucking overprotective, she doesn't seem to get it, only thing in her mind is getting me a college degree with no care about how i feel. Everything i say is taken as a insult. I feel helpless.
I'm probably not gonna kill myself, at least not before i go to my psychiatrists appointment(next wednesday), posting here because i feel like i'm losing it.
