I find myself planning on killing myself when my money runs outI have a few months worth of rent left in the bank and i just dont want to get another job, they make me so depressed i am already always depressed but the thought of going to another job just makes me want to kill myself

There are so many reasons i want to die already, im 26 years old never been in a relationship, i have no career aspects, i have my first year in plumbing but i hate contruction.

I have a terrible fear of school tests, i have adhd and it just makes studying for anything impossible.

6 months ago or something like that i was diagnosed with Celiac making me not even able to go out for dinner anymore which was one of the only things i enjoyed leaving the house for.

i just want to die plain and simple. i just dont see a reason to keep going, no fun no joy no nothing just misery and shit.
