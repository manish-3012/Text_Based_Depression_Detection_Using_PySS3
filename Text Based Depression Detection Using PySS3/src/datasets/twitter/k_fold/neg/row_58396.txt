ending my lifeIt doesn't get better. Talking to people doesn't really help. Nothing helps my social anxiety or depression. Its been so long and I'm tired of fighting. I am convinced at this point its a brain problem. It just my depressive mentality. or my anxious mindset. I'm so twisted maybe I should kill myself. I'm a burden to people around me because of my mental disorders. I can't progress like normal people. I'm tired therefore I'm killing myself.
