I'll set myself freeHi,

I'm 27 years old, and have as long as I can remember always been disappointed in everything I've done or been part of. School career sucked, career sucked, another university degree I picked up since last few years sucks too actually.

Never experienced real friendship, or experienced how it's like to fall in love with someone where this feeling is actually once not mutually exclusive for the change. Or to put it more abstract, I've never experienced true happiness and satisfaction for as long as I can remember.

So I'm 27, missed out actually most of my youth already, and the future is as dark as the night as far as I can see. And I have accepted it for quite a while but I will not embrace it as my destiny.

My face is covered with tears of joy, I feel actually happy at this single moment because I'll finally be free. Guys, please, enjoy life to the fullest, if there is the slightest opportunity to do so.

I wanted to leave this as a personal note. You don't need to reply on this as I'll be most likely dead at the time you read this. Cheers.
