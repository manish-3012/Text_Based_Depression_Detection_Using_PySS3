I just stopped caring.I've had a couple breakdowns over the last week. Last night, it happened again and I just stopped caring about everything. Everything seems so pointless right now. No matter what I do with my life, it won't have any real effect two or three generations after I'm gone. I probably won't even be able to do what I want in my lifetime because I don't know if I'll be able to afford the education to do it. After 4 years of work at my university, I don't even know if I'll be able to afford to go back for my last year to finish my 2 degrees.

The only thing that's giving me even a little bit of hope right now is my plan to get a pet rat. I'm buying her cage and everything on Friday and then getting her after they get delivered. But even keeping her will depend on me getting a letter signed by my doctor for her to be an emotional support animal. I've been receiving treatment for depression for about a year now so I'm hoping that will be enough but beyond that, I just don't see the point in anything.
