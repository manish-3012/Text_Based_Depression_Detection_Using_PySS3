It will never get better.I'm tired of hearing these words. I've been waiting for years and it's only becoming progressively worse. I now see with clear eyes that I'll never be good at anything. I'll never achieve anything. I'm a waste of time, space and resources. I'll never bring anything valuable to this world. I shouldn't have been born in the first place. Every night I pray that I don't wake up, everytime I cross the street I pray for a car to kill me. I have terrible intrusive thoughts all the time. I can't live with them. I can't do anything right. Maybe I should just listen to them and finally kill myself. It would be better for everyone if I died. The world would be a much better place without me in it. I don't even know why I'm still alive. I don't deserve to live. I'm the worst person in this world. And the worst thing for me is that nobody understands what I feel. I've been trying to get help but nothing works. I'm just so tired. I can't do it anymore.
