I'm done being me and living as me and living this life.I don't wanna be me anymore. My emotions are completly out of control. I have broken many things because of my uncontrolable, destructive anger. I constantly make assumptions about my friends and family, always thinking that I'm a hasle to hang out with or chat with.

I'm so done with the person I am. I don't want to be me anymore. I've been able to tolerate me for a while, many years in fact but I'm done now. I'm sick of me and who I am.
