I'm now planningA lot has happened in these past few days. I said goodbye to a "close" and longtime friend that I was in love with. I've lost every form of contact with them and even though they said I'm always free to talk to them again, I can't. My job makes me feel suffocated. I can't take a breath and just think anymore. I just drag down my family and friends. This year has just reminded me how little I'm connected with people and it's my fault. 

This year - these past 3 years have been hell and they seem to only get worse. I can't seem to find any moment of clarity. I've made a few posts on here prior to this one.

I have an eating disorder. I don't date people, I'm scared of forming relationships with people and I hide my insecurities with painting and jokes.
I am 19, female and I'm planning my suicide. I don't know when. Part of me wants to just get it over with... The other wants to wait.
