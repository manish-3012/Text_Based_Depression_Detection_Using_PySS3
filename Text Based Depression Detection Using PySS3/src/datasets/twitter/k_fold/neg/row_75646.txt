how to move forwardsomeone who was really important to me cut me off. i dont know why because they didnt really explain, so all im left with right now is an even more broken heart and a million unanswered questions and memories that are hard to think about.

we had lots of overlapping friends and still live around the same area. we did a lot of things and went to a lot of places with each other.

i dont know how im supposed to move forward from this. people have been telling me its time again for me to focus on myself but i dont even really know what that means. im so sad. this only happened yesterday but i already know its just another thing to add to my trauma bank of PTSD. 

i just dont see how me dying isnt what would make everything and everyone better.
