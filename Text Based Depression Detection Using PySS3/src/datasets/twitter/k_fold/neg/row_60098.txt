Cripplingly Bipolar and Living a LieHello r/SuicideWatch. It's my first year of community college and it's been almost impossible due to mental illiness.

In the past two weeks:
&gt;I've tried to start a cult
&gt;Spent over 600 dollars on junk
&gt;Started many online businesses ex. Fiverr astrology
&gt;Planned comedy YouTube channels
&gt;Smoked enough weed to lose a couple brain cells
&gt;Accidentally started a coup against my boss
&gt;Started 10 different stories
&gt;Gained a manic need to learn everything about WWII
&gt;Studied up on street drug cartel just in case I want to join one
&gt;Stayed up for days at a time to binge watch shows

Yeah. I know, crazy. But the biggest problem I have is pushing college work out of the way for these shenanigans. I have 3 giant essays due by the 14th, and if I don't get them in on time, I will fail the year.

I've lied to my family and friends saying everything is okay. I've been in the psych system all my life and It's turned to me having to pretend to be okay just to get by. They think I have all my work done, and I'm a perfect student. But it's all wrong. I'm gonna fail soon and I don't know how to cope with this.

I'm so scared. Are there any good people I can pay to help me get my work done? Any forums?
