This is going to sound weird but...Have you ever seen a TV show that so perfectly described what you want in life that you realize reality will never satisfy you? 

I have been binge watching the magicians on Netflix and I realized no matter what I will never be happy. I know it sounds crazy and childish. I have always retreated to day dreams and fantasy just to get by, I would have killed myself long ago if I didn't have the ability to burrow into my imagination to escape a world that I never have nor never will relate to or feel at home in.

I'm sorry for the ramblings but I just had the sudden realization that the world has literally nothing to offer me that I want and it is physically impossible for me to ever find happiness.
