Being alive sucks. Idk why, I just hate it. All the time.On occasion I might enjoy something a little bit. Like playing a videogame or having sex or reading a book. But im never happy. And my comfort/discomfort in life ratio, is so heavy on the discomfort side, I just dont see the point of anything. I love my family and my girlfriend, but at this point, i hate that I have people who love me, because if I didnt, I could end it all. I feel totally imprisoned and love is the prison guard.
