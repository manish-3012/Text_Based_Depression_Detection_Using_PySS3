The pain is perpetual, why cant I find the way to just stop it all?Every day is an uncomfortable cycle of inner anguish. I don't have the nerve to kill myself yet as I believe at heart I am a narcissist who seeks optimism. Family has died, lovers left to travel thousands of miles away. Please convince me to slip into the numbness of death and just kill myself. I do not hate everyone nor the world, but I just dont think this life is right for me. Too much pride to ask for help in real life.
