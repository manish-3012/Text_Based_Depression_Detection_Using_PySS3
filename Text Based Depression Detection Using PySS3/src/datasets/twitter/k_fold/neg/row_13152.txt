Down-swing AheadI've been on an emotional see-saw since me and my ex-girlfriend broke up and can't get in to see any specialists to talk to for ages yet about it.

I've been diagnosed with severe despression before, but don't think I can go through it again.  Basically, after exchanging a few lines about how we have both moved on in the last month, she told me she's seen a couple of people and I feel like I have gaping hole where my body used to be.

Never really posted things in a place like this as I don't want nor like sympathy. But I would like some ideas as to what I can do as an alternative to going to the medicine cupboard and ending it all. Not how I should value my life or how things will get better, I know that but it offers me no comfort at present. Anything I can do from inside the comfort of my bed to at least distract me?
