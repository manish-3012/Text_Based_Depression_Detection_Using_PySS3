I don't drink b/c I'm afraid I will hurt myself (or worse) while drunkI'm in college and my friends would never force me to drink but sometimes they ask if I want a beer and when I say no, sometimes they'll tease me. No big deal, they're just being funny and I don't mind it. But sometimes I just want to tell them/ shout the truth, other than I don't like to drink which is only partly true. I'm terrified that if I get drunk or drink even a little the depression will get even worse and I will hurt myself or worse. I'm terrified of my thoughts and the bad feelings and I'm afraid they'll run rampant if I'm too drunk to "control" them. Idk, I have no one else to tell so posting this kind of gets it off my chest
