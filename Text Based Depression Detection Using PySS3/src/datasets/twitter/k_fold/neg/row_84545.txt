I'm literally on a school trip right now and I want to cry and die and stop existingEveryone seems happy, they are taking photoes, smiling and talking to friends and meanwhile I just WISH, WISH that I could get a gun somehow. I would think how hesitantly I would pull the trigger. 

My fucking life sucks and I hate everyone and every single day I think "Today's the worst day of my life" for 9 fucking months now. God I reallly want to die. I'm so fucking sad and I know for a fact that nothing can help.
