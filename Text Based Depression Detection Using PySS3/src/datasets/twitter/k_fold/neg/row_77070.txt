Nothing has changed in ten yearsWhen I was 11 I self harmed for the first time. I developed depression and debilitating anxiety and my mental health was fucked. Now ten years later Iâ€™m 21, still self harming, depressed and anxious. Nothing has changed.

I feel like everything is weighing down on me, I feel crushed. Thereâ€™s so much negative shit in the world, so much to be sad about and worry about, that itâ€™s hard to see any other way. I canâ€™t reach out to my friends because I donâ€™t want to lose them. I donâ€™t want to be a burden. Iâ€™ve put my parents through so much shit already with my mental health, they have no idea whatâ€™s going on.

I hate myself. I hate the way I am and the way I act. I hate everything about me and itâ€™s hard to leave that mindset. I donâ€™t feel worthy of love.

I just donâ€™t want to exist anymore. I donâ€™t want to have to worry constantly, to be constantly paranoid and anxious and depressed. I donâ€™t want to have to hide my scars and feel ashamed of my existence. Iâ€™m an embarrassment. I feel so fucking alone.

I donâ€™t want to be here. Iâ€™ve been too cowardly to ever attempt but I feel closer to it than ever. I just wanna take my car and drive headfirst into a tree. Just blink out, that sounds perfect.

I donâ€™t know, this is all a load of shite. I just feel incredibly low and Iâ€™m scared.
