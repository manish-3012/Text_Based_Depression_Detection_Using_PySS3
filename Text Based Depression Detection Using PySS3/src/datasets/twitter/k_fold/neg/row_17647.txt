does anyone know somewhere i can get some help online?there aren't many options where i am that aren't prohibitively expensive, but i can buy whatever prescriptions i might need relatively easily. i'm fighting through a lot of things, and going through the process of explaining everything beginning to end over again seems like it'd be too hard to just keep doing over and over again. i never know where to begin and there's too much pressure and stress involved, and it only seems to add to my despair if it doesn't go anywhere. so i wanted to try and invest myself emotionally and mentally in a more cohesive way, that might lead to some progress. i'm at a very crucial point in my career, and i need something like this. i'm not expecting miracles i just think i need someone who isn't reeling or numb to help me sort through things. 

i'm sorry, i'm having a hard time thinking, and i can't see a better solution besides something like this. i wouldn't know where to begin anyway.
