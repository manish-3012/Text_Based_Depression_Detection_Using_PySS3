I don't want to live in this world anymoreThis is a throwaway account.
I recently have been having suicidal feelings. I can't help but feel that all the people in the world are evil in some way and I can never have meaningful relationships. All of my friends I've ever had have either left or betrayed me and I can't get over my distrust of everybody.
I have accepted that I will never be in a romantic/sexual relationship, not because I think I would not be able to have one, but because I've come to the conclusion that every woman would leave me or cheat on me when they find someone better. But my state of being alone isn't why I'm saddened. I'm disturbed by the amount of people who take for granted or betray the people who they claim to love in their life. My idea that all people are evil is reinforced by the fact that people in my life say that I am a good person, but I have some secrets that I feel so guilty about and if they knew they would likely shun me. If I can't be the good that I want to see in the world, how can anybody else? Everybody has secrets and everybody has done bad things, even people we revere like Mother Theresa and Gandhi.
I know intellectually that my views are irrational, but I can't help but think them. As far as I'm concerned, they are the natural state of things. How can I live in a world where all people suffer and all people deserve suffering?
I'll give it some time before I actually attempt, maybe I'll change my mind in the next few days, but the misanthropy will stay, and that's what kills me.
