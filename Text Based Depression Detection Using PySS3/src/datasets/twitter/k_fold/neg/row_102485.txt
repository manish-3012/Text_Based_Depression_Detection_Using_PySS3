Me not wanting to live doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m depressedHere me out, the aspect of life simply does not intrigue me, I look at people and Iâ€™m astonished at how easily they handle this reality. I say I donâ€™t wanna do this anymore and everyone gasps, I must be sick to think this!!! do they not know that the mere aspect of going any further makes me physically weak. 

I donâ€™t deny my environment has greatly contributed to my...lack of enthusiasm. On top of the childhood traumas and emotionally abusive parents/siblings/relatives, my geographical location is especially hard on women and the lgbtq+ community, and anyone who doesnâ€™t agree with their religion or ideas and beliefs. and Iâ€™m all of those things combined. Iâ€™m surrounded by people who would still to this day scream bloody murder if I asked them to take some accountability for the way I turned out, theyâ€™d tell me my pain is not real, and that I should get over the fact that life is 200 times harder for me because of them and their thinking. 


I have no emotional connections to any of my family or friends, I tell people I love them and that Iâ€™ve missed them when in reality I havenâ€™t. when someone hugs me after theyâ€™ve not seen me for a while, all I could think of during the embrace is how to conceal the fact that I donâ€™t give a damn about them, I tell myself hug them tighter or theyâ€™ll know!!! Itâ€™s absolutely pathetic and I donâ€™t wanna go on living like that, pretending to care. 


I simply want to cease to exist because I donâ€™t have love or passion for either myself or anybody else.
