Suicide Hotline made it worse! please I need a friend!!I've tried to kill myself last night. I mixed everything and according to google I took a fatal dose of paracetamol too (plus over 50 other pills). like literally all I had. I woke up over 20 hours later in my own vomit. 

I was too anxious to call but chatted with the hotline. they did nothing than repeat what I wrote and added "you must feel very abandoned/alone/worried with ___*
I felt like I'm chatting with a robot. calling them was useless too. it made me feel worse. I want to talk to someone who knows how it feels. I've tried every medication in the book, been to therapy for over 8 years, I'm almost 30 and there is nothing I haven't tried or haven't done to get better. I don't need breathing techniques and yoga, I need a real person to be there and I have no one.

I have no one to talk to. I dont know what to do. I need help. I don't know what else to do. I need a friend, anyone.
