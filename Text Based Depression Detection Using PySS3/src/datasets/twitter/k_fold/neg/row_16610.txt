Pegged with possession in college and want to kill myself.I'm a college student, and yesterday I was reported to the police on the basis of the smell of marijuana. I have never smoked in my room and I don't know who could have told on me. I was cited by campus police and they reported me to the people on campus that deal with disciplining students.

Regardless of the fact, this has just exacerbated my opinion on life and how it'll make everything harder, and how my parents are going to be pissed off at me, and how my brother is going to get blamed for everything even though he has no part in my, now prior, daily marijuana usage. But they're the only reason I live for, and I don't want to hurt them by my actions.

I wanted to be a doctor, but I guess no more, not with this on my file. I won't be able to get federal student aid for next semester, and probably won't get any more scholarship money. I'll probably need to undergo probation, pay a fine, live with the people that reported me and can't look at in the eye due to shame, and this shit's going to stick with me the rest of my life.

I just don't know what I'm going to do reddit. I feel like my parents will just be disappointed like they've been for a while, and I don't want to disappoint them. This entire thing has just been a steeper downward spiral. I just came back from a counseling session, and it's helped me, but now that I'm just sitting here alone in my dorm, I just keep feeling worse as time keeps going on. I don't feel motivated to do work because what will it be worth in the end? 

I just need something to keep my head occupied, not dwell on this stupid action that might cost me my future.
