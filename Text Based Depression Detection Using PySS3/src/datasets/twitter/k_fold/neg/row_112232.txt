I don't know if I want to dieGod I hate this back and fourth thinking. 

I first posted here a couple weeks ago saying I will be killing myself after I watch Avengers: Endgame. 

Then, I posted saying I have my notes written out. 

Then, I posted after watching Endgame.

Now it's been a couple weeks and I can't fucking do it. I've been gaining a ton of weight from binge eating, I've been self-harming more than I ever have before, and I have no money to support myself anymore; I was let go from my full time job two weeks ago.

All of this just makes me want to *do it*, but I haven't! I'm still here! 

I don't know if I want to follow through with my plan anymore, but where do I go from here? I didn't plan for this, I didn't plan to stay. I put so much time into my death, that now that I'm still alive I have no life. 

I don't know where to go. I've been eating my family's food, taking their wifi, sleeping for most of the day or staying in my room. This all feels so unreal. 

I still have everything to go. I can still kill myself but I don't know anymore.
