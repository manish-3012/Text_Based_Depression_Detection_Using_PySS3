I feel like Iâ€™m just wasting time living.I have nothing going for me in life. Everythingâ€™s gone to hell. Iâ€™m the lowest paid employee at work even though I work the hardest. No one give a fuck about me and it hurts. It doesnâ€™t matter though cause Iâ€™m only 17 and of course â€œitâ€™s gonna get betterâ€.  Fuck that shit. Everyone around me tells me to kill myself and bullyâ€™s me. I have no friends, never had a girlfriend, Iâ€™m unappreciated at work, and no one respects me. Iâ€™m always talked over by other people and no one gives a fuck about what I gotta say. I wish I would just die and it would all be over. Suicide worked out for my father because he doesnâ€™t have to deal with the pain anymore. I just wish I had a gun so I could blow my fucking brains out. Iâ€™ve seen other methods fail too much and then people say they just wanted attention. I just wanna fucking die. Fuck what other people think at this point. People tell me theyâ€™ll miss me but thatâ€™s just so I donâ€™t go through it. Iâ€™m tired of everyoneâ€™s bullshit. Fuck everyone Iâ€™ve ever met. Every single person. If I had a purpose on this world then it wouldnâ€™t have been that big anyways. I wish I wasnâ€™t such a pussy. Then I wouldnâ€™t be scared to slit my throat.
