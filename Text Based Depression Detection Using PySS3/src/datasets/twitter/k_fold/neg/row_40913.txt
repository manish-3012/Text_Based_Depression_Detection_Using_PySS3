Today is my day.Last night my boyfriend started slamming my head into the head board of our bed. And I punched him in the face to get him off of me.. he DOES NOT remember doing that to me all he remembers is I punched him. So now he broke up with me and is throwing me out of our house. I have been throw so damn much throughout my life. From being a mother to my own mother for over a decade, to abuse, and now to loose someone I had a reason to live for. Now I have nothing. I have planned this for a while.. I have everything prepared. I'm just trying to get the courage to do so. I want to apologize to my parents. But my heart has been broken. I have no one to talk to. And I am so alone. Honestly, no one needs me. If it wasn't for the letter I sent no one would even know I'd be gone. I've made peace with myself, and with God. He doesn't really speak to me. However, that's alright. I've made peace with that as well.
