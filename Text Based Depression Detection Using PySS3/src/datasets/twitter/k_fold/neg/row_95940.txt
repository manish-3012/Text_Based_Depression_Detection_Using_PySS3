Just turned 31 and I wish I hadn'tI can't forgive myself for what I did.

It's become my biggest regret in my life and it made me question who I even am.

The regret and pain i caused eats at me every day, and I can't bear it too much longer. 

I want the people who care about me to remember me for me and not this worthless piece of shit i am. Drifting no where in life.
