Just wonderingWanted to know peoples personal stories of loosing someone. Do recent exâ€™s and friends really feel bad when someoneâ€™s gone? From my experience people are sad for maybe a week or so and then they move on and basically forget. Itâ€™s like people pretend to be sad or are sad for a tiny bit of time and then after that their life means nothing. I guess Iâ€™m just having a hard time seeing people actually missing me if Iâ€™m gone.
