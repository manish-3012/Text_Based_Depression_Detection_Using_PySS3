Lost my job and my entire reason to wake up.I went through heavy depression the last year and a half dealing with suicidal thoughts everyday. Every fucking dya i wish the cat that almost hits me would run me off the cliff and id fucking die, or that id take too much medidince or the wrong combo of durgs and never wake up. The only thing that kept me going was my job. I lost that this week. I dont have any motivation left. I have no reason to wake up. People love me and i dont care because i have nothing to love myself. I have nothing to motivate me to keep going. They said theyd continue to be apart of my life and then they betrayed me. My boss i told about my dewpression and suicidal thougghts new my job was my only motivaiton and only thing keeping me from killing myself and acted sympethic in an attempt  to get rid of me. Im drunk sad fucking feel betrayed by the world. I want nothiong more than to not wake up tomorrow if anyone knows how please tell me
