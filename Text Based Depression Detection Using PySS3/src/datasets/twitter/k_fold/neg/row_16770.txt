I decided to live.I was dead set on killing myself. My girlfriend broke up with me a few weeks ago. She was the "one" to me and really she still is. I wanted to kill myself because I felt like I lost everything and I wasn't strong enough to go through this. I have been through traumatic stuff in the past and I figured after I found this woman, I was done with that. People have been trying to talk me out of killing myself but ultimately it came down to my choice. Ultimately I came to a catharsis today while I was taking a shower. I fucked up my relationship. I put all this weight on her that she was my only source of life. And on top of that, I was condescending and a know it all. I felt that because I had been through some shit, I knew all there was to life. But I was being stupid. I pushed her away. I still believe she's the one. The problem is I'm not the one right now. Life is short already so I'm going to chase after exactly what I want. I want to end up with this woman. But before I do that, I need to give my own life purpose by myself. I'm going to go after her again, but way down the line. As long as I'm alive there's a chance I can have the life that I want. But if I kill myself that life will really be gone. This is not going to be easy and I've accepted that. I'm just going to take the challenges as they come and better myself.
