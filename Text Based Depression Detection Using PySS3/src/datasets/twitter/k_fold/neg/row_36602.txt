Iâ€™m killing myself at midnight. Everything is ready.Itâ€™s 6:15pm when Iâ€™m writing this.

Thereâ€™s no complete way to explain why this is my only option. Iâ€™ve tried everything I could to get better, but I just get more and more depressed. When I thought it couldnâ€™t get any worse, it did. Life shit on me and then shit on me again. I have no doubt that so many people have it worse than I do. I know this makes me weak. But it doesnâ€™t make a difference anymore. I canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™ve tried. Iâ€™m so sorry.

If anyone I know reads this, mom, dad, Jake. Itâ€™s not your fault. Thereâ€™s nothing you couldâ€™ve done to stop me or â€œsaveâ€ me. There werenâ€™t any signs that you missed. I was silently suffering. I still am. Itâ€™s my fault, not yours. Please know that this is the only way that I can be happy. I know itâ€™s at your expense and Iâ€™m so sorry. Iâ€™m so sorry for what Iâ€™m doing to you. But I canâ€™t hang on anymore.
