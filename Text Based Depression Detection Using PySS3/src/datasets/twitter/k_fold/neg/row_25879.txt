I don't know what to doI was thinking about and planning to end things until pretty much when, stupidly enough, a new video game came out. The game sucks, and I know it, but I'm trying to force myself to stay interested in some aspects of it because without it I'm back to staring at the wall and thinking about the best way to go about ending it.

I killed my diet and can't find the motivation to get back on it.

I'm constantly buying random shit for some new fleeting "purpose". I'm staring at the purchase screen for $25 of in game content thinking that will somehow keep me from thinking about how empty my life is for a bit longer. It won't, but I want it to.

I don't know. I don't know if I want to die or if I just want to be happy.

I'm not even posting here because I want advice or something, I just don't feel like I can talk to my wife or friends about it, and this is what was on my mind and this seemed like the only place I could say what I'm thinking.

Idk.
