Hope this helpsIf you're feeling hopeless or feel worthless I have a few ways I've gotten past it

1. I live in the country so I have plenty of room for a garden. I highly recommend this. If I feel bad I go and hoe weeds or pick out rocks. I get quite a bit from it and I've been able to sell them at a local farmers market 
2. Obviously a full on garden won't work for everyone. But get a pepper plant or something small and take care of it. I highly recommend a hot pepper plant it takes a lot of care but it can be worth it and it can add some spice into your cooking if your into that
3. Coloring, painting, drawing. I'm am not a good drawer at all but I trace over others to help me learn. Cooking/ baking is also a great way to help express yourself.
4. Get a small pet if you can. Taking care of something else can help you take your mind off of things for a bit
5. Talk to someone. If you don't feel like you can I've found that writing how I feel down and then leaving someplace allows for me to distance myself from it for awhile I think about what to say

I truly hope these help, I've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for about a year now and I've found that these have helped me the most. I'm always here if you need to talk, I will help you
