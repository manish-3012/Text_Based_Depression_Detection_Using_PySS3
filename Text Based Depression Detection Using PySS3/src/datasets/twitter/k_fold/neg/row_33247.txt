I've made a plan to kill myselfLike most of y'all, I'm tired of life and what implies to be alive, my childhood was trash, my mom was a slut and my dad dissapeared, and my stepdad is a drug dealer. I live with my 2 little brothers taking care of them bc now my mother works all day, well I'm 17 and I've always been a sad person, I feel like most of the time I've spent alive were bad or just bored moments. My main goal is to find a job, pay a psychologist and tell him about my depression, when he send me to a psychiatric and he tell me to buy antidepressants and anxiolytics, I'll overdose, that's it. I can't get guns easily in Europe and I'm a fucking pussy to hang myself or to jump off a bridge. I hate myself I hate this world and I find no reasons to live the rest of my life working for a broken system
