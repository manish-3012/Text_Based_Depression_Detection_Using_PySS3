Hello! This is my Thesis Project: Adult Attempted Suicide and How it Affects Quality of Life. I would like to interview those who have attempted suicide. Please read the requirements below. I hope the outcome of my study will help those who aren't doing well after their suicide attempt(s).  

I am recruiting participants for my thesis research, entitled Adult Attempted Suicide and how it Affects Quality of Life. If you are 29 or older, have attempted suicide at least once, attempted suicide 2-10 years previous to being at least 29, are a resident of the United States and are available, participation has two parts: (1) completing an online survey that includes demographic questions and an abbreviated version of the Reasons for Living Inventory by Marsha Linehan, and (2) scheduling a time for a 30-45 minute phone interview with the researcher. The phone interview will ask questions relating directly to participantsâ€™ (last) suicide attempt. After the phone interview is complete, the participant will be emailed a code for a $15 Tango gift card incentive. The information will be kept confidential unless the individual is perceived to be in imminent danger to themselves or others. For more information, please click the link below:
