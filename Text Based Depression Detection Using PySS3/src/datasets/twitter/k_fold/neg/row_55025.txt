Everything is falling apart and I have no idea what to doThis is gonna be a long one but I have literally no one to talk to and I need to dump this off somewhere, sorry for that.

I spent the last year trying to fix everything and things were looking good. It was a really rough year and I spent most of it in mental hospitals. I lost all of my remaining friends and gave my family a really hard time...

In the end I managed to get off of drugs, stop drinking, recovered from my ED and even got a job for a while. Hell, I even had a boyfriend and it looked like everything was gonna be ok.

Well my boss kicked me out, my boyfriend just stopped talking to me after a while and I had to move back in with my family. On top of all that, someone that meant a lot to me died and I still feel like itâ€™s partially my fault. I eventually relapsed and lost 30 pounds.

Recently I got a great offer for a new job and a new place to stay and I passed my driving theory exam so I really thought I could still make it.

Today I had my final driving exam and I failed because I was so nervous. My parents spontaneously had to go somewhere so I had to walk all the way home. I just walked home for 3 hours while crying my eyes out.

On top of all that, the people from the new job still havenâ€™t gotten back to me with the work contract even tho I am supposed to move there and start next week so it looks like they donâ€™t want me after all...

I am really really trying to get somewhere but itâ€™s so hard when I have to start over every time and nothing ever goes well... 

I donâ€™t have a single friend left since my best friend got caught shoplifting and doing drugs and told her parents and the police that itâ€™s all my fault. She also told my other friends a bunch of lies to make them hate me so now none of them want to talk to me anymore.

I really donâ€™t want to give in to the urge but itâ€™s so damn hard to keep going when there is an easy way out... Therapy just made it worse, the meds just make me fat and tired and no matter how hard I try, it always ends up just getting worse.
