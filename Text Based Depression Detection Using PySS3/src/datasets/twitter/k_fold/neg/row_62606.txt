i've given up.I have everything in life a 19 year old could want but i've given up. I don't feel happiness anymore, just this emptiness. I don't want to live any longer and haven't for a while. The only reason i haven't is because i had one hope in things getting better and i've lost it. I want to swallow the rest of my meds and just go to sleep but i'm fighting every urge. What do i do...
