Anyone can help this guy over at /r/islam ?I went on /r/islam right now and saw this post:

I'm not muslim, and I have never had to deal with any situation like this. I was just visiting the sub and saw this. I don't know how to reach out to him, and I'm afraid I might not act in time... can anyone please help him, or give me any type of advice to help him?
