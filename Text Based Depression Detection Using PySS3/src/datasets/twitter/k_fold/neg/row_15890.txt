Why do the good people die but people who actually want to die live on anyway :(I think I just want to talk to people. My therapist/counsellor/whatever is currently on vacation so there isn't anyone to really talk to about my thoughts on life. Hence the x-post.

The people who have terminal illnesses like cancer and what have you not, why are they the ones to be struck by such diseases. They have family who love them, need them and dreams that they want to accomplish. Why is it when we pray so hard to God for a miracle but they wouldn't be healed :( Why wouldn't it be me (depressed person) who was critically ill instead. I don't deserve this life. The closest I came to death was when I OD-ed unintentionally (or idk maybe up for anyone to judge). Felt like crap, vomiting multiple times every hour, was in the ER sobbing that I am dying and I can't wait for them to take my blood pressure to diagnose me. When I blacked out, I was encompassed by a warm white light, felt so serene and peaceful to not feel anymore pain anymore and I honestly wished it remained like that forever. But no I had to wake up and worry about my school project submission and test that I had missed because of the incident :| Asked my mum if she would be fine if i was gone she said she would accept it... (I do not want to commit suicide, it's a way too painful death, OD-ing is quite bad too if anyone even considers that, I wish somehow I would mysteriously just go back to that serene feeling though instead of having to worry so much about living!)

Don't worry about me, I will be fine... 

All i am saying is they deserve second chance in life, but I didn't want it and I shouldn't be here.
