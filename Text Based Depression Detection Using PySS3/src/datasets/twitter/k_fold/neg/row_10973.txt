It isnâ€™t that badHi, I am a 15-year-old girl that spends most of her time away from home at a boarding school because it isnâ€™t good for me to be home. At school, I have an amazing support system. I have lots of friends, am very-well liked, good grades, and my parents materially spoil me because Iâ€™m not home. I know a lot of people care about me but I still feel like a burden. I feel like an attention-seeking little shit whenever I passively post on my Snapchat private story about wanting to die. But iâ€™m sad almost every day or just numb and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve opened up to many people (not my parents, for the same reasons why i am away from home) but I still constantly think about wanting to die. Sometimes I want to harm myself. I live 50 floors up at home, and I am about to go home. My room is next to the balcony. I constantly think about jumping off the balcony even though I know iâ€™ll be too scared and because i donâ€™t want to leave anyone with that painful an image. I think about the aftermath and what I want to say to people. But Iâ€™m still telling myself iâ€™m not that bad because I havenâ€™t hurt myself, sometimes I starve myself to get the feeling of satisfaction. There are people that can make me feel better just by me talking to them but I feel like too much and I donâ€™t even really wanna get better? I just think this is unfair. I was sent to counseling by an adult I opened up to (who is one of the people that can make me feel better) but iâ€™m unable to talk to anyone i donâ€™t have a relationship with, which is why hotlines never work. This is just getting so unbearable and i feel so incredibly shallow and pathetic. Sometimes i just want a hug and then iâ€™ll just go die
