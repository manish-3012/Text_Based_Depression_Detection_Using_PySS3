...hi all meaningless post i know
but i just thought id mentioned listening to linkin park makes me forgot all the fuckwits i wish wouldn't exist
anyways to just vent, isnt it the lack of order and discipline that has allowed people to freely create enormous unbalance in my life, i feel like the media has manioulated children into believing into being special and all that, and once school is over for those rejects, they now see how hopeless situation truly is..i mean no offense, i believe there is a cause for everything, so whatever i am/you are, there is a clear reason, but for some reason people wish to ignore it, and i think ignoring this, will fuck the system up badly, cause of all the unskilled people it will create....any thoughts
