Wondering mind

This past year has been incredibly hard. 

From a break up, friendships lost over the break up, passed on missed opportunities, financial and health struggles. Itâ€™s severely affected my mental health. 

There are days where I hope I get into a car accident to end it all but the next day Iâ€™m loving life. I want to break down and cry but donâ€™t feel anything. 

I feel so isolated and alone and iâ€™m hurting. 

I know I have people who care about me but when you donâ€™t care about yourself it doesnâ€™t really matter. 

Iâ€™ve taken medication and seen a therapist to help with the pain and suffering that I feel on the inside but that isnâ€™t enough. 

I want to hurt myself but I donâ€™t. 

Iâ€™ve gotten back to the gym and started working out again. I even lost 40 pounds in the process. I feel good. Iâ€™ve picked up new hobbies that I really enjoy, but that happiness quickly fades. 

Almost instantly. 

I hate to feeling this way because I know I have it better than most in certain aspects of my life. 

I currently have the dream job Iâ€™ve always wanted. In one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I get to work on projects that really mean something. Iâ€™m respected by management and my peers. Itâ€™s something thatâ€™s rare in my industry. 

Iâ€™m in a new loving relationship with someone with the biggest heart and treats me incredibly well. Something I feel like I donâ€™t deserve. 

I know I have it good. 
 

But I still want to die.
