Should i do i now or later?I'm 27 years old. Male. Things don't get better unless you get lucky. And this may or may not be my suicide note. What do i even write to one... I guess a couse of my depression, loneliness. Cause of lonelyness, being a male. My god this is so stupid, why would need for love make someone want to die, an yet, this hurts so badly. Anyway if you're a male your looks or financial status don't get you dates, just look at me, even though I'm despise my flesh, I'm hot and it gets you nowhere, hell, I'd still be a virgin if i didn't got lucky once. People that say "If you don't love your self you can't love someone else" are idiots, also same goes for anyone saying that it gets better. You get stronger, get the cash, fancy blings, but your pain, lonelyness... It only grows more. There is no happy ending in life.
