New here, but I think Iâ€™m ok to say this?Hi everyone, I want to point out straight off the bat that I am not in any danger of killing myself right now, nor am I in a situation where I feel like I canâ€™t continue with my life, however...

Iâ€™ve had an absolutely amazing childhood, I come from a reasonably good family, not rich, not poor, but as a kid I was lucky to have a decent enducation and my parents took me on holiday pretty much every year, it was great.

Iâ€™m 32 now and Iâ€™m an alcoholic, ok people will instantly jump and say â€œwell thatâ€™s your problem thenâ€ but let me explain, I donâ€™t drink everyday, I probably drink 2-4 times a week, I had an excellent job in my opinion earning decent money, Iâ€™ve never been out of work In my life until January this year. 

Now this is where it changes, I have worked for the biggest pub and restaurant company in the UK for 9 years, prior to that 4 and a half years with the second biggest, Iâ€™ve always been successful, itâ€™s never took me too long to get promoted and Iâ€™ve always been good in my role. 

I went to head office in the pursuit of a new career, same company, did well there, but because of my background and the fact that I was â€œthe new guyâ€ I didnâ€™t really fit in, the guys in my office had all their own in jokes and banter, I was an outsider.

I tried hard to get on with them all, believe me they were nice people, but I felt alienated, I felt like there was something wrong with me, these people had worked in pubs and restaurants before but clearly they had no problems doing this office role.

Then it hit me... Iâ€™ve spent nearly half of my entire life working In a pub or restaurant background, I donâ€™t have my own house, I do t have a wife, I donâ€™t have kids, all of these people do?! So what have I done wrong? Why have I not achieved?

Then I realised I donâ€™t care.

I donâ€™t want a wife, I donâ€™t want children. I donâ€™t want to move out of my parents house. My sister did, my friends did, but I donâ€™t want to. Even if I did i would fuck that up so whatâ€™s the point? I canâ€™t exactly leave and go back can I? Iâ€™ve done that twice.

So hereâ€™s me sitting here thinking. I used to manage the 3rd most successful restaurant in Birmingham. I used to have a great girlfriend a year or so ago. I now do absolutely nothing and the problem is...

I donâ€™t care.

How do I make myself care?

Iâ€™d rather just be done with it all, Iâ€™m no good to anyone so fuck it, if there was an easy way out I would of taken it by now.

I donâ€™t even want help, I just felt compelled to explain my situation and my point of view.
