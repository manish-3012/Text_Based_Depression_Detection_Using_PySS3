I'm losing it.
i was prescribed schizophrenia medication when i was 20 years old.  i don't take it anymore, because the side affects made it impossible to keep a job.  i've been ok for the last four years, but it is coming back, and  it is worse.  I have strange compulsions, and will black out, only to come to in the kitchen holding a knife.  i'm afraid i will kill myself while i'm blacked out.  i don't know what to do.
