I can't see past my arms' length, and I'm okay with this.It's not like I'm blind, or my eyesight is bad; I just can't focus on the world anymore. Imagine your life as a ball around you, only as large as it is long, and the further beyond it you try to see, the harder and harder it is to focus. Well, my life has retracted to my hands, and I'm okay with this. 

I fight with my father every day; him, explaining to me what's so good about me; and me, explaining why he's wrong. He just sent me away, he didn't want to see me anymore tonight. Well, Dad, looks like you're getting your wish tonight, though it won't be until you're at work. 

It's not like I'm worth the food I eat, the air I breathe, because I haven't earned it, I don't have the means to. I'm not asking for attention, not saying "Oh, woe is me, give me your undivided attention because I deserve to be adored," because I don't. 

I just want someone to remember that I existed.

Goodbye, reddit.
