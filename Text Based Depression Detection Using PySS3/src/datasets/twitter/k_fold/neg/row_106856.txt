hello againBeen in therapy for about a year now, meds for 6 months. It helps a little bit but none of it stops the intrusive thoughts or urges

anyone free to talk for a little while? My friends are busy so I'm alone right now and I don't want to be while feeling this way (I know it'll lead to me attempting)
