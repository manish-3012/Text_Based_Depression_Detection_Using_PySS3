My boyfriend killed himself three months agoWe were planning to do it together, up until the last few days. I chickened out. He didn't. The second I decided not to, I absolutely knew I would always regret it. And I really, really do. 
I had already had the person who was basically the love of my life, who I was with for about five years, die a little over a year ago of an overdose. I have been struggling hardcore with depression for years, and these deaths of people I deeply love are adding up. 
I don't believe in an afterlife, but I want so badly to believe that I will see them again. Even if I don't...I'm so tired of being in this world. It's not at all fair that they left me here alone. I'm so tired. Of being sad, and lonely, and feeling like there is absolutely no purpose to my existence. I really don't want to exist anymore.
