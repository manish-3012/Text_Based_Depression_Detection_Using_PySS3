The inferno   
I cannot do this anymore.   
I cannot breathe or move.  
I cannot sleep.  
I cannot trust anyone.

My wife abandoned me and has gone silent.  


My youth and innocence was stolen from me.  
I was robbed of a proper education.  
I was raped and molested.  
I have been gaslit and tortured.   
I have always been the whipping boy and have been punished for others deeds.

I have never received an apology.  
I've never had friends or a real family.  
I have been bullied at every school I ever attended.  
I have been used and rejected my whole life.  
I never had a life that was my own.  
I have only lived through others, just a tool for their own ends.  
I have watched people attacked and murdered on the streets.  
I have seen people die of overdoses.

My wife abandoned me and has gone silent.  
Everyone has stood around me and lets me dig my own graves.They let me fail to teach me harsh lessons and abandon me.  
No one has ever told the truth to me or about me.  
I've never acted out to harm another intentionally.  
I am human and have made mistakes, but I do not know forgiveness.  
Forgiveness has never applied to me.  
I am sorry for all those I have unintentionally harmed in life.  
I forgive those who have harmed me which is more than I can say for anyone in my life. 

Death take me now to the lake of fire!
