I find the biggest reason I remain alive is due to a moral obligation to do so.Hello all.

I post here today not about the reasons for my depression, but instead about the reasons for which I must remain stable. I won't say that I have no other reason to live, because I do. However, the biggest reason I remain alive is because I believe that humans have an intrinsic, inherent moral obligation to stay alive. My friends would be devastated should I die. Several of them are borderline suicidal or are suicidal, and I believe that my own suicide would push more than one of them over the edge. All my life, I have been Mr. Shoulders to my friends, and that's my niche in life. I'm content with that. That's how I want it.

Aside from my friends, I owe society a great debt. Taxpayers have contributed to my education, the roads on which I walk, the food on my plate. I have consumed much of what the general good gives me. I believe it is my moral responsibility to give back to society in the form of economic work until the debt which has been given to me is satisfied.

That is all
