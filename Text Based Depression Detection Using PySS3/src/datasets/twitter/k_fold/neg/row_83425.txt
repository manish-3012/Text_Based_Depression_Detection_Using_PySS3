I think Iâ€™m at the end nowI donâ€™t think I ever could have lived for a long time anyway so itâ€™s not that sad. Iâ€™m eventually going to deal with something that is going to psychologically destroy me anyway. Itâ€™s an inevitability. Just thinking of it constantly is having a pretty bad effect on me. I was just hoping to have a few enjoyable years before I go so Iâ€™m pissed off and venting knowing Iâ€™m going to have to end it. 

I can already barely eat or sleep. There is a waiting list until 2023 before I can even see a psychologist, or a psychiatrist even though I had both when I was 13-15 as a result of a pretty bad situation over the first 12 years of my life. I just want something to get me to sleep and something to help me eat and go about my day. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with so many different things and I was prescribed so much at a young age (13-15). I didnâ€™t maintain any friends. The things I went through were too traumatic and I canâ€™t stop thinking of them and reliving it. When I can sleep I just have nightmares. 

Physically, my body has given up on me. Iâ€™m injured physically and it wonâ€™t heal, Iâ€™ve spent most of the last few months sick and I keep getting sick. Iâ€™m sick as I write this. The gym was one of the things Iâ€™d always be able to turn to and I donâ€™t have that anymore. 

Iâ€™m annoyed and angry. I always hoped Iâ€™d at least have some good memory before I died but thatâ€™s not the case. 

This is the first Christmas where I didnâ€™t get anything at all and didnâ€™t have anyone to buy anything for. Not even a card. I had one person text me but they texted everyone. Sort of a milestone of how empty and meaningless my life had become. I knew it anyway but it still hurt to see it like that. 

I had $550 in vet bills before Christmas I had to pay. Due to being so sick for the final three months I was barely able to cover my bills and didnâ€™t earn much of an income since September. I had to use my credit cards a lot. Now theyâ€™re both maxed. One is $80 over limit because of a bill. I have another $800 in bills coming soon. Many due to over limit fees, NSF fees, ongoing expenses for my job. I donâ€™t have any food or money for food. My bank is overdrawn. My credit is going to take a massive hit on the 11th when everything resets. I also have to pay another $100 for vet bills. 

Truth be told I donâ€™t even want to do this anymore. I thought I was going to die from my last flu. Part of me wanted to. I was ready. Iâ€™ve been keeping a lot of distance from people my whole life but Iâ€™ve made much more of an effort to do that since last spring. 

Iâ€™m trying to make it seem like Iâ€™m ok but I canâ€™t anymore. I donâ€™t want to live through this and I donâ€™t want to watch everything get taken from me. Iâ€™m out of resources. I donâ€™t have a safety net. 

Iâ€™m self employed and had to do everything on my own. I down have a rich family or much friends. I worked so hard maintaining this image and building my business and itâ€™s all for nothing.
