she just killed herselfholy fuck. shes gone. i cant hold her anymore. all gone. what am i going to do? i can't feel anything. the sadness hasnt hit yet,, just the initial shock. oh my god. shes really gone. my everything has just been ripped away from me like that. why did the world have to take her from me? why did she take herself from me? why did she take herself? why would she leave me? i cant do this anymore. i cant live life without her. she is my happiness. she is my world. but now shes not even here anymore. why would she do this? the weight in my chest is growing as i write this. the weight of what shes done is beginning to fall on me. how will i be able to wake up without her? oh my god.
