In a way, it's kind of goodI have my immediate family (3 people) who care (or think they do) but the rest of the people in my life would be unaffected. So if I was to die, almost everyone on earth would be unaffected. And the three people could maybe learn to deal with it (many people do). So in the end, shouldn't stopping pain be better than continuing and ruining resources without inputing things or even being happy? 

Sorry, if this makes no sense, I'm fairly drunk.  And I probably shouldn't post here sense I took apart the noose and am not close to dying. So sorry. This thing really means nothing. Just a way to vent. I just don't trust my friends enough to drag them in deeper so I just wanted to type it out.  haha, sorry anywany,
