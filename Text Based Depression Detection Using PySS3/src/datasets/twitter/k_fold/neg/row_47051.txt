High expectationsHi Iâ€™m 14 and I come from a common hardworking Asian family in the U.S. Recently I have been criticized by my dad to the point where I broke down and almost attempted something that I really donâ€™t want to talk about. 
What stopped me is the past when my parents had time to care about me, my new friends, and my aunt and uncle that have given me the best childhood I had ever wanted.
Throughout my childhood slowly most of my close friends have moved away or stopped talking to me, because they have changed. Iâ€™m only fourteen and i attend High school, so homework along with these problems really got to me as a person. My parents donâ€™t understand me and only look at me as a hopeless child at the times of depression. No support, no love, just high expectations ðŸ˜–
