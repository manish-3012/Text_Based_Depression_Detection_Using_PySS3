Life.My friend committed suicide a few weeks ago. She had been bullied for years, and things at home were progressively getting worse. She felt like there was no other way out, eventually leading to her death. She was 14, just 14. 9th grade. Her parents ignored the signs, and assumed it was a phase. Then someone had the FUCKING AUDACITY TO CALL HER AN ATTENTION SEEKER AFTER SHE KILLED HERSELF. I hate society. Parents, please keep an eye on your child. For all you know, they could be loosing their battle.
