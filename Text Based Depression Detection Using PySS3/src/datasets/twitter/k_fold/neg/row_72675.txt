Just gambled a lot of money away and I don't know what I'm supposed to do...Just lost about $650 on roulette and I just don't know what to do honestly...

I've been struggling with depression for a long time now and now this, i just want to die...

What the fuck should I do? I have no friends, its my birthday and I legit just feel like I'm gonna do some self harm soon, help..

Fuck this...
