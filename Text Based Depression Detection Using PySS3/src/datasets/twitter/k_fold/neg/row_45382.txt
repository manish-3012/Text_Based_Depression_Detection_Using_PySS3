Overcome with anxiety and depressionIâ€™m sitting here crying as I type this, my life has hit a new low consistently like every week. Iâ€™m 22, I have no job because I moved across the country to be with my boyfriend, and Iâ€™m too anxious to learn to drive and find a job like I told myself I would. I made a group of friends and half of them no longer like me because of how my mental health has distorted my personality into a toxic one. I just found this out tonight and Iâ€™m trying to hold myself together.

I just found out my boyfriendâ€™s work wonâ€™t give him time off anymore for my cousinâ€™s wedding back home and so I have to get on a plane and fly there for the first time next week and Iâ€™m terrified and I donâ€™t know what to do. 

Thereâ€™s so much going on and I just want to scream and cry and I have tendencies to harm myself and the urges have never been so strong. I donâ€™t know what else to type but I am doing so bad. Like beyond bad, worse than I have been in a long time and Iâ€™ve struggled since age 7. 

I just really donâ€™t know what to do anymore. When my boyfriend asks me whatâ€™s wrong I canâ€™t even find the words to say and I donâ€™t want him to feel responsible for fixing me or making it better. I just want to stop existing. If I could kill myself without hurting my family and boyfriend I would. I really donâ€™t want to keep living life like this.
