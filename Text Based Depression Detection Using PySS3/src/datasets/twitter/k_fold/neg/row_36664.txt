I feel disconnected from myself and it's causing me to want to kill myself.I just turned 21 and have been suffering from depression since I was 12. More recently have I started to feel this disconnect. When I experience things, I feel far away from them. Like, I'm simply not in my own body. My depression seems to be getting worse, and I sometimes also feel I may have Bipolar Disorder. I don't know for sure at the moment. This disconnected feeling doesn't change how I feel about people. I still love my family to death, love my friends, etc. I just feel weird, and it also makes me feel guilty. Guilty for feeling how I do. All this is making me want to end my life more than I've ever wanted to. I feel like I'm not experiencing anything anymore.

I still get angry, laugh, cry, etc. But, I feel EXTREMELY distant from it all.

That's it. Thanks for reading.
