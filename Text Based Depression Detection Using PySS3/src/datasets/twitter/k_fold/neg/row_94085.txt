ElegiaI think Iâ€™m going to kill myself tonight. Itâ€™s been something Iâ€™ve been wanting to do for years. My first attempt was at 10 years old, then I tried again at 13, then 14, then 15, then 16, then 18 and  19. The notes all written up and ready to go. 

The reasons are simple, I struggle with bipolar ii disorder, anxiety and feel depressed all the time. I also suffer from intense body dysmorphia which makes me starve myself on and off. Ive also been sexually assaulted twice, once when I was in middle school and the second time by my high school ex boyfriend who tried to fuck me while I was sleeping. Not to mention Iâ€™ve had multiple people in my family commit suicide. I even struggled with alcoholism at 13 because I thought that was the answer to my problems, but now I just have a gnarly little nicotine addiction. 

A good amount of time I feel like a burden and I know Iâ€™ve put my family, friends and romantic partners through a lot. And for that I feel absolutely awful. 

And you know whatâ€™s really shitty. I even OD this summer off benzos and woke up in the fucking hospital because I pussied out and drove myself to there so I didnâ€™t die alone in my room. All that did for me was put me in a psych ward for the second time in less than a year. 

I thought that after my second time Iâ€™d have an appreciation for life, that Iâ€™d be happy to be alive but Iâ€™m still fucking miserable. And I have no idea why. I have a loving family, lots of caring friends (that know Iâ€™m bipolar and still love me and are always there for me), take meds that are supposed to stabilize me, go to therapy, have a good job where I work with really cool people, and good grades. But Iâ€™m still miserable and tired of living. 

I wanna take a bunch of benzos again because I feel like ODing will be less painful and as weird as it sounds I liked ODing. I was so at peace when I was benzoâ€™d out and itâ€™s the only method that I have access to (donâ€™t own a rope, donâ€™t have a gun since I legally canâ€™t own one and Iâ€™m in the suburbs so no tall buildings I can fling myself off of). In a perfect world Iâ€™d OD off heroin or fentanyl because Iâ€™ve always wanted to feel that high (but not live with addiction that follows). I think Iâ€™ll do it outside my house so my family wonâ€™t have to find me in my room. 

The only thing I feel really shitty about is that if I die my dog wonâ€™t know why I never came home.
