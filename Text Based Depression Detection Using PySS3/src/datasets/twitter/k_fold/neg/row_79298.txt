Thought I would give this a shot. I need help.Well, Recently, I traveled to the mohave desert, in an attempt to end my life. I have had two unsuccessful attempts, this makes the third. My body is not letting me do it, but my mind is. I am mentally unstable, I have been isolated from society for 2 1/2 years, At home, internet based high school no friends, family that is not understanding of me. Anytime I go in public, I listen to every conversation, to see if people are talking about me. The past few times, I have been verbally assaulted by random members of the public. Next time i go out in public, if someone says something, I don't think I can control the rage inside. I have been to the doctor, and psychiatrist, my doctor said it was just sadness from isolation, my psychiatrist said that it was due to bad family relations. I am scared of what may happen the next time some punk has something rude to say about me, strangers. I might have to teach these assholes a lesson. I don't deserve anymore suffering. I am in a really dark place right now, and cannot get out of it.
