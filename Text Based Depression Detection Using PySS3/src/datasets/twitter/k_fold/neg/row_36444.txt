I dunno anymoreI made this account just for this. I'm not sure about what I want from this. I don't want to bother anyone. I don't want the usual pep talks I assume people get. I don't even exactly know what is so bad.

I've on and off felt and thought about this for a year or so. I have a few good friends. Good family. But I have had a couple heartbreaks in the last couple years. 

I don't feel like I am any use to anyone. I actually feel like I hinder people now. 

I have taken one of my friends on a spiral of drink and drugs with me as he's tried to be there for me. It's shit to see for him.

I've had fights and arguments with my mother and other friends through what I think in hindsight is my behaiour. It's hard to tell as I don't see what I've done wrong and most of the time think I'm right or hard done by. But by afterthought or seeing others go through this I guess I see maybe I am the common problem. I'm the one that always has the issue or causes the issues. 

I guess I have depression. My latest ex tried to get me to see someone about it. But I've never felt I'd need to do that. In fact 5 years ago I was the least likely guy to ever have to do that. 

I've always been the one to be there for everyone. The constant happy guy. The party guy. The helping guy. The guy who would pick you up. The guy who would take you in. Now I feel like no one wants to be near me. 

I am drunk and on drugs just now. Alone. I don't have anyone to talk to. I've thought for the last 2 hours about jumping in my car and fucking off or finding a cliff or bridge. But I know I really don't want to. Just that it might be best. I guess I just want to vent. Sorry if this doesn't fit here. Sorry if I brake any rules (I haven't read them) and as I said I don't want a phone number. I know what they are. Thanks reddit.
