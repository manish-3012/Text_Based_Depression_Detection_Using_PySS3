Made a bet with FaithI've been contemplating killing my self for a while and asked faith for one of 2 hope that the school I've been accepted in see past my bad semester in a different school and still let me continue and hope for the slightest sign of the girl I love to love me back in less than 24h i got both responses. The school cancelled my application and not only the girl doesn't love me back but I made her cry because of my cancer self. I whent from a ok life to shit. Now i dont go to school and I've lost the dearest person I know
