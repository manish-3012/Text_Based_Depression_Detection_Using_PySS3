The feelingHave any one you felt that feeling? When you've picked a day and you go through the whole day believing that you won't be alive to see the next day? That surreal feeling of believing you're a walking corpse. I've felt that feeling over a dozen times yet each time I don't go through. I bring myself up from the tub water for another breath of air. So close, yet I don't do it. I feel like that feeling is really doing a number on my mind and heart that I don't really notice anymore. One of these days I am going to come home from school or work and it will really be the end. The last thing that people will remember of me is how calm I was on my last day.
