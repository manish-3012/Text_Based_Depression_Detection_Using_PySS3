Has anyone else grown to like this feel?I hated the idea of feeling depressed and thinking about suicide but now, now I feel like I need it. I feel that I grow to know myself more when I feel like this. I don't know if I'm crazy or what. I just don't want this feel to end, but I want it to go away. I don't know.
