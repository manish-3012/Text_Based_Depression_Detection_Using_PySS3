No motivation to get betterWhat's the fucking point, nothing works, I don't believe I even can get better, this illness is going to end with my death. Any slight moment I don't feel like shit it feels like I force myself back down. Fucked up ain't it.

Don't even know why I'm writing this shit nobody's going to give a fuck
