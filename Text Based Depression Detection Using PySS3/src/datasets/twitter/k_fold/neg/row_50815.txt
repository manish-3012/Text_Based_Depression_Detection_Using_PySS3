I'm afraidI don't want to tell anyone, I really don't... I know I'll probably get sent into inpatient if I tell anyone, I just don't think I'd be able to hurt everyone around me like that... I'm so tired of living, but I know I can't get help, I feel like I'm stuck in limbo... (Oh and before anyone mentions patient-therapist confidentiality, that isn't applicable due to my situation)
