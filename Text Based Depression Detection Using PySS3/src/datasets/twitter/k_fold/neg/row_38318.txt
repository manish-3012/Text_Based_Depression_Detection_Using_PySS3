Do the suicidal thoughts ever go away?So Iâ€™ve been recovering from a lot of mental stuff the past 5 months after getting professional help. I was so convinced that I was going to end myself that it simply became fact to me, I never bothered trying, I never made plans for the future, I just existed out of guilt for my loved ones waiting for the day the fight is over. At my lowest I got really close, it was euphoric. But now that Im â€œrecoveringâ€ I still get those thoughts. That itâ€™s the only way out, Iâ€™m not meant for this world, itâ€™s not going to get any better. Your problems donâ€™t just disappear with magic pills and talking sessions. It just seems so easy sometimes, like I could just stop fighting and be done with it. I just want to sleep and never wake up to be bothered by myself again. But over all, my life has been on the up and up, and itâ€™s not all bad, itâ€™s just those long sleepless nights, the days that are thick with frustration, thatâ€™s those thoughts emerge again, and I feel like my old self. So, do those thoughts really ever go away, or is â€œrecoveringâ€ really just learning to deal with them.
