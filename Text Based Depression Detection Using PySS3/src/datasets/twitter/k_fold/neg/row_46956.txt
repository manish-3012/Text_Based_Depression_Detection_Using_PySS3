Life is hardDo you ever just look in a mirror and feel disappointed with what you see? Thatâ€™s me every time I stare at my reflection. I have a car, my own studio apartment, a job that pays well, a family that cares for me, friends who care for me, but yet I feel that I have nothing. Deep inside, thereâ€™s an immense amount of worthlessness. Thereâ€™s this emptiness so deep that thereâ€™s nothing that could ever fill it. Itâ€™s an abyss, a void, a vacuum that sucks all energy except those that are negative. My emptiness knows my weaknesses and it enjoys preying on it.
