I don't think I should exist anymore. My mind tortures me everyday.From a past few days I don't feel like doing anything at all. I just sleep all day and barely just eat to survive I can't remember things easily anymore. I am student and my studies are hindered I have exams in 2 months. Whenever I try to do anything I get bored. I cry randomly for no reason sometimes. I don't know why but it hurts so bad I have no friends and I don't have anyone to share anything. It's like my life is aimless:\ i know I am worthless and I feel bad seeing people around me working and living a happy life while I am just being a burden on them. I think things will fix and people will move on if I die:)
