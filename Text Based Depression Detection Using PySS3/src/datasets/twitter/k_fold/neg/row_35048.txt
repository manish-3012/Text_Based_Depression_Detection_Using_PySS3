Everything is just f*cking wrongLet's face it, mental illness has treatment, but not everyone can have it. We live in a fucked up world where your life is valued by the amount of profit you can raise to the elites. If you cannot raise profits and you are not part of the rulling class you're dumped somewhere in the corner of the world. I have no value to capitalist society, that's why there isn't a single chance of me getting better, any investment in my mental health would return no profit. That's why everytime I'm feeling suicidal I either get pushed to cheap good for nothing solutions like my crappy country's underfunded suicide hotline or products like meditation apps (things that can milk mental illness for profit). Any material change is immediately denied, no decent healthcare, no housing security, no social support, there's only the individual problem of **you** having a mental illness, and if you cannot afford to get better, well, **screw you**. How did we get to this point!? How can we help each other without building a solid foundation where solidarity can actually flourish? We keep telling each other everything is gonna be fine as if that's enough, and well, or intentions are good, but we can't treat cancer with good intentions, why it would work for mental illness??? But this is just a rant, a rant from someone who has been suicidal for as long as he can remember, and keeps telling the people around him things is going to be better, sometimes even to himself. Someone like everyone else, trying to extinguish a fire without the means to do it.
