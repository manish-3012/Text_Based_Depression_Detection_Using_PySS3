Not an emotional person. But I feel this may need talking about. 21mSuicide is not the answer. This is something that I have been reminding myself. But this is the problem...
THIS is something I have to remind myself.
I have posted here before and I got great advice but i feel maybe I didn't address the correct issue. 
Not being alive has just been seeming enticing. 
I do not like work or school, (never have liked school). I know nothing about anything other than usless material like video games and magic the gathering. and i know that ky family loves me but religion really esqued my thinking. (how can you know what love is when it's something you MUST grant everyone?) I let religion control me and now without it. I do not know who i am. I have tried to discover to no avail.
i am just ranting now. i need help.
