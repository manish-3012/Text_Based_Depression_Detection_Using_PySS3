I thought I could waitI always said that if stuff doesn't get better for me by the time I'm 30, I'd call it quits then. Recently, I have been feeling this overwhelming sense that stuff won't ever get better so I've decided to call it quits. Kind of sucks that life was never fair to me, but I suppose unfairness is a part of life.
