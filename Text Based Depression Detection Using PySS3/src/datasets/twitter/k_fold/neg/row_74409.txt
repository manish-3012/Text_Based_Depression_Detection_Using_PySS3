I could end all the painThis year has been the worst of my life thus far. Iâ€™ve ruined everything good I had. I lost the person I didnâ€™t think would ever leave. Every day when I wake up I just feel so heavy and simultaneously empty. Knowing I could just put my gun up to my head and click haunts me a lot. If Iâ€™m honest Iâ€™ve felt like this a long time but recently itâ€™s been way worse. I feel like a burden and an embarrassment, just a sick joke.
