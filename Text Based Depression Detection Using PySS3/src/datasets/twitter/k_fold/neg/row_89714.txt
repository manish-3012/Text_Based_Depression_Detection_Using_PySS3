My fiancÃ© prefers his work friend over meI think Iâ€™m going to lose my fiancÃ© to other people. In my last breakup, I lost my boyfriend to other people. The so-called â€œfriends.â€ This time itâ€™s a coworker who I didnâ€™t like from the beginning because heâ€™s disrespectful and childish. Now heâ€™s texting terrible things about me to my fiancÃ©, and my fiancÃ© is just going along with it. I read through his phone after I saw it pop up and they have both been talking about me for a while. Iâ€™m always portrayed as being the boss. Being portrayed as controlling everything. Found out he is getting rides from him that I never knew about. It wouldnâ€™t be a big deal had I known about it. What if his family asks where he was and I had no idea because he never told me and was getting rides secretly. I made him cry earlier and then we both cried. He left for work an I am still crying. My own reactions and his actions make me want to kill myself. I feel completely out of touch lately and have felt like this for about 3-4 months now. Iâ€™m a slob and a mess and no wonder he lets his coworker talk about me like that. I donâ€™t have a man that tells the guy to stop and that the conversation ends now. I have someone who will let anyone say anything about me and then comes home to me with secrets and lets me fall asleep alone, by myself, while he does whatever he does when Iâ€™m asleep without a damn given.  Then when I find things out, he has no clear answers. The explanations change. He doesnâ€™t remember. Then he gives me an answer and itâ€™s opposite from the last. I truly feel like Iâ€™m in a cartoon. And now I get to spend the next 9 hours alone, by myself, plans gone to waste for today, thinking about how much I hate living in this world. I hate being me.
