Is it better to have a shitty parent or a dead one?I am so incapable of parenting that I am making my kid's life awful. She's six and she's going to grow up hating me the way people in the raised by narcissist sub hate their parents. I just don't know if it will fuck her up more if I stay or if I leave.
