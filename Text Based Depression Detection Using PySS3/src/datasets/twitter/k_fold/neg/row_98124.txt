I have entered dying will mode,id like support a bitdying will mode is when you no longe fear death because you have embraced it and thus wait for it,but you still do stuff you want to since you fear no risk.

this isnt something to be happy about but its how I am like right now, I tried everything to get my life up and improve and thrive but i failed at all times.What can I do now? there's some stuff I want to do,and to benefit others,maybe helping out will clear my heard.

i feel very bad i cant get a gf,I just wanted a wife and a big family.i try to not think of dying but the idea plaguhes me
