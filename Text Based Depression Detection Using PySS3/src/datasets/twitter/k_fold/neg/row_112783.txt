Last night I wrote a suicide letterLast night I wrote a suicide note to my family. When Iâ€™ve gone through suicidal ideation periods before, I have never been able to write a suicide letter because guilt from the thought of what it would do to my family absolutely crushed me. But last night was different. I wrote an entire goodbye letter to my parents and siblings and it was actually the most calming thing Iâ€™ve done in a long time. I finally didnâ€™t feel trapped. Today I was thinking about how I will divide my possessions and writing down plans for after I die such as cremation and things like that. I started contemplating where I would do it, so that I donâ€™t scar people from entering my house or something like that. I also thought of making it look like an accident and what would be easiest for my family and friends. 

Iâ€™m posting here because this is the farthest Iâ€™ve ever gotten to planning my suicide and now that I have, I really canâ€™t picture not going through with it. In my heart feels like the best thing to do, but my head is telling me that I would be incredibly selfish and cowardly. I need advice on how to breathe again. I need to not feel trapped and I donâ€™t know how to do that. Iâ€™m reaching out as a last resort because Iâ€™m 19, and I know I shouldnâ€™t be doing this but at the same time I donâ€™t know what else to do.
