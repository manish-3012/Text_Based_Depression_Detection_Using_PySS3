What counts as a suicide attempt?In the past I had the intention and nearly killed myself. I held a knife to my wrist and did practice cuts across. I was about to cut when I thought about how it would devastate others and I didnâ€™t go through with it. This happened twice and I never told anyone. Kinda wish I did do it even though I would have probably messed it up.

Would those count as suicide attempts even if I didnâ€™t end up cutting? Would it be lying to say I attempted suicide?
