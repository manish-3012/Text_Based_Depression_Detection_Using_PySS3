The world rewards people for harming me.I didnâ€™t know where else to post this. No one will probably read this...

Several years ago, I was bullied severely, and psychologically abused to the point of a suicide attempt that has left me somewhat disabled. Iâ€™ve been trying to make my life better, without any success whatsoever. But now almost once a month I have to hear about my bullies and abusers who are getting accolades, praise, and fame. I donâ€™t hear about them through social media or friends, but through trade magazines and other outlets I have to keep up with in my field/industry. Itâ€™s unavoidable and it seems like the universe is determined to reward people for being abusive.

Iâ€™ve felt suicidal for a long time but this is the first time Iâ€™ve had homicidal thoughts. Iâ€™d never harm anyone other than myself. But the fact that Iâ€™m having these thoughts tells me that maybe itâ€™s time to try again and this time not fail. This can be the one and only thing I succeed at.
