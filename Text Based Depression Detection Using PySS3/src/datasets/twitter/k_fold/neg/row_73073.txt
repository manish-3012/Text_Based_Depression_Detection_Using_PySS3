I could kill myself and it wouldnâ€™t matterI could slit my wrists with the razor I have hidden in my closet and I donâ€™t think it would make any difference. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anyone in my life who would care or cry for me other than my parents. I donâ€™t know whether that makes me want to laugh or cry.
