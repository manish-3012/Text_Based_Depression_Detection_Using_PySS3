It just hurts.Im a married guy in his late thirtys. I just want to be normal and have kids but i never will. I got dignosed in my early 20s as having borderline personality disorder. Bpd effects people in different ways. For me it makes me feel like knowone wants or cares about me. All the time. For me this is a huge deal. I need to be loved and wanted or there is no point being alive. I feel like a massive burden to my wife and family. Im deeply ashamed that i havent succeded in life like my brother and sister. I work hard but i never seem to get anywere because as soon as i get an opportunity i self sabotage because i refuse to let myself be happy. I think my wife who i love with all my heart has had it with me. 

No one seems to care. I get told to shut up. I get told im making people uncomfortable. I plan on killing myself before christmas. I just hate myself so much i cant contain it. I just want to die a really painfull harsh death so that i can be punished for the disharmony i have created on this earth.

I only seem to be able to remember the negitive things that happen to me. People always seem to use then discard me. My mother died when i was 17 and i never remotely got over it. Its still as raw as when it happened. All i can do is try not to think about her.

I dont want to go on living in misery. Im only here still here because even though i feel ive ruined my wifes life she is the reason im  still here.

I stood on a highway overpass on my lunch break and tryed really hard to get the courage to jump but i was just to scared and i guess i knew the drop wasnt enough.

Noone cares. They tell me to "man up" or to think "positive". I cant feel or understand how they care when all they do is reject me and push me away. Meds dont work. Therapy dont work. 

I just dont know how the fuck to go on. Why should i be expected not to kill myself when i view the world like this?
