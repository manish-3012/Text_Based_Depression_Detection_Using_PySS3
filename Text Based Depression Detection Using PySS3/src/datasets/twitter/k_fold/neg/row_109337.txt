Everything is going downhillM17
I tried to go into the quarantine school year positively. I took a big step forward in my life. I asked a girl out. We went on a something you could call a "date". We, or in hindsight only me, had a great time. We had so much things in common. I was so happy. And she seemed to enjoy it. Suddenly she remembered something that she was supposed to do before the day ended and left. I didn't think anything about this as we got along so well. School starts and I ask her for another date. She said "Sorry but no."

I was pretty shocked as, in my opinion, we got along so well. After that I started to feel more lonely week by week. And I thought "okay let's just focus on school". I started working twice as hard. But my grades only dropped and dropped. I fell behind in every class. 

I have had some depression periods since I was around 10, but this is definitely the worst one yet. I have never felt so lonely, so distanced from my friends.

The only time I laugh is when I look at myself in the mirror and think about how pathetic I am. I have had a breakdown at least every two days for the past 3 weeks.

Everyone says that depression has won you over when you stop working and stuff. I am still working really hard on school. The grades just keep and keep dropping. I haven't had any fun in ages. 

And everything in this is just my fault. I don't blame anyone else. I am a really boring and retarded guy so the girl had every right to say no to me. 

Everyone talks about how they are depressed because of their family problems. 

My family couldn't be more supportive or better. It is just that I am an absolute imbecile. I am worse than all of you. You have a reason to be depressed. I don't!

I just wan't to feel loved by someone. I know the whole "Teenage love" clichÃ¨, but I feel really empty.

I am in the last week of the first half of this school year. I will finish it working hard. 

The next 2 weeks will be my last. 

Everyone will get a nice Christmas present in the form of me hanging in a tree. 

I am literally insane and nothing can help me :)
