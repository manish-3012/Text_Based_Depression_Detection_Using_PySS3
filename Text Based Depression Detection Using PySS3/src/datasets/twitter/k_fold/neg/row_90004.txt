I think I figured it out.Iâ€™ve heard so much about how peaceful death is and dealing with a very troubling pass, (I wonâ€™t speak of for personal reasons.)  All I ever wanted was peaceful days in which I didnâ€™t have to worry. Now I think I know why I always have these random suicidal thoughts. Itâ€™s not because Iâ€™m depressed itâ€™s because I just want some peace. ( if that makes any sense) I only get that the type of peace I crave when sleep, which happens rarely, but I think if I could sleep forever I could be forever at peace. (Aka death) I wonâ€™t be leaving much behind if I do die but Iâ€™m genuinely scared of the consistencies death brings such as family and the idea of an after life. If I knew for certain that all religions where bullshit Iâ€™d definitely do it. But the thought of doing it then ending up in hell with even less peace then on earth is so stupid to me. I just wish I could sleep forever without having to worry about consistencies. Iâ€™m sorry if this made anyone feel some type of way but I just needed this to be somewhere. Itâ€™s all so tiring to think about adding to the stress. I honestly hope thereâ€™s some eternal peace at the end we all get for being dragged through this hell called earth. Thanks for your time and all that.
