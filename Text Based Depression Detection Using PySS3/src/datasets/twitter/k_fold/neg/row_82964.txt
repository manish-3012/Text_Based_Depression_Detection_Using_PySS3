I'm writing a suicide letter, cannot make it through wish I could.I've always thought writing in forums like this is for weak, vulnerable people. But I'm running out of options. I've been in constant pain for more than five months now. I feel like everybody is blaming me for something, like everything I do is wrong, and there's been a couple of months since I last had an argument to prove that statement wrong. 
I've been cutting my wrists, I've been crying 'til I sleep. There was a woman that I loved with my whole heart, that I still do. She does not want anything from me now, she thinks I've fallen for her best friend, just because I used to like to spent time with her, but the truth was because I don't have lots of friends. 
I know that if I could be with her my pain will cease, but I'm a shit of a person to be with her, I'm no good for the woman I love the most. 
The only thing that keeps me from ending my life is the fact that I'm a completely atheist and I know for sure that this life is everything I have, and I think is better for a lifetime of endless missery and pain than to have nothing at all. 
But I do wish, that someday, somebody in the street pull a gun to my head and finish with this.
