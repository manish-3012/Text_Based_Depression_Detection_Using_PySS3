sick of life this planet sucksI don't know why I'm even writing this but maybe someone can relate.. I just feel so tired all the time and the thought of having to live through day after day of this torture called life is driving me insane. There is nothing good about this place, having to work all day every day just to survive, no real friends or family, just fake ass morons everywhere. I want to live, just not like this. This shit feels like a fucking prison.
