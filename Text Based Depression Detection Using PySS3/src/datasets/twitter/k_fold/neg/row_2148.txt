No motivation. No heart. No friends. Can you guys help? I hate my life and I don't know what to do. When I go home I'm a victim of mental and sometimes physical abuse from my alcoholic mother and dad who does nothing about it. Then when I'm at school away from them, I just get bullied at school. I feel like I have nobody to go to because I don't really have any friends and my parents will just tell me to grow the fuck up. My only escape is my computer and my "online" friends. I feel almost depressed all the time and I wear a smile around even though that's not how I'm feeling. I don't think I can live like this much longer. What can I do? 

If this is an inappropriate sub to post it on, downvote it all you want. I just would like an answer. I'm x-posting this from an askreddit thread I created.
