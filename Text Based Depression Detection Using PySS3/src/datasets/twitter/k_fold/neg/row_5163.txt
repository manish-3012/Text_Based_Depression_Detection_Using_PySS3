I'm just done.17M, had depression since age 6, funny how fast 11 years goes by when you can't focus on the long term.
Tried overdosing on prednisolone ~6 months ago and got put into the mental health inpatient system for just under 2 months. Since then I just can't focus on anything else, I just want to die, and I've stopped being quiet about it. Nothing can get me out of this mindset anymore, I'm just done. I feel ready, and every day feels as if I'm nearing the end of my third act, that I'm nearing my end.
