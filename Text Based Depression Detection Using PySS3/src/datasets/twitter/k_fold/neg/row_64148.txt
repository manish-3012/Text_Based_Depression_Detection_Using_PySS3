I Did ItIâ€™ve been a victim of my stepfathers verbal, physical, and emotional abuse since I was a boy. Iâ€™m in my 30s now and it still continues. My mom occasionally joins in the name calling and being the only child itâ€™s difficult for me to find someone to talk to. Theyâ€™ve never supported my endeavors or cheered me on when I accomplished big things. Last week, with no thought about it, I just went into the closet and tied the rope around my neck and let go. All i could think of was oh no, whoâ€™s going to love my dog now? And the thought of finally being free from torment. I donâ€™t remember blacking out, but I did. I donâ€™t know how or why but i awoke very disoriented and struggling for air. The rope hardened ripped in two and the closet rod wasnâ€™t broken, so how did i manage to be conscious sitting at the bottom of the closet floor? Was it simply not my time? And if it isnâ€™t why tf am I still here for if the abuse still continues? I am thinking my beloved dog needed me more. Heâ€™s my only joy.
