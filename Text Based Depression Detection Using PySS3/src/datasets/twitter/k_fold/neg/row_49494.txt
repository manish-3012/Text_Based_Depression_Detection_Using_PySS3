I'm probably gonna end it soon.I've posted here numorous times over the years while fighting depression but it keeps coming back and getting worse each time. To start off after I finished high school most of my friends left for college leaving me behind since I'm missing a creditto get in. The ones who stayed are mostly ignoring me completely even though I told them I need help. I've tried getting a job numorous times but I keep getting rejected. One place even fucking said don't apply again, I was ready to barge in and make a scene. Finally I'm all alone, I hardly see my family anymore after moving in with my grandma and I also have zero chance at getting a girlfriend. I'm really tempted to try to hang myself again because I've run outta hope.
