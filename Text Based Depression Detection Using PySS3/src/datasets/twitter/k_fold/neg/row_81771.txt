BpdIâ€™m exhausted . Every episode of crying fits, Ptsd, anger frustration confusion brings me closer to the edge. My whole life has been chaos n upset. Iâ€™m nearly 21 nothing is changing. I canâ€™t be bothered to make sense 
Anymore. I canâ€™t be bothered to do things. I have to wait a year for help but I donâ€™t think I can
make it that long even though I really want to . Iâ€™m sick of physically writhing around in mental anguish I . think Iâ€™d do it by burning because I canâ€™t bare the thought of anyone seeing my body naked and dead. I dunno when I canâ€™t predict . Anyone that thinks people with bpd are toxic and should stay away from anyone with it are so wrong Iâ€™ve never wanted to be this way and I try every day so hard to stop it . I donâ€™t blame the ones that act out I really donâ€™t bc living with this shits hell
