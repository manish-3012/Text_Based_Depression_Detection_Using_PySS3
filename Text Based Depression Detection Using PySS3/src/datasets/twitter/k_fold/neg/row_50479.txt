My friend is seriously thinking about suicide. How can I help?I've known my friend for almost a year now. He has many problems in his life - anorexia (he starved himself last summer before we met), cutting, self-loathing and depression to name some of the major ones. He feels like he deserves it all. He has a girlfriend that is really helping him through everything, but both are leaning on me for support. His girlfriend has told me that she is scared that one time she won't be able to talk him down and he'll kill himself. I'm scared about this too, especially since we're all in senior year of high school. What happens if she leaves him, or they have to split for college? I know for a fact that he couldn't make it through that. He also said that he has accepted that suicide is his eventual fate, that he knows that suicide will be the cause of his death and that it's a matter of time. I've never had to help someone through something like this before, since I've lived a relatively sheltered life. Yesterday I had to help talk him out of 'splattering his brains on the pavement.' I'm scared about what could happen, since I have to move cross-country and I can't be there in person anymore. What should I do? If you need any more information or anything, please just ask, I'll try to provide as much as possible without violating my friend's privacy. I don't normally post such private things, especially since he asked me to keep it a secret, but this is too important to keep a secret. I would rather break a promise than see him dead.

Please help, I'm really scared.
