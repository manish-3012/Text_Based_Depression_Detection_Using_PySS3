In the midst of a panic attackWaiting for my train to take me to a city Iâ€™m not very familiar with for a work event. Iâ€™m panicking a lot, want to cut, want to die, feel awful. Anybody who can talk to me right now, will be paid back in kind whenever they want. Just please help me. Thanks in advance
