It's a bad night.My girlfriend who left me a month ago just posted a bunch of pictures with her looking very happy while I am empty. I was getting better but this has brought me back to almost the beginning. We were together for three years and this is pathetic. It's not normal to feel so depressed a month after that kind of thing is it. I had massive depression before I got with her. I don't have any friends locally and I have been trying to find people on kik to text with. I'm on autopilot with no social skills or personality. I thought I could wait another year until I'm 21 and go to the bars to find someone but I feel like that would be a lonely failure of an experience. I was thinking about driving across the country, does anyone have experience with this? I'd be doing it alone. I work and go to college. I'm 20 and I do have enough money to do so. Maybe someone wants to talk on kik with me about their experiences traveling or something.
