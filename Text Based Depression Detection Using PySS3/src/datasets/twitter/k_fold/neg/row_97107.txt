I dont hate my life I'm just tiredHey
I already posted once before in this sub, but I kinda know better than before what I feel and what my problem is. I thought more about it and tried to find a solution or at least find out what the matter was.
It's not that I hate my life, I have a pretty good life to be honest, a nice job , friends and no serious problems...
However I cant explain the way I feel and why I feel that. I feel like my life was long enough (I'm 19) that I've experienced everything I have to and that it's a good time for it to end. I feel unmotivated and tired of doing something productive there's no will to do stuff, I feel like every necessity in life has been fulfilled.
