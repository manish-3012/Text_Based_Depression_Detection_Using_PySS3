I just want to express how I feel...I always tell myself that I would never be able to commit suicide, that suicide is cheating life, if I'm alive it is because a lot of causalities happened and that I have to die the same way, by a causality of the universe.

But every day I find living more and more boring, meaningless, tasteless. Sometimes I feel lonely, but I really rather to be alone.

This has been a hard year, I've looked fot help with a psychologist and a psychiatrist, they helped me, but I can't stop feeling empty, useless, not grateful for being alive.

I want to feel normal again, not happy but less alone and willing to do things.
