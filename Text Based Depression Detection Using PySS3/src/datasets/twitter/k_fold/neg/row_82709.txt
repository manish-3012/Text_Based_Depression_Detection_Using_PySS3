I just need helpI just want help. I cant explain it. I'm usually happy and outgoing but as soon as I'm alone and ticked off I start bawling silently. I feel like I've become a hollow shell of smiles. I can only imagine what happens if this persists... My only problem is where I turn. Everytime I try to bring it up with someone my head fucks with me, it makes me act like I was kidding. No one can take me seriously. I tryed telling my Mom (I'm about to turn 17) but my I got scared, and backed down. I have no where to turn. Most adults hate me. (I'm manipulative, which I hate but I can't help it) So I have no where to turn. I'm failing my junior year. My family hates me cause I'm stupid. I wanna be a DJ which wont happen. I can't take it anymore. I'm in tears, because I know something is wrong with me, but I don't know what. I don't even see the point in writing this stupid post. FML.
