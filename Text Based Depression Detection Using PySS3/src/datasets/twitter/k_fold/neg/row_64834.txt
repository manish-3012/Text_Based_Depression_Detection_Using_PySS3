My parents died before I did...Long ago, I wanted to die on my own, taking my life in my hands, I failed and since then I feel like I live "borrowed life". During those years I graduated, I got a boyfriend ... two days after my engagement party a driver killed my parents. Since it happened I have taken care of everything but I feel I can not do it. I cry every day, I try to keep the house tidy like my mom used to do it and cry, cook for my younger brother and still crying... I canceled my wedding, I do not want anything now, I just want my mom and dad, I need my mommy and my daddy I can not work properly anymore, I do not feel that I can laugh and enjoy anything again and I feel just as I was years ago when I tried to kill myself.

I know that if I die my brother will be fine, the rest of my family is going to take good care. My fiance will meet someone else and continue with his life, basically I'm pushing him to continue his life without me, I don't want to talk to him since the funeral. 

And I know that if I die I stop feeling the way I feel, just everything will stop and will not be here, like them. I do not want a life without them, I miss my parents. I need them.
