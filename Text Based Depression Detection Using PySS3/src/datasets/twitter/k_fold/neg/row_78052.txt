The burden on everyone's lifeI talk. Either I am ignored. Or I get everyone angry. Or upset. I've been assaulted because of how disliked I am. I have lost one of my friends a few months ago. I lost another one only a few days ago. I cut to try and release the pain but nothing helps. One of the only things that could help me at this point is suicide.
