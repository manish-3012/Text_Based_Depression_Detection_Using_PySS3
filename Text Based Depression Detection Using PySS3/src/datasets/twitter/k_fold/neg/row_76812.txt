The strongest people are the ones who kill themselves.how can you tell me they aren't? Your whole life you escape dangerous situations the best you could. it is written in you to escape harm and to run when it comes to fight or flight. no one wants to fucking die. the strongest people are the ones who kill themselves because they themselves decide to die and they themselves are responsible for their own death. they overcome that urge to survive, that urge that is so hard to break
