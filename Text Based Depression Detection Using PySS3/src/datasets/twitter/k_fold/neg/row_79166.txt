I romanticize suicide a bit.I dunno, I compare to like a bird spreading its wings for the first time and flying. Finally being free. It feels so good to think about. It's the only way to release all the pain but at the same time it means leaving your friends and family in this world behind. That just seems beautiful to me. I can't wait for March 9th, when I finally end it all. It's a Monday. Which means I'll get one last chance to go to school and say goodbye to all my friends and family.

Suicide is a beautiful thing in my eyes. I'm tearing up a bit right now. When I kill myself the shackles of stress, sadness and everything else will be free. When I think of suicide it makes me happy. I can't help but just smile. I barely ever smile anymore. But the prospect of a way to end all the pain so easily, but leaving everything behind is kind of intense.

I know I'm going to go through with it when the time comes, but for now I might as well spend my last few months having fun with my friends and family. Then my time will come and I say goodbye. It's perfect.
