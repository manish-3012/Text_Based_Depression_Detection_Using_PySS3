So depressed when things should be going wellI just need to connect to someone so badly. I've made so much progress in the past two years. I left an abusive marriage, got to see my kids really thrive, landed my dream job and reached some other huge (for me) career milestones. Clawed out of debt, cleaned up my credit, got some friends. 

I don't know how it happens like this but it seems like the smallest things send me down this awful spiral. I'm just dealing with some run of the mill work drama. On the surface, normal stuff. But inside I just feel like I want to die. Like if I'm not making those perfect performance reviews I just dont deserve to live and I've let everyone down and all this progress is for nothing. what am I striving for if I can't claw my way out of this hole? I want to make my kids proud of their mom. Show them that we can live the good life in spite of a rocky start. I just don't know what to do or where to go for help. I'm so afraid and hate that even when I've worked this hard I still just want to die.
