Planning to end my life soonSince I donâ€™t think much people will read this, Iâ€™ll make it brief. My life has become too hard because my school work, abuse family, and loneliness. My grades are going down and I have absolutely no motivation to do any work. Just sleep and die. My parents canâ€™t understand the fact that I have depression. Nobody, anywhere near me wants to my friend. 

I remember earlier this year I tried hanging myself at school but I failed. Iâ€™m going to try it again very soon because it wasnâ€™t that hard. I donâ€™t really care if I make anyone sad by killing my self because my friends and family shouldnâ€™t have took me for granted in the first place. Fuck family. Idgaf if they get depressed after I die. My life didnâ€™t matter anyway grades because I arenâ€™t even that good.
