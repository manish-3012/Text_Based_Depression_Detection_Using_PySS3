My boyfriend says he doesn't have any reason to live, is there anything I can sag to change his mind?He just says there aren't any reasons why it's worth living. Anything that might make it bearable requires a lifetime of work or a lot of money which requires more work. I'm not sure what I can say to change his mind and I just want to remind him that things can get better and that there are reasons to live.
Any suggestions?
