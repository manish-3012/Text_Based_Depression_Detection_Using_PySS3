Please helpI donâ€™t know what to do, lately the voices came back, my mood has been swinging even harder and my temper is going out of control and all I can do is cry, itâ€™s been slowly getting worse since Iâ€™ve turned 18 ( for many many years I never wouldâ€™ve thought Iâ€™ll make it past 18) . I can feel myself going slowly towards killing myself, not self harming but just passing away but Iâ€™m too scared to leave my family behind because I know they wouldnâ€™t be able to take it and with my families past mental health problems I donâ€™t want them to be upset over it. I know it sounds horrible but Iâ€™ve been forcing myself to stay alive because I donâ€™t want my boyfriend ( i live with my bf) to come back to my room to see my dead body, as much as heâ€™s causing me to have worse mood swings and stress, heâ€™s maybe perhaps the only reason I am alive right now, just because I donâ€™t want him to be the one discovering my body. I know Iâ€™ve got my family and I should stay alive for them but I really donâ€™t want to, but I canâ€™t get help because theyâ€™ll put me in a hospital again and my family would make me fly back home and stay with them. I have a therapist ( diagnosed with BPD for roughly a year) back home but I just seem to be unable to fully open up my feelings even though I have talked to him about many things. I have a tendency to slowly going back â€˜normalâ€™ just so people would leave me alone and think Iâ€™m getting better, thatâ€™s what at least my parents and my doctor think. Iâ€™ve got medications Iâ€™m supposed to take too ( trazodone) but I havenâ€™t been taking them for ages since all they do is make me tired. I know itâ€™s bad but Iâ€™ve been doing drugs mostly weed and for months itâ€™s been fine since it just relaxes me but lately Iâ€™ve been getting worse and itâ€™s not helping. I donâ€™t know why I donâ€™t want to get better I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me, having bpd even though it was only diagnosed last year has been such a big part of my life ( after I got diagnosed everything started to make sense when I was younger, I was suicidal when I was in primary school but I think my family just thought Iâ€™m joking and I was only a kid) and itâ€™s breaking me apart.

Please help me
