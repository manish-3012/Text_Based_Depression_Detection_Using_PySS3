When I tell people that I want to die--that I can't take the pain any more, am dysfunctional, and can think of nothing but slitting my wrists--they accuse me of "drama." There's only one way to prove I'm not acting and they're telling me so. Shit or get off the pot. Well, I'm going to shit.**Edit:** Damn! I've actually been avoiding Reddit because I was ashamed of posting this outburst.

To come back and find all these supportive, loving comments just lifted my mood to the point where I think I might have actually crossed the 'happiness threshold.'

Thank you all!

I'll reply to individual comments as I find the time; but, as usual after a severe bout of depression, the amount of catching up I have to do just with the daily chores of maintaining existence is kind of daunting at the moment.

Thank you all so much! 

I feel so much ... better!
