Mental Hospital, should you admit yourself? I did, AMA.I had been thinking of wanting to die lately. Every day, all day. And Iâ€™m not going to lie. I still do sometimes. But itâ€™s not all the time. Iâ€™ve been rapidly declining with anxiety &amp; depression, but was put on a waiting list for therapy. However with how rapid I was declining I needed immediate help. I felt desperate. I felt like I was going crazy. Like a psychotic break or something. THAT crazy. So I did research upon research upon research. About what mental hospitals are like. How to admit myself. Which one in my area had the best feedback/reviews. I was very afraid. As from what I read, it was only a 50/50 chance. Either a great decision. Or the worst. I was extremely desperate, so I packed my bag and left to the nearest hospital. Went to the front desk, and told them I wanted to die and needed help. And thatâ€™s the start of my story. 

If any of you are considering this, which I think you should, ask me anything youâ€™d like to know. So hopefully you wonâ€™t be as nervous as I am. Not all hospitals are the same. But theyâ€™re pretty similar. So Iâ€™ll do my best to answer your questions.
