I just want to dieIt's become such a normal thought, it scares me.
There's never anyone available to talk to in the middle of the night to stop me contemplating whether I should kill myself or not and the thoughts have become so haunting 

Sorry I know this is a waste of everyone's time I just feel so shit right now
