I've been homeless for almost a year and I'm doneI became homeless in June 2014.  I just couldn't afford rent.  For the past year I've been in a motel room for half of the week and sleeping in my car the rest of the week.  I'm still employed but its impossible to save money for a place to live.  Whenever I have money I use it on a cheap motel room because living out of a car is so awful.  But occasional cheap motel rooms are still expensive and take most of my paycheck.  I tried to call shelters last year but I always get a sorry we're filled so I gave up with that.  I have no family, no friends, no happiness, just a day in day out struggle to survive and I'm just done.  The thought of spending the next week in my car with only a few dollars in my wallet, only showering once or twice at a truck stop, makes me want to hang myself with my belt.  There's no point I'm stuck in this cycle of homelessness that I can't get out of when though I work my ass off.  I'm just done. I've never been happy, name  an awful thing few people experience in their life and I've probably experienced it.  I'm just done.
