I dont know what to do anymoreI.want to talk about it with friends or my brothers.. But i just can't. I want to get help but i dont know where to find it without having to tell my parents. And my relation with my parents is toxic. So itll make everything worst. I dont want to call, because i feel like words wont come out. I just want to talk to someone by chat. Im tired of pretending I'm okay
