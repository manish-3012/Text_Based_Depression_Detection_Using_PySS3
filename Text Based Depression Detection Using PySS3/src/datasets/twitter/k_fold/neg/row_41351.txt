Just want to die, why can't it be that simple?Hey, I'm 19 and I don't understand why should I live anymore. I have no friends, the last one that I had stopped answering me. I'm ugly and boring and dumb... I have no dreams, I feel so tired all the time... I just want to sleep but I keep waking up. I live in my parents basement and it is dark and has no windows... years ago somehow I got the idea in my head that love is the thing that people live for... I cant have that.. never.. now one will want me... I keep reading that I should fight but I don't really believe that anything good awaits me in the future I will have a long and painful live... people say that nobody should ever kill themselves and that is what i don't understand... why?
