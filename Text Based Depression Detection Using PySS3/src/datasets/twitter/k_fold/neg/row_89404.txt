I donâ€™t know anymoreIâ€™m gonna keep this short. I hate who I am how lazy and selfish I can be. I canâ€™t stand the world anymore, the stress and the anxiety and this goddamn fucking ulcerative colitis. I just want everything to end but I know how much pain I would cause to my friends and family. Iâ€™m scared guys. Like really scared.

One last thing I had a suicide attempt back in September obviously I woke up. I wish I never did.
