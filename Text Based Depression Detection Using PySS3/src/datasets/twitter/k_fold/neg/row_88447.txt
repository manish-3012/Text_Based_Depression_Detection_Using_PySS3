IsolationI have effectively isolated myself from everyone in my life, in one way or another. I had to drop out of high school a while back to get a full time job and help support my family. I quickly just stopped communicating with my high school buddies, and none of them try to contact me anymore. 
That left me with my girlfriend, best friend, and my family. After dating for a few months, my girlfriend ghosted me out of nowhere two days before my birthday. itâ€™s been weeks, no texts or calls back. Iâ€™ve given up. 
My best friend walked out of my life yesterday, I was â€œtoo depressedâ€ and it was â€œtoo much for her to deal withâ€. I rarely talked about my depression. 
The rental home that iâ€™ve worked so hard to keep is about to go into foreclosure, and I havenâ€™t secured another home yet. 
I feel like thereâ€™s nothing left for me here, like life simply cannot get any worse. I feel like thereâ€™s only one way out. But iâ€™m glad i no longer have anyone to miss me when iâ€™m gone.
