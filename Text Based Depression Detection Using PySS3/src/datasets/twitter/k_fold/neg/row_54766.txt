Have any of y'all ever checked yourself into a psychiatric hospital?I am strongly considering checking myself into my local psychiatric hospital.

However, I am transgender and bisexual so I have fears of being too vulnerable. Like the people working there might trigger me and make it worse.

What was it like?
