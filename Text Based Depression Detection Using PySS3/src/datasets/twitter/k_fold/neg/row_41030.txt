I canâ€™t do anything right and Iâ€™m giving up on trying anythingEvery time I do anything at work I do it wrong and someone has to clean up after me and Iâ€™m supposed to be doing my classes online but I havenâ€™t been able to because I always mess it up and Iâ€™ve just ghosted my classes not that it really matters I donâ€™t think I have long enough to use the education all Iâ€™ve done is read about legal cases, unidentified decedents and speed runs. Hell I canâ€™t even seem to have a simple conversation this has been going on for wayyyy too long I think Iâ€™m going to stay in bed forever.
