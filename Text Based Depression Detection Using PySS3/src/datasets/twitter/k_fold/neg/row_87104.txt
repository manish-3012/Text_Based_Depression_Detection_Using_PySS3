I think I'm pathetic for wanting to dieI am pathetic for considering suicide for the mediocre shit I go through. I have it so good. I will always have it so good. I am just so fucking weak that I can't handle even the most minor failure. It makes no sense. And yet my brain keeps telling myself that nobody cares about me, that I'm a waste of space, I'll never help anyone, that everyone is disappointed in me or doesn't think twice about me, that the only people who have helped me have done so out of professional obligation, that they don't really care.  

I don't know, what is the point of it all? We're driven by different things, and I'm wondering if I'll ever feel happy, if I'll ever be satisfied, or if I'll just spend the rest of my life punching myself in the head because I'm never good enough. What kind of life is that?

Yet I don't know what will happen once I die. How can the brain comprehend its own non-existence? It's unfathomable.
