Rant. Someone to talk to would be nice.21M In case anybody gives a shit.

The girl who made me more happy than anything in the world wants nothing to do with me. 

She said she couldn't date me because she was too busy... and the she started dating another dude.

It makes me not want to be alive. 

She made me not want to be anywhere else in the world. She was the reason I looked forward to waking up when I went to bed. She is so pretty. :(

I would choose to spend my life with her in a heartbeat.

I have to work in the department next to her. My stomach drops when I see her come to work.

 She broke up with me... and I have to be alone. While she gets to be in a relationship.
