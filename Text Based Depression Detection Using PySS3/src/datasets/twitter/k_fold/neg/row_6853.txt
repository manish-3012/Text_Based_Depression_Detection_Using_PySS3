What's the point?25 year-old guy here. I'm comfortable with spending most of my time alone but lately something went off. My usual routine of boozing it up and playing online games doesn't really cut it anymore. In the recent days I found myself doing some work around the apartment instead of distracting myself in front of the computer.
Moreover, this girl I had some history with messaged me after a year of nothing wanting to hang out, but now it's been 4 days she isn't replying to me. I know I shouldn't think about it much but I feel angry at how much it gets to me.
I know I should just put my shit together like a normal functioning adult but I'm not sure I want to.
