Every time I call the suicide hotline I feel even worseTo start with I can never get a hold of someone and I always come out more alone feeling and depressed. Is there an alternative to immediate help? I'm also asked if I can hold, I imagine in case someone needs more help and I can't help but say yes.. for that reason. Should I say no? What can I do when I feel like the moment is in hand?
