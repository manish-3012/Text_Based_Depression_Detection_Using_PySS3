Just need a little helpI'm just, super irrational right now. Not necessarily suicidal but definitely self harming. I seriously considered putting a screw driver through my palm earlier, who does that!? I had a meltdown in front of friends I've had for years. I asked them for help because I'd already hurt myself, but I think they didn't like that. They did help though, to their credit. I think it's been building up for years. My partner said those friends said I'm not the same anymore. I've really been trying to reach out more because I'm not feeling right and i think Prednisone is affecting that. I'mean just not getting support and/or outright hostility. I think that means it'seems me. I'm feeling very burdensome and needy. Validation I guess. Needy and middle school. So hey Internet strangers, put up with my bullshit because no one else wants to. I went through all this goddamn work to make new account and a throwaway so it's all alright.
