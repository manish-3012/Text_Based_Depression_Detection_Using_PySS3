I just want outI just want out. I feel that at this point Iâ€™ve irrevocably ruined my life. Itâ€™s all been non stop self destructive behavior for the past 3 years, and I have no one to blame but myself. I canâ€™t reset this, and I canâ€™t go back in time. Itâ€™s just ruined, all of it. I canâ€™t major in what I wanted to anymore, I ruined the relationship that I thought would be everything, and I donâ€™t have anything I dream of being anymore. The only thing that stops me most days is that I donâ€™t have any access to gun. I just want out. I just want out. And it just feels like thereâ€™s no options anymore, and I just know itâ€™s all my fault.
