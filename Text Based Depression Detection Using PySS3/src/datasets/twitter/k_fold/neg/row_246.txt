I have HSV1. I really contemplating ending my life tonight.I did everything right. I was in a long term, monogamous relationship. We both got tested before having sex. Except they donâ€™t test for HSV, and my ex didnâ€™t tell me he got cold sores. I ended up contracting HSV1 genitally after a year of being together. He broke up with me in December and is now in a new relationship. He can be happy and feel love again. He cheated on me and has cheated on his current girlfriend. But heâ€™s still a desirable person because he has HSV1 orally. 

Iâ€™ve been left tainted, and disgusting. I am now destined to live a life without sex, or love. I read posts on Reddit and Iâ€™m reminded over and over how Iâ€™m worthless now because I have a permanent STD. I was also so careful with sex, Iâ€™ve never had a one night stand. And yet my life is over. There is no point in living if Iâ€™m going to be alone for the rest of my life.
