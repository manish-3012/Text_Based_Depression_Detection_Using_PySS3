It's all in my headI've been thinking and fantasising about death so much lately, it's hard to stop, even though I'm trying not to. I still have this loop running in my head that is me trying to convince myself I shouldn't be alive. I try not to dwell on it, but once I start thinking about it, it's really almost impossible to stop. I tell myself over and over all the reasons not to do it, but I'm literally arguing with myself. I'm never going to get better am I
