Born to commit suicideIâ€™ve always thought about why I was here and what I was meant to do but you know after while I got to thinking that maybe I was put here to kill myself and ever since that thought it has stuck with me that I was meant to do that so Iâ€™m wondering if anyone else has thought this?
