Iâ€™m slowly losing myself.Nothing pleases me anymore. I try to do the things I used to love, but it never works. I still feel miserable. I feel trapped in a place where I no longer wanna be in. Iâ€™m not fucking scared anymore, Iâ€™d do it in a heartbeat if I could. I feel so selfish when people around me try to cheer me up and it doesnâ€™t work. I already know theyâ€™ve given up on me, but itâ€™s fine.
