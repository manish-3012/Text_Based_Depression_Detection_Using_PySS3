i'm over the linefor the last week i haven't been able to sleep for more than 1-2 hours through out the day. i woke up today to find 5 cigarette type burns on my wrist. i started hearing voices/songs two days ago...some of my fav songs play, and voices that i hear sometimes tend to be mocking me in a little girls voice, or my own voice telling me to just do it. i woke up with my heart beating on the floor to find out i have burns on my right arm, i don't know how they got there but what i do remember was when i was going to pee in my bathroom hearing my own voice so vividly saying to just do it, end it, and then i wake up on my floor with burns on my hand...i'm afraid to close my eyes...and i can't stop drinking.
