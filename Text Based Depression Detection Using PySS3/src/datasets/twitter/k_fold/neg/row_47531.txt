Done with school, done with lifeJust graduated from college after what felt like an endless struggle to meet everyone's expectations and thought I would feel relief. Went to the graduation ceremony to please my parents, had a panic attack, saw the disappointment in my parent's eyes. 

Lately I've been feeling more and more desperate to escape myself. OCD, Hypochondriasis, PTSD... depression as the cherry on top. Back pain from a bulging disc, daily panic attacks, leg pain... I don't want to die but I feel like i don't have any more options. I need relief. Doctors throw pills at me and they just create more symptoms. Lately I feel like I can't do this anymore. The only person keeping me in this life is my boyfriend.
