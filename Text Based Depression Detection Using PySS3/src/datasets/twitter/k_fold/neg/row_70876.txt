Just wrote a suicide letterI think about what it would be like to end it every once in a while, but today I took it a step further. I actually wrote something for my *"loved ones"* to read if I would ever go through with it.

People would say there's no point in me killing myself, I'm not even 18 and I have my whole life ahead of me, but I haven't found my purpose and I'm almost done trying. Everything is grey and uninteresting. The only person who actually made me happy was my ex from a year ago, but that was for short bursts of time and probably not because of her personally, but because I needed affection.

I'm probably a pussy for my reasoning and for this post.

Even if I sleep it off, I'll probably feel the same way tomorrow night.
