It just feels inevitable.Closest I was to going through with it was NYE going into 2019. Was deep into writing the suicide note and for some reason I stopped.

It was pretty much non-existent for all of 2019 and popped up once earlier this year.

but recently literally everything that angers me to any extent every single day makes me want to just go through with it and kill myself because some problems literally just can't be solved.

i can easily just grab the huge kitchen knife and slit my throat right now. literally the only reason i've hesitated to go through with it is the same reason as anyone, family. don't give a fuck about anything else. there are a fuckton of people that for whatever reason i wish would do the same thing. but i can easily admit i'd be down to go first.

as much as i want to, i know i'd regret it the second i attempted it. but what do you do when you don't *want* to be better? i don't have any drive to restart most of the other parts of my life. i know how much of a process it's going to be, just to live an at-most decent life at worst-a slog. instead of throwing time/effort/money into a pit, i could just off myself Â¯\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

being frustrated with something shouldn't get normal people to this point every time. but it feels right, feels like this is where i'm *supposed* to end up every time.

it just feels inevitable. whether it's assisted \~40-50 years from now or whatever. even earlier, once the people i care about are gone, i have 0 ties to the world. people say nothing good comes easy but nothing good is worth the huge fucking process it takes to get there so what's the purpose of pretending like i want it? wasting all that time/effort/money just to not even have that guaranteed?
