This article made me chuckle, it should not have but come onThis article was insisting on how you're supposed to call 911 or something like that without hesitation if you're having suicidal thoughts. Made me chuckle. Am I supposed to call them every day? I feel like they have some better things to do and honestly if I've dealt with my shit up until now, why bother someone else. 

Also, what are they gonna do? Arrest my brain or some shit? Technically yes, my brain is responsible of attempted murder on my body, and premeditation too, lol. Or maybe depression. Depression has been trying to kill me for years but this bitch hasn't succeeded, and no matter what it's not going to, but yes, officers, it would be nice to stop fighting against a fucking invisible murderer for once. So if you could arrest it for me that would be amazing. 

Hmpf why not call 911 after all? 

But for real guys take care of yourselves, just wanted to share my random thoughts and hope I at least made you smile a bit. Even if it's in your head.
