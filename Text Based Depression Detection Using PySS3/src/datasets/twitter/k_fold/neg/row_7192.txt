Spiraling DownI was never really good at anything in life weather it be studies, sports, didn't have any hobbies or any talent at all. I always considered myself  very lucky I have an amazing family, always go what I needed and I asked for. When I was very young I was diagnosed with optic atrophy in my left eye. I was very luck in the sense that most people suffering from optic atrophy lose vision in both eyes. A year back my life was a mess I was depressed, I was doing something that I hated and failing miserably at life I used to post at sanctioned suicide all the time, but I gathered myself and fought back, got a job changed courses and I was happy this past year went on holidays made friends and learned important life lessons. It was a good year. Untill Friday last week when I went to a doctor regarding blurry vision in my right eye, I got all the tests done they put a bunch of drops in my eye and stuff and that's when I got the news that the optic nerve in my right is somehow degenerating that I am going to lose vision in my right and be completely blind. All I have done for the past weekend is drink and drink I haven't told anyone in my family. I can't tell them or face them I don't want to live like this I don't want to be blind I just want to be free of this life
