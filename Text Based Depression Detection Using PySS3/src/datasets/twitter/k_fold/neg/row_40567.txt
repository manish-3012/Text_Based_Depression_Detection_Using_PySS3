Not sure if this is allowed, feel free to delete if it's not.So, I have been trying to reach out to as many people as I possibly can lately. I have my dark moments and sometimes honestly all I need is a friend. I don't have many of those (not my choosing...people just see me and assume I'm a bitch). So what I was wondering was... If there is anyone else in this situation, if anyone wants some real life friends to meet up with on occasion, talk to, maybe go for walks... Maybe we can make some groups by location and do that? It could be very helpful to some people. Again, if this isn't allowed, then I apologize. But I figured it's worth a try, and if even one person is interested and I make a new friend or am able to help someone, then it's worth it for me. 
My name is Jennifer, and I live in NH. If anyone would be interested in this, be helped by it, etc.. please leave a comment or PM me. :)
