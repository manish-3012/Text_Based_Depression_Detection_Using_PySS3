I survived my attemptI jumped off a bridge and I survived. The river under the bridge was frozen. I thought I could break the ice and drown. During the fall I felt so relieved and happy. Everything went white. While I was falling I saw people that I never actually seen but felt like I knew them. It was me, young woman and a young man. But they weren't my parents. These figures felt so warm. And I felt happy and reunited for the longest time. Unfortunately I did not break the ice and I broke my neck on the impact. I was in hospital for the last week. And I finally got my phone today.  And they are planning to send me to mental hospital for 2 weeks. And they might send me when I recover from my injury. I just feel so scarred right now. The fact that I still haven't left this world. The thought of never feeling this much euphoria ever again just upsets. I will attempt again. I will escape this world.
