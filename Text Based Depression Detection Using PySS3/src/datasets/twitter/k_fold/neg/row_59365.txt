I'm not sure how it's supposed to work, but I think I'm hurting.Almost everything I do now is an exercise in pushing away anxiety, I remember times before when it didn't hurt so much. I was bold and strong and had no fucks to give but it slowly fell away from me as I got older. Now I feel like I'm a nudge away from doing something drastic. I've got a loving and supportive family, a decent prospect for the future, but it always feels like I'm just a childish replica of a human being. I think about suicide more often than I'd like, and it's a battle just to push that away on top of the anxiety that fills me daily. I can't even leave the house now without sensations of dread, sometimes to the places I used to love. I want to get  out but those moments of freedom are getting harder and harder to grab. I'm now useless and relying on others to help me as much as I despise the idea and now I'm so lost I just want to be done.
