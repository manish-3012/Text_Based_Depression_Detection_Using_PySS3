Losing everything that mattersIâ€™ve been unhappy for a long time. Iâ€™ve never been â€œwellâ€ ever. I grew up in a pretty bad home situation and my young adult life had other traumatic experiences I was never able to deal with . I met someone, and felt like I had a shot at a normal life, normal relationship, normal family, normal job. We have a beautiful flat in a quiet neighbourhood that we put a lot of time into decorating together. Shopping for groceries together and cooking meals together and looking at dogs and houses with fences for dogs. I didnâ€™t have a real meltdown for 3 years. Everything I wanted-stability, normal.

Hes left to his parents. Heâ€™s tired of me being too emotional and not making as much salary as he does. I lack ambition.  


I need to be out of our place in a couple weeks. I donâ€™t have family or friends to fall back on. Iâ€™m losing his family too. Iâ€™m supposed to start at a new job too so there wonâ€™t be a paycheque for 4 weeks. I have a lot o debt, and I canâ€™t afford more than half a rent alone. I donâ€™t have enough to cover a new lease anyway even with roommates. Iâ€™m terrified of living with a stranger. Iâ€™m terrified of going to a shelter.  I looked at one place that had a shared bathroom and there was black stuff all over the floor and it was still too expensive for me.  he wonâ€™t speak to me on the phone, Iâ€™ve been living in our place by myself. Heâ€™s taking our cat, Which really hurts because Iâ€™ve had her for 8 years and sheâ€™s probably the only being who still loves me but itâ€™s not fair to her if I canâ€™t provide adequate food and home.

Thursday night he had me sent to psych emerg. They showed up with 3 police cars and all the neighbours came outside and then I had to sit and cry in a public hall way because there were no beds and they told me if I ran away Iâ€™d be arrested, it was completely humiliating.

When I got out on Friday night I realized he did it so that Iâ€™d be out of the house so he could come pick up more of his things. Iâ€™ve been taking sleeping pills since that and only get up for the bathroom. 


I donâ€™t understand how you can love someone for three years and build a life together and then cancel it.


I just donâ€™t see a way out of this. The public mental health options werenâ€™t helpful.  Iâ€™m scared of death but my life feels like a mean joke right now and I donâ€™t see how it can improve. 

Iâ€™m sorry the post is long . I might delete it later I donâ€™t know
