In need of help. Tried everything. So i've tried seemingly every medication, been to therapy, and tried to make some real lifestyle changes. And yet, I'm still plagued with these suicidal thoughts. I've dealt with this seemingly treatment resistant depression for four years now. I really don't know how much longer I can take it. has anyone found something that helps that maybe I haven't tried?
