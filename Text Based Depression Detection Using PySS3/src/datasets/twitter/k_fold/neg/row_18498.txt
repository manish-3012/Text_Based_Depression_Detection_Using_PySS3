I hate my intrusive thoughts.Everyday I'll be doing something normal or working or something like that and I'll think about killing myself randomly or really gorey stuff for no reason. I don't like being left home alone because I'm afraid my thoughts will manifest into actions. Like I'll think of bashing my head open with a rock or jumping off a 20 story building randomly. I hate it so much I just want to be normal and not feel like this everyday of my stupid fucking useless life. Side note, I'm really sorry for the disorganized way I've written this I'm sorry.
