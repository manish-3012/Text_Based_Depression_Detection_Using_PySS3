Useless burden that makes things worseThat sums me up and i have the potential of hurting only 3 people so what is the point i don't want them to hurt but i really don't know anymore they only ever hurt me its a constant cycle of me being hurt and then wanting to hurt them sometimes to the point of wanting to kill them and then feeling so sick for what i had wanted to do until i am hurt again.  then the cycle continues. My counselor has told me that they are just delusions and that i am not actually being harmed by them but the thoughts are so real. i cant sleep, eat and function like anyone else and i hurt and burden the only people that really care.
