Can't fit a square through a round hole.Sometimes I wish there was legal euthanasia for people who can rationally prove they're (both ethically and economically) better off dead.
But then I remember I wouldn't be able to afford it.

The thing is I simply have a nonviable personality:
1) I don't enjoy any productive activities.
2) I'm not interested in money or helping others on a regular basis.
3) All dreams and goals I have are physically impossible to ever become true.
4) I don't believe there's any "grand reward" in the end of life.
5) I hate working for nothing.

Therefore, I don't do anything and don't plan on doing anything ever. 
But that's fine, I guess. Or would be, if I could just quit right now. Sadly, I'm also a coward, who would never be able to go through with suicide. I can't even force myself to do it indirectly, like run away from home, so I could starve to death and no one would be able to save me.

Why can't I just hibernate like some animals do? I don't care about anything what's outside my head anyway.

Eh, whatever.

So, there are two ways my life can go from here:
1) I'll keep on being me until my mother would die or get tired of my shit, and I'll end up on the street where I'll die within months.
2) I'll ask my mother to force and supervise me to hold some job and/or education. I'll eventually snap (as it already happened in the past) and end up in prison, hospital or as in paragraph above.

Sometimes I wonder how many people could say their life goal is inevitable. I should probably be grateful, instead of whining about how I'm not getting it immediately.
