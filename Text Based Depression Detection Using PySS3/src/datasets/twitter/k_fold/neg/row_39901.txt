Need advice
I'm really struggling lately thinking about things that happened years ago ago and feel guilty. I want to apologize and make admendants but am concerned it will only make things worse for bringing up past events...I don't want to upset the person who said he has moved on from the incident, however we don't talk anymore. I feel trapped and have a pit in my stomach a lot of the time.

On top of this the way I'm viewing the guilt is that I must apologize for every thing that happened between us or otherwise it will not be okay. On top of this I've developed a fear of guilt and if I do things, then I must apologize otherwise I will not be able to function even although it may be out of context or not needed. My mind just needs to apologize or I will feel trapped.

What's happening to me? What can I do about it? Thanks in advance.
