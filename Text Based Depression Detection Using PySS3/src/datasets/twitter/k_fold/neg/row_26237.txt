Practicing your planFor the past few days Iâ€™ve been having these intrusive and obsessive thoughts of how horrible I am (please spare me the â€œyouâ€™re a good personâ€ gambit because Iâ€™ve done some really shitty things to people I love). Theyâ€™ve been accompanied by visualizing killing myself either by eating a gun (which I donâ€™t have access to) or by hanging myself. 

I learned how to tie a noose today. I â€œpracticedâ€ twice by putting it around my neck, without anchoring the other end to anything, and tightening it just so I could get an idea of what it feels like. I inadvertently gave myself some rope burn during one of the â€œpracticeâ€ runs which is pretty unpleasant, but itâ€™s welcome because it somewhat distracts me from the storm in my head by giving me something to focus on.

Has anyone else ever done this kind of trial run type thing? I feel like Iâ€™m trying to acclimate myself to the entire scenario so itâ€™s not as scary when I finally pop.
