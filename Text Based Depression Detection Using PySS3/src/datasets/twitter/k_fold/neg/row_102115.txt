So incredibly stupid. Can't stand myselfI am trapped.

Trapped in this out of control brain. Trapped in a cycle of volatile and extraordinarily intense emotions. 

Trapped in a marriage with a man that has no respect for me because of crazy emotional bs.

Trapped here because I made the mistake of having a kid. Losing a parent to suicide is probably one of the most damaging things that could happen to a kid. I can't decide what is worse, my out of control emotions, lack of patience, over reacting, inconsistent parenting and no boundaries - or just making myself disappear and leaving him a letter trying to explain...

But how would I ever explain.

I don't want to keep being this person. I have not been able to change any behaviors. They have only gotten worse.

Recently, we bought a house.
Then my husband lost his job.
Then I threw away a high paying job because I can't control my emotions.
Now we are unemployed, without insurance and I am ready to kill myself.

But it is a cycle... Feeling so stupid and wanting to die, but then knowing if I did it would only cause more problems for my family.

So I hurt myself. I slice myself up and can't really tell anyone. It's just attention seeking. As is the suicidal talk of course.

I've been through lots of therapy. Tried dbt and within weeks was homicidal and suicidal. I quit. I hated the therapist.

I'm on medications. Luckily one of them is klonopin so at least when I start thinking in circles I can take a pill or two and cry myself to sleep.

There's nothing that wrong with me. I'm pathetic. I just don't want to change., I would have by now.

I hate myself so much, I can't kill myself although I feel it creeping closer and closer, so I just want to rip myself apart. I just want to cut and cut and cut and cut. Im sorry for being so dramatic. I just don't know what else to do besides punish myself for being so stupid. 

I don't get it and I never will.
