Still waiting on that switch...It's 2017 for nobody's sake, surely the technology is there. Just a flick of a switch and I'm instantly gone. Quick, easy, painless, and most importantly...guaranteed. That's all I ask, but clearly that's asking too much. Nope, clearly society thinks it's better we maim ourselves, so that we might survive and suffer life even more. I hate this, I just tired of living. Tired of this life, this world, this pointlessness.
