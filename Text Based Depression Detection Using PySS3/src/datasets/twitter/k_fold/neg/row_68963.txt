I want to crash my carI have had suicidal ideation for a long time now. Sometimes lately the urge gets so strong that it does startle me. Especially when I'm driving.. I want to just let go so badly. Let my car run into something and don't try to stop it. I remember that I don't want to hurt others. Maybe someone will hit me instead.. then I can have what I want but I don't have to do it myself. I really think I shouldn't be driving most of the time, but I need to get to work and home, so. 

Lots of aspects of my life are so complicated right now. My happiness is so low. I still care way too much what everyone thinks of me and I feel them judging me. I can't be myself at all. I can't talk about this feeling because of judgement.. I can't do anything because I'm too scared.

I hope someone hits my car.
