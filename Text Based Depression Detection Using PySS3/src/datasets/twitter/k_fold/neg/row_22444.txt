If I can't fix these problems, then I probblably have to shoot myself.So at the time I am serving in the military. The 2 main problems I have is that I am inferior and I have no social life. Every time we are told to do something, everyone else does it better and I always feel like shit. It's so tiring to see people do things successfully without any effort and I'm just too fucking retarded to do the most basic tasks. How the fuck do I fix this? Can this even be fixed? If i'm stuck like this for the rest of my life, than I don't really see any point in living my life as a parasitic burden. 

Then there is my social life: I have become the master of small talk. I can easily talk to people for 10 seconds which is an improvement over my never make any talk attitude. The problem is that I can only hold a conversation for 10 seconds. After that I don't know what to say and I always fear and feel that i'll say something stupid which I often do. I desperately want to have a deeper connection with someone, but when the conversations last for 10 seconds, I don't see how that can happen. How the fuck do I get over this obstacle? Certainly there is something that I can do, but considering how shitty I am at everything, maybe I truly am stuck like this for the rest of my life and if that's the case, well then I hope it is a short live.
