I just don't know...I don't now if I'm just lazy, tired, lonely, depressed or all the above, (these are all things people around me have accused me of). For years now I've been feeling so lacklustre living life. I've never felt long lasting joy in anything a do.  I'm not unloved, I'm surround by people who cherish me. I know this I and I repeat it to myself whenever I get really unmotivated with life, but sometimes it just isn't enough, and I end up feeling like trash for thinking like that. I've never vocalised these thoughts but I'm almost 30 now and something about this year just set me off to look for this reddit. I don't know what's going on with my life. Writing this is difficult... I'm having trouble breathing, my hands keep shaking, I'm crying... I just don't know what's going on with me... I don't know what to do...
