I will jump of a bridgeI can't deal with the effects of antipsychotics did on my life

I can't accept because of the psychiatrist, and by extension my family, I lost the girl I love 

I can't deal with being alone because the meds pushed everyone away

Goodbye and a big thank you for all the help â¤
