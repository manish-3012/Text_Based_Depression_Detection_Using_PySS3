I canâ€™tMy stepfather have just beaten me up. He does this every now and then. My mom just watched me getting beaten by him and she screamed and shouted at me afterwards, because I fought back. Both my mom and my stepfather want me to move to my dad, who obviously doesnâ€™t want me either. My two siblings(from my stepfather) are slowly starting to hate me every time I fight back. Even though Iâ€™m trying my best to love them and I would do anything for my siblings but I just canâ€™t do this shit. Also my boyfriend (We are both males) who I have known for years doesnâ€™t give a fuck about my depression and my situaton at home. And while I was questioning him about why he would stop caring about me he said â€œidkâ€ multiple times which didnâ€™t really give me any answer on what I would have done wrong. He even said that he doesnâ€™t know if he loves me anymore and Iâ€™m pretty sure he wouldnâ€™t even cry when I will kill myself. Nobody will. Nobody fucking cares about me. Iâ€™m almost sure that everyone would just be happier if I would be gone. I donâ€™t have any friends and I have been bullied my whole fucking life. In the past few months my depression got worse and worse each fucking day and Iâ€™m trying to get help but no one cares. Iâ€™m so tired of this. Why does everyone who I love turned away from me. I think I have never done anything useful in my fucking miserable life so I donâ€™t know why the fuck Iâ€™m even complaining because I wouldnâ€™t deserve to be loved anyways. I am just a fucking failure.(Oh yeah and Iâ€™m 15 years old if you would like to know)
