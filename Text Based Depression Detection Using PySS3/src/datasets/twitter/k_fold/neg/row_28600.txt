Hearing Impaired Homeless man just had his motorhome impounded (Seattle, Washington)[Here is the main post about what happened.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/m66ea/hearing_impaird_homeless_mans_motorhome_impounded/)

In brief, I just found out a few minutes ago my motorhome was impounded without notice. I don't have money to get it back. Why am I posting? That motorhome was one of the few things keeping me willing to stay alive. Without it, life isn't worth staying alive for. For me, anyway.

I was in trouble like this a year or so ago. 
[Here's the main post about that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/df2u3/help_homeless_disabled_mans_motorhome_impounded/)

About that time there was a lot of desperate people fallen on hard times begging for help--and there was a very long thread with literally hundreds of people complaining about the reddit beggars. I realized I was one of the people they were complaining about. For me personally that thread was appalling to read, and it discouraged me from asking for help again. I don't think anyone's going to want to help me out a second time. Compassion fatigue. It's too much to ask of anyone.

About a dozen people back then offered to help me. Only one actually followed through--he's the one got my motorhome out of impound. Everyone else disappeared.

I won't reveal too much personal detail--I won't allow anyone to call the cops on me. I have been homeless a very very long time. I never wanted to be. I don't enjoy it. I tried everything I could think of, to get out. Nothing works. Most of all I'm tired of the punitive attitudes and the indifference I encounter everywhere. I've just had enough.

My issues are more in the way of practical issues than of depression. 

I have just enough money set aside for a bottle of helium to suicide with. I won't do it just yet. And I won't allow anyone to call cops on me, and I don't need a therapist--I need my motorhome back. It's a broken down motorhome, can't drive it more than 2 or 3 blocks or so at a time, but it was the difference between a life I could endure and one I can't.

I know you guys are the anti-suicide people. I don't know how much to trust any of you--you might decide to put me in jail or in a mental institute, both of which to me are worse than being homeless.

Cops claiming they're there to protect me. Lie. They're the ones I most need protecting FROM. They're the ones took my motorhome away. They're the ones fined me more than $5,000 in parking tickets and impound fees over the last 10 years. I could've bought land with that $5,000 and be living there instead. That's what I was trying to do.

Anyway, this is probably my last posted thread (maybe). I don't even have a jacket or sleeping bag anymore against the oncoming winter. I lost faith in people a long time ago.

I just want my motorhome back. It'll have to be towed, because the radiator is broken, and I couldn't find a replacement for it. Brakes are very weak too. I don't have money to fix any of it.

Not expecting help. I'm mostly just saying goodbye. But I read you guys would prefer I post this first... so let me do that before I change my mind and just delete this without posting.

Sorry to dump. I will probably delete this in a few hours. I shouldn't have posted this.

**EDIT:** Ok. I think my rights were just violated. Just tried to use Telecommunications Relay via IM--they're a service that allows hearing impaired people to use voice phones. The relay operator called the tow company I think is responsible, and they said "We don't accept relay calls". I believe this is illegal discrimination against the disabled and I've got it logged (grounds for a lawsuit?). Also had the relay operator call the police department and I am completely unable to get to any live person. All I get is a maze of machine messages. I can't get any information on my motorhome. Neither the tow company nor the police department will talk to me via Relay.

**EDIT 2:** A helpful redditor made a call for me and confirms that Lincoln Towing indeed impounded my motorhome. Apparently ticketed for "Commercial vehicle parked on a public street between 2am to 5am outside an Industrial Zone". He was able to find out the charge is $175.97 (plus two $45 tickets), plus an additional $18 every 12 hours to get it out. So time is of the essence here. He says police officer suggested I contact a lawyer for the discrimination against the hearing impaired.

**EDIT 3:** I managed to contact someone at Real Change Newspaper, a local paper that serves the homeless community. No immediate help, but they're *very* interested in my story. They want me to visit them at their office and they are looking into contacting some civil rights lawyers. Impounding my motorhome isn't illegal, but refusing to talk to the relay operator *is*. And I've got the logs. I don't think there's much of a case, but we'll see. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. Just paid $47 on one ticket--the other was issued during the impound so I don't even know the ticket number on that one. Charges are piling up at $36 a day. Not being able to work the phones due to my hearing is a real handicap. 

Nobody's stepped up to help with the motorhome yet. Hands still shaking as I write this.
