Can anyone help?This is my first time asking for something like this so please try to be understanding. I am a 39m who is divorced. I had to move back in with my parents after trying to survive for a few years on my own. Everything has gone down hill and idk what to do. I constantly get belittled and made fun of by both my parents for being here. I had some bad health issues which put me in the hospital and afterwards I reached out to them for help. It was the first time in 15 years that we spoke. About a year later I moved in with them and it has been hell ever since. We live in a rural area which has made finding a full time job difficult and I cannot save enough to leave since I have to pay rent and bills for here. I am not sure what I am asking for but really looking for advice or help please. I live in Arizona if it helps.
