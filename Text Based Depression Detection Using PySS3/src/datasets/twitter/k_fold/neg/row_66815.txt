Mental health systemI hate how you wont be taken seriously unless you present to the ER with a million pills already in your stomach. Even in Canada, sure it's a free visit, but they refuse to admit you or do anything other than make you sit in the hallway for 7 hours before sending you home (ALONE). Soemtimes I genuinely need an inpatient stay but they just wont admit me unless I've already made an attempt and am currently dying.
