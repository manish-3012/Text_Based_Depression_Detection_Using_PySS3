Death seems like the best optionI'm just so lost and I feel like everything I do will lead to failure. I'm a 19 year old male and I'm currently thinking of taking a break from college, but even that seems wrong and setting me up for failure. 
I don't even know what I want to do with my life, or anything. Death feels like the best option because I don't even know what to do or how to do it. And its not like my life is even bad. I have a good family, good friends, a caring girlfriend, but I still want to die and don't know what to do with my life anymore. 
I just don't know anymore.
