My BDD is at its worstI have been struggling with mental health my whole life. Since the start of quarantine, my BDD has gotten out of control. I spend hours every day measuring my face, and when I am not staring at a mirror I am in bed crying. Once I leave the mirror, the image I have of myself in my head gets distorted to the point I just want to rip my face off. My mother is not helping either, teasing me and screaming her ass off when I go look in the mirror. I want to believe I look decent, but I know I am just lying to myself. Please help, someone...


Sorry for the rant...
