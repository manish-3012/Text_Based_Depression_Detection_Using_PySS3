I hate my existenceI HATE everything about myself. The way i look. The way i talk. My voice. My fucking accent. My nose. My ears. My eyes. My goddamn physique. My fucked up genetics. 

My lack of â€œworthy achievementsâ€. The way i canâ€™t communicate with another human like a fucking â€œnormalâ€ person is â€œsupposedâ€ to do. The amount of fucks i give about what everyone thinks of me. The effort i put to look â€œnormalâ€, still ending up failing to look normal. Thereâ€™s no way i could ever socialise like a â€œnon-retardedâ€ adult should.

My useless delusions, unrealistic expectations, and always ending up worse than i could ever expect. Fantasising is one of the main reasons iâ€™ve wasted time iâ€™m never getting back. 

I donâ€™t get people, never have, never think i can. Especially women. Iâ€™ve lived my life with minimum interaction with women and now iâ€™m self-conscious about everything about my behaviour and looks which could be a turn off for women. 

My low af self-esteem and massive anxiety is all life is. I hate my existence. I wish i didnâ€™t have to exist. This is PURE terror. This is life.
