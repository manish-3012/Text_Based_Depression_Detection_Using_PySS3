The world doesn't care.I've come to the conclusion that the world literally just doesn't care about me. Nothing and nobody can help me, not even myself. I don't even feel like writing a whole paragraph about my failed life because, like I said, the world doesn't care. I'll just keep everything inside so it continues eating me alive.

In the nicest way possible, I just wanna cease to exist.
