How is 'talking it out' supposed to help if I can't even articulate what the problem is?I'm on my second year of CBT (before that I was in psychoanalysis for seven years) and it always seems like the shapeless nameless Thing that's bothering me only seems to exist *between* the things the therapist wants to talk about. Not a single question either therapist has asked me has opened up a channel of conversation that I have found helpful.

My childhood, my love life, my 'career', my social life...they are all fairly normal (but not normal enough to be boring) and they all seem completely irrelevant to my depression. The Thing that's bothering me is older than all of them. If I believed in past lives I'd wonder if it came from there.

I don't think it's a chemical imbalance because none of the nine or ten meds I've tried seem to have made a difference. I have no interest in continuing to try meds until I find one that works because my gut is telling me that THE FUCKING SIDE EFFECTS WILL PROBABLY KILL ME FIRST.

I'm not sure what I'm trying to accomplish by posting this.
