I am going to kill myself tonightI wrote my letter last night

The only reason I didn't do it is because I thought there might be some chance my boyfriend would stay because everyone else has already given up on me

He didn't and today he told me he is no longer in love with me after 4 years

I am broken and beyond repair


I have nothing left to live for
