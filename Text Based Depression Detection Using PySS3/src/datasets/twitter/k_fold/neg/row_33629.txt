I feel a weight liftedI finally wrote my suicide note to my parents. Theyâ€™re the total reason why this is all happening. Iâ€™m still so scared and I need some words of encouragement. Iâ€™ve got 100 pills in front of me and plenty of chemicals in my closet. I plan to just make a comfy bed in my bathroom and go away from all this. Iâ€™ve got the perfect song playing. To anyone reading this, I love you.
