i cant anymoreiâ€™m so tired of this year. its had its moments but its been so mentally draining iâ€™ve considered seriously harming myself more than 10 times. i feel so alone and sad but i put on a happy mask everyday. iâ€™m still trying to find myself managing all this work and i canâ€™t do it. last grading period my grades were good because I was able to borrow an iPad which kept me on top of my work I felt good about going to virtual school. One month later my grades are terrible i no longer have the right materials and i feel like iâ€™m getting 2x the amount of work, i canâ€™t do it anymore i donâ€™t see the point in living. all this pressure and when i canâ€™t handle it I just say forget it and game my problems away. The work stacks, my grades slip, i ignore my problems and i suffer. i just want to be happy again i canâ€™t remember the last time i woke up and thought â€œtoday is gonna be a good dayâ€ or went to sleep thinking â€œtoday was greatâ€. i didnâ€™t ask for any of this i didnâ€™t ask to be born i didnâ€™t ask to exist. as iâ€™m typing this i have 15+ late assignments. honestly i donâ€™t see myself making it past 18. someone happened recently too which made me question myself, i donâ€™t know who i am or what iâ€™m doing anymore. i donâ€™t want my parents to feel like they werenâ€™t enough because they try i just canâ€™t take it anymore. if i didnâ€™t type this out you couldnâ€™t even tell that i was like this. why am i still living. i hate it here i donâ€™t wanna live anymore man..
