Haven't heard any bit of new advice in years. It's always the same thing that doesn't work.It's seeming like your life has to be super easy or you have to be really stupid to have advice help. I've exhausted everything years ago. Here I am, failed every college class I've ever taken, lost every breif job I've ever had, had every girl I've met leave me (every friend too), and I can't handle life. I'm in my early 20s, but I'm not YOU when YOU were in your early 20s. I can't make things happen even now. It's already over. I feel like I've heard everything and tried everything. 
I guess this is where it ends, finally. It's better than cracking under pressure and ending up in jail at least, but that's apparently my fault, because everyone else is used to having a life that allows them to do what they want.
Knowing reddit, I feel like this place won't help, but I'm just so done, I dont care. Or maybe I'll literally be the only person not to get their post approved as one last FU before I go
