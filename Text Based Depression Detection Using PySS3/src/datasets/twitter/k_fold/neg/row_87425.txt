Hating yourself is too easy. When you hate yourself, the creeps win.Whether that's the creep(s) in the Oval Office, the creep(s) at your shitty job, the creep(s) in your family who shamed you because you weren't their ideal/"normal", and the rest of it.

Just sayin', grasshoppers.  Self-acceptance first, then forge ahead.  Self-love eventually; I'm working on it too and I'm pushing 40.

Join the (good) freaks -- the decent/open-minded ones, not the creeps; break out of that self-hatred bubble and don't-let-the-bastards-grind-you-down sort of thing needs to be in your daily self-messaging.

There are so many of you that you can get together in person (esp. the ones in metro areas) and help each other out of that shame/self-hate-fest bubble.

Meetups, whatever.

Your new self-hatred-free/shame-free identity/being/consciousness/personality/life awaits you; the challenge is to discover, develop and claim it, grasshoppers.

It doesn't happen overnight but you must work to combat/shed the shame and self-hatred and self-blame, kiddoes.
