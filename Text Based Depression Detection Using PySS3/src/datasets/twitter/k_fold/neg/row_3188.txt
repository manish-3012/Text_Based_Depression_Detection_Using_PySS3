Staying alive is inhumaneFor some fucking reason, humans have a need for love and affection and all that other bullshit. Some of us are so goddamned lonely that normal people can't even fathom it. No matter the attempts I make to connect with people, I remain alone. The loneliness is deteriorating my mind and it's not too long before I snap.


Being alive is inhumane because the loneliness I feel when I see other people who are normal and can do this shit without even trying is unbearable. It's torment. Something I'll never have.

WHY DO WE HAVE THIS STUPID FUCKING NEED IF NOT EVERYONE CAN MEET IT!? DO I NEED A LOBOTOMY TO GET IT OUT? I CAN'T FUCKING TAKE IT ANYMORE.
