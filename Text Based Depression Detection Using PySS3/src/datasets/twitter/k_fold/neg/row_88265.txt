I can't live in this world like thisI am 27. And due to my own self, let my periodontitis get so bad out of humiliation and fear that my dentist will yell at me, that my teeth will start falling out probably within this year. I've brushed my teeth and used mouth wash for years but I didn't floss. I didn't think it was necessary. 
I won't be one of those people with missing teeth. How can I find a good woman looking like a monster? I won't. I would rather be dead than wonder what everyone is saying about me. At least if I'm dead I won't
hear their comments or think about it.

There is no good future for someone like me in this world.
No wife. No family. No good job.

So there's no point in me being here.
