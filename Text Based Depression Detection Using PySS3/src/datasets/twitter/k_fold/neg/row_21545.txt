SuicideI'm going to really do it today. My girlfriend is unhappy and she won't care if I'm finally dead. She's been so stressed out because of me. All my life I've struggled with suicide. Anyone that knows me knows this. I've said that I'm going to do it so many times but I think today I'm going to officially do it. My mother will suffer but I can't go through with this life anymore. I fail and fail and fail every single day. Everyone at work is getting promoted and I'm a purchaser with no future. I'm 26 and I'm going no where. I have a criminal record so I can't even live on my own. I can't get any better job than the one I have now.
