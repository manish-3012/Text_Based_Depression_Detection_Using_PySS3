I'm so tired of livingI just want some to fucking listen, first off sorry if my grammer sucks because I'm not really concerned about that right now.....anyways. I'm so fucking tired of everyone, I want someone to really listen and understand how hurting I really am everyday, sure maybe it's not the worst every single day but it doesn't take a scientist to understand that somethings wrong with me. I'm always struggling and it feels like it'll never end, how will I ever become the person I wanna be when I don't even know what that looks like. I am hopeless, a disappointment and a failure. I try to open up to people I know, only person I'm really open with is my girlfriend but she doesn't understand how hurt I am, I love her so much. She's my only friend and only person who doesn't dismiss me, but we've fought so much lately, I thought we were past all this but it's come back. I simply just wanna die, it's like I've been in this situation far to much this year. Too be honest I'm to much of a coward, hell even my girlfriend said that I'm a coward for not being open with my parents about how I struggle. There's a lot a struggle with but it'd take forever to do it all. I just want someone to understand, I'm sorry this is vague but I'm not sure how to write all of this. Fuck me, I wish I was never born.
