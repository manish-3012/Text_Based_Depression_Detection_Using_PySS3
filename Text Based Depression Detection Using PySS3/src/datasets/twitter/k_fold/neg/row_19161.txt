I don't really have anyone to talk to.I am feeling especially suicidal right now. I forgot my antidepressants last night, and additionally I am in the middle of a med switch. I feel hopeless, alone, and have been googling methods for a bit now. 

What I really want to do is go into the other room with my mom and tell her about how I'm feeling. Unfortunately, in April I attempted suicide and upturned my family's life. I know that speaking honestly with my mom will only serve to upset her, and myself because of it. 

I just want someone that will listen, that can hear me and comfort me without judgement.

It's been so long since I've felt loved. Physical contact seems hollow and insincere. I just want someone to hold me and touch me and tell me it'll be okay instead of crying or getting upset with me. I'm so desperate for true affection.
