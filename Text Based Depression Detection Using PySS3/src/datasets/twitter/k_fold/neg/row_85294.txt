DrivingI'm suicidal have been for a long while. I recently got my drivers license and can drive alone now. When I'm on the highway I always get the urge to swerve head on into a semi truck. I drive a small sunfire, it would kill me instantly but the trucker would be fine.. I'm so scared bc I'm so impulsive like I could end it within seconds and it scares me so much I'm trying so hard to stay alive.
