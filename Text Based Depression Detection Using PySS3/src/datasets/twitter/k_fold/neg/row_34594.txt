I'm coming to realize that depression stays with your forever and I'm too tired to fight anymoreI felt so anxious and depressed before moving here today. I felt so trapped and this immense force of pressure pushing down on my shoulders. I woke up feeling like I couldn't breathe, feeling like I'm literally dying, feeling like I can't think, feeling hazey like the worlds not real? It so felt fake, this didn't feel like my life. September 1st was supposed to be the day that it all changed. That I'd have snapped out of it, be excited to move in with my friends, set up my room, get some exercise, go outside for the sun. This was supposed to make me happy even if for 5 minutes. It didn't. I still feel the pressure, the performance, this still doesn't feel like my life. Then I started thinking how I was trapped and overwhelmed with the pressure... Then I started wondering if it every goes away. My head says no. My head says it never goes away and you're so tired of fighting. Why not just end it so you can finally be at peace. Anyway this pictures is whatever feeling that is.
