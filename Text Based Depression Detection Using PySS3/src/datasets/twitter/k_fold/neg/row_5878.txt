What is wrong with meI'm 19 years young and have no ambition to live. I've been back and forth with moderate to severe depression for almost a decade and I'm just tired of it all. Things seem so together in my life right now, I have a job and a girlfriend (after a long ass time of being single) and close friends but what's the point if my piece of shit mind can't comprehend the fact that things are goins alright for once....I'm caught at a crossroads here. Do I just follow my thoughts and end it all while abandoning dozens of people in the process or do I stay for their benefit &amp; hide the evil behind a mask...and I apologize if my post seems vague here, I have a lot on my mind but can't put it all into words.
