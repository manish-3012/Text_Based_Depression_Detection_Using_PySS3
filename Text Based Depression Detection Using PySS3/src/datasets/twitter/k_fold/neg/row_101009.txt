Feel worthless, got dumped. Wanna shoot myself in the head.A 3 year relationship came to an abrupt end for reasons she can't or won't explain to me. Other than the vague "I need space, it's not you" stuff. I am having a very hard time dealing with this. 
We've stayed in close contact, talk a lot but not as much as we used to. I talked to her for a bit about my suicidal thoughts, but not much. We still talk. She's moving on, only really talking to me because she thinks she has to keep me from getting to depressed, at least that's what I assume. I don't want to talk to any of my friends or family about this. I feel like shit and would rather shoot myself than deal with it anymore. I've loaded the gun and had it my mouth several times. I need help. I'm not sure how best to cope with this. She was who I turned for everything. I've never spoken deeply about myself or my feelings to anybody else in my life. It also doesn't help that she's grown into an amazingly gorgeous woman since we've met, and I have only gotten less attractive, less confident, and have a rock bottom self esteem. I've always been anti social and she was my rock, somebody who brought out the best in me. I can't help but feel like she's moving on to bigger and better things and wants to leave me behind. How do people cope with this?
