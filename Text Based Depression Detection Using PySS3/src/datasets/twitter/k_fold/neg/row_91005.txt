Can't take it any moreI've had feelings of depression (don't want to say I've been depressed because I've never gone to get diagnosed) for the past 8-ish years and I've had enough. 

Being constantly miserable has pretty much ruined the entirety of my teenage years, and as I approach 20 years old I don't think I can take any more.

I don't even know if I have depression or anything, I don't know whether what I'm feeling is serious enough. All I know is that I don't have much of a future, and that my life really is worthless.

I've been thinking about suicide since I first experienced depressed thoughts, but for the last few months I've been thinking about it a lot more. I think I might attempt soon, I'm running out of reasons to bother staying alive.

Not sure why I'm posting on here really, I suppose it just feels nice to be honest for once.
