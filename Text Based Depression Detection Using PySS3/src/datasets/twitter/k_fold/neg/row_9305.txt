I will never ever get help nor get better. I'm just sick. It's just fate. I have to accept that, and try to keep it at the back of my mind, or else I'll just feel bad all the time with no end to it.Never. The only way I can survive is through trying to run away and ignore my problems. I'll never get help. I am just so full of hatred. Everytime I talk to people, I get mad, and act mean, and push them away. If not I just haven't said much at all. I can't get help. On the internet I'm safe, but real life isn't possible at all. I'd just ruin everything and how people look at me and I'd lose whatever peace I have left. I am just sick. It is fate. I am just messed up, no amount of talking will solve it, I hate talking, I hate 'opening up', I won't take a therapist because they won't help me, I don't trust my family, my friends won't get me, I will always, always be alone until I die. I'll always be mediocre and live sadly. To be completely honest, I just hate living. My interests are just things you can do if you're alive. I like them, but I hate living. I just don't want to do anything else. Don't want to try, don't want to even think about anything. I'll just finish the stuff I want to do, then hopefully I'll get into another crisis and go through with suicide ( perhaps this time I'll man up because I'll have no unfinished business at the time to make me hesitate ) or maybe I'll just disappear instantly without even having to worry about it, and that'll be it. I just absolutely hate living and I'll never ever be happy and no amount of talking will ever get to me nor help me. No matter how many of these stupid posts I make, I'll just never get anywhere. I am doomed.

Typing this makes me feel so bad already, I just want to stop, let this go, and continue on with the stuff I want to do today.
