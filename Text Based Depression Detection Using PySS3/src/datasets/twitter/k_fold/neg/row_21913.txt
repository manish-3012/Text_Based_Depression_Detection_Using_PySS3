I just want this mental illness and cycle of friends to end. I'm sorry i'm a burden.A friend dumped me and because my stupid bpd ass couldn't help but look at their social media, it seems they are doing great while I am struggling everyday with mental illness. I can't take it anymore and I just want to end it all. I'm tired of this cycle of pain. To be given up on because they think you are a burden is the worst feeling ever. I can't sleep. I can't win and i'm so fucking alone. All I wanted was to reach out and not feel so lonely. I'm sorry that was too much for you.
