My first attemptCant sleep 
Been trying to go to bed at a decent time but keept waking up so I thought id tell you guys about my first attempt (like people care)

I was 17
Got my results back and failed everything 
I genuinely thought i was going to pass
That I could prove everyone who called me a idiot wrong and show them i was actually smart but i failed 
Like ive always done and that mixed with everything just drove me to a point I wanted to drink myself to death 
I donâ€™t really really remember much of it 
Just me chugging this bottle of whiskey while sobbing and throwing up a little 
Couldnâ€™t even stand at one point 
Obviously it didnâ€™t work (guess I failed at that too)
Woke up on the floor vomit and bottles everywhere 
Felt like fucking idot 
Never told anyone about it 
I think I should have died that day 
I donâ€™t know if ill finish the job 
Im just a shell now
