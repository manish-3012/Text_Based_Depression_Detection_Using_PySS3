Self fulfilling prophecy?So this sounds really stupid, but.

Iâ€™ve been depression and suicidal on and off since I hit puberty. The older I get (Iâ€™m 33 now) the lonelier I become. It really feels as if thereâ€™s no end in sight. Iâ€™ve given up on love and I really take no pleasure in just being with myself.

Every time I try to think positive and try to convince myself I shouldnâ€™t end it, I think about this psychic I went to one time. She was reading my palm and said a bunch of things that were spot on and then she just got this very sad troubled look on her face, and started shaking her head and saying, â€œoh, no... oh, you poor dear..â€ and kept clicking her tongue and something inside of me was like, â€œshe knows that Iâ€™m going to kill myself. She sees it in my hand.â€

This woman was totally genuine and was not putting me on at all. Her reaction was a hundred percent genuine. 

Whenever I think about trying to get my mental health back on track I always think back to that, and think, Iâ€™m destined to do it. Iâ€™m never going to be happy. Iâ€™m going to kill myself eventually.

I never told anyone about it because I know how stupid it sounds but Iâ€™m at such a low place and have been for such a long time, and I know itâ€™s only going to get worse the longer Iâ€™m here on the planet.
