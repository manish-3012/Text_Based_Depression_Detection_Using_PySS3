I feel like everyone hates meI just started college and Iâ€™m in my 4th week here and I feel so alone. My roommate wants me to leave and change rooms because I said something that offended him and my sister (my parents died so sheâ€™s the only family I still have) said she doesnâ€™t want me to come home because sheâ€™s tired of me. I sometimes canâ€™t control my actions which is why Iâ€™m going to counseling on campus because I feel like Iâ€™m going crazy. They said I might have bipolar disorder but they arenâ€™t sure. I feel like Iâ€™m losing my mind. This weekend I was all alone in my room and I kept thinking I should go to this place on campus really high up and jump because my thoughts dont deserve time be free but scattered on the pavement. I donâ€™t know what to do. Itâ€™s 1 in the morning and Iâ€™m thinking about ending it because I hate my self and have nothing to live for.
