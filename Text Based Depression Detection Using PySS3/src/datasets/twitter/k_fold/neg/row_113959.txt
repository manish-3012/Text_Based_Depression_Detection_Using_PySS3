I'm literally only not killing myself because I love my familyI'm a woman who is very ugly and autistic. Being ugly and autistic might as well be a death sentence, especially for women whose value generally comes from their beauty and social skills. I literally feel that I have no future and there is no point in my life. Everyone that I meet hates me and I have no talents or passions. I am only not killing myself because I love my family and I feel that I have a duty towards them. Once my parents die, I'm going to end my life too.
