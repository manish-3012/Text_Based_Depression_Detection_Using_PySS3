Tried checking into a mental health care facility todayLeft when they said they were planning to hold me 72 hours minimum. Fuck that, Iâ€™d rather just go back to work. Thank god it wasnâ€™t all that professional of a place or I couldâ€™ve been in some trouble trying to get out after having filled out and signed paperwork. At least now I know thatâ€™s not an option for help either. Haha thereâ€™s no escape from the hell that is my life.
