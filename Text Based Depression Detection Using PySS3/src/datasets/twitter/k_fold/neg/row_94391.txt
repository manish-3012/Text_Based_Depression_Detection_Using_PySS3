I put a gun to my head and I wasn't scared.This is the worst my sadness has ever been. I felt so sad this morning that I went where I knew a shotgun in my house was, took it out and held it up to my head while looking in the mirror. I might have looked for about a minute or two, and I wasn't scared. I might have found "my way" to die. There's no way I survive a gunshot to the head. This is a permanent end to my permanent problems. I knew I wouldn't make it to 18. I just knew. I'm not writing a note because I have no one to write to. It's all me. I barely slept because I stayed up till 4 am googling suicide methods, and that's all I've been doing this morning. These are my final days, in fact today is probably my final day. My pain has reached it's peak and it's not coming down until I end my life. I know I'm gonna die. I accept it.
