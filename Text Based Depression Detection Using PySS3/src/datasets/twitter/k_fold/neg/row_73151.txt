I want to dieI am done with my life and Iâ€™m very tired. I donâ€™t want to listen to encouraging words anymore. I just want to end everything. I donâ€™t want to think about how to get my life straightened out. Iâ€™m so very tired of thinking. I just really want to die. I want to die. Maybe tonight Iâ€™ll die.
