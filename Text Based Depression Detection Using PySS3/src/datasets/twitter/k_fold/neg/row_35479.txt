Someone. Anyone, please helpI am a 16 year old English girl. On November 12th 2014 my dad died on his way home from work. As you can imagine it crushed me and my family, my birthday is two days after my dad's and they're next month. I'm currently in the middle of my a-Levels and I am not coping. I had 6 weeks of counselling and then nothing, I'm still struggling with just day to day life. And last week my boyfriend broke up with me, he was with me all through my dad's death and when he left me all of the feelings and the memories of the day my dad died came flooding back. I've been having break down after break down in the middle of college and I don't know if I can do this anymore. And to top it all off the tattoo shop I am working in is most likely to close, which means that my childhood dream of tattooing people and being who I want to be is over for a long time. It was all because of my dad that I wanted to do this, I've been seeing my ex around with someone who I thought was a great friend and turns out I was wrong. It kills me to know that he can forget about everything we went through together at the drop of a hat. I'm so overwhelmed by everything and I can't live on this world anymore. I want to be with my dad. I can't even remember what he sounds like and it crushes me every day. I need help, someone please help me
