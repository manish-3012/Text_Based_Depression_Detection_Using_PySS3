Idk how much fight I have leftI really dont know how to start this putting what Im feeling has always been hard to put into words but Ill do my best I just cant reach out to anyone and need this to be out there

I haven't really been happy since I was around 8 its hard to reall narrow down a time because I cant really remember much about my life just fleeting moments here and there, the only thing that has stayed with me is this constant feeling of drowning it just keeps getting worse and I feel like what air I have left is running out. Its gotten hard to enjoy the happy moments because no matter how nice they are I know as soon as that moment ends everything goes back to just an insufferable emptiness.

Its hard to even want to keep going Im 23 now and have been this was for almost two thirds of my life Im exhausted Ive put as much fight as I have in me into this and I know Im about to break. Even my hobbies that I used to love so much dont bring me joy anymore so Ive thrown myself at new one and it works for a few months at best and then that enjoyment dissappears as well.

I cant escape this feeling of loneliness, I spend as much time with with my friends as I can but I dont feel any connection to them anymore. In fact I dont feel a connection to anyone I know when Im gone Ill be a fleeting memory that people will mostly forget soon after. Ive tried dating but I dont enjoy sex nor do I have a sex drive which makes it difficult since its generally an important thing in a relationship so I ended giving up it just reminds me every time how truly broken I am. I feel increasingly alienated from other human 

Im sorry for the rambling I dont even know if this all makes sense honestly
