I have no where to turn to..Let me start off by saying I'm fairly young. Everyone's told me the usual "You're so young! You've got so much to live for!" and all that Jazz. It doesn't work. At all. Maybe I need a little venting before..

A few years ago, my cousin passed away. And I was anything but happy. For about 3 years, I only went outside my room for the necessary things a human needs to keep on functioning.. This is where my depression came from. Or..started..same thing. 

A few months after my recuperation, bullying came into the picture. It began with verbal abuse at school, then moved to physical violence, and finally continued with cyber bullying. I felt the need to end it, do I took it a step further. I drank pills; having no idea what they are, but I took a lot of them.. My parents found out and took me to the hospital after I was passed out. My stomach was flushed and I was fine. (So unfortunate.) 

I was on watch 24/7 for many weeks until my parents decided that I was alright, I could manage without any thoughts of suicide. I played it off and I was fine about it. I moved school and everything was alright and back to the norm. Great, right? Not really. 

Reality struck me. I had no friends, and no one that I felt that really loved me. I wasn't popular, ever. I always strived to be someone well-known with a great life. Something worth it.

It's always been an internal battle. And now memories which I wish were gone are starting to flood back into my mind..If you read this, you know that I'm either in the process, or have succeeded in my attempt to end it. I've lost all will to keep going.. I've resulted to self-harm and anti-depressants. Nothing seems to work. I don't want any karma. This isn't for attention, at all. Maybe this is my suicide note. Could be, should be.
