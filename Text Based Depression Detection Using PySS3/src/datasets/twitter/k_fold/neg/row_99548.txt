I like being alone but not having friends is awful.I really enjoy being alone. I have a few people I would considered my really good friend, though I no longer live near any of them. But when ever I'd get really down, they'd be there for me.

The trouble now is that they've all forgotten me. I get into these awful states of depression and I fucking text everyone I know. Just a short hello or hi or how are you doing. Just praying someone will reply. But they never do.

I'm reduced to just sobbing mess on my floor. 

It really sucks not having anyone to talk to. It allows my own thoughts to take over. It's never good.

Sometimes I want to die just to get it over with. I don't have the courage to kill myself. If I did I would have died years ago. I don't fear death at all. Dying would be a relief. I know no one would miss me. Really they wouldn't. They wouldn't even notice. They'd probably say "I'm glad she finally took a hint and left me alone".

I wonder if I died in my sleep. How long would it take for someone to come looking for me? I'm sure the smell of my body would bother my neighbors before anyone I've ever known would think "I haven't heard from her in a while".
