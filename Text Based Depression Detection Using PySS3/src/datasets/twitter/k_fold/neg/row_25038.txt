someone please just help me.Iâ€™m an awful person. I donâ€™t know what to do, but Iâ€™m horrible. 

I donâ€™t think I deserve to be here. I only care for myself and I canâ€™t even tell if it bothers me. I just deserve to die at this point. 

I have nothing I even want to do when Iâ€™m older, and my family thinks Iâ€™m way better than I actually am.  

I just canâ€™t stop thinking of how much of a jerk I was when I was younger, and how I still probably am. Why did I even need to be born if my whole existence means nothing other than making things difficult? I canâ€™t even tell if I care for other people or not, so I want to die. I canâ€™t stand being this way. I feel like Iâ€™ve already given up on living my life, and Iâ€™m only 14.
