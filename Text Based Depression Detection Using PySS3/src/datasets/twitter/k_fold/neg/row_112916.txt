I keep being told to "be careful" by people that know full well im trying to drink myself to deathI get people don't know what to say,  but it's like,  Cheers but im trying not to be careful. I ran out of percocet to drink with,  so I guess im having to rely on liver failure or alcohol poisoning.  Im tired of life and not having anything worth caring for enough to even try living.  I've smiled at my mom and gave her a hug with her not having a clue how hard im actively trying to not be careful. I don't even feel guilty anymore
