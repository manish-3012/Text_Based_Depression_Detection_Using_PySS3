I need helpI am 23, I study and have a job. But I feel so... miserable. I have been told that I am kind, caring, smart and beautiful but I can't ever keep anyone I like close to me. I feel too old for my age and because I am traditional in relationships I have a HARD time finding someone I like. I feel like I am actually ending up alone forever, this is SERIOUSLY something that I truly am disturbed to know. Because ai have a strong feeling that that's what will happen to me and I just can't handle it. I used to be depressed and even attempted suicide several times but God has been helping me with that. But it's not enough to this feeling of worthlessness and loneliness. I was dumped by my first boyfriend, ghosted by someone I knew for years and lost several friendships. I ended a few more today because I feel so tired of trying. I can't even cry. No matter what people say, that it'll get better, I find it impossible to believe it will.

I think about moving to Scandinavia to study and that does give me some hope that I may find someone there but it isn't enough. Nothing is enough. My life isn't enough. I am just not enough for people. For anyone. It hurts. It REALLY hurts. Being alone is horrible. I may end up just going forward with suicide. But I am scared of what comes next.

I need help.
