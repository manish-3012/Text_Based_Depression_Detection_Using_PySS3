Not the help I asked forReached out to an old friend and asked for help. Said that I was not in the mood for any sex but if he could just come over and hold me. Guess that wasn't enough. This was not the kind of help I asked for. Or needed. Now I feel even worse. I've learned my lesson. Back to the original plan, how to kill myself.
