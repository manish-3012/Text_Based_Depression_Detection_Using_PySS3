IÂ´m tired of existingI donÂ´t want to kill myself, but im really tired of all, i want just to stop existing, just dissapear wit no pain for me or my beloved ones.
But nothing motivates me, iÂ´m empty with no will to live.
iÂ´m tired of pretending that im ok, or cant talk with anybody about this.
i donÂ´t know what to do,or handle it. is like the suicide is the only way,, or at leat the easy one.
