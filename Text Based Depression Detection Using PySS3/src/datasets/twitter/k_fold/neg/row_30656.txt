Thought about ending my life [32, M] my GF of 11 months wasn't very supportive [33, F] when I told her.Yesterday morning I started my work shift at 7am. At 7:45AM I went home, and it was either going to be to end my life or sleep. I felt so drained that I decided on sleeping. I slept for 3hrs. I sent my gf a text right before that, letting her know that I was sorry not always being good to her. Letting her know that I loved her and wanted to be the best for her.

Fast forward to 6pm, when I went to go see her. We were watching a show, and I sat there, feeling worthless and I told her I wanted to tell her something. That I was thinking of taking my life earlier but decided on sleep. Her response was to call me selfish, rude and that I omitted the truth, because she thought I was at work, and I wasn't.

Pretty much she turned this into her issue, that I shouldn't have gone that long without answering her. It made me feeling even more empty, lonely, hopeless and sad. I just went home, and till now she hasn't apologized. Did I overact? I'm thinking of leaving her. I'm so hurt that I turned to her for support, and she pretty much made me going MIA a bigger issue than me attempting to end my life.

Should I end things?

TL;DR my girlfriend of almost a year, doesn't know how to be there for me. Should I end things?
