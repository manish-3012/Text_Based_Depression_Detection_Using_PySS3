Still alive, but no motivation or reason to continue. I now know how I'll do it, but not whenI told a friend the other night how I felt. Not as upset as I was a week or so ago, but more depressed and pessimistic than ever. I told him I have no reason to carry on. 

He told me he felt that way in the past, and that something or someone comes along and changes you, but I don't think they understood that I would be incapable of caring if I was gone.

I can't skip along to the happy parts of life, I can't skip to the parts where I've fucked up. So I'm just in limbo, waiting for that next paycheck to finally leave this all behind.
