This quarantine is killing me.I've already survived one OD. One more would do me in. Shit, too much alcohol would do me in. I'm so close, finally.

This quarantine is killing me. It's been six months since I've had any semblance of normal. I don't remember what it was like to have friends, or somewhere to go every day, or to be allowed out after 8:00 PM at night. Or go outside without wearing a mask, or travel more than 5km from my house, or go to a shopping centre. Or go to the cinema, or go to the pub/club/bar, or go on a Tinder date. Or sit down at a restaurant, or study in a cafe. All of these things are no longer accessible to me because of this stupid fucking lockdown. All my days are the same.

And then there's the absolute joy that is online university. I sit there and feel stupid, and there's nobody I can ask for help. I failed two units last semester, after dropping down from four, and it's knocked my confidence so badly that I truly can't see myself ever succeeding in this degree.

This is fucking bullshit. I'm 20 years old, and this was supposed to be the year that things got \*better\* for me. I worked so hard to get off meth, I made the (difficult) decision to start a new degree in a new field entirely, I started eating disorder recovery, I did everything I could to make sure that this would be the year that I finally became the person I was meant to be. And now? Still on meth, still underweight, failing that degree we spoke about earlier. And quarantine is going to be another six weeks, at the very least. But I've had it. I'm done. This fucking sucks, and I'd rather be dead forever than live through another fucking hour of this bullshit, let alone another six weeks.

I'm 500mL of vodka away from the grave. I might do it tonight, if I can be bothered. I can hardly be bothered doing anything these days.
