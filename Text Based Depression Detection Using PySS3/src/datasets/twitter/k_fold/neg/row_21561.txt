The only thing holding me back is what will happen when I dieI'm not afraid of death or suicide, but the only thing holding me back is what will happen when I jump. Will I be punished for taking my own life by some god? Or will it just be like sleeping? I've been thinking about this for a few months and I still can't settle on an answer. I don't have any reason to live, my parents are both terrible figures and have traumatized me since I was born. My dad is a delusional raging alcoholic who jumps at ANY opportunity to break dishes and humiliate us in the eyes of our neighbors (one time I brought a bottle of superglue for an A&amp;C project and he accused my mother of poisoning the food with it.) And my mother is a submissive overdramatic woman, this may sound unfair to my mother, but seeing the victim side in a parent fight begging and pleading for forgiveness and bawling her eyes out while being verbally assaulted is one of the most traumatizing sights I can think of. I have given up on school social life too, and I don't have any friends nor do I talk to anyone, even though my grades are pretty good. I have since abandoned my only group of friends (online friends with whom I shared a lot of the same issues) even though they were extremely loyal and great friends, because I snapped at them once, said all sorts of things and cant bring myself to face them anymore, even if Im sure they'll take me back instantly. I get mad at anyone who tries to talk to me for more than 10 seconds and Im frustrated by my lack of any emotion other than constant anger and occasional sadness. I know English (my 4th language) far better than my mother tongue because I only ever talked with aforementioned group of friends and never with any of my compatriots. I don't have a meaningful future due to my abysmal social skills. I don't know what kind of replies I want to this post but I'm really posting just to vent. Thank you for reading.
