SuddenFeeling more suicidal, lately. I know people are going through a lot everyone and people have it worse than me. I hate thinking this way because I feel like an idiot and so ungrateful. I am just so tired of being trapped in my own head. I am consumed by my own mind and have no one. Getting older pains me because I know I will be alone forever. And, that my time here and when I leave this earth, wonâ€™t be good. Iâ€™m rebelling against my family without them knowing and without me choosing to. If I was at least born normal, I could contribute something and maybe have someone proud of me. I know people, especially my parents, look at me with pity being 20, worthless, and alone. Our family has been through a lot and had to deal with tough shit while trying to maintain normalcy. I crave pain, unfortunately. Iâ€™m rambling but I have so many thoughts. I think I want to cause pain but not really to others. I feel so bottled up. I used to be happy but I chalk those days up to being a kid and youthful. If I commit suicide, I will ruin my family but once they know my truth, my life wouldnâ€™t mean anything to them, anyway. I see why people take drugs but I could never. Iâ€™m already consumed by my pain so I donâ€™t need added manipulations. Iâ€™ve been lonely all my life and felt so alienated. Slowly self-destructing seems like my current state. Itâ€™s sort of my form of self-harm because I canâ€™t cut due to fear of noticeable scars. I donâ€™t express my pain but crying or anything like that. Itâ€™s tiresome and solves nothing. I wish I was at least smart to contrast my uselessness. I hate being touched because it reminds me that I am a person on this earth. Sleeping is the only time I am at peace.
