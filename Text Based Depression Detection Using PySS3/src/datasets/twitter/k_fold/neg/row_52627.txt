It's never been this bad before. Starting to think I have a real problem.Never posted on Reddit before. I've always been too nervous, but I need to blow off steam. Sorry if I'm not doing this right. I'll try not to be too melodramatic.

I'm a 16 y/o female high school student with social anxiety. Been in and out of therapy for the anxiety twice now, but haven't gone in about 3 years. Currently taking Celexa. I have a bit of a history with depression and suicidal thoughts, though I thought that part of my life was over.

But for several months, it's gotten worse. Nothing incredibly tragic has happened, but it seems I'm worse than ever. I hate everything about myself. I hate the person I am. I have no confidence. I have no drive, no motivation to do anything. I'm having bigger panic attacks for smaller things. Everything just feels hopeless. The list goes on and on. 

I've started to contemplate suicide more and more seriously. I think about the pros and cons. I think about the method I would use. Haven't chosen one yet, but I know very well what is and isn't available. I could do it if I want to. And I think I might want to.

I've gotten low before, but never this low. I don't know whether I should be concerned or not. I might wake up tomorrow and be perfectly fine. But today, I don't feel safe by myself. And I don't know what to think about that.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

Thank you for reading all this. You're not obligated to comment. I feel a bit better just getting this out there. Sorry for rambling.
