What Is the Point of Begging People to Help Me to not Kill Myself Every DayWhat is the point of this? I'm so sick, so tired. I have nothing to live for. Can anyone help me? Literally begging random strangers to keep me from killing myself, every day. You all must think I'm just the neediest idiot out there. I have nothing to offer the world. I'm sorry.
