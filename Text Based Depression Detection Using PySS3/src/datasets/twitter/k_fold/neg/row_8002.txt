Want to feel nothing at allMy girlfriend left me for someone else, I keep comparing myself with him and wondering what I could have done to prevent this breakup. We had a wonderful 4 year relationship and did so much for each other. How could she replace me so easily?! 

I feel so lonely, replaceable and abandon. I don't want to die, I just want to be gone and feel nothing.
