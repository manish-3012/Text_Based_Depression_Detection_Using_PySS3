I have no oneEverytime I read a post about someone wanting to kill themselves ,there's always someone talking about "what about the people who love and care for you?", and honestly, it makes me feel awful because I have no one. 

This is not because I'm sick and can't recognize the people around me that actually care about me. I legitimately have no one.

This makes me want to disappear even more. How come I have no one? What kind of human being has no one?  Supposedly every person has at least one person to care about them.

When I was growing up I thought to myself that it was ok, I could manage being alone and that it wasn't as bad as it seems, but honestly, as I grew older I noticed that life is unbearable when you're alone.

Sometimes I really wish I at least believed in god, because maybe I could find some comfort in faith.
For what I've seen, people that believe in god have hope that things will get better, that everything happens for a reason and that every human being exists for a reason.

What bothers me the most is that I don't even have the right to choose what to do with my own existence. People should be able to decide and die with dignity, like in euthanasia. 

But no, killing yourself is bad. You'd better get out of it and learn to accept the suffering and agony that it is to be alive.
