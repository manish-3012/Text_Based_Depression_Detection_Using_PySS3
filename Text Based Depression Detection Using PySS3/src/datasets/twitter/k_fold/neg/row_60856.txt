2020I'm using my throwaway for reasons I hope are obvious.  
I understand I may be overreacting but the things that I'm feeling are so overwhelming and I can't distance myself from them anymore. I'm in a constant state of anxiety and stress over the election and the pandemic. I feel like I can't hold on anymore. This year has already taken so much of me away, damaged me so badly, that I feel like there's nothing left to hold out hope on.  
I'm exhausted. I'm scared. I'm depressed. I can't even talk to my parents since we have opposing political views. I'm only 16, turning 17 in a few weeks, so I don't have many options. I can't move somewhere else, I can't vote, and I'm still young enough that my voice doesn't really have an opportunity to be heard- I'm 'too naive', 'uneducated', 'gullible', etc.  
I just don't know what to do. I fear if Trump is reelected that that will be the tipping point for me. I can't handle another 4 years of pain.  
If this post isn't appropriate for this sub or I misunderstood and thus broke a rule, I'm okay with this being deleted. I apologize for any mistakes I may have made.
