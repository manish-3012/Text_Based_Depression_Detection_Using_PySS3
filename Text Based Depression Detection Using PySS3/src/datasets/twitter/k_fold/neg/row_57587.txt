I dont want to live like this anymoreI can't stop crying every night thinking about how much I want the suffering to end. I tried so hard to turn my life around and had got my own apartment and a good job and found the love of my life. She left me after a year saying she didn't feel anything for me anymore. This was the only person I had in my life and the only person I had ever trusted as much as her. I felt utterly broken, but not nearly as broken as I feel now after becoming jobless and homeless, living out of my car, hoping every night that I somehow don't wake up another day to face the reality that I'm just never going to be good enough to be able to be happy. I can't stand the loneliness anymore. I can't stand the alienation and failure. I've lost hope for a better tomorrow. I can't stand the pain, and I can't think of a reason why I wouldn't be better off feeling nothing at all right now. My life hasn't really worked out, and I'm just getting older and lonelier and more unhappy. Why shouldn't I leave? This isn't a game I want to play anymore. It isn't fun, it isn't funny, it isn't rewarding. It's unfair and hurtful, and I don't see the value in living such a life. I just can't accept living like this.
