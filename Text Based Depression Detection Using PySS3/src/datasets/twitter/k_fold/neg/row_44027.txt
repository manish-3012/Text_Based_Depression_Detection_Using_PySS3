Should i say something?I don't wanna go into too much detail due to the fact that I made a post last night about this, but after my first ever suicide attempt, I failed. I'm supposed to graduate in June and my dad is excited about that. And that's what makes things even worse. I'm scared that I am going to try again, and deep down inside I don't want to die, but I am at the point where I can no longer control myself. I'm wondering if I should tell guidance about this today. I know I'll go to a psych ward, as I have been there three times in my life. I just feel that it would be kind of a relief. No more worrying about whether or not I am going to die today and the day after that. All I want is to take a break from this madness. Finally telling someone about what I did instead of keeping it bottled up too long would set me at ease a little bit. God the relief I would get. I just don't like ow if I should or not
