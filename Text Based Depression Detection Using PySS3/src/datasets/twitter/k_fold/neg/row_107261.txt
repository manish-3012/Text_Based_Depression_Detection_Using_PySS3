I wanna die asapHonestly, I don't see the point in living and I just really wanna die asap but scared of failing a suicide attempt. I recently tried killing myself by taking sleeping pills and drive off in my car, passed out once I started the car and hit a tree. (No one else injured) I broke my ankle, had my knee exposed, had to get plastic surgery to fix my jaw etc. Etc. I really wish I died from that attempt because life just keeps getting worse and I don't think it'll ever be better for me. I'm not happy or content with myself or life. I don't have many friends to rely on and I just got out of an abusive relationship (everything but physical).
