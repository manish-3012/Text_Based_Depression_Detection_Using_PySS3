I canâ€™t go onI have nothing left; dignity, stability, solace. Itâ€™s evaporated. I tried to live a good life and be kind but the universe has deemed this a weakness and has ruled that I must die by a thousand cuts to my self esteem and mental health. The world is a cruel callous place and despite my best intentions and countless efforts to be happy I donâ€™t have anything left to try. Iâ€™m all out of support and ideas. Why do bad things happen to good people? Iâ€™ve been hit with a relentless tsunami of bad luck and worse people and this trend just wont stop. I need peace but there appears only one way now to achieve peace and so I must take my own life to stop my suffering.
