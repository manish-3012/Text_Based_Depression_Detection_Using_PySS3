I want to reach out to somebody but if they don't understand or realise how serious I am what do I do?How should I feel if I reach out to somebody for help Irl  but they don't realize how serious I am or they just aren't emotionally equipped to handle it???

Also if that does happen and I still decide to go through with it how can I let them know it's not their fault for being "unprepared" or at all for what I did?
