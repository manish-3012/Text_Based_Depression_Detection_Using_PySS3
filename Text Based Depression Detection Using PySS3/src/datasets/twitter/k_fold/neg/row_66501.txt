A burden on othersI wish assisted suicide was legal everywhere like in Switzerland. I also wish it was cheap and an easy procedure to go through. It would certainly help a lot of people who are burdened by my sickness. Aaah... just wishful thinking. I hate to leave a mess or not be successful in my attempt.
