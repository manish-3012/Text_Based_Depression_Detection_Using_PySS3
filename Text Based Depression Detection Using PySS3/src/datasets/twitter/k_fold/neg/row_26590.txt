Iâ€™m really good at failing.I go to an online school and a college and Iâ€™m under 18. Recently Iâ€™ve been struggling in the college because I have no motivation to study at all. My dad has been irritated with me because Iâ€™m an C average student at this college. I have a fairly high IQ so my parents expect a lot from me. Itâ€™s just I canâ€™t find any motivation to study and I donâ€™t know why. 

Recently, Iâ€™ve been struggling finding who I really am. I have different personalities around certain people and I donâ€™t change on purpose, it just happens. And people call me fake for it. Specifically my family, and Iâ€™ve tried to change but I canâ€™t. 

My dad has been super passive aggressive towards me in the past two months and I canâ€™t understand what Iâ€™m doing wrong. I expect this behavior from my mother not him. I looked up to him and trusted him until this point. They both constantly destroy what little self confidence I already have and itâ€™s just left me not wanting to do anything for years now. I donâ€™t see a purpose of being here. 

Iâ€™ve been failing a few of my classes this semester and if I fail in the end we pay for the class. I took two exams today and stayed up till two and woke up at six to study so Iâ€™m trying to be better. I thought my day was going ok, I felt better than normal. I have a three hour government class that I had an exam for today and I got below average on the test. 

Itâ€™s about 9:30 PM I get home from school and my family is watching a movie. So, Iâ€™m kind of happy I can relax with them. But I go in the living room and my dad glares at me. My mom kind of gives me this look. My dad hands me a letter and I read it. It says that we have a court date because I was missing school. 

A little backstory, for my online high school I have to â€œlog my attendanceâ€ everyday. Just a few clicks and itâ€™s done. Well, me being me, I forget to do this A LOT. For some reason I donâ€™t see this as a big deal because I go to a college and Iâ€™m still in school, not really skipping. So it led to this. 

I read the letter and everything hits me. I feel like an utter failure. Iâ€™m currently failing my classes, I have a court date, my parents might get fined, or go to jail. I head to the restroom and lock the door. I hear my dad and sisters just walk past the door like I donâ€™t need help. Normally I wouldnâ€™t be too butthurt but when they did this Iâ€™ve sat outside the door for 45 minutes before to make sure theyâ€™re ok. Frankly, Iâ€™m hurt they didnâ€™t even try. But, from past experience I know they donâ€™t care.  My mom tries to get my attention but I canâ€™t respond (my mom and I have history and sheâ€™s the last person I needed to talk to) 

Let me leave it at this. The first time I cut myself I showed my mom because I thought she loved me. Well all she told me was to not do it again. Didnâ€™t ask if I was ok, or even informed my father. And she knew it was self harm. Plus, sheâ€™s a compulsive liar and I canâ€™t trust her, my dad doesnâ€™t even trust her. 

So she tries to get my attention for a few minutes then gives up. But later she comes back with my dad and he yells outside the door â€œopen the door or Iâ€™ll break it and make you pay.â€ I wasnâ€™t feeling much love. 

My mom keeps poking me and asking me non relevant questions and threatens to ground me because I wasnâ€™t responding. I couldnâ€™t respond to her because I knew she really didnâ€™t care, she just has to tend to me because Iâ€™m her child. 

I reached out to a couple friends because I really donâ€™t see a need to be here anymore, I was hoping theyâ€™d give me a reason to stay... they kind of played it off and didnâ€™t seem to care. The one person I love and trusted left me a few months ago. I go to my next option and try to reach a helpline online that I can text because Iâ€™m not good on the phone. I wait for twenty minutes and no one texts back after the please wait message. 

Thereâ€™s a lot I didnâ€™t state because frankly I have no energy right now. I might make it through the night, Iâ€™m not sure. I feel empty.
