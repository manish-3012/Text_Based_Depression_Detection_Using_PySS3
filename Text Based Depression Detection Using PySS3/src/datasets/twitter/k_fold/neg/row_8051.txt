Waiting for the Perfect MomentWaiting for the First rave after this Corona shit is over or Maybe iâ€˜ll just head to an illegal rave for new years eve. I want to party Hard one last Time. 

 I already know how i could do it without failing. And nobody will stop me there. 

All tekheads are too fucked up to stop me  and there will be no ambulance to save me :) 

Also I can get huge amounts of carbon dioxide to add to my overdose mix. I will be happy Again, for a Moment... :)

this Life and this world Is a joke. Fuck it.
