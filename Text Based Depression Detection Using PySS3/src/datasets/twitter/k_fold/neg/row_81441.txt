Still suicidal, but determined to live to the performance so I don't let my friends down.I thought I was gonna kill myself yesterday, but after a long talk with my boyfriend he convinced me to wait until after my music program's festival on the seventeenth. It's a school funded band and I'm one of the singers. I still feel depressed, hopeless, and suicidal. I don't want to live any longer than I have to.
