There's nothing left for me.The past 10 years I've tried everything I can think of, distraction worked well for a time but that's all it is; a distraction. 

I have no support, no resources to continue. I know the first thing you'll think when you read this is you'll want to type "I'm here for you, you have support whether you know it or not" but we both know that's a lie. If I had support then something would have changed for the better, anything could have changed for the better in the past 10 years. But no matter what I try to do to get out of this simply doesn't work out for me. I've put more effort into changing than I had to give and nothing ever paid off. I can't keep feeling like everything I do is futile. I can't keep taking it day by day anymore. I've talked to so many people about this and nobody can give me any concrete answers. "I used to feel just like you and I turned my life around so can you!" yet still can't answer me when I ask what they did, when they can I've already tried and failed. Not once, but multiple times. How many times do I have to try before I can finally give up? Can't I just be selfish this once? Guilt tripping me into staying around isn't going to work anymore. 

I really just want to die. I'm pretty fucking resolute. But I'm still just too much of a failure to do it myself, every night I wish for a brain aneurysm, to catch a stray bullet, hell I'd even take the pain of cancer if it was guaranteed to end in death. I need to find a train. I just want out. 

Every single time I talk to people about my feelings I get a number of responses. 
1. I'm here for you (you're not, you're here to validate yourself as a good person)
2. I'd be devastated if you died (does that outweigh my feelings?)
3. You just have to keep working through this it gets better (it doesn't)
4. There has to be something you enjoy, or want to do (there isn't)

It's the same shit over and over and nothing changes. I hesitate to call this hell because I still have the option to opt out if I want. People trying to keep me here is the closest thing to hell I can think of. It's all just complete shit, I feel like the only time I don't feel like complete shit is when I'm putting all my effort into keeping the mask of normalcy on around "friends" and family. But that only lasts 15 minutes at most before I just feel worse than before. I really just want to die. I've exhausted every other option. I've got nothing left.
