Why am I so fucked up?I made this throwaway so it wouldn't be associate with the real me. I feel like I am a detriment to society. I am attracted to underaged girls, to bondage, to all of these things that go against the grain of society and the law. I used to smoke weed everyday and that helped for a while, then I got busted and lost that privlidge. I feel like everything in my life is crumbling around me. I have no friends. I don't talk to anyone. I don't do my work, I don't study, I feel like shit. I know that "I can do it" but I can't. No matter how hard I push myself or how ever much I try to motivate myself I cannot succeed. I used to have huge dreams, then they got "realistic" then they got mediocre, and now I have no prospects at all. I have depression, anxiety and feel like I will probably end up as a schizophrenic. 

EDIT: I should note, I am not suicidal, but more of isolational if that makes sense, I feel it would be better to seclude myself from the world.
