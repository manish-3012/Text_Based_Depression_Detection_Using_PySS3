17 yo who's contemplatingWhy am I sad. I want to be loved. I have no friends that truly care if I'm okay or not. I have family, I know they care, but I still can't get the thought out of my head. I. WANNA. DIE. I gave my heart to this one person and it's like they took it for granted. Why me? God please tell me why. I've tried living, everyone looks at me and sees a happy person. All I see is a waste of space. I just wish I could give my life to someone who really wants to live. You know?Â  It's okay to say all this shit to Trey because he doesn't care. Right? Well maybe if someone actually took the time to get to know me, then I wouldn't feel like this. Why is it so easy to hide emotions. Why can't I just express them. Am I afraid of getting judged? Yeah. Am I afraid that I'll truly know no one cares? Yeah, I am. Everyone says you're loved why would you wanna do that. The fact is we are not. Who loves you? No one. If you were to die tommorow, people will care, for a little while at least. And then what life's goes on. Our lives in this stupid ass universe have no purpose. They are microscopic specs. The odds that you are one of the few who get remembered. Tiny. And if so what for a hundred years, this shit is pointless.
