I didnt mean to come here i dont know where else to go.Hi sorry for this i dont think im going to kill myself i just really want to stop existing for a long time, not feel anything, not matter, like being dead without being dead.

Im struggling to even go through with even typing this i just want to say "fuck it" and forget about it, because im on the brink of just closing this page and not posting ill just dump it all out in detail.

Everything was fine, then mum left dad, dad cried after losing 40yrs of marriage, all my siblings took it very hard, little sister took up smoking, older sisters husband had a child with her then emotionally abused her and ran away overseas, money troubles with me and my gf of 10 years, works fine but dont like it that much, depression is coming back hard i get anxiety attacks and severe depression symptoms like i have never had before, get back on meds AGAIN and do the whole thing AGAIN, mum acting like a fuckwit all the time my siblings hate her, i get migraines now more 80% of the day, now teeth are hurting, turns out all 4 wisdom teeth need to be extracted, all havent emerged yet, need surgery and anethestist to get them out its going to cost like 5000$ unless i get a health fund and wait a whole year i could maybe cut that in half, might have to live a year in pain, someother stuff is wrong i cant remember it all anymore just more and more just getting kicked while im down ive never done anything worng i just be nice and try to be helpful, karma obviously isnt real but it would be nice if it was, getting fucked harder and harder it doesnt let up now the little things bring me down further than before i just want to be left alone. now just tonight i got scammed out of a bunch of CSGO items that were probably worth hundreds, feel like an idiot for falling for it, was really convincing and steam support is a labyrinth of bullshit i just want to email them or something i just want tsomeone to tell me what to do, was frustrated and gf paused her tv show to talk to me but i couldnt explain or get any emotions out, i pressed play on the show and said to just watch the show, she got upset and now we just yelled at each other over nothing, a fucking misunderstanding so i feel ever dumber now and i was just looking out the window at the bush (forest) and was *this* close to just walking in a straight line into it and not stopping until my feet were bleeding.

so now im on a game im going to stay up all night and turn up to work fucked tomorrow and probably piss off my gf again in the afternoon.

just realised i guess i should go and see my general practitioner again and start seeing the psyc AGAIN because im never going to escape it and im 24 so if i dont die i have 60 more years or so of this utter catshit that happens every fucking day.
