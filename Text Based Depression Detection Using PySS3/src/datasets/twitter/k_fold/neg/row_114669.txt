Iâ€™m tired of the cycle2 years ago I had my first suicide attempt, went to a mental hospital, got my dream internship after. Half a year goes by and Iâ€™m burned out, get fired and fall right back into the depression loop. Cut to today, i donâ€™t have a job, live with my parents, I sleep all day simply because I donâ€™t want to be awake and lately the suicide thoughts are getting louder. I canâ€™t escape the cycle no matter what I do, I donâ€™t belong anywhere. My trauma will follow me until Iâ€™m finally fucking dead.
