Loneliness is going to kill meI do not have any friends or a boyfriend. I donâ€™t have much family left. I spend most of my time alone and donâ€™t want to continue living this way anymore. Iâ€™ve been alone for most of my life and have tried to do everything that I can to become happy, but I will never be that person. I give up.
