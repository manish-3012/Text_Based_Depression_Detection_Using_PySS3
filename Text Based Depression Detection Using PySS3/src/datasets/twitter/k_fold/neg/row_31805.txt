I am not afraid but I am afraidI am not afraid of dying...  but how could I do this to my parents, my sister and my friends? I feel numb all the time but then when I think about how they would feel if I left them... I feel unbearable pain and guilt. It keeps me alive.

I am afraid that one day I'll reach a level of numbness that I can't remind myself of that pain.

I'm not afraid of dying... I'm afraid of hurting the ones I love. 

I'm not afraid of dying... but I am hella afraid of life.
