I canâ€™tGod, I just feel like such shit. I cant escape my anxieties, I canâ€™t distract myself. And you know I see these people with similar stories to mine, but are significantly older than me and it doesnâ€™t get better for us. Letâ€™s be honest. Why would I keep holding onto this shithole. Iâ€™m so tired of trying to jam a bunch of puzzle pieces that donâ€™t fit to make some semblance of a future. Iâ€™m an unlikeable fag with no talents or friends. Where does one go from there.
