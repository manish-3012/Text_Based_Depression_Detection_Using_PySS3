my life is flashing before my eyes.these intrusive thoughts... every memory i've ever had... random ones... unimportant events... they keep flooding in and they hurt so much. i don't want to be here anymore. i don't like what i've recorded mentally. i don't like my mind. i don't like myself. i don't want to do this anymore.

i hate being mentally ill. i hate having emotional responses to my past. i feel so childish.
