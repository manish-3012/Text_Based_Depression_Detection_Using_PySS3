I canâ€™t be asked anymoreI got so much to fucking offer but no one wants it, I have wonderful friends, but nothing else. When I think something good is happening, it doesnâ€™t. Iâ€™m pissed. Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m not suicidal, Iâ€™m just drunk, I beg to god there wonâ€™t be any messages when I wake up tomorrow. Iâ€™m so sorry, peaple with real problems are in here, Iâ€™m just mad at life itself, Iâ€™m changing Bext week. Thanks, but Iâ€™m sorry
