I just wanna sleep (not in a suicidal way btw)I just wanna sleep without ruminating all the time and thinking about killing myself and what a bad person I am, a good nights sleep. Can someone please help me, I don't even know what I need help with but I feel terrible, I can't figure out how to get my bad feelings to go away, nothing works.
