How can I turn my brother's suicide (mental illness) into a positive career working for a non-profit, I am a professional programmerRecently my brother succumbed to his mental illness, he was bipoloar, by finally ending it for himself.He went through so much treatment and my family tried hard for years but he had accompanying major drug problems it proved to just be too much to overcome. This has left a huge void in my life, although I had grown away from him because his illness caused him to push people away, I always loved him and honestly thought things would work out in the end.

I would really like to use my career-related abilities to work for an organization that at least helps a related cause or to somehow be able to create my own as I feel that my experience with him and the pain I feel for people who have mental illnesses could at least lead to something good and working for at my current job, for a for-profit, startup company just doesn't feel right anymore. I would still need to make a livable salary as I am planning to have a family soon but I'd be ok with the lower "ceiling" for potential earnings in exchange for working for something I believe in.

I'm wondering if anyone can offer any advice how to go about this, any resources or people who I may be able to get in touch with. I feel that the internet is something that is powerful for connecting people and my own experience could be applied to help further the cause of a non-profit. Sorry for my ramblings, any advice is appreciated

EDIT: I suppose there could be organizations that aren't necessarily "non-profit" that could still be along the lines of helping towards a cause so I'd be open to that too. I'm just kind of lost right now as far as where to begin looking and how to make sure that the organization has legitimate goals where it is trying to help people.
