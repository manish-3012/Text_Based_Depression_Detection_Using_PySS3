Iâ€™ve recently gotten over my anxiety, depression, and lack of general confidence in myself. But now for the first time ever I feel like leaving this place isnâ€™t so unreasonableI used to see myself as less than all those around me, Iâ€™m not sure if thats necessarily changed, or even true, but I just donâ€™t really see the point in caring about that anymore. 


I feel like Iâ€™ve spent the past few years in an existential crisis and itâ€™s finally come to a head. I used to rarely dream (or remember my dreams that is), if I did it was always vague. But lately my dreams have been extremely vivid. Iâ€™ve also had a series of terribly vivid nightmares as of late, they feel so real that in my waking state I question whether Iâ€™m in one or not. I canâ€™t always discern what memories are real and what were just a dream.


I donâ€™t feel sexual attraction anymore. I used to be heterosexual, but these days even the most objectively attractive woman looks disgusting to me. All humans do, hell all organic life just seems gross. I donâ€™t even like looking in the mirror because realizing the pile of meat and bone looking back is me scares the hell out of me.


My own consciousness and the nature of our reality makes me very uncomfortable and I feel like itâ€™s all fake, everything about it. It all feels off, like living in a dream.


I used to view suicide as pathetic, selfish, moronic. From a point of view it probably still is. But itâ€™d sure be nice to escape from all this.
