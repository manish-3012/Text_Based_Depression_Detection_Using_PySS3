i really want to end my life tonighttoday was really a really difficult day for my suicidal depression and i dont feel very capable of living the rest of my life like i have been living recently. I want to die so fucking badly. this year i decided to go to a new school for a fresh start, but i find myself to be just as suicidal (if not more) than i was before. It makes me so ill because i know that no matter what i try to do to better myself it doesn't work and i just feel so bored of being alive. its all so cyclic and surreal feeling, and i dont have any way to escape it. I hate being alive. I hate my friends and i hate that i feel like all i have left to give is hate. I dont know. i really just feel like hanging myself and i don't even want anyone to help me make my suicidal thoughts go away anymore.
