Not sure if this is the proper place but I need helpI have a lot of issues. Trust issues, specifically. I am a rape victim and bipolar.

My SO is also depressed and was suicidal at one point. During this time he got very close to a female who was allegedly going through the same thing. They flirted. A lot. Very heavily and publicly. This continued when we started dating. They have pet names for each other, and take "couples" pictures. He says that he is close to her because they both went through the same things and talked each other down multiple times.

I should probably be thanking her because she could've been the only reason he's still alive and he's the best thing ever to happen to me. But jealousy is an ugly thing and I feel so much resentment towards her and take it out on him. I feel like a disgusting person. I self-harm because I feel so disgusted with myself for having so much anger at the situation.

Am I at all justified? He swears there is nothing but I can't bring myself to even see that as a possibility. Please help me. I am destroying an otherwise great relationship and I dont know what to do.
