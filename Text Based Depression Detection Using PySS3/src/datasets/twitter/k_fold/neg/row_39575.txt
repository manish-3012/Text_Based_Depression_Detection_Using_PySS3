Alone At A BarHey guys. I'm chilling out at a bar by myself.

I keep swiping through my phone contacts and seeing the sparse list that is presented.

There is no one that I can contact, so I feel a bit alone at the moment.

I just keep wondering how things turned out like this.

Alone, scared to interact with people, a gambler, probably would turn into an alcoholic if I actually tried.

I just hate where I am at right now. 

In a sense... I just wonder if this is karmic punishment for something that I did.

Cursed with boredom and isolation.

I love my family, but holy shit I want to get out of this life.

I've tried to commit suicide a few times (pills, stabbing, etc), but nothing works.

It's like I'm just stuck.

I dunno.

I'm just scared to die, but I want to get this shit show over with.
