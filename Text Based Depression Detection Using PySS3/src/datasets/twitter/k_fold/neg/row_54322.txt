Another ruined holidayWhen I was growing up, my dad ruined every holiday I ever had by fighting with my mom. Well here it is, another ruined holiday, this time by my boyfriend (ex boyfriend? who even fucking knows) 

he told me i am pessimistic and negative about everything in his life. i honestly can't remember being negative. what was i supposed to say when he's bitching about his parents borrowing money, because "oh that sucks, im really sorry" is apparently wrong. and also, telling him i'm sorry and it sucks when sessions just don't show up is also wrong. he told me i am unsupportive. he also said he heard rumor i said he was sleeping around behind my back which i envr said and i don't understand where he heard that. 

i keep second guessing everything i've done in the past few months. i keep having flash backs of all the good memories. i spent all day laying around and crying. i tried to contact the suicide hotline and i waited on hold until they asked me to leave a message. i have social anxiety so i can't call back because i can't bring myself to try. i want to disappear. i want to cease to exist. i do'nt know if i'll kill myself. i took an ap and woke up with deep scratches in my arm. i scratched myself in my sleep. i've cut again as well. i hope i don't wake up in the morning. i really never want to wake up again.
