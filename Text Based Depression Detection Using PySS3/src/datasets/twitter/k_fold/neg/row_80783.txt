Why Is "threatening" someone with killing yourself considered manipulative and childish?I get that it sounds horrible, but what else is there to say? If I'm that passionate about something that I would kill myself over it completely seriously, why would I hide it? My recent post on AITA about my boyfriend included me telling him I would kill myself if he continued to watch porn. My question is, should I just not mention I would kill myself, and then when he inevitably did watch porn again, I should just commit suicide? Sure it's a threat but if that's what's going to happen then they should get a heads up. 

It's a long story, but essentially he kept lying about watching porn. I told him after the second time I found out that I would kill myself if he did it again. I've lost all my love for him ever since then and I broke up with him last night, and when I did, he admitted to everything he did including jacking it to porn when I went to my night class. He said since I was more confident I'd be fine learning the truth.

The fact that he continued to do something I told him I would kill myself over (if I still loved him) made me so incredibly upset I actually am contemplating suicide again. I thought he was telling the truth this whole time and now my self esteem is the worst it's ever been. 

Why is everyone on that thread saying I'm a piece of shit for telling him I'd kill myself when it was completely true? Why can't men stop watching porn for someone they supposedly love so much? God I wanna fucking die I hate this feeling so much.
