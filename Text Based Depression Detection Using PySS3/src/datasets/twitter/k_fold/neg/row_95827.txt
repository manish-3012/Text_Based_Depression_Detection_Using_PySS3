I always fall backI always remind myself that what Iâ€™m telling myself about myself is all in my head, itâ€™s literally not possible for me to be the worst person to ever be alive thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™m a narcissist when I talk down to myself everyday and loving myself isnâ€™t the same as selfishness. But Iâ€™ve fallen so far and so hard that Iâ€™ll never be able to tell myself the truth without making it seem like a lie.
