Staring at this bottle of pills...And it's just so tempting to just empty the contents of this bottle, and the many others in my home, into my stomach and just fall asleep.  
To just have all of this pain and despair end... just drift away.  
I just feel so used, damaged, and unlovable. It's exhausting to wake up each day and pretend like I'm okay. I'm really not.
