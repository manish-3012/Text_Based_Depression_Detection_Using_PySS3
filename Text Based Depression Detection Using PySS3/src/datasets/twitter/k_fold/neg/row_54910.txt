I can't and don't want to continue.My fiancee cheated on me and is possibly pregnant with the guys kid.
I have no friends.
Family kicking me out on the streets yet keeping my junkie brother.
I have a dead end job and can not get a second/better job.
Section 8 housing will not give me the time of day.
I'm disabled and am getting thrown off of disability because all of my papers were lost by the post office and possibly my identity could have been stolen as a result.
So what's the point of living?
