Even as a little girl I had suicidal thoughts. I feel constantly in pain.I have no idea why I am the way I am. I used to cry at night when I was little because I thought someone would murder me in the middle of the night and I constantly thought about killing myself or jumping out of the car while it was moving. I would run the scene over and over in my head. My parents were never abusive but for some reason I am always in a state of depression. I have terrible panic attacks where I hallucinate and I can hardly breathe, I feel like I am going to be killed and I get really paranoid. It is so difficult for me to be emotionally involved in a relationship because I don't trust anyone. If no one responds it is okay. I needed to vent some..
