I'm hanging in there, but I feel like I'm falling fast.I made a previous post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2ueej8/my_main_problem_is_that_i_feel_disconnected_from/

Long story short I'm feeling extreme apathy and misanthropy lately.  I've always been depressed but I feel like I've kept it together to some degree throughout my life.  Now I'm unemployed and drinking so much my kidneys hurt, and I seem content to lay around spending the last of my savings just paying the rent until it's time to finish the job.

I've let myself become uninsured, I stopped paying attention to bills, I didn't turn in my last year taxes in time even after filing an extension -- despite having a sizeable refund coming my way, and will again this year.  I keep eating frozen pizza and delivery. I'm a mess.
