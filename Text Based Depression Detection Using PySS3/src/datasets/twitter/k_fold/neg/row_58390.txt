Insult to injuryLast week, in a moment of severe pain, I posted on social media about how hard life has been for me lately. 

A couple of people responded with general messages of support-hang in there, sorry to hear this. 

One person who responded was a former classmate of mine. She's really nice and we got along well. She asked how she could help and I said that I could use someone to talk to. She said I could message her any time. 

It was late that night, so I wrote to her the following morning. The conversation was disappointing. I let her know some of the problems I've been having and she just seemed to not be listening. She was like everyone else, just saying hang in there. 

It hurt. I felt like I was wasting her time. I don't now why she offered to talk to me when she didn't care. We only ended up exchanging a few messages until she dropped out of the conversation. 

That was last week. Today I reached out to her again to let her know how things were going--I had taken some steps during the week to work on some of the problems that I had. She didn't respond. 

Later I found out that she had been in the same city as me today. I feel very hurt that she was here and never mentioned it/didn't reach out or make plans when she knows I'm having a hard time and I don't have anyone around me. 

She's the only person I have to talk to and she doesn't want to talk to me. 

I know a professional would be better, but I don't have the money for that. And I need someone to talk to in general, not just about mental health things. I don't have any friends. She's the closest thing to it. She is nice and caring, but I just don't matter to her. 

I don't want to live. This experience is the last disappointment I could take. I know I'm worthless, but this tenuous connection was the only bit of hope I had left. Maybe if I could have had a conversation with somebody, the pain would have alleviated a little. I'll always be alone and I can't deal with that pain anymore.
