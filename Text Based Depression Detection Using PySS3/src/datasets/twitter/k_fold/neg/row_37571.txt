Trying to drag myself onWel I was doing better until my last friend stole the money I had saved for my life.

Just found out I lost my cash and she is now in a different country...was my only friend in 5 years..guess she showed her true colors..

I'm not suicidal yet..I'm afraid I might become it though since I just lost almost 3k..this was my life..this was going to help me in my new life away from my ex husband
