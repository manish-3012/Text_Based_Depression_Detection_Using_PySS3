I didn't want to live to be 20my birthday is next week. back in October I was very determined to die. I would have never guessed I'd still be alive, or at least in the same position as I was then. 

last year I was told my birthdate is an unimportant day, easy to forget. only a couple people wished me well. my most favorite person didn't come online until 8pm, said a simple "happy birthday", then logged off. no celebration, no nothing.

I really was better off never being born. I've always told myself I'm not really into birthdays, but I've realized that's a lie to keep myself from expecting something. birthdays are wonderful. it's just mine that isn't. there's nothing important to celebrate that day anyways. 

my wish this year is to die. your gift to me can be a trip to Belgium for euthanasia.
