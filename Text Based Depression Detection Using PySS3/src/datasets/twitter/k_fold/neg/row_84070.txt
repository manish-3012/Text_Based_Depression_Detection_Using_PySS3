A broken heart I quess.I had a nice game session with some online friends, I visited some friends too and generally had a good day. However one thought of "I wish I had a partner" got me down. My chest and back hurt and I just wish I had someone to hold me and just talk to while falling asleep. Kinda wish I could just will my heart to stop cause it hurts.
