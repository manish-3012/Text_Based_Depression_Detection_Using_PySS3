I deserve all thisI was a really shitty kid, and teen. I've bullied people, made fun of handicapped people, was racist, tortured and killed animals etc. I've hurt many people by just existing

One day about 20 years ago, the kid I was bullying called me and said "revenge wil be sweet" and I thought nothing of it, made fun of it for years after that, what is this dumbass thinking, is he casting a spell on me or something?

Well what do you know, it's been 20 years since then, and life is absolute hell and only keeps getting worse. I think my life is punishing me for what I did when younger and it's teaching me lessons.

Just make it end, PLEASE, life is really not for me
