Need a friend or someone who will listenMy suicidal thoughts have been getting worse and worse lately. Iâ€™ve tried to mention it to my mom, but she just gets mad and says Iâ€™ll be put in a psych ward and ruin my future. I have nobody who will just have a conversation with and let me vent about it without trying to guilt me or getting mad. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can stand things.
