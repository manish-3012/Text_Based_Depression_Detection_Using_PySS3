Suicide Thoughts Getting StrongerOK, since the last time I was here, I've been to see the endo. Link to previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7rfccf/thinking_death_is_my_only_option/

Can't go on E until I've gone through the process of evaluation &amp; psychiatry with a gender specialist. I'm not sure if Australia has informed consent but it's virtually impossible to find someone here that will deal with me with the other mental health problems I have. So basically I can't even try E to see how I would feel on it. Might as well just forget about being who I am.

For my sexual issues, he added 100mg of Spiro per day to my list of meds. This, on top of the 200mg of Androcur (which I have been taking for a year now) &amp; still I have sexual urges. It also made me feel sick &amp; I did have to stop after about a week. Then, this morning, I was desperate after waking up with all those feelings again so I took another tablet.

Why? It's so depressing to want to get rid of anything sexual in your life &amp; know that nothing is possible! I so feel like giving up &amp; just ending it all. Why keep on subjecting myself to a life of solitude, frustration &amp; everything else I've been feeling?

I'm sick of being looked at &amp; feeling like an asshole, a deviant, a piece of shit by doctors (actually had one say it to me like 'you know you're a deviant don't you?') or wondering how they're going to take it as you can never be too sure. I'm sick of it being called OCD or an addiction when it's not. It's a sexual preference. I didn't choose it. I don't want it. If I could reach into my brain &amp; carve the piece out responsible for it, I would. I sometimes hope I'll have a stroke, maybe that'll fuck me up enough to not think like this anymore.

Seriously, the more I think about suicide, the more I just want to do it &amp; be done with it. It's better in the long run.
