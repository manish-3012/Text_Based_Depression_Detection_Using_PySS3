Once I clear my debts, it's done.I'm going to take care of what is necessary, then I'm going to asphyxiate myself.  I've reached a point where I feel little worth.  my friends do nothing but remind me how much of a failure to existence I am in every possible way.  I'm still broken hearted, a year later.  my family doesn't seem to care about what's going on with me since my brother is always having an issue and demands attention.  meanwhile, I'm just over here sliding farther and farther into the belief that I am just wasting space.  sure, people may care a bit for a couple weeks, say things like "I knew him so well" and "he was my best friend."  well where the fuck have you been the last 18 months?  when I needed someone and there's no one around.  when I've been in the ER 3 times because my anxiety attacks get out of control.  when I'm having seizures trying to get to sleep.  the longer I carry on the more complexes I build, the worse my health gets, the worse my emotional well being gets.  I'm at a point in life where I'm tired of trying to prove something.  I'm surrounded by braindead cretins who will ride something to the point it no longer matters.  There are many things in my life I hate, but the thing I hate the most is myself.  and not just because.  I have good reason.  trying to psycho-analyze myself just leads in me reminding myself I'm a failure.

when I'm gone, give my body to science.  I wasn't any good in life, hopefully I will find some use in death.
