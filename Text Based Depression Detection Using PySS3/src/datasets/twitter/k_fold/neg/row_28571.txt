Everyone dislikes meEveryone I know, friends, family, and even my gf seem to just distance themselves from me after knowing me for a bit. I'm just alone and that's it. How am I supposed to give life a meaning if no one even wants to talk with me for more than a month. I just can't find a purpose and I don't think I will ever.
