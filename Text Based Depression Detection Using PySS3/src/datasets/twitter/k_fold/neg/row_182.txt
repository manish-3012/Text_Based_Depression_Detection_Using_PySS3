After an attemptSo, for all those who have attempted to remove themselves from the world, did any of you experience some strange sensation after?

Like, for a few weeks after my first O.D. I was completely at peace, I was almost happy to be honest. 

It's the perfect calm, and there's this sense that you've purged your pain.

Now, of course I'm back to my misery, but I just want to know if anyone else experienced this.
