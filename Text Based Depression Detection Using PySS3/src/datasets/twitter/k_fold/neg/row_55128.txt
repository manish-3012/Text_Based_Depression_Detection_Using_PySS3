very close to suicidei deal with constant ruminations for over a year.

&amp;#x200B;

i'll use this letter to sum up what i'm ruminating.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hello dad,  
&gt;  
&gt;Hope you're doing well.  
&gt;  
&gt;I want to try explain what is bothering me in a simple, concise way with least emotional attached to it as possible.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have written long, repetitive emotional rants, but this is what is it in a simplified way.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is what is bothering me:  
&gt;  
&gt;I had an aggressive experience with mother growing up, mainly focused around education and mental health. Every day, my brain constantly fixates on it, and every other highly emotional experiences I've had in life, against my will. I deal with a spectrum of emotion every day, often focusing on this, and find it difficult to forgive because my future and well-being are important.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was bullied/depressed by dozens at 15 and wanted to change schools, and it only happened because mother screamed, threatened, and intimidated me, and I kept pushing her over months until she gave up. The real issues were never discussed. Instead, our relationship was smashed, a burden on a 15 year old was so heavy it left me crying to sleep at night regularly and attempting self-harm. At that age you're still making sense of the world, I shouldn't have dealt with being screamed at until mother gives up.  
&gt;  
&gt;She shouted me down for wanting to do university preparation, pushed me into almost 2 years of 2 different art courses I never wanted to do, and threatened to cancel university. I've dealt with hostile aggression for resisting. I simply don't see education the same way she does - education is there to give opportunity like Computer Science, I can learn about art in my own time - and that should be perfectly acceptable. It shouldn't have ever become a heated fight, and if I didn't want to do Creative Graphics or Creative Media Productive, that should be acceptable.  
&gt;  
&gt;By the time I was 18, three of my counsellors have stepped in and spoken to her. I grew up getting advice from another mother on how to deal with her and her unruly behaviour, and she would often get furious about mother's treatment of me. Mother shouldn't have been someone I get advice on how to deal with; mother should be someone I trust.  
&gt;  
&gt;Education conversations being an emotional battle where I have no choice but to fight is all I've ever known. â€œDON'T TRY BECAUSE I'LL WIN.â€ Education is important, my future is important, but it wasn't taken seriously. I had to outmaneuver and fight to get what I want.  
&gt;  
&gt;We live in a country with one of the highest youth suicide in the OECD, and I explained to her I was planning on committing suicide, and she simply didn't believe me.  
&gt;  
&gt;I explained why I wanted antidepressants, but she doesn't, and she went â€œUGH, YOU HAVE TO MAKE EVERYTHING AN ARGUMENT.â€ This is serious.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was taking antidepressants, and needed more, and she simply refused to pay and told me she doesn't want me taking them. I can't emphasise enough how damaging it is to just stop without medical assistance - this is dangerous. The other mother was furious, and believed she didn't take me seriously.  
&gt;  
&gt;I experienced psychological effects from antidepressant withdrawal in front of her, and she went â€œPOOR YOU, YOU HAVE IT SO TOUGH.â€  
&gt;  
&gt;I grew up seeing counsellors. I grew up bottling everything up, being abused without an outlet, and unsurprisingly, when I left home, I broke down, was on suicide watch by Massey University and even had a lecture cancelled once so the teacher can take me to the hospital.  
&gt;  
&gt;I didnâ€™t grow up with a mother I trusted, but instead someone to resist and outmaneuver as she verbally abuses me and aggressively tries to push me into a corner to control my life in unwanted directions. She was someone not to trust, but to hide information from and get advice on because you don't know what she'll do next. I consider her emotionally abusive and neglectful.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sometimes people screw up, but I never received an apology or attempt to do better for the repeated abuse I got. This is damaging to trust, and it was just normal at home. Sometimes I'd just be shrugged off as "too sensitive" instead.  
&gt;  
&gt;My brain is in a state where I fixate on all the pain she caused me 24/7, and other painful experiences in my life, and I can't control it. I go through a spectrum of emotions every day. When my mind is fixated against my will on all the pain she caused me, it is difficult to forgive or even move on.
