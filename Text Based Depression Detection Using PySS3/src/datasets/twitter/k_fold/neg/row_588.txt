Work pressure and mental tormentHello to all,

I struggled with suicidal thoughts throughout my entire college years. I studied medicine in Germany and work as junior cardiologist in a challenging top tier university research hospital here in Germany.

I am getting bullied by my colleagues and mentally tormented. I failed at many research projects and get bullied heavily because of this. I am 26, have no social interactions besides going to work and the gym. I have no friends, never had a girlfriend or any kind of physical contact to the opposite sex. The worst part is my work and all my failed projects. I just do not enjoy life. I know that many people here are in worse and more precarious situations, but I do not want to exist.   
I hate every moment. The only reason why I am living is my family and brother. I do not want them to feel sad when I die.

I just do not want to exist, because I hate life and my existence itself.
