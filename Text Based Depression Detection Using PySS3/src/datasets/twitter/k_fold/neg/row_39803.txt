This psych ward is a jokeI woke up feeling the worst Iâ€™ve felt since being here. The nurse told me that I should go for a walk and that it would help. Like she let me leave the hospital. So I walked straight to the store, bought a pack of razors and cut my legs up in the store bathroom. I was even able to sneak the razors in, in my bra. 

I did it so I didnâ€™t feel so suicidal, self harm helps tame my thoughts a little. Iâ€™m considering handing them in but at the same time I really donâ€™t want to. I need to say my goodbyes to the people I love and then I have the perfect way out. I wonâ€™t mess up this time.
