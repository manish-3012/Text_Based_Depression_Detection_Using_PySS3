Everything is falling apart at onceI mean I've never been excessively content with my life but lately I feel like all I even think about anymore is killing myself. 
Last weekend I got really high at a boy's house and he raped me and I still have only told my best friend because I'm too scared to tell anyone else or even leave the house or talk to anyone and everyone knows something is wrong with me but I can't tell them how bad I fucked up. I think my best friend is getting sick of me. I wish she wasn't because I also happen to be in love with her and it's ruining my life. Uni pretty much sucks because I can barely get out of bed so I'm madly behind. I managed to scrape an A in a test last week god knows how since I don't do anything. But I think that was a fluke and I'm going to fail now after all the work I have put in. I'm struggling so bad and I just can't see it getting any better and I don't know what to do I feel so trapped. I want to kill myself. So why haven't I done it yet? Why am I such a coward? Fuck fuck fuck.
