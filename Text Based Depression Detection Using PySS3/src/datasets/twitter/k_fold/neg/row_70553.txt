Thinking. It seems killing yourself is harder than it should be. I thought about jumping... but to hit concrete anywhere here only has a 60% death rate. Too low. At the local bridge it's 95, but it's water so shave off 10% and I really don't want to drown. I thought about getting drunk to dull pain and accelerate bleeding but getting drunk reduces success because of goofs. I'm sure it won't work. I'm house sitting in a couple months so that's probably the best moment
