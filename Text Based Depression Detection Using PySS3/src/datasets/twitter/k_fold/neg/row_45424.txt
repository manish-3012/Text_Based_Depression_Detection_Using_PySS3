I fantasise about getting a terminal illness and dying constantly. I donâ€™t have the guts to kill myself, but Iâ€™m desperate to die.All the people in my life are slowly abandoning me.
No one has even noticed how lost I am. 
All my hair is falling off. 
I canâ€™t take this anymore.
I just want to die. 
But I donâ€™t want to put my parents through knowing I killed myself. 
I just want to know if thereâ€™s a way to die where it isnâ€™t obvious youâ€™re killing yourself 
Iâ€™ve already written my suicide note
