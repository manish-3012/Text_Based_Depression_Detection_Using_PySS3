I have CPTSD from trauma and my life is shit.TW: Sexual and physical abuse  

I'm 20. DONT tell me "you have so much life to live" and "you're so young". I get it. But I want to tell you, the life that I have lived has been plagued by monsters, childhood rapes, fear of other children, defending my family, internalizing religious trauma, and living a life of always feeling like an "other".

I've been beat by electrical cords, hangers, toy lightsabers, brooms, an arrow used with a bow (those leave welts). I've had bruises the sizes of dinner plates and welts to match. I remember as a little kid, making a game of what color my bruises were going to turn. Would they turn purple or red or yellow or even be like a fun little rainbow??

This life has fucked my brain up. It has turned it onto a permanent danger mode. Danger mode is permanently on after being abused.. Going to work? DANGER MODE. Being around friends? DANGER MODE. Talking to customers? DANGER MODE. Leaving my house? DANGER MODE. Staying in my house with my head under the covers while I'm typing this on my phone? DANGER MODE. Anything related to sex? DANGER MODE. 

FUCK. THIS. LIFE.

WHAT AM I EVEN LIVING FOR?? IM NOT EVEN LIVING. I AM IN A FROZEN SPOT IN LIFE. I HAVE BEEN IN THE SAME POSITION FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW AND I LOOK BACK AND SEE MONTHS OF MY LIFE JUST WASTED.. ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS TRAUMA. 

I look at the world through the lense of a child who's expecting abuse. Screaming. Pain. 

I've been in therapy for 2 years and at least I have coping skills now. But I dont feel like this is a life even worth living.
