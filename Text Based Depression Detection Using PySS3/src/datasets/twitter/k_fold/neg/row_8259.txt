I cut myselfI had a bottle of Xanax in my hand but I couldn't bring myself to do it. So I sliced my arms and my legs and the same spot where my ex who just dumped me used to cut. I feel like such a fuck up right now but I feel so much calmer. 

I could cut my face up. I've always been "the pretty girl". That's what they come for but they never stay. Nobody I love stays. Every time it's "it's not you, it's me". But it has to be me.
