Why the fuck should I stayLife offers too little to me. I started hating it as early as 10 years old. It's been over a decade now and I'm still misreable. Why would I stay for this? Should I stay for my amazing minimum wage job? Maybe all the peers who don't want be my friend? Probably should stay for all the girls who don't notice me and would be disgusted if they did. Clearly, I expect too much. The one I can be grateful for is despite being completely broke, I can still afford rope.
