Life Becoming a Landslide (a goodbye).I havenâ€™t ever posted on here before because I get anxious over making my thoughts public. But as I am ending my life soon. I thought Iâ€™d say hello, and goodbye. 
Suffice to say, the coronavirus outbreak has stripped away any help I was going to get for my mental health. My family love me but I donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll ever truly understand me. 
The world is so horrible and scary now, I donâ€™t want to be a part of it. Every cry for help Iâ€™ve made has been brushed off, ignored, dismissed as â€œattitudeâ€ or â€œdramatic behaviourâ€. I hope mental health services feel some guilt and responsibility when I die. I am yearning for the day, to find a quiet place, where I can lie down and listen to my favourite songs one last time and slip away. Autism is a hell, thereâ€™s so much going on in your mind, it never stops, and you have so much to say yet you cannot get it out. I was mere weeks away from getting the intervention I need, and it was taken away and my illness painted over and made to seem like a figment of my imagination. Iâ€™ve tried to give myself a voice but Iâ€™m too tired to fight, Iâ€™d rather die than continue to be left like this. Iâ€™m just too tired and I know I wonâ€™t be able to cope with any more stress. So now is the time to leave. Too tired to carry on and live in a country thatâ€™s in lockdown, because I know the claustrophobia of being stuck inside for most of my day will drive me mad and my family wonâ€™t give me the space I need. 

Itâ€™s all too much now, and I canâ€™t do anything to prevent it because there is no one and nowhere to go.
