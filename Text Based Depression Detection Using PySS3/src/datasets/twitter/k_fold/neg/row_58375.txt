I think I've had enoughLong story short, I've had an eating disorder since I was 18. I've been in treatment 3 times for this already, and each time I came out I knew this was the last time I'd ever have to deal with it. But it's not. I just keep screwing myself, over and over and over. I don't know if I have the will to put everything on hold, again, for more of this and more of this shitty cycle. If I can't stop myself from destroying myself, what's even the point anymore? I've never felt like this before, and it's...scary.
