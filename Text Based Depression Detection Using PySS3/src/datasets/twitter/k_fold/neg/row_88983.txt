I'm sick of climbing in fucking lifeYou claw your way up and then life throws you back down. And even if it's because of the stupidity, ignorance, or complete inconsiderance of another human, it's just NOT acceptable to exact your own justice upon them. You're just fucking expected to keep your head fucking down and keep pushing fucking anyways. Even if you keep getting kicked whole your down. Nope, not allowed to make others pay, you're just supposed to up and move on from it. It's fucked. It's completely fucked. 

At this point I just want to get ahead and I'm starting to think the best way to do that is to step all over people and completely exploit them for my own benefit. I don't have a reason to give a fuck about them anymore. It's all bullshit anyways though. I'm just done with this life. I'm sick of fucking getting up and moving. I'm sick of hearing other humans speak. I fucking hate every goddamn person on the planet. They are all shit.
