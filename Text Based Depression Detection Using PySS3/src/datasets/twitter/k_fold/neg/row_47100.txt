That's all folksI've decided to end my life on my birthday in two days it's pretty grim I know but the reality is so much more morose. I'm so empty and have been for so long I forgot what it was like to be happy. All I see is my faults and the loneliness has went past killing me and is instead keeping me alive...well going to be was in a few days
