help(posting on an alt)                                       So I have a really happy life. Doing well in school, have a ton of really good friends, doing well in sports, donâ€™t do any drugs, etc. upper middle class, you get the point. The problem is, in bed, right before I go to sleep, I get super depressed and suicidal for absolutely no reason. I just think that my existence is pointless and it would be easier to just not live. There is no reason for this besides the fact that my mom is a heavy alcoholic and my dad works most of the time. any suggestions for not being suicidal?
