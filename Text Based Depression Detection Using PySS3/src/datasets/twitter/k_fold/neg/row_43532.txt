I thought I was done with this part of depressionI've had depression for about 20 years and I used to be accidentally stubborn about feeling like crap. There's some part of me that wanted or needed to feel bad, and it is took me many years to develop mechanisms that put me in a healthy mindset where I could just straight up avoid going down a bad road in my head or find my way back when I was in a low again. But in the last couple months I haven't been able to dig myself out of the hole anymore, that part of me is back that just wants to stay in there and make life feel worse and worse. The only thing on my mind all day has been "It made no difference to anyone else that I ever lived, the only difference is I have these feelings". I know it's irrational but maybe I'm just too tired to worm my way out of this one.
