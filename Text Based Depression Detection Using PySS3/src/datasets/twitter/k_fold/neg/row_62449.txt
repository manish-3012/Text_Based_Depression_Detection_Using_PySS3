No more hopeI got rid of everything in hopes for a better life. I left my hermit shell in Idaho and moved to FL to be around family and nothing worked out the way it was planned. I always figured before I'd kill myself I'd go on a journey and try something different. I'd set out woth $11,000 and in 10 days the trip cost 2k, when I'd sold my house I had to give my buyer 3k because of a sewer problem which held up the sale the day before closing. Now my dog died last saturday after watching him lose control of his back legs half way through the trip. I wonder now if I had just stayed put... would my little baby doggy still be alive... all I have left is some clothes and a handgun which I'll use to shoot myself in the head. Still not sure where and when. I'm thinking of doing it in Daytona Beach on the beach itself... probably where I sat with my dog right when we arrived here. I want to be with him so bad. I can't keep going anymore.
