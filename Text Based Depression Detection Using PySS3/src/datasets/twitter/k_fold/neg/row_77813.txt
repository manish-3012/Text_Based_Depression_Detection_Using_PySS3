HelpIn a toxic relationship. Beg for her not to leave when she threatens to. She treats me like shit. I put up with her no matter what she does. Everything is somehow my fault. She has said sorry 4 times in our 6 month relationship. I want to leave her but CANT let everyone have her. Have been having crazy thoughts. When she's nice she's the nicest. And she's so beautiful. I love her to death. But know this won't work. If I leave her she'll go off with someone else. I can't have that. I will never have another her. Im so insecure and have a low self esteem and have become codependent on her. I don't hang with my fiends anymore and I got a job I didn't want so I could make more money to move forward with her. But I'm depressed and want to kill myself. Like I'd be happy if she disappeared but that's not possible. I won't deal with the pain of leaving her. Been through that previously and won't go trough it again. I constantly think of ODing on my adderall, stabbing myself, hanging myself, or jumping in front of a car. I don't know what to do. We're looking at apartments and I'm scared to move on with her. I'm pretty close to stabbing myself in the stomach right now. 

TLDR; toxic relationship, would never want her with someone else. so either she gets cancer and I'm free or I kill myself. Pretty close to hurting myself right now.
