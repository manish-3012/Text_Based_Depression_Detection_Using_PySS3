I donâ€™t wanna live anymoreHi. This is my first time posting about what Iâ€™ve been feeling and I donâ€™t even know if I will say things right but I need to let this off my chest. I fell in love some months ago. I have had a great time with him but not so great at the same time. I am super jealous of him and I have these thoughts about not being good enough for him. I tend to freak out about simple stuff like heâ€™s following other guys on Instagram/Facebook/tik tok and I think those people look better and are better than me. I also get very jealous because people he dated keep texting him and he keeps interacting with them. That bothers me so much. I have started therapy and at some points itâ€™s been helpful but I canâ€™t control my mind anymore. I tend to try to look at his social media all the time to see if heâ€™s followed or interacted with someone else and my mind just goes crazy. We fight a lot because of my overthoughts and heâ€™s been very patient trying to explain thereâ€™s nothing going on but I canâ€™t seem to see that. After we fight, I blame myself for being so jealous and lately I have even tried to hit myself on the face. Some days ago he saw me doing that and helped me calm down. I feel horrible he saw me having a panic attack and I am scared he sees me differently now. I have lost my urge to live. I canâ€™t be overreacting about stuff all the time but I canâ€™t seem to help myself. I want to disappear but I donâ€™t have the strength to kill myself. I donâ€™t want to hurt my family and my boyfriend. I have had a lot of panic attacks lately. I think I am not beautiful, nice or interesting enough for him to be with me. Every time I see the people he had something with I compare myself to them and I see I am not even close to be that good. I need help. I want to be fixed. I canâ€™t take this anymore. 

Sorry if itâ€™s a bit confusing. English is not my first language and I also typing as things come to my mind.
