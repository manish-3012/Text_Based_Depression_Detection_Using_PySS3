Starting to RelateI donâ€™t know. Iâ€™ve considered killing myself before, but always had the thought about if Iâ€™d mess it up too, because Iâ€™ve messed up everything else so far. Or the thought of the burden itâ€™d be on those around me. However, now I feel like trying to get help is just as much a burden. Do people actually care? Iâ€™ve had thoughts about what would really happen if I was gone, and up till now everyoneâ€™s been sad, but in the last few days, itâ€™s been much less emotional for them. I doubt Iâ€™ll actually do anything, Iâ€™ll probably pussy out, but that just makes me feel so much worse about myself. This may not be the right place to post this, and if not, itâ€™s just something else Iâ€™ve screwed up.
