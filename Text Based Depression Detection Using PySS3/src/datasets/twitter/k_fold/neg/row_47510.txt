Idk anymoreI want to kill myself tomorrow by train.  My cousin hung himself, March 7, and I miss him a lot.  I want to join him.  What's the point in living if you're going to die anyway?  I've seen my psychiatrist and psychologist countless times, but nothing seems to be working.  Maybe I'm supposed to kill myself.  Maybe I'm destined to kill myself.  Idk. I'm just asking for help and trying to squeeze every last hope.
