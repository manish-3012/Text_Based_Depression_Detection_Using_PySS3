i really want to kill myself right nowi'm so lonely. i don't have any friends outside of school and nobody to talk to. my brother is the only person i'd want to stay around for, and i just found out he might not be coming home for christmas. i'm so tired of being alone. i can't do it anymore. i have nobody to live for. i'm too much of a coward to end my life but right now i feel like i just can't be here anymore
