Killing myself soonIâ€™m 18 years old and my life is already over. BPD and depression have destroyed me and I canâ€™t get help, my mum wonâ€™t get me help and itâ€™s now too late. Everything is too painful and itâ€™s not just circumstantial, it wonâ€™t just get better depending on my social situation. Everything hurts because of my fucked up brain and it would be easier to kill myself than live a horrifically miserable existence in which every day I struggle not to kill myself
