I want off this emotional rollercoaster.Hi. I'm not suicidal at this very moment, but I have been in the very recent past (as in, earlier today) and suspect that I will be again in the near future--and that I will be too paralyzed to write about it then--so here goes.

I've thought about suicide intermittently for several years. At first I was afraid of the idea and desperately wanted to live, but believed that my capacity to give back to the world was less than the resources I was draining from it and that I thus was morally obligated to do so. 

I've since dismissed this notion for several reasons: first, because I no longer think quite so little of myself; and second, that even my mostly hard-headed utilitarian self objects to a morality that would require this of people. And yet, perhaps because it gripped me for several months, I've had trouble dispelling the urge to commit suicide as a response to fear of the future (I am a talented catastrophizer!). Even so, since I haven't been prone to depression, I've always been comforted by the idea that when the fear subsides, I will want to live again.

In the last few months I have increasingly lost touch with that. I find myself overcome at times with hopelessness and ennui, and question the premise that life is inherently worth living--for which I can find no logical rationalization aside from subjective experience. Yet at other times I am happy and appreciate the inherent beauty and marvelousness of this universe, of music, of people, and I want to live to help other people and make something of myself and most of all experience all of this--

--and I fluctuate between these two as frequently as multiple times a day, seemingly uncontrollably, and it's overwhelming. I can't trust my mental stability enough to accomplish anything while alive, but neither can I die (since I'm essentially paralyzed while suicidal, and getting up to start putting a plan into motion generally swaps me into a more positive frame of mind). 

I wish I could choose one or the other (with life being the logical choice, if only for the sake of my family) and stick with it. I wish I could stay convinced it was the right choice, that life *is* worth living for itself and not only as a moral obligation, even with all the drudgery and pointlessness that a modern life entails--and that if it isn't that I will go out and *make* it into something worth living for. 

I had an eating disorder once, a number of years ago, and I know what got me through all the dark moments was that I knew, always and without a doubt, that I wanted to live and wanted to recover and I wasn't going to let its distortions convince me otherwise. I don't have that same certainty now, and I wish I did. Help me find it?
