One of the only reasons I'm still aroundI recently had a mental breakdown. two visits to a psychologist helped. However, I lied to friends/ family that I felt 100% better. The thoughts of ending my life sometimes go away for 10 to 12 hours at a time. However, the depression, anxiety, fear of failure, shame (I come from a well-off but controlling family), and deep hatred of uncertainty never left. The psychologist helped me remain stable for a while. My friends try to help...but I don't want them to worry for me, and I feel like I used my last sympathy card. 

**One of the only reason I'm still around** **is my fear that ending my own life could trigger a contagion where people I know do the same thing. The thought that my suicide could cause someone else to do the same thing,..is as painful if not more than my own mental illness. I'm trying to keep it together...but it's tough for me right now.**
