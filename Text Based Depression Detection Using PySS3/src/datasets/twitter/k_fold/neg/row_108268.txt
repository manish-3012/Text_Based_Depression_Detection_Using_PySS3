How to survive high schoolI know it's dumb because I'm only 14 and have severe depression and "life isn't even hard yet" but I've cut for the second time today. I'm a loser, a failure in the eyes of all, the reason my brothers are ruined in my mom's eyes. Nothing of worth. I'm average at best, and just ugly, inside and out. I see no reason to live, when all that happens is I get yelled at. But if I try to talk about it I'm "overreacting." Am I Reddit? Does my depression even count?
