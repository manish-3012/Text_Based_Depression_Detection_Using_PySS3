Antipsychotics make me want to kill myselfI use to love life. I loved yoga and exercising. I loved going for bike rides, eating healthy and going to school. I loved my old psychiatrist. Now I have a new psychiatrist that just forces me on antipsychotics and I think im going to kill myself if this is all there is for me. I can't think straight. I'm getting fat. I don't have the energy for anything. I can't work. What the fuck is the point? If I go off my meds they will just give me a needle in the ass.
