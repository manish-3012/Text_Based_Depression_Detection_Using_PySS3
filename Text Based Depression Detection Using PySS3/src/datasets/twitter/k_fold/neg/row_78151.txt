I'm going to kill myself after work tonight.I've got a weapon. I'm just going to go into the dorm showers and kill myself.

Until then, I'm going to go to work one last time. I work at an ice cream store. It's such a great place to work; I love my coworkers and my boss and the work that I do. Like the drinking I do, it helps me forget a little while how unhappy I am. 

Maybe it'll help me change my mind. Or maybe not.
