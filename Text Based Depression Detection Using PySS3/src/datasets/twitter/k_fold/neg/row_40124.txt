Has anyone ever thought about this?I firmly decided I **will** suicide because I see no future, but no rush, it will happen close to autumn.

But there is one thing which disturbs me. What if reincarnation exists? I kind of don't believe in it nor in life after death, but still.

Lemme tell you I come from pretty decent family which cares about me, they know about all my thoughts. No, they not alcoholics, no they (almost) don't abuse me. In other words, there are a lot more families worse than mine if you think from this perspective. I am fairly beautiful, and prolly ppl like me. I come from 2nd world country and I dont complain about my country I love it

Now about reincarnation stuff.

Commonly known that people in developed countries either have very few, or no (child-free) kids at all. But in developing countries birth rate is insane. So actually I have A LOT more chances to be born into one of those families. Given that I am female, perhaps I am gonna be female as well, it gonna SUCK.

Just one of my fears lol. And no this thought is not a point in favor of not to suicide, I will, but just have this kind of fear.
