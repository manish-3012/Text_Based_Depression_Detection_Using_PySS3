I just ended my only friendship I've ever had and... I don't have anything to live forI don't have any friends, I don't want any other friends, I have nothing to live for. I give up. I'm sorry Matana but I just can't do life anymore. I needed you in it but now I don't have you. I've got no future. I'm a ugly, selfish, piece of shit. I have no desire to deal with it any longer. I quit. I'm sorry for wasting your life
