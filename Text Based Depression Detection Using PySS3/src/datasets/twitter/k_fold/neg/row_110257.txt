I almost fucking diedI nearly passed out. I was semi unconscious. I can't tell if I lost my vision or if my eyes were closed. I started to shake slightly and I can't remember what it was but there was something I remember that I wanted to say to my ex. I was completely delusion so I have no idea what it was.

I still want to die. I was scared for a second but now I'm back to being calm and ready to try again.
