HelpI have just had a panic attack and I completely broke down and have no once to talk to itâ€™s 11:30pm and I seriously thought about killing myself being very close without detail but then I thought of what would happen and I couldnâ€™t take like I hate life so much but I canâ€™t do it because I donâ€™t want to make others upset and ruin there life cause I didnâ€™t want mine I felt sad for 1-2 years and want a way out but I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore I have no motivation bar the idea that people will be sad. I just feel empty and sad all the time and want to die.
