hi guys. breakup got me sad as fuckhey guys. so i was with this person and yeah we just broke up. i didnt sleep yesterday, i just got really drunk and took a bath that i dont remember (i woke up with wet hair and found the bathtub full of water) while blacked out (which was my "sleep"). i feel very very alone kind of just empty honestly. i want to just go to sleep and not be damaging to myself but i honestly dont remember how to.

anyways. whats been one thing you accomplished today? i went to a church at my school and sat and wrote in a book they keep there for anonymous notes and all. i cried the whole time i was there but im really proud that i left my house and walked over there.
