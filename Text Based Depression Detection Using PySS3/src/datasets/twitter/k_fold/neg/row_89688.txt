Why do people keep trying to â€œhelpâ€ when they have no clue as to how to help?I just need some time on my own to process things and fix myself, but every time I try to do that, somebody talks about how I look depressed and how I should stop being depressed. Itâ€™s like theyâ€™re picking at a scabbing wound and expecting it to help it heal. 

I also think itâ€™s just a completely selfish act, where they feel bad when someone around them appears depressed. Because they donâ€™t want to feel bad, they then try to poke and pry at the depressed person to stop them from giving off â€œbad vibes,â€ all while making things worse because they have zero clue as to what theyâ€™re doing.
