Sucide noteHey First of all I would like to say that I'm sorry that I came into your life and I ruined everything for you,I never meant to ruin Everything for you I Just wanted to make you happy that's all I ever wanted.I didn't think it would come to this but idk I cannot live the guilt of whatever I did,I knew it was wrong but I just wanted to hear your voice one last time and I I I'm sorry I'm sorry for always annoying you all the time,sorry for disturbing you all the time,sorry for ruining your mornings Everyday.It didn't have to be this it way it was all my fault starting from January it was all my fault,and I I I cannot live  like that it may seem like a small thing to you,but I can't I just idk something came to my mind and I I cannot live before I go you need to know what kind of person I am what I wanted to tell you that gonna make you hate me so much 
First of all I did all this so that I could hear your voice one time , whatever I'm going to say I mean whatever I say I'm not joking I'm serious
On the 2nd of March after my exam was done I planned to jump from my building and on that day I wanted to ask you that whether you need me in your life ,and idk what happened we talked that day and you comforted me and I couldn't jump then I just idk I just thought that if I live I would get to hug you one day and now I won't be able to and that was the only thing preventing me from jumping,knowing that yeah if I survive I'll get to hug her one time.But now I have to jump Because the thing which was preventing me from jumping is not there now.Its idk I wasn't joking when I said that I needed you for the past almost 2 weeks my mental health has only been going down and down.And I cannot control myself yeah I know neither do I have anyone who's gonna talk to me,I know what I did was wrong the other day but I just wanted to hear your voice .
You know it's better that I die today than you know to live a life where I don't have you as my friend  because it turns out that I tried to forget you for a month and I couldn't as a friend.Its just idk it wasn't supposed to be this way , yeah I know what you would say sometimes things don't work out.You didn't complete your promise V you told me you would help me whenever I'm weak.Yeah I know you're gonna say I'm so pathetic and I'm a scum because I lied.I knew it was wrong lying about my health but I just I'm sorry I had broken down completely.I needed you that's why I lied,I needed you because I didn't want to break down and to be honest I did break down completely
I am sorry for ruining your days for ruining your mood at times.haha I'm gonna tell them to not disclose my body so that it doesn't come in the newspaper.I am just sorry that I ruined everything for you ,I know that you are angry with me  I only lied because I knew that if I say that I wanna hear your voice you wouldn't call me so I had to and still it didn't work . I'm not scared right now because I'm going to jump probably idk it's like everything is gone for me , there's nothing which gives me the will to live anymore.Haha my eyes have swollen because everyday I cry so much idk I just feel guilty for lying to you about my health it was you know becoming bad but and I had to talk to you.Anyway it's a long letter I'm not sure if you will ever read this or not but if you do I want you to be happy forever,and this time I'm not joking I will actually jump Because the one thing preventing me from jumping is not there haha you remember you told me I hope you die well your wish is coming true.Anyway I'm gonna go now I need to prepare myself.Goodbye V....
