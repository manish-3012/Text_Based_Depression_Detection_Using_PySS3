I really need help for a friendI'm sorry if this is not appropriate for this subreddit, but after reading the sidebar, I don't think i'm breaking any rules; If I am, I am very sorry and you can report this post.

I'm in highschool and have a friend who has severe depression and self harms. He's a really great friend of mine and our group of friends at school is always supportive of him, but we never get into details about his problems. Just yesterday though, he attempted suicide. I found out about this through another close friend in our group. I want to ask if he's alright, but since he didn't tell me directly, I don't think he'd "appreciate" the idea that someone else knows without having told them himself :( . So, would it be appropriate for me to just message him "hey, are you alright?" or something similar? Just to make sure he's alright? Thank you for any responses.
