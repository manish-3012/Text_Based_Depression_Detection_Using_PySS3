At the hospital. How do I convince my friend to stay and get help?I've got a friend who has always been heavy into drugs. Worst I've seen. Today I called to hang with him and he was crying. I heard from a buddy that he showed up at work completely fucked up. Drove to work on 4mg of xanax and 60mg of percocet. I drove him to the hospital cause his damn eyes were going in different directions and he was barely coherent, falling asleep while he was talking. He was earlier determined completely to get help, but now he's afraid of not being able to see his girlfriend (also a user) and be able to sleep in his own bed. I've been through the hospital system and I told him everything I could, but he's at the point where he's refusing to budge and telling me to give him just one more week and if he starts using again (daily xanax, can't stop obviously), he'll call me and he'll get admitted. It's obviously not going to work. How do I convince him? Will the people here at the hospital try to convince him as well? 
Thank you.
