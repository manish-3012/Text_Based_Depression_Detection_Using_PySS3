It's my 26th birthday, and I'm ready to die.Today is my 26th birthday, and marks another year of my life spent in misery. 

Not only that, but it also marks 1 year since my fiancee walked out on me.

Left me last year, on my birthday, while I was in the fucking hospital.

Now here I am, with no one in the world to love, no friends, and no family around me. 

Everyone I've cared for has left me, abandoned me, left me to rot in the darkness around me. 

Not but a single message has come across my phone wishing me well today, reinforcing that no one gives a fuck.

I'm sick of waking up day in and day out, just to fall back asleep at night.

I'm sick of being tired, that exhausted feeling that never goes away with sleep. 

I'm sick of reaching out to those few people that still hold a place in my heart that don't deserve it,

And hating myself even more when they never answer. 

I just wanted someone to care, to love me, to stay by my side. to not betray me when I needed them most.

What a fucking fool I was, no one could ever give a fuck about me for more than a few months at a time.
