Sick of this awful existenceI'm sick of unrequited love. I'm sick of not having the answers to everything. I'm sick of caring about what everyone thinks of me and what I have to prove and stress and my place in the world and how nothing matters at all. If I died everything would I just stop moving so quickly and all the uncertainty would just be gone there would be no more anything and I could finally just stop suffering.
