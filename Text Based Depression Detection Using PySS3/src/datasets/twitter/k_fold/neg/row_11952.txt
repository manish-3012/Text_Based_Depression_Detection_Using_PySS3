i kinda need someone to talk to.honestly i been  thinking about suicide for a long time maybe since i was about 13. im 17 now. i basically feel like i'm on my own and have no one to turn to. i have friends but i can't tell them how i'm feeling. for the fear they'll think i'm weird. for that same reason i can't tell my parents either. i'm about to turn 18 in a week. i'm not too excited about it because i'm pretty much going to be on my own and i don't see my future being successful. also my gf of about 4 months broke up with me because she thought i was cheating. or maybe she just doesn't want to be with me. and she is just trying to pin something on me. idk im not happy nor sad. i think it would be better for everyone if i was gone. my parents could stop worrying about me. and i won't be using up all their money, with food, clothes, etc. people claim they care about you but deep down its only myself and thats the only person i can trust. being with my gf has made me not think about it. but now that she is gone i don't have anything left. i get annoyed with the smallest of things. and now i'm back to being angry\ sad most of the day. just thinking about everything altogether. suicide seems like the best option.
