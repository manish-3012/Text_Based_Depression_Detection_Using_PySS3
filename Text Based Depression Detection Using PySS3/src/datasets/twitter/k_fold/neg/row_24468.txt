Every moment is a bruh momentI really have nothing going for me. I was just shy of gifted as a kid but I'm not at all smart. I don't particularly excel in anything. I can't draw, make music, heck I can't even play Minecraft without being scared or dying, I always play on Peaceful. I barely even beat the Ender Dragon.

It's time to go to college now and I don't want to do it. My parents want my to be the "first on both sides" to go and finish higher education but I genuinely have no idea what I want to major in. I never thought I'd make it passed 18 and I don't want to be stuck in a miserable cycle for the rest of my life.

I don't have friends anymore, yet I crave human interaction. I used to be so out there and social. But I've never been able to hold good friends. I really want to end it all but I'm so scared of what's after and if I'll be eternally punished. I want to die but I also want to experience all of the happy feelings I have once in a blue moon.

I'm stuck in limbo and I don't know how to get out.
