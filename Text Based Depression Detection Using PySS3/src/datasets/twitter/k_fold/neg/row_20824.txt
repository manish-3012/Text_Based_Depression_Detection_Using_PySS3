I have no more energy anymore.I've been depressed for over a year now, and my family and friends are the sole reason why I haven't killed myself, but even now that may not be enough for me. School and work is just wearing me down, I can never seem to catch a break. I feel like the stress will never go away, and I can't deal with feeling like this forever, I'm just so lost and I don't know what to do.
