Anyone know how to make this better.I am so near the end of things. I live on benefits which have now stopped so we literally have nothing to live on. We managed to get food in before they stopped it but have a couple of days left before we are screwed. My partner will be able to solve it so I shouldn't be worried really but I am. 

I hate this time of year as it is. It reminds me that I have been alive for another year and every year I promise to make it the last one. I have attempted suicide twice and they were both in January. Each time I have learnt and done it better. It is because I am overweight that has saved me.

 I am not at breaking point yet but everyday it is getting worse. My heart feels like it is coming out of my chest. I keep dissasociating and not knowing what I have done.  I need some strength in order to commit suicide because when I am really low then I can't evendo that. 

How do I stop the torrade of unhappiness that is pressing on me. I need help I don't know who to talk to or where to go. I am not very good with helplines.
