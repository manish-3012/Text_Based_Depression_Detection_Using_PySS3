Looks like the end of the roadI live in Israel. There are several reasons why I don't like the life in here, culture wise and other. I don't want to be a part of any dispute, just live my life in peace. 
I don't want to be surrounded by religion (it's hard to describe the situation - I pay a lot of taxes, more than $2000 a month, and it all goes to subsidies religious folks that don't work and spawn children that will eventually elect the same guy that gives them the funding, an average apartment rent is about $2000 a month).

I want to live in the US, but I was born in here, so I can't.
Most US citizens don't know it, but it's really hard to immigrate to the states, it usually requires money, a life long plan and/or a spouse with the appropriate benefits. 
I work in IT, in a really required field, but without a sponsor, I won't be able to move. 
I'm over 30, so it's too late for me to take other roads/college.

I've looked into other countries, but they don't offer a better solution and I really do want to live in the states.

I have about $180K in savings, that don't really help me with that cause and today, I've lost the annual green card draw, what would have been my only option to be part of the group once in my life and get in.

Most people won't understand (some of those who do, left when they could). Therapist were usually in for my money, I never felt like they had a solution, believe me when I say it just went on with no direction or a useful advice. the worse was that some felt sorry for me and others scolded me.

I can't really see a future for myself, I've lost all hope.
