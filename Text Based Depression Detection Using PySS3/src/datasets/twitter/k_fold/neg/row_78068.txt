This place is hell. Change my mind.Happy people are there to make unhappy people feel even worse. Congratualation, if you won in genetic lottery. 

I didn't. I have been suffering from day 1. 

3 fucking decades of suffering made me completely qualified to deserve a fucking peace. My hell has been funnily caused by very religious people, who I don't even want to call parents. Fuck this shit. I'm out. Sleeping pills and booze will make hypothermia much more pleasant. If God exists, he's a fucking sadists.
