No one wants to meet new people, and if you don't meet someone at high school or as a kid, you're fucked.I've tried talking to people, very often it just leads to people saying "I don't even know you, why are you talking to me?" so what the fuck are you meant to do? 

Seems if you don't know anyone early you're absolutely screwed and alone.
