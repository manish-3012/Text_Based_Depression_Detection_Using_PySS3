An updateI posted a thread about suicide and my Aunt being a 911 dispatcher had the Ambulance called and cops came to. Here is what happened,

1. I got put 5 days in the mental hospital. Other patients and the nurses there were nice.

2. Dad came and picked me up and he started screaming at me. He talked about a lot of things and Iâ€™m still sad to see how Iâ€™m still being completely misunderstood about a lot of shit.

Most of it is due to him not understand my social limitations (not picking up social cues, how to act in social gatherings, reading facial expressions etc)

Thatâ€™s how our society is though. People just purely living there lives only looking at whatâ€™s put right in front of them. Not bothering to learn nor accept people who have there brains â€œwiredâ€ differently so to speak.

So Iâ€™m going to take these meds, go to the doctor, see the therapist and if none of that works, Iâ€™m fucking done finished.

It really does suck that due to being born differently from everyone that I was socially isolated from people and much more shit I donâ€™t want to talk about.

I know what normally happens to people like myself who are on the spectrum. We get killed a shit ton by police, we become homeless and die out in the cold. I fucking get it. No one really wants us around.

Our mental health system is very bad. We hit people up with $5k mental health to penalize them. Everyone is expected to be super happy and work your life away so you can even meet your basic human needs. A ton of People are all around ignorant and I donâ€™t get it.

So much fucking evil and how money in a Capitalist nation can really fuck up peopleâ€™s minds. Itâ€™s starting to sicken me this life this system we created everything.

In fact, once I get tired of playing the game that we all have to play or die..............I donâ€™t know.
