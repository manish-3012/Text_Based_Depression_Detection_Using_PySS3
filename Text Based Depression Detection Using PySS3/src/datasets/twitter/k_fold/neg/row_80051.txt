Can't find the will to live anymoreIt's as if the universe keeps pushing me down, kicking me while I'm there and laughing maniacally while I desperately try to get up. Now I stopped trying. I'm frozen. I can't get out of bed, I can't engage in my hobbies. I can't eat. I suck at parenting. I think they would be better off with out me. Financially im totally screwed, this year has not been kind to me. I've lost my best friend,my job, essentially myself.   I'm not even myself anymore. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. The tunnel just gets longer and darker. I don't want to hurt my kids but I can't even breathe. Every particle of my being hurts. I don't want to do this anymore. Only thing holding me back at this point is how do I make sure they are ok with out me. Call me selfish, you have no idea the pain I'm in. I can't escape it.
