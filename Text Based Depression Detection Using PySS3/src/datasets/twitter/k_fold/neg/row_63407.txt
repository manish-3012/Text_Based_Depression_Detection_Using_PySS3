I need to kill myselfMy life is actually on the up. But, I don't know why I'm working to improve.  I don't want anything in working for.

I've fought hard against the idea that I hate everything.  I've found it too edgy and dumb, but as the years go by, I can't deny how much I don't like, how much I hate.  

All I want is to kill myself.
