I Donâ€™t Want To Be Here AnymoreIâ€™m such a terrible person, Iâ€™ve hurt so many people in so many different ways and itâ€™s always my fault. Iâ€™m terrified of being alive now, Iâ€™m just scared of consciousness and wishing for relationships that will never exist. 

I wish I was good enough for somebody, just anybody. I try so hard sometimes but itâ€™s never enough, I would just get really angry but Iâ€™ve learned that getting really angry leads to broken friendships and the such. But I canâ€™t be myself because people donâ€™t like me. Iâ€™m too skinny too and I really hate my face and just everything about me honestly like my right ear. 

It just sucks that I canâ€™t find someone who accepts me for me, I donâ€™t wanna be left out anymore. I hate being not cool enough to be in photos with friends or getting ignored when a more popular friend showes up to a gathering or something.

I attempted suicide back in January and was so close but I survived because the world hates me or something I donâ€™t know. I like hiking now because the woods doesnâ€™t care how you look or act or sound. Speaking of sound my voice/lisp makes me want to kill myself, god everytime i talk to someone new they ask me if i knew i had one and i know iâ€™ll just go and cry about it later because i just want to be one of the normal ones sometimes

i need to try again
