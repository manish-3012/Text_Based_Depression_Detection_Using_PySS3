First time poster.Iâ€™ve been suicidal for the last few months. Iâ€™m recently diagnosed with bipolar ii and itâ€™s getting in the way of everything in life. I feel hopeless to fight it. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. My partner thinks Iâ€™m saying it to manipulate him  and I donâ€™t know who else to talk to
