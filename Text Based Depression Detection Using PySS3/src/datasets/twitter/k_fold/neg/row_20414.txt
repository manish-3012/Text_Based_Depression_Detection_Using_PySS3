Donâ€™t you hate when things mess upI wanted to be a new me in new year last year everything was shit I was surprised I didnâ€™t kill myself last year.

So my plans was to be new me forgot get my pass and move on, be who I want to be. 

I have a good job and awesome boss (I work at home so it helps)

I was playing to do CrossFit n MMA

I was planing to ask a girl out (my fiancÃ©e left me 6mnths ago)

But of course life is a bitch,

I work but not much to do so I get little hours (we r a small company) so I got make much, and I am behind on so many bills (I was laid off for months be4 I got this job) so everything is adding up n I canâ€™t take it anymore....

Canâ€™t afford the gyms cuz of all the bill and stuff (Ontario is expensive)

Iâ€™m afraid of asking the girl out cuz I have so much trust issues....

Home I get bossed around and told to do everything even pay major bills.... 

I really wished I ended my life last year, I really didnâ€™t want to feel like this again this year but 3 days in and the feel cane back and kicked me in the nuts...
