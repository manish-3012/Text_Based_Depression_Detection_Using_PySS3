HelpSingle mom. 28. No real emotional mental spiritual support. Parents watch kid when work calls for it. Theyâ€™re good to kid but I have hard time asking them to watch kid more. No one else to ask. Tired of being alone. So thoroughly tired of being alone. Could not possibly be more fucking tired of the shit that is my life. I hate so much. Used to be grateful for everything. Used to be happy. Now not sure if I pegged all my happiness on my relationship(s)... donâ€™t know. Wasnâ€™t always that. Conservation work left me feeling proud of myself much of the time. Now my work leaves me feeling more alone than ever. My babyâ€™s dad (used to be best friend) (used to be only friend) doesnâ€™t seem to want anything from me but my body, I have no real friends...people that say they care, but they are in other states, or my brothers friends, or just too busy with their own lives. I donâ€™t fit anywhere. 

Lonely. Want to be chosen. 
Want to be wanted. 
Accepted. 
Desired. 
Treasured.

A tattered flag.. 
trampled 
Mud. Blood. Sweat. Tears. 
Tears. Rips. Edges shorn. Pieces of me wrapped around bloody wounds. 
I blend with the dust. I am dust. 
Forgotten. Left. 
Alone. 

Does anybody hear me....?
