I have Bromhidrosis. Give me a reason why I shouldn't commit suicide.This sickness is quite unfamiliar to most of the people. It basically causes you to always smell ridiculously bad. Like real bad. There's no chance for living a normal life, nobody takes me serious, people don't understand that I'm not responsible for the bad smell. It's completely destroying my life.
