Please help I'm so lost, anyone pleaseI'm 16 and just confused. I'm unsure on whats really happening, my parents are being abusive but everything seems fine. They're gonna drive me to suicide and I'm just lost on what to do. They stole all the stuff I worked and payed for with the excuse of being a good parent, I can't feel happy, just melancholic. I'm not happy at all, how are you good parents? You're making me consider suicide as a last resort. They took my phone so I can't call a hotline for help, my music player so I can't listen to music to cope, and all I have left is my laptop which they may take. I would get a job to buy more stuff back but I don't have a phone. I've had to resort to drugs but I'm so tolerant to everything I've taken now. What do I do? If I go to a foster home I feel like it'll get worse, I'm so fucked.
