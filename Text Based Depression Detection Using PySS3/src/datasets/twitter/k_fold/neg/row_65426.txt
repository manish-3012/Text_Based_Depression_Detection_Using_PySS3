Does anyone know what happens to credit card debt after you die?I've been building up credit for a while now, and realised that I have a butt tonne at my disposal.

If I organised a huge funeral for myself, rented a big venue, open bar and fully catered.
Could I put it all on Amex before I commit. So my friends and family can have a big ol' party to celebrate when I finally get out.

Might take the sting out of the loss for them and keep a lasting happy memory.

Would the card companies know straight away and bounce the credit?

I don't want my last act to be screwing a catering company.
