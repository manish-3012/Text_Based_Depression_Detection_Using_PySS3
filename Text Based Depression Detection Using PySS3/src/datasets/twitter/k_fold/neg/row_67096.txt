Knife in one hand, pills in the other. I don't want to die.Hello. Sorry to bother you all, but I need to talk to someone. I am going to kill myself if I can't calm down and I don't want to die. My boyfriend is gone. I trusted him. He said he wanted to open up to me and share everything with me. He realized early on that he couldn't, but instead of telling me (and he knew I'd be OK with it), he just made up things about his past. He lied about everything. He slipped up and I found out. He said he was sorry. It was rough. I forgave him on the condition that he not lie anymore. He accepted. I asked him to get tested. Chlamydia. I got tested myself and was OK. Soon he told me he loved me. He said it several times over the course of a week. Then he said he took it back. He said it was a lie and he never felt that way. Crushed me. Even worse this time, but again we tried to move forward. Since then he's been a terror. Always mad at me. Always blaming me for everything. Yelling at me when I get sad about the current state of affairs. Drove home stumbling drunk and said I drove him to it. Packed his bags and threatened to leave. Triggered me. Got on my hands and knees and begged him not to go. He stayed. He promised he wouldn't do it again. He just did. Won't pick up the phone. I'm going to die. Please help me.
