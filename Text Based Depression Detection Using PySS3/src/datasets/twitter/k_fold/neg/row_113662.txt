This life will never present with an answer will it?It was veterans Day yesterday for me. God I wished I had seen combat, instead I wounded up with the job where your always state side, instead I wounded up with some bullshit TS rate, instead I wounded up having not been man enough to pick up a gun and go infantry.

Why is it even when I have accomplished my goal I woke back up here. Why fucking me why why
