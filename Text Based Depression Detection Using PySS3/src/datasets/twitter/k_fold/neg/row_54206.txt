I want to end it, but at the same time I constantly try to help people not end it. I feel hypocriticalI have lots of suicidal friends &amp; peers, and I've had to talk a lot of people out of suicide. I want to kill myself, though. I can't follow my own advice. I want to get help, but it's not available. I wish the people I've talked to could return the words to me but they've already struggled and I don't want to add on more. I keep contradicting myself. I feel so fake. 
I know it's wrong but it feels like it'd be right to do it for so many reasons
