It feels pointless to keep trying to get better.I saw a psychiatrist today and was told that that my only options left are expensive medications not covered under public healthcare, but that I shouldn't keep my hopes up for those to even help. I asked if I was too far gone for treatment, and she dodged the question. 

I'm desperate and considering illegal options. Once all these options are exhausted I guess the only other option will be to end things. No professional I've seen out of the dozens of them seem to have any real hope for me. I keep being told to grit my teeth and "just hold on" but I don't want to do that anymore. I'm so sick of hating life. I'd rather die than live to get older. If I reach 26 and I'm somehow not dead or better, that'll be it. 15 years of chronic suicidality and being a pathetic loner is long enough. I don't think I could bare getting to the late 20s still staying the same. I would rather die.
