If I get rejected one more time I am ending it allI have put myself out there for eight years and all I get is rejected because of my weight. If I get rejected one more time I am done. I will end it. I can't take anymore. and its not just romantic relationships its friendships, apartments, rooms to rent, everything. for eight years I tried to make friends and get ghosted or blocked instantly, or tried to find rooms to rent and get turned down because of being on SSI, tried getting housing through hud and been turned down many times.  I been rejected 19 times this past week by women and trans women I literally can't take one more rejection by anything even if my credit card gets denied or if I apply for a loan and get turned down ti will just push me over the edge. I can't take anymore being told no or I don't qualify or I am ugly and disgusting etc. I AM A HUMAN BEING AND I MATTER AND HAVE FEELINGS TOO. JUST BECAUSE I AM FAT OR ON DISABILITY DOESN'T MEAN I AM A DAMN ROBOT!!!!
