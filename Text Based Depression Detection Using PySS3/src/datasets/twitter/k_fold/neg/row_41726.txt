On the edgeBeen fighting depression for the better part of a year now. Two previous attempts that failed. Slit wrists in 05, and water hose to exhaust pipe in 07or8. I refuse to take medication as I'd prefer to stand on my own two feet than have a fucking crutch I'm dependent on. So self control is kinda important to me.I've always for whatever reason had small circles of friends, and lately over the past few years people have drifted away due to life or whatever I probably go for a month or more before hearing from anyone reaching out to chat if that. While I do have co-workers, I'm a bookworm, reading a book, comic or movie when on break.

I've had a few sluggers deck me the last 3-4 years, or tldr dealing with bedbugs, unstable housing situations before that, and family stuff, which all ratcheted me into a heavy alcoholic, which I'm struggling to put heavy brakes on, but not much luck. I'm so tired. Not suicidal, but I've felt myself teetering there slowly.
