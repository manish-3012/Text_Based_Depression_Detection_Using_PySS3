I want my life to endIt's hopeless. What's the goddamned point. I've tried every recourse. Nobody gives a shit. There's nothing left. I just want it all to end. I spent yesterday sitting in a chair in a dark room, I think today I'll just fucking stay in bed. I've got no reason to get up. Fuck my life. Fuck everything.
