Trying to find reasons not toI've been searching for ways to end it. I have no friends or family, i started soothing my stress by drinking and trying to socialize at bars and clubs to no avail. 

I even started thinking what my obituary will say. Who will I be remembered by, who would even publish or pay for my obituary in the paper. I was good in drama at school and a very good actor and control my public view that people and strangers have towards me. But I have nothing to live for. 

I don't know how to talk to a professional and I don't know what will be the consequences of it. Will I lose my job?
