Ending this now. Goodbye.I'm done. I've posted on here on a throwaway but I don't even care anymore. My name is Genevieve. I live in Canada. I have psychosis and bipolar ll. I didn't want it to come to this. I have a wonderful family and boyfriend,  but they'll be better off without me. I attempted a few months ago and failed,  but this time I'll make sure I don't. I'm taking a bottle of epival and slitting my wrists. I just wanted to let you all know that I really tried to recover. I really did try, but I'm not strong enough. Goodbye sw
