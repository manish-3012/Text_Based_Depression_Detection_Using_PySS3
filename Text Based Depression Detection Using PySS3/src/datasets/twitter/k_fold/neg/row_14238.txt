Thick as a brickI've been thinking about suicide everyday for the past 2 years now. I've tried it once and didn't succeed sadly and no one knows. I did it then because my mom is verbally abusive to me and my choices in life. My old friends don't keep in touch with me and I rarely ever leave the house. The only people I talk to now are a group of friends that I've met over the Internet. 2 days ago I received a letter that I will be unable to attend university again because I failed classes. My mom has yet to read the letter but we both know what it says. She has yelled at me everyday save some days when she is feeling benevolent. She has called me a failure, told me she wished I moved away for university so I could be out of her sight and has reminded me of every fuckup I have ever done multiple times. She has laughed in my face when I have confronted her as that is usually her defence when she knows she is wrong. 

I'm too much of a pussy to actually kill myself though. If I had a gun somewhere it would have already been done. But all the other methods seem like to much pain. But I am seriously thinking of trying again because I don't want to deal with my shit of a life anymore. 

I don't know why I lasted this long I guess I just didn't want to let my Internet friends down.

Sorry,


Alex.
