Is there hope for this lost soul?Delete if not allowed, but I need help. This isn't a throwaway account, this is my first Reddit account.

I've felt this way for as long as I could remember. I am 22 years old and I constantly feel suicidal, but regret it later. I've been on medication, but can't keep up with it or doctors appointments. I feel as if I'm a waste. I just don't want to feel anymore. I feel like I done everything. Life hurts. I don't amount to anything and have no job. I feel like I lost my chance of living a normal life, to find friends, or even go to college. I don't know. The only that keeps me going is my little siblings, but even then I feel like a disappointment to them. I feel like I've done everything to my ability to make my life good but I end up ruining it. Would it really be that bad if I die? Hell is what I feel like I deserve. I've lost all my faith, am bi, lazy, fat, I have no work ethic,and my family deserves better. My mother wants me institutionalized for my suicidal thoughts, but that would just be a waste. I feel guilty for using my bed or eating food or even wearing clothing my mother purchased. I'm a mess. Is there any hope for me? Please I need to know it will get better.
