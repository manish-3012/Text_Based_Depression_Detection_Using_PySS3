Really want to end it all.Full disclosure: I am 41 who thought I was happily married. I have had lots of medical issues my whole life. 

Most recently, I have been plagued with a case of erectile dysfunction. Add that to the pile of my feelings of worthlessness. 

My wife last night told me she would prefer if I no longer try to be intimate with her or do any more than hug her. I asked â€œwhat can I do to be more appealing or make you want me?â€ 

She simply replied, â€œ there is no answer to that question.â€

So, Iâ€™m off to find a bridge. Fuck it.
