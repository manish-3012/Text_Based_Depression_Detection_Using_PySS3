What would you do before committing suicide?Iâ€™ve reached the point that Iâ€™m closer than Iâ€™ve ever been to taking my own life. Itâ€™s crossed my mind on several occasions but recently it just seems like the best thing to do. I used to be a happy fun person but the depression has just become more and more of a toll everyday. Financial troubles. Personal troubles. Relationship troubles just keep piling up no matter what I do. Iâ€™ve become more of a burden to everyone Iâ€™m around.  I have written my letters. Planned goodbyes with loved ones. Organized my personal belongings. Chosen a place and method to die with an inert gas so itâ€™s clean and painless. Setup to have a notification sent so I will be found. Iâ€™m going to spend the next 2 days going to my favorite places one last time before I prepare my last meal. Dress myself in my favorite outfit and lie down to take my final breath.
