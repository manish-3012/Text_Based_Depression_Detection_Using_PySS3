How easy it all seemsEvery time I come to it, dying seems to be more and more pleasurable. Although, I don't think I could ever do it. I can't help but wonder how it feels to put a gun barrel to my temple. I hate life and it's rollercosters of emotions. 

I find it funny that I work at a substance abuse treatment facility. Everyday I see our clients, and just think to myself. There isn't much difference between me and them. I could easily be where they are. Only difference is, I would have kill myself before I ever could get here.
