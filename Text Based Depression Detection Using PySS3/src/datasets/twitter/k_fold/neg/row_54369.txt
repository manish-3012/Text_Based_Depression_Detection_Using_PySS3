SuicideI think there should be a choice if you want to end your life and doctors or nhs should give it to you so you can die peacefully. Life is hard  for the people who donâ€™t want to be here anymore. For instance Iâ€™m girl who lives on my own always suffered from depression and I donâ€™t have much of a life I canâ€™t come out my flat because of my depression and anxiety. I donâ€™t have any friends or family. Itâ€™s killing me being here and all I want is to die peacefully and rest in peace.
