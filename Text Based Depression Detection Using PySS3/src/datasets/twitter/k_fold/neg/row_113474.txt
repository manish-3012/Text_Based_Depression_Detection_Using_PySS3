9 more daysMy prep is almost done. I want my teddy bear buried with me, my poems and notebooks burned, everything else can be thrown out or donated. I want to be buried near my grandparents, in a red dress with red shoes and gold jewelry. 

This will not get better. I weigh down my family and loved ones. I am undesired, unwanted scum, and there is no place for me in this world. In pre-school, I was rejected by my peers for no reason. It continued until high school. When I moved out and tried to rent apartments, I was evicted over and over again. I moved nine times in a year and a half. Never got to stay anywhere longer than four months. My father chose his girlfriend over me when I was a teenager. My mother chose a pedophile over me two years later. Nobody will ever want me around. I can't be tolerated, let alone loved. And I still don't understand what about me is so repulsive. 

There's no future. There's no upswing, no escape from those who want to fuck up my life. They're going to kill me eventually. My family doesn't believe me. They're scared by me telling them the truth more than they are scared of the people who are literally coming to fucking kill me. They don't understand no matter how hard i try to make them see. They're coming to kill me, I have to kill myself first. Why not? There's nothing for me here anyway.
