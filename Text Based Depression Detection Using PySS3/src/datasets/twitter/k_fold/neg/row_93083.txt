Drowning in the sea. Can't swim. No one around to save me.That's basically what my life has boiled down to. I'm stuck. I'm terrified. I'm alone. I can't do anything. Every little problem just compounds onto the previous one. Some days I hope I end up in a terrible car accident, so I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore. I just want to die. I want to stop feeling all of this all the time. I'm tired of the emptiness. Whatever soul or spirit I had died long ago and soon the rest of me will finally catch up. Joy and happiness have left me. I've watched all my hopes and dreams turn to dust and slip through my fingers. Where there once was pleasure and comfort, there is now pain and suffering. There's nothing I can do alone to stop any of it, but it seems I shall always be alone in this fight.
