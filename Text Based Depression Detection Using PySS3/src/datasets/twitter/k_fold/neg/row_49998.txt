I will die tomorrow. And with me will be buried the humanityâ€™s biggest disgrace.Hey guys. 

Long story short. Iâ€™m trying to muster enough courage to kill myself tomorrow. Iâ€™m really really ugly. And whatever I do I canâ€™t shake this feeling. Nobody wants to be with me because of my looks and even though I have lots of friends, I have never had a girlfriend. I am utterly despicable and I will never be loved. 

Just wanted to say my goodbyes. Iâ€™m doing it by trains. Hopefully my family will be alright.
