How have I made it this far.For as long as I remember I've been depressed. I have literally never felt good about everything I did. I have never had any wants for anything I just feel grey all the time. Over the past 4-5 years I've started self harming,if it wasn't with a knife I'd find some way to hurt myself. When I couldent I'd be constantly thinking about it. Thinking about finally bucking up and offing myself. It hasn't helped the one time I told someone, someone I considered a close friend, what I wanted to do they went on calling me selfish and bad. That I didn't care about any one... I don't think I have to say it but my arm sure as shit wasn't feeling that good the next day. For a while though... I didn't feel as bad. I didn't hurt myself, I actually did stuff but that's all come crashing down. I can't talk to anyone about this, I can't go to therepy. I just keep everything bottled up and hurt myself more and more. I'm driving myself insane like this but I can't stop feeling like I deserve it. I don't know why I'm posting this here... Maybe I'm just looking for attention so I don't feel as alone, but I don't know. What I do know is I'm afraid of what I'm going to do when I'm alone tonight.

I'm sorry for the shit formatting and any spelling errors, I have shakey hands and autocorrect dosent do much to help.
