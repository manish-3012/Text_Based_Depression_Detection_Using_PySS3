I know the world is better off with me in it, but so many bad things keep happening to me and I'm afraid I'll never be allowed to be happy.I have had a difficult life. There has never been a time where things were just, okay, when something new and worse wasn't happening. I recently tried to do the right thing; stand up for myself against my abusive husband and hold him accountable, and he has yet again retaliated against me. I thought I was doing the right thing. For years I have thought the things I have been through were teaching me lessons and making into a well-rounded person. But this? This is my life, I want to have a successful future, where I can help people and make the world a better place. That's always been what I wanted. What he is doing can damage my future. I can't understand, if there is some lesson the universe wants me to learn, what is it? I just want to be happy, and I feel like I will never be allowed to be happy. He gets away with everything, I still have hope but I believe he can get away with this too.

Before now, I never contemplated suicidal thoughts no matter how bad things got, but I am so sad all the time with this, and scared. I have actually started thinking about ways to kill myself. A few days ago, I actually felt okay with going to the store and buying some kind of drug cocktail to take. I've thought of what I would write in goodbye letters. I've thought of packing up my apartment so my family won't have to do it, or who to ask to watch my cat for a while so he isn't here alone when it happens. I always had hope things would be okay before. I know there is so much I can offer the world and I get that things will be okay eventually. That's what everyone says. But I am tired of having lived my entire life so far waiting for the eventually.
