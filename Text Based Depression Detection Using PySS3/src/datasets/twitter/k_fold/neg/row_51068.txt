Take Me Off the LedgeHoly shit where do I even begin...

I am an 18 year old, high school senior. My grades are completely in the shitter and I'm worried (as I'm filling out these college applications) that I won't get accepted into any colleges and my life will have no meaning. My parents are putting so much pressure on me to succeed and I feel like I can never live up to their expectations.

My 'girlfriend' broke up with me this weekend. We have been talking/texting every day for the past two months and out of absolutely nowhere she ends it saying she isn't ready to commit to a relationship again. 

I'm pissed and depressed at the same time.

Also, I play used to play baseball. I was damn good at it too. But I blew out my shoulder last year and had surgery. Now almost a year later, my shoulder is still fucked up and my physical therapist says I won't ever play again.

So I feel like I wasted a year of my life getting the surgery and going through physical therapy and two months talking to a girl who was just stringing me on (and apparently hooking up with another guy on the side). And I feel like if I continue living this way, I will just waste my entire life. So why not end it now?

I am not popular, have no *real* friends that I can talk to about this, and think that suicide would be the easiest way out. No one would care. No one miss me. Sure my school and my hicktown city would get on the news but that's it.

I just feel like everything in my life has gone wrong and this weekend was the breaking point. I'm currently googling ways of killing myself.

Don't give the 'it will get better' shpeel. I've heard it. RIGHT NOW my life is completely awful. I've had some low points but never has my life felt *this* bad. I think the easiest and simplest way out would be to just end it.

Thanks for listening you guys.
