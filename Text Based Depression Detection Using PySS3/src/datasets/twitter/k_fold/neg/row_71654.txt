I keep thinking this is the lowest but it only gets worseThings have been getting worse and worse and I can't do anything about it. I can't stop concentrating on how bad I feel. There is no point anymor there is nothing I have to look forward to at all. my interest in everything hs dwindled down to nothing and i severed all ties with all my friends. My parents probably hate me now too since I have been so inconsiderate lately. I can't stop being selfish but all I can think about is myself. Why the fuck is everything so horrible in my life. I've been on a drug binge for 4 days and I feel nothing anymore. I don't care
