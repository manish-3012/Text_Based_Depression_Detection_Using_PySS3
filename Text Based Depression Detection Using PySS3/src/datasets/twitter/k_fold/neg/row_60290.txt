If my girlfriend breaks up with me tomorrow I'm going to kill myselfIt sounds ridiculously petty but in all honesty she is the only thing keeping me alive right now. I have absolutely no other reason to live.

I've had a horrible life and I feel so empty all the time. I have no purpose or reason to be here. I have no intention of dating anybody else. I'm just tired of the pain and I want it all to end.

I'll drive to somewhere rural where nobody can see me, I don't know what method I'm going to use yet but I know I'll figure it out as the day goes. This life has been ok but I dream of living a new life, I have no reason or intention of carrying this one on.
