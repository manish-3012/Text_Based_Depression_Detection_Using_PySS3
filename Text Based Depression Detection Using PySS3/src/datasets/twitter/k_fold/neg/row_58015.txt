Lost hopeI have no motivation and will to live anymore. I find no interest in every thing. Every day is just a suffering. Im VERY ugly, weak, unfit, not smart, no talent, etc. Im good at nothing. I feel useless. I feel im just a burden. Earlier I just had multiple breakdowns. I dont know if I can continue living like this. I've lost hope
