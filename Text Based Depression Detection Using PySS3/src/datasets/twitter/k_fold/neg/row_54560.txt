Been suicidal since a couple of years, can't ket anyone knowI'm 15 and an abomination already
I'm utterly incapable of any human connection. I mean neurologically incapable. The only think that gave me any hope to find a place in the world or society was to exploit my only hability, that is, to play the piano. Of course, Ihave always knew that that weren't but a childish delusion, I'm really inadequate for it. It really wouldn't make much of a difference to die today or in 50 years. Can't talk to my mother about it, her physical health is too fragile for her to be able to experience any kind of stress without severe backlashes. I'm clumsy, clinically retarded, weak, slow and akward. Not to mention horribly ugly. I probably shouldn't post here.
