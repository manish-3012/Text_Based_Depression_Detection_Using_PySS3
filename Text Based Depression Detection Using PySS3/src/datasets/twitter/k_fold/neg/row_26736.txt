Please helpIâ€™ve dealt with severe depression and suicidal thoughts my entire life. I can remember being a small child and wishing I was dead so I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with emotional pain anymore.

I have been happy exactly once in my lifeâ€”and it just ended. I am 37. I have 6 children. 2 of them live at home with me. They are 3 and 5.

A little over a year ago, I met the love of my life. And he just dumped me. It hurts so bad. I want to die. The day after he broke up with me my phone broke, my car stopped twice on a busy highway, I was locked out of work, and my two babies and I were locked out of my house. I have no way but FB messenger for anyone to contact me. 

My babies just went to their dadâ€™s house. Vodka has me thinking I need to end it now. Their voices saying â€œI want to stay with you, Mommyâ€ has me living.

Please, Reddit, remind me I need to stay here for them.
