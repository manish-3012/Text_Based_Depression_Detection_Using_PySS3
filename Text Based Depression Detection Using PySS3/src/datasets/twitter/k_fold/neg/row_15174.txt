This is itI need help, nothing is getting better, Ive been trying to rely in Jesus but idk whats happening. Im always sad, there is no point to anything I feel like an empty shell. Everyone ignores me, every girl I tell that I like either friendzone me or like someone else, I dont want attention, I just need someone wo understands me... Im fading away, I will soon be forgoten... Noone seems to care about me and I am begining to fade away, and If i scream noone hears me. 
Addio tutti
