I'm on the verge of you know what, need some adviceI made a post here a couple days ago, really poured my heart out in it. I've been having mood swings ever since my sister was hit by a car. She and I were riding to school together, and this bitch who claimed the sun was in her eyes bumped my sister into the busy street. She was instantly killed. It was traumatizing.

This happened half a decade ago, and I still haven't gotten over it. I need help getting past this event in my life. Have you ever heard Earth Wind &amp; Fire - September?
