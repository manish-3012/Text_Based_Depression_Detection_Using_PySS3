A light that is going out...Idk how to start but I've have a heart made of ice but with a light that is going out, I'm planning to jump off a building somewhere cause I see no good in these streets, no good in people , all I've seen people lie to me , and it makes me sick, I bought some weed and smoked a wood, and my head cleared up, I thought about stuff, I just want someone to help me, it hurts on the inside, I'm just tearing up thinking about it, if I don't respond or reply within a day, you know what I did , good bye
