you know..?You know when you've been really trying? You've been doing what everyone says you should. you've been taking the meds. you've been going out. you drank that herbal tea. you took those naps. you tried getting a hobby. but nothing ever helps does it..everyone thought i was getting better. but all i can think about is killing myself. i tried talking about it to my best mates but they openly admitted that sometimes im too sad for them and they ignore me on purpose. im so tired of fighting to be okay. im so tired. all the time.
