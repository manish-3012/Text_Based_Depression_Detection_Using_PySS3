A strange reason to stay aliveMaybe not so strange, but to only stay alive for a family member. Who would have thought I'd ever be writing this. 
I have a lot of mixed emotions. I'm not sure if a lot of what I feel is true. My father was a bad person and I think like I've inherited some of his instability. My mum, I'm losing touch with her. I live with her and I'm aware that she is the only reason why I have the luxury of being depressed and cooped up. But I'm supposed to lose it quietly. I have a lot of family, more than most people. But I don't know them and I can't understand them. I can't understand almost everyone. 

I have a lot of trouble relating or making friends. I dropped out of school at thirteen, although I had been missing most days per year since I was nine. I just don't know what it is with me. I feel like I'm getting worse. I block it out or I absorb it all, just a mess. I also have an issue communicating with people, it's like I have two modes: angry or sullen. I am happy sometimes, but I become very negative inside and the feeling it causes is really something. I have my pets and my family and I feel how lucky that makes me. But then I have me and I can't really explain what I feel. It's like I'm waiting for that outside reason. It can't end because of me. It's going to be because that reason I'm waiting for.
