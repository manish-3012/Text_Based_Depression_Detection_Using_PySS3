Another $5,000 went into default todayI'm gonna kill myself so soon I really really am. Even if (and that's an extremely unlikely if) I ever got over depression I've still fucked myself for life financially. I'm gonna finally hang myself soon because there is no getting better for me. It's not even about depression it's about how I've ruined my own life permanently. Forever. No fixing it. Even a chemically mentally healthy person would wanna die to escape my life.
