Idk how to feelI've been to counseling before. I used to love the release of cutting, therapy helped me resist the urge quite a bit, it had been about 5 months. I started on my arm about a week ago though, and stopped before going very deep because I realized I was making a mistake.
Fast forward to some drama with one of my roommates. One of the last people I can get into detail about my thoughts. I let them know I was in my room a lot because I didnt want the cuts on my arm to show. I got picked up and sent to a mental ward for 3 days.
Idk if I can trust anyone anymore. I'm mad at them for sending me straight there without talking to me. It's messed up because, when you're getting help, you're supposed to find people you can call and I feel as if I've run out of people. Can anyone give me tips?
