Looking for a little guidanceI have struggled with some sort of mood disorder and many other things for a very long time, ever since I can remember actually. I am a 22 year old female. I made two attempts in 2010 close to each other, right after what I consider the peak of my suicidal thinking. Since then the thinking has gone back down to "normal" (normal to me, which is thinking about it at least once a week) to more recently becoming frequent again. I'm really afraid that one day I'm going to get into one of my moods and just do it. I suspect that I am bipolar, counselors have speculated but none have known me well enough or even been qualified to diagnose. Antidepressants hurt instead of help. I know I need to see somebody about this as soon as I can, but I don't know how, I don't know where, I don't have insurance, and I'm afraid that if I tell someone I'm feeling suicidal, they will lock me away in the mental ward where they put me after my first attempt and that place was just awful. Plus, I have a baby who depends on me entirely. Yes, I already know that hormones are affecting me but as stated earlier, I have struggled with this long before baby-hormones came into the equation.


I'm just looking to get some sort of idea of what to actually do about this. I have tried "fixing myself" by introspection, by "being present" (trying to relieve anxiety), by self medication (not the best method), by friends (does not work, though they are great, my feelings about them change), and I have tried twice to kill myself. Both times were legitimate attempts that, had I been alone, would have possibly worked. 


Please write soon. This is not my main account, but I will be checking.
