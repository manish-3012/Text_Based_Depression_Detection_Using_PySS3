It's my best friend's birthdayIt's my best friends birthday. So, as badly as I want to kill myself, I can't. I also am hanging out with her this weekend. It has been over a year since we have seen each other in person. 

I was going to go into depth explaining my situation and why I dread seeing her, but it's useless. No one can help. My situation can not be helped. Nothing that anyone says will help. In the end, no one even genuinely fucking cares. I am so fucking lonely and I don't think any of my family members genuinely love me, and I am not as close to any of my friends as they think I am, so none of these people can help me either. I don't know why I ever bothered trying to live at all. 

I am not going to kill myself so don't be concerned about it. But I still hate living. I still hate being here.
