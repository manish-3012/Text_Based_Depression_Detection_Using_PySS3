I'm just so tired of fighting.I just want to be done. I've been diagnosed with OCD, bipolar disorder, and extreme anxiety in the last year. I'm medicated. Everyone thinks I'm doing better. That the medication is working. The truth is anything but. I'm so tired of chewing my lip off or pulling out my hair everytime I leave the house. I'm tired of not being able to go anywhere without my dog. I'm tired of shaking so hard while trying to talk to the cashier that I can't get my card into the chip reader. I'm so tired of having to act like I'm better. Im tired of the constant nightmares. Im exhausted from staying up at night sleeping with my fire extinguisher in my hands and going over my escape route in my head. I'm exhausted of having to get up and check the stove and the doors to make sure they're locked for the 12th time before I can even try to sleep. The only reason that I haven't tried earlier is because of my family. I have 4 children and a husband. I would never want to hurt them, but I hate how they have to see me sometimes. It's getting to the point that I think they would be better off without me. I'm just so, so tired.
