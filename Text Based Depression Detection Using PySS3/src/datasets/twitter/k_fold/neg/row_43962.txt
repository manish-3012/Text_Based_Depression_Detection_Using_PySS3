I want to go homeI donâ€™t feel like living anymore. I am so tired. I donâ€™t want to live at all, I wake up everyday so angry. I sleep hoping that Iâ€™ll just finally NOT wake up. I hate that I just donâ€™t want to hurt myself yet donâ€™t want to live. Iâ€™m physically weak, my brain is so foggy, I feel unreal, everything around me feels unreal, it almost feels like a dream. A horrible DREAM. I am so tired, I just want to go home.
