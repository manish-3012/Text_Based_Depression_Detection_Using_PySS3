Need some advice. Thankshi , for a long time now I've not been happy. Not a day goes by where I don't think about ending it all. 
The only time I've ever felt happy in the past few months is when I see friends - but even now that is starting to fade because the rarity in which I get to see them.
 However more recently I'm upset even when I spend time with them as I worry about when I next see them and If I can make it until then and It just feels awful. I don't think they know just how much they mean to me , but I am worried about telling them as to whether they would just freak out and ignore me all together. I don't know what to do. I really want them to know but I'm worried of the consequences. They are my first proper group of friends who seem to care about me and to lose them would be devastating - but I don't think I can go on like this. I realise I don't have it as bad as some people and that just makes me feel even worse.  If you are reading this, thank you for your time.
