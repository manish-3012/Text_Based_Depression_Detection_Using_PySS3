I feel like a horrible personI'm not big on talking about  my feelings but this is a better place to talk about this than anywhere else for reasons I'll talk about in a second. I feel like a horrible person.

A few years back, I tried to kill myself and everyone basically insulted me for it and said I was trying to upset them on purpose and I was being extremely selfish, in response, I closed up and for the last few years, I've been kind of broken but obviously no one knew that. A few nights ago, that completely broke down, I've been depressed and suicidal still due to my issues with family, the fact I was kicked out of high school and I can't really go back because I have to keep a sustaining full time job where I work 12 hours a day and the fact that my ex told me I was a disappointment which , literally a hour before that, was also said to me by my mother in a text. I just broke down, I told all my friends I didn't know what to do anymore, I felt like ending it all and then I just logged out of all my socials and I contemplated doing it, people who were able to get in contact with me, I shut them out or just told them I was gonna do it and they needed to leave me alone and I felt like I just couldn't handle it anymore. I'm a confident person but I have so many traumatizing experiences, (my family is unstable, I was raped when I was a child, etc, etc. I really don't wanna get into it cause it'll make me feel worse.) The day afterwards, I realized that I had put everyone in some kind of weird sadness and I needed to apologize but they just think I manipulated them when I had no intent to harm them at all! They refuse to think otherwise and now I feel like a horrible person, I've been sat in bed all day telling myself I'm a good person but no one will validate it for me. I think life is just too much for me right now.
