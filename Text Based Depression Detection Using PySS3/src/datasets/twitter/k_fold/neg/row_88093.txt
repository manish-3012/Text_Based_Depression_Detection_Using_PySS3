I think Iâ€™m readyIâ€™m 27. Wife, mom of 2 and not much else. I work and I come home, sleep repeat. My recent diagnosis gave me hope for a while but I donâ€™t even know what to do now. Iâ€™m going to go get my daughter in the morning when I get off work and take her bowling or to the play ground and spend one more good day with her before I go. I know my son is too young he wonâ€™t remember me. My husband was wanting to watch the Basketball game tonight so weâ€™ll probably do that. I really want to make sure they have one good day with me around. 
I guess it doesnâ€™t really make sense for me to be suicidal. Iâ€™m trying. I go to therapy and I take my medicine. My husband is super supportive and my kids are fantastic. My best friend is always there for me no matter what. I think I just canâ€™t stand to be a burden anymore. 
I want to reach out to them but Iâ€™m not sure that it would make a difference if I did. I definitely donâ€™t want them feeling responsible when I go. It kind of feels like a relief that I wonâ€™t have to hurt anymore after today.  I just wish I could make sure no one else hurts either.
