How is anything worth itIf I hear one fuckin person say suicide isnâ€™t worth it Iâ€™m gonna flip my shit. What the fuck is in life thatâ€™s worth so much more? Iâ€™m just so fucking done man I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m supposed to do. I worked in school and never learned proper studying cause it was easy so now Iâ€™m failing college but even if I pass college I just get to work endlessly till I die and make no impact on the world and be forgotten. I genuinely donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m supposed to do or how Iâ€™m supposed to think anything is worth the effort it takes. The only reason Iâ€™m even still alive is my base biological fear of dying
