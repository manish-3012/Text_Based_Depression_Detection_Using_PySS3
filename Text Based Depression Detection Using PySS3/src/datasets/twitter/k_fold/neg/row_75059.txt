I'm afraid of myselfMy Life has aways been a mess, but recently, I feel like that mess has gotten bigger and bigger, I don't love my family anymore, I know it's wrong, but I just can't trust them, but that's not why I'm feeling this way, I'm 17 and it's my last year at school, after this it's just College, and I'm having the worst grades ever, I can't learn anything and I just feel like shit everytime there's a test, recently I got a zero at one of the tests and I just wanted to end my Life, I spent the whole Day thinking about it and nothing was able to Cheer me up, I aways feel like that when I get a bad grade, I just feel like The dumbest person, and it's a terrible feeling, so, If I felt like that over one test, imagine what would happen when I saw all my grades at the same time? Because that's going to happen, my vacations are right around de corner, and I'm just.. Afraid, I don't want to do it, but I just can't control depression, I don't want to kill myself, but I'm so afraid that I'm going to do it in the future :/
Everything is a mess and I don't know what to do
