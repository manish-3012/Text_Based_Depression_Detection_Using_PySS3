I feel like I woke up from a year long nightmareI'm not sure where to go from here though. After all the medications that made me want to kill myself, I don't think I can pick up where I left off prior to everything going wrong. In a way I feel like I cheated death by getting through it all, but it isn't necessarily a good feeling after trying to recall the people I've burdened.
