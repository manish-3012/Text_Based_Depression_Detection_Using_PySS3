I'm thinking about it.24 (M) The last few months are becoming increasingly difficult for me and honestly its becoming overwhelming due in-part to my own actions and actions of other people in my life. Every day I cry because I'm depressed and lonely and everyday I contemplate ending things. My birthday was on Saturday so things just felt more amplified. Today I lost my wallet and ruined my phone due to some bad luck and I broke down again. It's like no matter what I do, something bad is going to happen. I just want a break and every time I try I get knocked back down. 

I don't know how much more I can take. The nights are the hardest.
