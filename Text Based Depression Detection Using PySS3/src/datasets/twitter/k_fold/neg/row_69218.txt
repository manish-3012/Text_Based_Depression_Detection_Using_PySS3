The right time.The only thing keeping me alive was my parents. My dad died semi-recently and it has just been my mom and me. I donâ€™t think I can wait until my mom dies as well I need to end this soon, but the thought of everything my mom has done for me and how she would react to this is the main thing stopping me. She was told she wouldnâ€™t be able to have children. All she wanted was a child and then I came along. I canâ€™t even comprehend how badly this would break her, to go from wife and mother to  just being on her own.

There is obviously no good time  to do this but at least if I was gone she would have a chance at being ok, I just donâ€™t know.
