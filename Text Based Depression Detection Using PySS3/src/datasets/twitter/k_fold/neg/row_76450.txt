i am incapable of REALLY feeling anythingi feel so disconnected from my mind and body and the world around me. i live behind a brain fog that is so dense that i'm not even sure if i can't grasp the gravity of situations or if i just really don't care at all. i feel emotions that are shallow and fleeting. the only thing i ever feel that my mind really registers is disgust and anger when i think of my cheating ex. i haven't felt a positive feeling since i left her. i think i have a brain tumor or some shit. like this brain fog has lingered for about 2 years and i feel like i'm always a little drunk? like everything is dull and lifeless and my memory, sense of consequences, and ability to think and feel has diminished greatly. idk even know what i'm writing about. depression? health? relationships? am i dying? i hope so. this post doesn't make sense. goodnight
