I tried and failedManaged to get two dates with some decent girls and got ghosted by one the night before and stood up by the other girl. Honestly I when I start getting too full of myself and feeling like Iâ€™m ok, something has to snap me back to reality. I donâ€™t know why I bother with anything. Thinking about something drastic because I canâ€™t stand my life anymore.
