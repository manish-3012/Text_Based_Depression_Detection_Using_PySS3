I don't know how long I can go on for.I suffer from severe depression and PTSD, and I've been in regular therapy for a year now, but I feel like it doesn't help anymore. Right now my mom is at work and I'm all alone which makes it harder to cope. Last Thursday I told my parents I wanted to kill myself, a thought and feeling I've had for over ten years, I'm 21 now. 
My life is so empty, and I don't want to live the next fifty years in complete and utter misery because my parents don't want me to kill myself but I'm so done with everything. I don't want to live anymore, I'm tired and empty and there's nothing for me, I don't want to go on, and I can't. Not any longer. 
My therapist suspects that I'm somewhere in the autism spectrum, which would explain my inability to talk about my feelings, mostly because half of the time I don't know what I'm feeling, other than dread. I'm so stuck in my own head and I keep running around in circles and I can't deal with it anymore. I can't deal with myself and I don't want to live with myself any longer. It's enough, I honestly feel like my time is done here. The very few friends I have I can't contact right now because its early and they're sleeping and I don't know what to do. 
I don't know if it's worth it to keep on fighting and going to therapy, I seriously feel like its not ever going to get better. I guess I just want someone to talk to right now.
