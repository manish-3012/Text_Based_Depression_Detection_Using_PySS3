I feel trappedI get these moments where I just want to end everything in my life. I donâ€™t feel good enough. I would just be better off. I feel trapped where I am because I always feel like Iâ€™m failing. I canâ€™t help but think what would people think if I am gone. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone, but I think it would be for the best if I was.
