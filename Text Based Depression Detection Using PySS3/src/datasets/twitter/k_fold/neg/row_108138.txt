Pain, feel like i can go on anymoreIm in constant pain my back shoulder knees all hurt, i used to lift weights alot and it was my escape i loved it but everything hurts so bad i cant do much anymore, and idk why, im only 19. I recently got a job and have been having panic attacked and shortness of breath i feel like i cant even work everything is so hard, it just doesn't seem worth it anymore, 80% of my friends moved away and im so alone, its been like this for like over 8 months and isn't getting better seems like its getting worse, so i ask whats the point in going on when all i experience is pain.
