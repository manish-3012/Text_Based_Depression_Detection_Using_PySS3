TrappedMy ex threatens suicide every time I donâ€™t interact with him like he wants or tell him what he wants to hear. He has guns and I know heâ€™ll do it. I canâ€™t send the police for a wellness check because he said heâ€™ll suicide by cop. My current boyfriend is healthy and supportive but hates that I still interact with him. I think my current good relationship may actually be over due to this. Everyone I know in my life and my therapist have advised me to cut contact with my ex. But I feel responsible. I feel trapped. I donâ€™t see any other way out than to go out myself.
