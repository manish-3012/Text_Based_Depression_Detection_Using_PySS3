Things seem to be going okay.Im really trying to take it day by day and just see how things go. Ive recently been trying to find things to do, like playing video games that seem interesting to me and also getting into reading more manga or just more books in general.

I have decided that I want to keep on living and try to find somekind of future for myself. I want to try to find something to be alive for. And the new games and books I've been playing and reading have helped me find that.

The thoughts of wanting to die are still there, but they don't keep me trapped down into a pit as much as they used to. 


I'll keep going and see what happens. Good luck to all of you.
