It feels like my life has come to an end.I have been abusing DXM for this past week but I took a lot one night (a lot for me) and I am okay with dying now. While intoxicated I felt like I had died and I was a spirit. This feeling was very nice a brought peace to me. 

Obviously I am aware that when I actually die is I'll feel nothing, but I am still happy with dying. Nothing feels real anymore and I think that's because I am now living in a time I wasn't supposed to exist in.

I am in possession of around 7500mg of benadryl and I can use that to end my life.

I am sober now and have been since yesterday but I still feel this way. I have become emotionally disconnected from the world around me and I want to peacefully exit this life.

I still want to write some notes for people and some instruction on what I want done with my body so I wont die yet. I do not plan on abusing substances anymore either.

I will never be truly happy alive so I feel like this is the best option for me. I just wanted to share this before I do anything.
