Iâ€™m think Iâ€™m so ugly that I should kill myselfIâ€™ve always thought that Iâ€™m ugly. When I was 12, I stopped leaving the house because of it. People have always told me Iâ€™m beautiful, but every time I look Iâ€™m the mirror my face looks deformed and ugly and itâ€™s hard to look at. I canâ€™t have pictures taken of me. Every time someone does I panic until itâ€™s deleted and it makes me feel horrible for days. I already have depression and they way I feel about myself makes it harder to treat. Itâ€™s so bad that I just want to kill myself and get it over with. I donâ€™t know what to do.
