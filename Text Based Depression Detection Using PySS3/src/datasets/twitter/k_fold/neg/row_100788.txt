Ready but notI should be studying now, I'm having exams this week. I'm not even prepared in 1%. I haven't studied for weeks now. Because I know it doesn't even matter as I'm not going to make the next few weeks in this state. I neglected almost everything in my life. In this state I'm quite worthless so it's not like it matters to care about things.

I'm ready, I planned it. Chose the way. Found a place. But when thinking of it, about those who are gonna find me... they will then call my mother, and then my father will find out. And that's the moment that breaks me. That's what makes me not able to do it. This is the only thing I care about now. I want to go and I'm not able to. 

I'm still scared.
