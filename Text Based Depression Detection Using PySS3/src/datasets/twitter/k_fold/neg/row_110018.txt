I have a roommateI have a roommate and i just found out that he has pretty bad depression and has had thoughts of suicide. Im not sure how to feel about this because hes never told me which doesn't surprise me but now im always worried... He doesn't leave the apartment at all really and stopped going to classes 2 months into school, ive talked to his mom about it and i guess they had a talk but im not sure what he is doing now. What do I do?
