Can't stop eatingI binged yesterday, and i binged today. I don't know why I can't stop. I'm not even good at purging, which is why I don't usually binge that much because I know I can't get rid of it all. I'm so fucking fat. I've no money *again*, and I couldn't find a way to get money at all. I hate this life, but I don't want it to change. I don't think there's anything I can do to make it better. 

I use to be able to hide all of this well. I use to be able to act normal about everything, and the moment I messed up a little, everything fell apart. Everyone is constantly looking at me now and watching me waiting for me to really mess up. Not that i haven't already really messed up, but I guess they're waiting for me to mess up more. I'm quite done with all of this. I don't really know what I'm going to do, but I'm not going to put up with this any longer.
