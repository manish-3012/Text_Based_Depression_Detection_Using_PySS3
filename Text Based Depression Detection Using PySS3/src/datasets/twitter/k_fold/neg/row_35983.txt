Just wanted to be happy.  Feel so tired.After a shitty failed marriage in my 20s and now my current gf of 6 years looking like shes on the way out, I just want to be done with it.

I try so hard to be open and communicate all my feelings with her.  I wait on her hand &amp; foot, treating her like a princess.  I don't know what else I could have done.  A few weeks ago we fought and I told her I was suicidal again because she has always wanted me to be honest with her about my feelings.  Now, I have the feeling she's just with me til she can figure out how to leave without feeling guilty if I kill myself.

If she leaves, I really feel like I might do it.  I know it's a shitty thing to put on someone.  But I threw everything I had into this relationship.  Everything.  I tried so hard to be a better person than I was in my failed marriage.  Changed so many bad things about myself for her. 

I just want to be happy.  That's all I've wanted and I feel like I have tried everything I can and it just didn't work.  I can't do it again.  I am too exhausted.  I don't want to get up and go to work every day, come home to an empty house again.  

I don't know what to do.  I've got an appointment with a psych in a few days, but I don't see it helping.

I just feel so mentally exhausted and I hurt on the inside so much it just feels unbearable at times.

I guess I didn't really have a question; just venting.
