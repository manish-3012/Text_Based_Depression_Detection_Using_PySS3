Well here we arewell, im (16M) posting here so im not really fine,

friendgroup left me, i fucked up my relationship with my parents and i feel like im dissapointing everyone.  
i feel like my autism is the worst thing i have and it affects all the things i do. making friends? hell no. Keeping friends? hell no. Doing the things normal people can when it comes to socializing? hell no.

im done with it, everything feels empty and i havent had a good smile in 2 months.  
every night i hope i dont wake up just so that i dont have to endure this shit again and again.  


i just had a talk with my now ex-best friend about why, and he has a lot of good points, i cant emphatize with other people, i cant think like a normal person would about the situation. he said im manipulated him and i dont know if im to believe hiim or not. hes probably right otherwise he wouldnt have said it. i just want this shit to be over. and if this is the only option then so be it.

and about my parents. we fought for like the 4th time this week. my dad said he didnt love me, mom said nothing but had a approving face. fyi my relationship with them has always been rough. why couldnt i be like my sisters. theyre way better people than me. im a failure in life and the only thing i can do is put on a smile like a mask and pretend its all okay.

no one bothers to check up on me and all i wanna do is be alone and not talk to anyone, and shut myself of from society so that it can be itself in peace. 

so, im sorry for trying to be an adult and wanting to make up with you Frogger. im sorry for being the shittiest friend you had. im sorry for everything. 

thanks for not giving me something in return for everything i gave you lot, seeyou on the other side
