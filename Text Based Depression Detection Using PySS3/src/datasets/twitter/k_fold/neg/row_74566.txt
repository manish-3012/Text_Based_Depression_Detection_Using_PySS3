If something doesnâ€™t change in me Iâ€™ll be dead soon.Get back up on your feet ,make yourself happy and it will be okay are the most common things Iâ€™m told when I say I want to destroy myself and I need help. 

I know the way I feel is because of myself and not anyone else but how the fuck am I supposed to just change. Thereâ€™s things that have happened in my life that caused me to become this way. I canâ€™t go back and change those things. I want someone to save me from myself before itâ€™s really too late. I cannot do this on my will to live is hanging on by a thread and Iâ€™m about to slice it. 

The only thing I care about is being loved and loving others. It seems like I give everything and nothing is ever returned. I hate myself because of it. I feel ugly and stupid. Iâ€™m trapped in a body that I didnâ€™t ask to be in and I donâ€™t want it there isnâ€™t anything I can do about that other cease to exist. 

Iâ€™m socially stupid and thatâ€™s the worst part all I fucking want is to talk to people and they never can handle it. I spill my feelings and tell them everything just to be met with no response. I feel like everyone is scared of feeling and negative emotion. No one wants to help, no one cares to help. Not even the people that made me but Iâ€™m selfish if kill myself? They made me this way. They made me insecure and hate myself then they tell me Iâ€™m supposed to just fix it.

Sexual, physical, and emotional abuse have left scars that I cannot cover. I have to live with it everyday. Everyday is a battle and Iâ€™m getting tired. I feel if I have someone to fight with and not be alone it would be easier and I could actually continue to live but no one loves me even if they say they do. My brain wonâ€™t allow it and then they leave so do they really love me if they canâ€™t handle me at my worst. 

Itâ€™s all in my fucking head...all of this and I canâ€™t stop it. I donâ€™t know how. I just donâ€™t want to die alone.
