Police Visit UKThrowaway due to obvious reasons.

Last night I made a decision to significantly harm myself with the intention to end my life.
As a last ditch attempt I text Crisis Text Line.

After some back and for I had calmed down and decided to get out of the house. I left everything including my phone.

Once I managed to recoup my thoughts I gathers my things (including my phone) and went to my parents.

In the meantime, Crisis has contacted the Police and they tracked me to my parents house. This led to an encounter where I had to discuss everything in an open dialogue and I was strongly advised to stay at my parents etc.

Iâ€™m concerned with what the repercussions are now with Police (including my police records, contact with my GP/medical records and employer).
