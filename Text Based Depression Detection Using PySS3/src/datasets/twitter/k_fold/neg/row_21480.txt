An endless rant - don't read.I don't expect anyone to read this. Or expect anyone to reply. Maybe this is just a vent to make myself feel sorry, I'm not sure. I'm just sick of it all...

I've been diagnosed as depressed, with anxiety, diabetes and epilepsy. I can't hold down a job well because of them, I can barely make it through school, and I'm practically a slave at home to my mom as she's in a wheelchair. If I say no to anything, j get threatened to get kicked out with nowhere to go... My father is an abusive asshole, homophobic, blames me for everything, even though hes the one who cheated in my mom and got them divorced...  

I can't work, school I'm barely holding on, just the thought makes me want to slash my wrists again, to kill myself is a dream I have. Maybe it's cause I'm too scared of the pain to do it? I'm not sure...

I have a boyfriend. I live him so much. But I can't get through this depression thing of mine to barely do anything. I can't kiss, I can't cuddle, he doesnt even like to have sex anyways - even though I really want to...

Fuck it in ranting with no logic... I'm hanging by a thread, I've got nowhere to go, nobody... I can't take this anymore.
