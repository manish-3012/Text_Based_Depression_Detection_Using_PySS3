I'm a mess.This is going to be a self-indulgent and self-piteous post and it makes me feel more shitty. I just am so sick of feeling this way. I still can find flashes of happiness but it's always fleeting and temporary, my emotions are so unstable. I think I have a deep seated fear of abandonment, I have no idea why. Usually people have been abandoned in the past or have experiences trauma but I haven't. I've had a lovely upbringing so I feel guilty for feeling this way. I just feel so loveless and hopeless. So many changes have taken place in my life, mainly due to COVID-19. I've been talking to a guy for a bit now and yesterday he called me up and said he's not ready for a relationship. That's cool and I understand his needs because he's been through past trauma etc. But it doesn't erase the hurt, and I'll admit I feel a bit angry and I feel guilty about this anger because I have no right to be angry. I'm tired of my moods feeling like a roller-coaster, up and down all the time. I know my family love me and I love them too but I just feel so empty and hopeless and I just want to die sometimes. Some days are better than others and these suicidal feelings go away but they always come back. Sorry for ranting, and I understand this is full of self-pity and I hate it. But I had to get it off my chest. Hope everyone is okay. 

It's dramatic but every time I look at the future, I can't see myself as an older person, I just don't imagine even being alive at that point.
