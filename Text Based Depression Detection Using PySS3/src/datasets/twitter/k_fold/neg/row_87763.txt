I just discovered this sub in a depressive whim.I'm not comfortable talking about why, but I do have a question I would like help with...
Is there a difference between wanting to die, and being suicidal?
I desperately wish I would die, but I know I would never so it myself. I wish it would just happen. Don't wake up one day, hit by a car, randomly shot etc.
People say they worry about me,  but I don't think it's me they need to worry about.
