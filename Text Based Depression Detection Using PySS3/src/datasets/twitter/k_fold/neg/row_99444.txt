I canâ€™t see myself growing oldI canâ€™t envision myself aging as far as my parents have if Iâ€™m being honest. I can only see up to my late twenties, if that. Just a few more years. I just donâ€™t think I can hold on much longer after that. Suicide just feels like my fate. It feels like itâ€™s becoming a goal. 

I know Iâ€™ll never be accepted for who I am in this world. And Iâ€™ll never be able to live the life I want in this world. No-one accepts my sexuality (zoosexual). So I lie in front of everybody. I even lie to myself (I have a human girlfriend). If I have to keep living a lie, what type of life would that be?

I just needed to write this out somewhere. Thank you
