I donâ€™t know how much longer I can do thisIâ€™ve always had a thought in the back of my mind, that if I did end it, maybe it would be better. For me, and everyone who knows me. The only thing standing in the way of that however, is my mother. She means a lot to me and I know I mean a lot to her, and itâ€™s always been like a scale between her and everything in my life that makes me want to end it. However the things that make my life shit have started to weigh more recently and iâ€™ve been thinking, of she loves me so much would she really want me to be in all this pain? I mean, my â€œfriendsâ€ ignore me and treat me like shit, my family hates me for who I am, and donâ€™t get me started on all the existential terrors that haunt my life. I just donâ€™t see a reason for this miserable existence I call my life anymore
