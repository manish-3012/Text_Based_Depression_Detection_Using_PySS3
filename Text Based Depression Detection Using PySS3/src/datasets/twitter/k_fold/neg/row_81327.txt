I hate it when the forcibly save suicidal people from doing what they desire...I was on youtube just then, looking at failed suicide attempts. and there is always someone forcibly puling/pushing someone to "save" them, okay cool yeah you saved them, but people should think about what goes through the minds of suicidal people. people should think about what WE are going through and take realise that bad things happened to lead someone to commit suicide, and others should not just interrupt. Its not their decision wether we want to die or not.
