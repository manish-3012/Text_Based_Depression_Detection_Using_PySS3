Watched all my neighbors today.Today is Canada day. I stood inside my house peering out the window watching everyone leave for festivities. I saw people leaving with kayaks, their dogs, swimwear, drink coolers, blow up rafts.. I heard laughing, chattering and singing.

It was a huge wake up call and made me think "What the hell am I doing with my life?"

I have agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder and a messed up sleeping schedule. I sleep from 10am until 6pm generally. These people were leaving to have a fun day and I was getting ready to go to sleep. 

I spend my time awake having panic attacks or laying in bed on my laptop. Can't do much because of chronic nausea. 

I hate this routine. I hate having no life. I don't want to have anxiety anymore and i'm tired of fighting with myself. I can't do it.
