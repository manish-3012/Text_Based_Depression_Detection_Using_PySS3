How do I like myselfFirst off some background I'm a trans girl and am wildly in love with another trans woman, she is probably the only person I feel genuine emotion towards at this point and the only thing that makes me genuinely happy is making her happy, I feel empty when I'm not talking to her, I hate myself and I feel like I'm burdening her by just being around, she is also suicidal. Neither of us can transition currently we are also living in different states

Edit: also good to note I'm not at major risk yet just toying around with the idea and making some minor preparations
