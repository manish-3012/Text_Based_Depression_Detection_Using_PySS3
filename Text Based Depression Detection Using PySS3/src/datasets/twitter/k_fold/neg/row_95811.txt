My wife is suicidalShe told me she wakes up every day wishing she was dead. She randomly burst into tears one night last week and through her sobbing she told me this. Shes asleep now. She called out of work this morning. Sheâ€™s so angry all of the time. I know she loves me but sheâ€™s just so angry and sad idk what to do. Iâ€™ve encouraged her to go to therapy but she wonâ€™t. The last time she went to the doctor for her mental health they gave her several meds that gave her terrible hallucinations that left her hospitalized for days. So I donâ€™t blame her. Idk what else to do. I found a knife under her pillow just now. Iâ€™m so lost. Idk how to help her
