Tried to kill myself last night. Am currently stable, but no one to talk to. Scared.I have problems communicating when I'm anxious, so I can only try to make sense through bullet points:

- Had a shitty couple of years. Long story short, I had to quit school, I moved across the country without any family, I found out I'd been cheated on and had also been the cheatee without knowing it, I went five months without a job leading to my father's family essentially giving up on me ever being successful (I have a long history of being bipolar and it changed how everyone saw me since I was a pre-teen). 

- The biggest factor was that I found out the relative who sexually abused me as a child had kidnapped me as an infant and had been saying sexual things about me to my parents and mother's family's knowledge without them acting on it ever since it started. (All they don't know about is the molestation itself.) It makes me feel like I was never worth protecting.

- All of this has left me feeling incredibly abandoned by everyone in my family except my parents, and even then, I feel very alone and like I'm constantly disappointing them.

- I'm fat, lazy, ugly. I can't look in a mirror without wanting to throw up.

- I'm gay and I keep turning bi girls straight. It makes me believe ultra-religious bullshit about me being deformed. Like those girls got "fixed" but I can't be. I've liked girls since I was 12 and never felt ashamed like this before. I feel like a horrible person for thinking this way about myself.

- I know I can't discuss methods, but, I basically completely lost my shit and staged something to make it look like an accident.

- Best friend ran after me. Started yelling and physically pulled me away. She doesn't know what I was actually planning. She thought it was just a panic attack.

- Been having a crisis all day. Knowing how close I was.

- Scared but glad. Shocked would be a better word. Feeling numb over so many things. How I almost died/was seriously injured. How many innocent people would have watched it/been traumatized for life. How my best friend saved me without knowing and didn't get mad at me for screaming/swearing at her to leave me alone immediately after.

- Too numb and guilty to be thankful. That's why I can't talk about this to anyone I know. I probably can't for years.

- I'm relieved. Relieved that maybe this got it "out of my system" and relieved that I'm not regretting that I'm alive right now. Hadn't attempted to do anything like this since I was 14. Feeling like I'm going through the motions as I think about what would have happened. Who would have told my family. What my friends would be doing today.

- Feeling stupid.

- My cat hasn't left me alone all day.

- Some details of this + my account may make me identifiable to friends. If so, please contact me before anyone else. Sorry if this is dumb. Just paranoid.
