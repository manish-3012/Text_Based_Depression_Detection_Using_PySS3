Thank YouI would just like to say thank you to the people who said they cared about me, you know who you are. I pray you live a truly prosperous life.

I can't keep myself safe, and there's nothing I can do, I'm sorry.

To all redditors, good luck and keep yourselves safe. You can all do this, keep hope in your hearts always.
