I feel like Iâ€™ve trapped myself in a cornerI feel like Iâ€™m isolating myself from even my closest friends, Iâ€™m wasting my time, Iâ€™ve lost so much self confidence that Iâ€™m donâ€™t even want to leave the house anymore. Online outlets I find where I can actually talk to people about my hobbies I feel like everyone is turning against me even if that isnâ€™t the case. I remember when I was the opposite to all those things and I feel like Iâ€™m never going to be in a positive position like that anymore. Iâ€™ve tried therapy, Iâ€™ve tried meds, I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore and I feel like Iâ€™ve brought this all upon myself in the last few years. Iâ€™m no longer the person I was proud and happy to be and I feel like I never will be. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I really donâ€™t.
