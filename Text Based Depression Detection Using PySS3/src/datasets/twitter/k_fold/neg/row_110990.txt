Im doing it either tonight or tomorrow.Pretty much just preparing to finish myself off. Cleaning the house,packing stuff up,notes,etc. Im just so tired anymore. My heart is still broken three months later after my BPD ex cheated and left. I know she probably wont care. My family will get over it. Im rotting from the inside. I just cant take this feeling anymore. Im practically dead anyways,i have no energy to do anything and i cant stop the rushing thoughts of my childhood and my ex. I just want to sleep. And today may be that day. Regardless,i should be dead by the end of the weekend. Hopefully tonight. I still have lots to do. Ill keep everyone updated.
