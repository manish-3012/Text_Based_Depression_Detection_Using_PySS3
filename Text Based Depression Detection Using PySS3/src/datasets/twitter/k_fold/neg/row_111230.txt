How do you stop feeling like this without dyingIt's constant. I can't sleep.

I was set up for failure, abused as a young child and struggling ever since.

The man I love treats me like shit and I can't get enough of him. When he's away I just think about him. How he's my soulmate. And all the awful things he's done to me. 

But let's face it, even if I wasn't in a fucked up relationship, I would probably still feel this way. I was set up for failure. The first time I considered suicide was in 2nd grade.

I don't feel any desire to connect with other people anymore. I don't find hobbies enjoyable anymore. I'm no longer motivated by my career. I had so many goals not too long ago and now I just watch Netflix and pray I die overnight.

I've already tried all the treatments and heard all the empty platitudes.

Sometimes I feel good and even get some sleep... Only when I take benzos. What's worse? Being dead or being addicted. 

Fuck
