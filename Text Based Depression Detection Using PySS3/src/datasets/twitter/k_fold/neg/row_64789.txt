How do I kill myself?Honestly so much in my life could be fixed if I just completed my online assignments on time or took notes or worked out or had the dedication to do something I want to do. I canâ€™t move forward in life like this and being alive isnâ€™t helping . My family is not very supportive either and school has no consideration for any of this. I donâ€™t want to keep suffering . Iâ€™m not capable of making it through 12th grade and even if I somehow passed 12th I wouldnâ€™t be able to get a job respectable for my parents. I donâ€™t want to hurt my parentsâ€™ esteem by being the failure I am but I cannot do anything. I lie to them about completing my assignments and notes because I donâ€™t want them to yell at me or be angry , my dad has high blood pressure and he works very hard but Iâ€™m not getting anything done. Soon the school will ask me to upload my work and I will have nothing to upload. I have no other option.
