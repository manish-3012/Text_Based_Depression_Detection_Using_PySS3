I think I'm gonna do it soonmy thoughts of suicide started when i started doing so bad in college. I am about to graduate with a degree in environmental chemistry, but i'm so scared that I might not get a job due to lack of experience. I have loans and debts and I am scared. I know that I am not the only one who is in this kind of situation. But I just don't understand why I am so hopeless and the only solution that always appear in my mind is to end my life. I mean whenever i think of my problems, i feel like my heart is sinking, my brain is draining, and my mind is spinning out of control. I hate these feelings. I understand that sometimes there are ups and downs. But why do i always feel sad after I get happy? Why do i always anticipate bad things will happen? I am so confused, I don't want to be confused anymore. I think I will do it soon, I just can't take it anymore. At least I can prove my step-mom that I can do something that most people fear. She says I'm weak.
