My relationship ended and so did II have dated someone for 3 years. They broke up with me out of the blue last month, because they stopped loving me. We have spent every day together for years. I donâ€™t know who I am now. I donâ€™t think I exist anymore. I donâ€™t want to exist anymore. Iâ€™ve been thinking about this for a while now, and the only thing stopping me is that I donâ€™t want my ex to blame themselves. I tried asking for an explanation on the breakup today, got no response, even when I said I am not well. I am completely utterly alone and I canâ€™t do it anymore.
