I want to get help but I feel like I can'tI desperately need long-term intense therapy but I don't feel like I can get it. Even when I try to call somewhere to get help I end up hanging up because I don't know what to say. I really just don't know how to ask for help and I feel like that's going to end with me killing myself.
