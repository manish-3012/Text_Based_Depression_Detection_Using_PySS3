I deserve nothingI canâ€™t get my life together. I donâ€™t deserve anything. Iâ€™m stupid for ever thinking I deserve a good life. Even the person closest to me agrees, I donâ€™t deserve anything anymore. Iâ€™ll just do whatever is on my list for the day and nothing else. I donâ€™t deserve relax. I donâ€™t deserve fun. Just do my work and thatâ€™s all. 

I donâ€™t even deserve to be alive anymore. I donâ€™t know why I donâ€™t just end it. 

Iâ€™m worthless and having nothing left. My soul is empty. If I was home no one would miss me. The world is better off without me.
