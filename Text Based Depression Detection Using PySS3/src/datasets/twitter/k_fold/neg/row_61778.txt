It feels different.I have bipolar disorder with mixed episodes and severe anxiety. I'm just so done feeling like this all the time. My husband will find someone who will love him as much as he deserves and my children will hopefully get a mom who doesn't yell all the time and try to escape from home as much as possible. 

I've found a place I can climb up to and set up a rope and a timeframe that should work most weeks where my husband will be home with the kids. I'll wipe all of my electronics beforehand since I have cheated on my husband and he doesn't need to stumble upon that while he grieves. Tomorrow, I plan to purchase the rope and store it in my locker on my University's campus.

I have one thing left I wanna try before I do it. I remember feeling so very happy and satisfied just last week. Maybe I can ride that again. I'm going to try to make a friend and be 100% myself, within respectable bounds. If I'm rejected, once again, I don't think I'll be able to take it.  

I know I am loved, albeit the me I try to present. I know I have potential. I don't have the motivation, patience, or the positivity to do anything worth something. I can fake motivation and ambition for only so long. I feel empty. My insides feel raw from the emotions scratching at my chest and my throat. 

I've always been able to calm myself down by thinking of slitting my throat, warm blood enveloping me in a tender last embrace. I knew I couldn't bring myself to do that and I wouldn't have the strength anyway, but it would help me relax. This time I know what I want to do and where to do it. I feel more independent knowing I can do it. All I need is rope, conveniently located at my neighborhood hardware store. 

I'm not really looking for any support so I'm not sure why I am posting here. I just want to get it out of me... Somewhere.
