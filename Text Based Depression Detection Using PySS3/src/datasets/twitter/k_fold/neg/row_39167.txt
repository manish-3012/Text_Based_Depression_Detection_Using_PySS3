Why am I aliveWhy am I alive

Would everyone else be happier if I killed my self, no, they probably wouldnâ€™t 
I know my mom would be devastated and my sister would wonder were I was and probably forget about me since how young she is but I know that she would cry every now and then and my brother would probably be really sad for a long time. My dad would be the same as my mom but he would try to hide it but deep inside would think about me a lot.
My friends would be sad for a month or two but then forget about me.
My school would probably have a couple of week. that they would talk about suicide prevention but after a month or two they would forget about me.

And yet I think about this, why.
Because it feels like the only option and I am so stressed about everything and it feels like nobody cares even though I know my mom thinks about how sad I am all the time.

But in my heart I know I would never actually be able to end all of this because most of the time that I cry its because of my fear of death.
And even if I was so close to ending it all I would know that my family, all downstairs would be having fun and my family would be thinking about me.
