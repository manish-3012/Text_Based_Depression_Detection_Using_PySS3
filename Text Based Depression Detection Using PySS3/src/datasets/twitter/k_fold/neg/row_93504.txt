The perfect weekendMy family and friends will all be out of town this weekend, including my roommates. I wasnâ€™t planning on dying just yet, but this seems like a perfect opportunity to go through with it. I canâ€™t continue living anymore, no matter how hard I try to get over my problems, I always end up back at square one. If I wasnâ€™t such a pussy I would have already done it by now.
