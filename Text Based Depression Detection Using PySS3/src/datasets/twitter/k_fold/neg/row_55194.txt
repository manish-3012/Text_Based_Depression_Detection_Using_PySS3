Just need to ventI just turned 21 and I am not happy at all where I am in my life. I am going to college right now and I'm a sophomore. I just feel like I am too smart for college and just want a web development job that pays well. I have trouble getting out of bed everyday because I just don't feel like getting up and want to blow off all of my meetings and appointments. I end up doing that sometimes. I just started anti depressants 2 months ago. They are working, I'm not suicidal anymore. Just very unhappy with where I am in my life. I feel like I should be a lot farther along than where I am right now. I also have a hard time falling asleep at night. I'll stay up until 2am thinking about what I want to do with my life and thinking about my gun that is sitting on my nightstand.
