What will the therapyst say?I'm in therapy for nearly 3 years. Been suicidal for twice as long. Had an attempt recently after which my therapist refused to work with me unless I made a promise. So now I'm obligated to call him if I decide I'm gonna kill myself.
I feel that I'll soon be ready to leave and I am afraid of calling. But I don't want to be a shitty person either.
What should I expect from the talk?
