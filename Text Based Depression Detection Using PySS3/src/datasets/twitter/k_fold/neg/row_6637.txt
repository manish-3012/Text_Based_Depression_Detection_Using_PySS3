I'm just doneMy mom has had a rough morning (like every morning) and asked me to help her out, well here I am, hours later still watching my adopted brother that is spoiled inside and out. I can't even have a good relationship with my boyfriend because of the amount of time that I have to watch him, or feed him or "help mom out." Even the counselors at school think that my parents are bad at being parents, but they haven't done anything explicitly wrong, so I can't call CPS. I've relapsed in cutting and I do have a plan. I just don't want to do it while my sister is here, she didn't do anything and doesn't deserve that. I done with this whole family, I can't take it anymore! I'm 16 for fucks sake. I shouldn't have to do this, I shouldn't have to be a parent to a kid that's not even my blood relative, I shouldn't have to give up someone I truly love to be a stand in parent because my mom cants stop smoking weed long enough to be an actual mom.
