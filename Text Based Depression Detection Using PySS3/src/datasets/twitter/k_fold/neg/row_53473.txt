Why do they leave when you tell them?Thereâ€™s a friend and I havenâ€™t been talking too much to her. I just canâ€™t. I donâ€™t have the energy anymore and I just sleep. Itâ€™s better because if I sleep I donâ€™t think of ending it. 

So she gets mad. â€˜Real friendsâ€™ will say hi or how are you once in a while even if they canâ€™t hang out. I explain whatâ€™s up. Finally tell her that Iâ€™m trying to stay alive. And I donâ€™t have the words to explain anything. I might not even understand it myself. 

So she blocks me. Wonâ€™t text back. 

And Iâ€™m stuck feeling worse because I already beat myself up for not going to see her and now Iâ€™m doing it even more. Why do they leave?
