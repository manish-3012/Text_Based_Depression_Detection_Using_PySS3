How can I get help? Please helpHey guys I'm not sure how you can help me but I feel like you might be able to cheer me up or just listen because I'm done with my life and I hate it because I've got so many problems at once and it's not like they're small problems they're big and can't be solved easily, I want to run away from my parents because they force me to do stuff I don't want to do, and if I don't, they get abusive and it's slowly really tearing me apart, I'm feel like a marionette, I just go to school, come back home, start working with my mum all day, and I swear it lasts till night when I'm exhausted and can't do anything for school so instead of doing my homework I go to bed, then the other day is the same, I've told my teacher about how it's at home but nothing happened, I wasn't even sure what I expected, my grades in school are the worst and my parents expect me to get a well paid job, and I don't know what to do when I show them my school certificate, I applied for schools but I got declined by all of them, I'm waiting to get 18 so I go away anywhere far away from my parents but I still have to wait for more than a year, and I'm afraid that when I am away, I'd get more depressed and that I will think of suicide but I don't want it, I think life can be beautiful but then I think of how it will get beautiful for me because I know I'll never be able to forget my parents and siblings, I don't want to go to those child protective services because I don't want my parents to get in trouble because of me and I know that my father will bring me to the Mid East and kill me there if he'd find out, I don't know what to do I'm in Germany and I'm 16 how can I get help??? Please I don't know what to do I'm afraid

thanks a lot
