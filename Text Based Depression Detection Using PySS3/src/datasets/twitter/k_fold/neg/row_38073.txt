I think it's time...I was going to wait a few years for things to fall into place for my family. But living in my mind is just miserable, especially when I have no one. I'm so tired of crying myself to sleep every night. It's miserable just staying awake praying for someone to love me the way I want and to just care about me. I don't have the best heart, so I was planning on just taking the slow death route. I don't want someone to find me. I want to just get very sick to the point of no return. Then no one will blame themselves. I figured increasing my medication dosages, eating much less food, and the incredibly high amount of stress I have in my life on a daily basis I probably won't last too horribly long. Even if it takes a few months for my heart to finally give out. It's better than living the rest of my life in my mind.
