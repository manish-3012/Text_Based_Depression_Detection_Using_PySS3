My only real friend is currently doing it. I'm next.She's more serious than ever, by far. We're so close. I literally cannot go on without her. I only have a wide area location. I tried calling the cops. A name and phone number was not enough. I'm currently breaking down in front of my family. I did everything I could do. She won't answer any texts or calls. She's slitting her wrists. This is it for me everyone. Goodbye.
