I don't want to deal with it anymoreI'm so tired of dealing with everything. With my shitty abusive family. With the constant stress of loans. With not being able to find a job or support myself. I'm a drain on everyone at this point and I'm tired of it. I don't want to get harassed by my mom any more without having the courage to tell her to fuck off. She's gonna be in my life forever because I can't stand up to her and I can't live with her in my life. She's my mom I'm supposed to love her and she's supposed to love me. I can't get her out of my life I can't confront her. Suicide is the easiest way. She can't get me if I'm dead.
