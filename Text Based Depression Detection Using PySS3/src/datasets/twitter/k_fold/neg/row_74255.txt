I love youI know there are probably a lot of people out there who are having a hard time right now. To those who are, I want you to know I love you. I will most likely never actually meet you in person, but I love you for who you are. You may think you donâ€™t do anything right, but thatâ€™s ok. Even if you arenâ€™t perfect,  I still love you. No matter how much youâ€™ve fucked up, I still love you. 

Iâ€™ve had some hard times as well, but the thing that cheered me up the most was the internet. I wanted to give some of that love back to the internet. So fellow person who needs some love, I love you.
