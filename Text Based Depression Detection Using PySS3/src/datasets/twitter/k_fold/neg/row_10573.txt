Why do I suck at suicide tooyou'd think after all the things i do wrong, this would be the one thing i do right, but no
ive never had a successful attempt

i always half ass it, or call an ambulance myself when it gets real

i have this stupid will to live and people always try and use that against me and say 'well clearly you're not as depressed as you say because you're still alive' and all it makes me do is want to die more but i just CANT

I FUCKING CANT AND I WANT TO

god if guns were legal id be dead so fast but the time involved in other methods gives me too much time to think but if i could just shut my eyes and squeeze a trigger like ripping off a band-aid, 1-2-3 go, and im dead, it'd be so much easier and i wouldn't have to do this fucking shit anymore

how am i supposed to do this for several more decades? i can't
i can't handle the loneliness and isolation, the constant thoughts and sick feeling, like that squeezing feeling in my stomach and chest that just hits me for no reason twenty times a day, just the fucking hopelessness of it all

i don't understand why i can't just shut my eyes and never wake up
and the thing is i KNOW id rather be alive and happy than dead, but id rather be dead than depressed and im depressed right now, but i still hope that one day ill be happy and that's what's fucking killing me

hope isn't a good thing, it's a fucking curse, it's bullshit. im going to spend the rest of my life feeling sick all because I can't let go of this fantasy world ive created in my head where im normal and happy

this isn't fair

tldr im a fucking piece of shit who can't even die right
