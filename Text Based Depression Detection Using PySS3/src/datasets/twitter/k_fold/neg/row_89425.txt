Stimulants for depressionI'm chronically suicidal. I don't plan it but I feel horrified and panicked as soon as I wake up every morning. I lack the ability to focus. My mind is constantly wandering and I'm thinking when is this or that activity over, especially work, or if not at work a feeling of deep apathy and hopelessness.
I have tried all sorts of meds. Nothing really works.
I have however found that if I drink one strong cup of coffee I feel very differently. I am more in the moment at work and relaxed in my mind, I can focus on what's necessary atleast for a while.
I wonder if a stimulant Med would be helpful like ritalin or vyanese (ADD meds)
Does anyone have experience with this?
I do wonder if it's a short cut and perhaps opposite to what I need in that I need to learn to focus on my own, calm myself down and regulate my own emotions but... Its the old cost benefit analysis and at this point I cannot focus and constantly think I don't want to be here, oh god not the morning again....
Thanks
