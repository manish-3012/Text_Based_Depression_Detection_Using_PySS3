I just noticed today that my mom makes me suicidal.I've had this feeling appear whenever I see/hear my mom for so long that I thought it was normal. 
It's like whenever I see/hear her I can't breathe and I can sometimes sweat. Anxiety pours over me and I'm just done.

I noticed it today because I haven't had any anxiety today and I thought it was great, well, when my mom came home I got a hell of anxiety and suicide thoughts. God... I know she's been mentally abusive like, controlling me, but never thought it'd take on me this much.

I need to gtfo next year when I'll be 18, if I survive till then.
