My bf just overdosed and I'd like to do the sameI kind of posted about this on infidelity too but idk if people telling me my bf is trash is gonna help. Basically him, myself and my sister all got super shitfaced last night. We all live together. I heard him blatantly trying to have sex with her while he thought I was sleeping. I left and was texting him today, not very happily. He started getting really dark so I sent my sister to check on him. Yeah he was trying to overdose so I had her call the hospital and came home. He's still in the ER but they're transferring him to a psych ward soon. 

I feel so fucking betrayed and bitter and miserable. And now I have to worry about him and be supportive too. He has no one else really, when I called his mom to ask her to check up on him she thought it was a huge inconvenience and just "drama". She actually got mad. I mean outside of being my bf he's also my best friend I can't just let him come home alone. 

So anyway. I don't really think I want to continue this relationship but I'm stuck. I am a student, I can't work with my current program. I have $1000 to my name. He owns our house and he owns my car. I have nowhere to go. I can't talk to the two people I am closest to anymore either. I'm ready to go blow everything I have left on a gun and just end it. I was barely holding it the fuck together to begin with and now the only good stuff I had in my life blew up. I've been suicidal for a long time now and really I just can't think of any reason to keep going. 

Thanks if you read all this crap
