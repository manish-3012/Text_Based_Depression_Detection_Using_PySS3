I'm done28 years old, I've smoked weed basically every day since I was 15, and there is absolutely no traction in my life. I don't want to do anything. I just want to get high. I enrolled in law school but went to like 2 classes this semester. My anxiety is way too fucking high around other people, and with the growing depression, I don't care enough to push through it.

I don't care about a job. I don't care about meeting other people. I want to be alone, or, preferably, to not exist. I've had this thought for years, and it keeps getting louder and louder.

My life feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure. I've been avoiding it more than living it for 13 years. Basically half my life. I've been a non-person as long as I've been a person. So who gives a fuck if I end it.
