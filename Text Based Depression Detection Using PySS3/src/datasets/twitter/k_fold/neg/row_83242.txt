I feel like my thoughts are winning and I donâ€™t want to fight with my inner demons anymoreIâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts almost every day, Iâ€™ve had them forever it seems like and theyâ€™ve been getting worse and worse over the last few months. My mother is extremely narcissistic and due to certain circumstances I had to move back in with her and I just feel like Iâ€™m going back instead of moving forward and itâ€™s killing me. I hate living here and always have, I thought everything would get better once I left but they didnâ€™t and now Iâ€™m stuck in the same situation again with the same set of problems and Iâ€™m just exhausted of all of it. I feel like I have no friends and I know thatâ€™s not true but at the same time I feel like they wouldnâ€™t exactly miss me if I was gone. Sure people would morn, but theyâ€™d soon forget about me, and eventually I would turn into some distant memory.
