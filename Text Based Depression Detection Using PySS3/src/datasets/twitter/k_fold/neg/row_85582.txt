There just isn't anywhere left to runThe few positives are so crowded out by the obsessions, the trauma is now such a huge part of my life and my brain that it's taken control. I've tried therapists and moving to new countries etc. but nothing helps, because I'm simply not likeable or valuable or good at anything. I am simply not a person who can function normally, but I'm so close that I constantly fail at everything I aspire to, I can fake it up until I just start to feel secure, then I fuck everything up. I have driven away all my close friends with my mental illness and just being sort of crap, I still have some who don't know me well, but that's the worst part; the more people get to know me the more they realize what I truly am, and they need to get away for the sake of themselves. But I want so much to be good at something, to be normal, to be liked and loved for who I really am. I just don't think it's possible to break out of this prison I've built around myself when I'm not good enough to really function anyway.
