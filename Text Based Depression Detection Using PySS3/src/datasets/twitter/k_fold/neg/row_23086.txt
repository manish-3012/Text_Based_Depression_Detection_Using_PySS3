Emergency heroin shotEver since I watched the nuclear documentary 'Threads' nuclear war has been on my mind, I started thinking about what I would do if it ever happened. 

Heroin od seems the best way to go tbh, fuck dying of 3rd degree burns and radiation sickness. I live in the UK so no matter where I am I will be fucked by it cos it's such a small country.

So how much heroin should an opiate naive person use to od comfortably without nausea ? 

Can a pre prepared heroin syringe be kept in a fridge long term and then be used straightaway?
