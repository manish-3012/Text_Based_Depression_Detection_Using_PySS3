i am a burdenlately, i feel like a burden to everyone. I am only a troublesome for people. I feel like I always bring them a bad mood, always bring unhappiness to those around me. I have a boyfriend and I feel really bad for him because dealing with a crazy person like me. I feel lethargic to everything lately. All i want is just to disappear from this world. I wanted to go, but on the other hand I am worried about the people that i am close with. I dont even know what i want... I just... feel... like i dont have any purpose to live anymore...
