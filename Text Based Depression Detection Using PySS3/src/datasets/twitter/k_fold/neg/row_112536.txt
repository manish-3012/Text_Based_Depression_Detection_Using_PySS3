I think I am done.14 years I've been telling myself.. This is going to get better one day. Only thing that kept me alive was the thought that.. It will get better some day. I no longer believe that. I think... Living is the worst punishment anyone could get. At least for me it is. I've hurt so much over so many years. All I see in the future is the same pain. No silver lining. I am scared shitless of death but... Overcome your fears right?
