Hear me out! sorry for the long potato post!Today I will be sharing another chapter from the book How I Stayed Alive When My Brain was Trying to Kill Me by Susan Rose. (I recommend everyone to read it as it gives a deeper insight to our suicidal tendencies.)
Sometimes it helps to â€œunderstand how things work upstairs.â€

â€œThoughts and feelings are electrical impulses that travel along a complex web of nerve cells called neurons, with the help of chemicals called neurotransmitters.
Feelings and thoughts are certainly real.â€
But the fact remains that biologically speaking, feelings and thoughts are just energy particles born of life experiences and genetics.
Pretend youâ€™re flying above a busy highway at rush hour. Below you at cars and trucks on the roads streaming through various destinations.
Your thoughts and feelings can be pictured as the trucks and cars and the neurons are the highways theyâ€™re traveling on.
Now imagine youâ€™re driving a fed ex truck along the highway and suddenly the highway ends at a river. No bridge in sight but there is a ferry that can take you across the river. What do you do? You get your truck on the ferry and are taken to the other side of the highway and on your way you go again. A similar thing happens in the brain, an electromagnetic signal (the fed ex truck) travels along the neuron (the highway) carrying important packages and letter (your thoughts and feelings) until it reaches a gap called the synapse (the river).
Synapses are non contact chemical transmissions between one part of a neuron and another. 
 Take a look at the provided photo below, the little circular molecules floating in the gap are the neurotransmitters (carries) that transmit nerve impulses across the synapse.
Just a faulty construction or improper maintenance can cause the highway to deteriorate, brain function can be compromised by severe trauma, stress, or chemical imbalanceâ€ (bad habits as well). Some people are born with these faulty constructs and some people create them, or both. The chemical imbalance can combine with trauma or stress and weaken the construction. â€œ Two things happened: my body stopped making enough of the critical neurotransmitter serotonin and what I did produce for used up too quickly.â€ 

THIS IS WHERE MEDICATION AND THERAPY COMES INTO PLAY TO FIX THAT FAUKTY CONSTRUCTION UP. 

you and me didnâ€™t ask for this but alas itâ€™s time to take care of things!!!!
