how to stop needing human contact?how can i stop needing contact with other people? every day is a massive struggle to keep myself isolated. i need to stop talking to people i know because i know in the end iâ€™m only going to hurt or betray them, but i canâ€™t stop myself. i try to limit myself to only talking to people when they have a problem that i could reassure them on or give advice about, but too often i find myself talking out of turn anyway. i hate it. i donâ€™t want to keep forcing them to have to speak to me but i canâ€™t stop myself. 
i also donâ€™t want them to think that i hate them, which is where things become very difficult. people will tend to assume that itâ€™s something theyâ€™ve done when i stop talking to them and i donâ€™t like that, i donâ€™t want to hurt them that way either, but when it comes down to it iâ€™d rather they hurt a little bit that way than things ending up crashing and burning if i keep up talking to them.

how can i stop the desire, the impulse to talk to people? failing that, how can i prove to them that theyâ€™re better off without me?
