thereâ€™s no way outliving is hard, dying (and not being part of the percentage that ends up disabled, humiliated, etc) is almost harder. and i thought i was getting better. i thought i wouldnâ€™t have a night like this again. i have a boyfriend who loves me, i have (some) family that would be devastated. and all i can think about sometimes is how much i miss the person i used to be.

 what do i do? i feel claustrophobic in my own body. i keep getting pieces of hope but itâ€™s just delaying the inevitableâ€”maybe it would be better if i just hit rock bottom so i could just pull the cord, finally. no fucks given.

this will never be fucking worth it, will it? iâ€™ll always end up back here, wonâ€™t i
