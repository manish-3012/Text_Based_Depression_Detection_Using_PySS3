I don't have an interesting title.I just want my parents to say, "hey you okay?" and then not ride my ass on how I cause my own depression. It's not like they are abusive, I just wish they understood that I can't be alone in this. I should just be placed in a psych ward already. I don't know how much more I can stand. Depression hurts so bad.
