I have been having some thoughts...Is life really worth? Doing the same thing over and over again. I'm M[15] and i have built up a fear of school (Didaskaleinophobia).

For the past years i have been getting constant depression from school, i have been crying and have had many suicidal thoughts due to school. Al this fear of results, homework, detentions, and all these grades and tests kill me, literally. It happens usually near the end of school holidays or days off, where i get a bit of freedom and don't want to go back to the same old routine. But it hasn't been all bad for the past years, I met this girl on an app and i booked a flight for her to come here and she did... she went back to Germany yesterday after a 1 week stay at my house. I loved spending time with her and all, I love her so much and she also loves me so that has really cheered me up!

After she left though I was dropped home by my uncle and was home alone, it was lonely, I felt lonely as if no on cared about me... and I missed my girl, everywhere i looked around the room and it reminded me of the times we had, which broke me down, then i moved to the bed and there it was her smell... i couldn't even lay on the bed without crying even more!

These 2 things together are completely breaking me down every second and i don't really know what to do, I'm having so much depression and suicidal thoughts, and it's killing me because i'm a shy person and don't open up much.
