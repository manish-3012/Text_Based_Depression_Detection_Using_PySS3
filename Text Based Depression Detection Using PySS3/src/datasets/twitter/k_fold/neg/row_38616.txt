Donâ€™t feel like feeling anymoreIâ€™m so completely drained. Itâ€™s getting harder every day to pretend I donâ€™t want to walk into traffic or leap off the subway platform into an oncoming train. My head is overflowing with terrible feelings. From â€œoh no the sheet on my bed doesnâ€™t fit properlyâ€ to â€œmaybe I should try to grab that cops gunâ€ itâ€™s too damned much. When everything is negative I just donâ€™t feel like feeling it any more.
