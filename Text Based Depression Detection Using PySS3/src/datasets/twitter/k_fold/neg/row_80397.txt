I shouldâ€™ve never been bornDo you ever feel why you were even born? My life is so much chaos, that Iâ€™m honestly considering my entire life as a mistake 

Honestly, I just feel like I should have never left the fetus alive. Iâ€™m the root to so many problems, including my own my problems 

Iâ€™ve been considering suicide, but I realize it wonâ€™t solve anything at all
