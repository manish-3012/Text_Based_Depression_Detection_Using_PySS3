I just want it all to endI just can't take it anymore, I just want it all to end. For the past few weeks I've been contemplating it. It's not like anyone would miss me, I have zero friends, aside from my girlfriend, and she can do better, better than the terrible person she has for a lover now. We don't even live in the same country, let alone the same continent. My parents could do without me as a freeloader, make their lives easier. My half brother doesn't even like me. It seems like a win-win situation. I just want it to end.. just.. fade away into nothing.. or even if there is an afterlife, something where there is no pain.. if I can't hold out tonight.. i don't know..

EDIT: I just told my girlfriend. She laughed in my face and told me to stop being emo. **WELP**
