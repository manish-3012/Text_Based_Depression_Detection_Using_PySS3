I still prayI donâ€™t have a god to pray to anymore. He is gone. He was never there. But I still pray. I pray to the being I once believed in. I pray for my death. I pray  I pray that my soul would be ripped of my body and I could be nothing but a ghost. I pray. Why do I pray. There is no god. There is nothing. He is gone. He left me. But I still pray.
