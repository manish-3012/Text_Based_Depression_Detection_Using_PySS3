Iâ€™m feeling pretty hopeless todayIâ€™ve been doing better about coping skills, but I just feel so hopeless right now. Last night I had a dream that my ex fiancÃ© told me he wanted to be with me again no matter how hard it was, and I felt so happy to know I didnâ€™t ruin everything. But obviously it was a dream, and now I just feel like I donâ€™t do anything right. I feel so alone and unloved and just want to stop existing. Iâ€™ve started to hate calling the suicide hotline because they never understand I just need someone to tell me everything is going to be ok and I just need someone to care about me for a few minutes, and instead they just talk to me like Iâ€™m a crazy person and try to get me to go to a hospital that I canâ€™t afford. I used to talk about my friends, but I donâ€™t want to bother them because itâ€™s always just the same stuff over and over and Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™m going to push them away like I pushed away my fiancÃ© and Iâ€™ll have no one who wants to be around me anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do, I just feel so broken
