PE makes me so suicidali really just wanna hang myself or something right now. i feel so useless. i've had nothing but bad experiences from PE, and every new class is just another reminder and another bad experience to add to the list. best part is NO ONE FUCKING CARES. I've had panic attacks and I've literally just wandered around crying doing absolute shit and people just stare at me weird if anything. even my "friends"; fuck them. and the fact that after I've had a panic attack or whatever, people still try to pass the ball to me as if I'm even paying attention or as if I can even catch it. That just brings attention to the fact that I'm crying. And then everyone just ignores it again. Like, if y'all are going to leave me alone, then leave me THE FUCK ALONE. 

goddammit i just want to die
