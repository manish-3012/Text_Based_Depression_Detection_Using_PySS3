Trying to love yourself when reality sets inSome days I have control, but most days everything triggers tramatic images and flashbacks of me at my worst. Maybe I'm a narc. Idk. I try to forgive myself and think I was okay all along, but reality sets in and I realize there was always something wrong with me. People say it doesn't matter what others think. Everyone says, "see the beauty, intelligence, greatness about yourself!" so I try. If I put makeup on and act confident, people look at me weird. I can tell they want to say (and they sometimes do) tell me I'm not a model/still ugly. If I try to join in on convos, my stuttering, shyness and anxiety instantly makes me look stupid in the eyes of others. So,I'm stupid. And I'm ugly. And my past is full of the proof. (Special ed, counseling, getting told ugly constantly, everyone treating me like I'm challenged) How my present got so great, idk, but I'm always aware it could shatter at any moment, because I'm me and eventually I'll be thete to catch up and ruin it.
