I want to dieSo, I'm 19, and I'm a guy. Yes. I'm a guy that is trying to talk about my suicidal thoughts and feelings. 
It started about 3 years ago after I self harmed so badly I needed over 30 stitches. 2 weeks later I was rushed to hospital after a bodged suicide attempt and kept in a mental hospital. I went to therapy, I took the pills, I felt "better". I thought life was worth living for a while, I had a girlfriend, a job I was happy with and a close family that loved me.
Fast forward 2 and a bit years, and I'm homeless. My dad and I no longer speak, my girlfriend and I have split up, and now the thoughts are worse than ever. My girlfriend was and still is the only person I could talk to about my feelings. She helped, but I ended it because my head is so messed up and I don't really know what to do.
I've researched. When the time comes I'm going to hang myself, drop hang myself actually, with the aid of an exit bag (not necessary but a safety net so to speak) I know that I need to drop approximately 5' 9" in order to generate 1100lbs of force, more than enough to snap my neck, sever my spinal cord, and theoretically provide me with instant death, or as I see it, an instant relief. I don't know what to do, everything is so hard and I'm so scared of the pain I'll cause with suicide. Is it selfish to think about myself and only myself for once? I just need help. 

TLDR I'm in shit and want to hang myself
