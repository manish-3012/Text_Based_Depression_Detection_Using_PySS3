25 or 50 floors?There's an apartment building I know of here that's fifty stories tall. They have a sky bridge kinda thing at the 25th and 50th floor, open to the public. I'm scared of the fall at either height - 50 stories would take a full five seconds, but I'm more afraid of failing. And, it's also a beautiful building, and I don't want to ruin things for the residents there or future visitors. I wonder what'll be the repercussions. I wish there was an easier way for me to kill myself.
