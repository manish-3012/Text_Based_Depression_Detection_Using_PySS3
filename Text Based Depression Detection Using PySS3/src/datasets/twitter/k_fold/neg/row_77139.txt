My brother killed himself 3 years ago, and now I'm older than he wasAnd I just can't stop thinking that the motherfucker stole my chance. Now I can't make my family go through this once again. I have already made them suffer a lot. Maybe I deserve a little hell on earth before I can send myself to hell.
