I give upI have huge anxiety. I'm always troubled by thoughts of suicide and self harm. I always hope that things get better but they never do. I can never talk to people properly nor defend myself. No one really cares about me. I'm sire that no one will even see this. I always felt alone but today I realised that I truly am alone. I wish I couldn just end my life . But I always never follow through with it. I've tried it 4 times but I've never died. I wNt to jump out of my window. But im too scared to do it. I'm a pushy, a coward and a disgrace. I dont deserve to live and I'm tired of never being understood anymore. I'm tired of always being shy. Tired of being ignored. Tired of people only talking to me only when they need something. Tired of work pressure. Tired of exams. I'm tired of everything. I wish I fi ally do it. I wait for the sweet embrace of death. I need to do it as quickly as possible. I give up on life. I give up on people. I have given up on myself. I quit
