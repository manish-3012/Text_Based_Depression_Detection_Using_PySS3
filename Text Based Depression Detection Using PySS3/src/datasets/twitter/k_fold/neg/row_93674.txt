Hate my life/If anyone wants to talk?Like I'm becoming numb now, Last year I tied killing myself by hanging but this random guy came cut the rope and talked to me for hours. It honestly helped a bit but then I get back home and the bullshit would start all over.

The only thing keeping me alive till now is my little sister a PC and the music I do, I can lost myself in the gaming world an ignore my life and sometime Express my feelings in music or just make up lies to feel better. Won't lie I tried to have a normal life like get a job, get a girl make friends but it all comes crashing down.

I'm unemployed, no girl and I stay in a dark room all day. I'm reminded by my failures everyday, I dont think this life is for me. I love my Mom and step dad (I guess) but I'm starting to feel its slipping away slowly. My mom nags me constantly bout how much of a failure I am, My step dad dont tell me anything but the look he gives me says a lot.

I'm 26 years an I have absolutely nothing like nothing that I can call my own. The feelings of anger, sadness and fear have all left me in ways, I dont feel it as much anymore cause as I said I dont go outside anymore. I taped up my windows an locked my door, Its completely dark an I like it. My mom them thinks I'm just pretending.

I dont blame them tho, Today I'll do something useful for once. I'm going and register to be an organ donor. So many people need what I have an I dont want it. Cause I might not be here long I would like to make it to my sister birthday so I can see her turn 11 then I can leave but if I reach the edge well I'm gonna end it.

I know my issues aren't that big like some of you guys, I read what some of you'll go though an I cry it's just so messed up!! Like is God even real at this point?? So many people suffering from physical and mental pain yet no help!! That's fuked!!.

I am so sorry!! I honestly wish we could all find another way to escape whatever pain we're carrying around, No matter how small or large pain is pain we all experience it differently. Sigh I hope someday we can all meet somewhere and finally live a life that feels like it's worth something. I'm just so sorry!! I truly am.
