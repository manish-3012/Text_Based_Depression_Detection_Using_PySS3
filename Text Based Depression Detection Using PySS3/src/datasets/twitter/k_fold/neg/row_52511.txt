i lost faith in myselflong story short,  
I was spiralling into depresson again when i found out there was a hobby club in my town. i quickly became friends with everyone, including a friend X. Friend X was in a similar situation, depressed and using the club as an escape, i could tell them anything without being judged and in turn i was really kind to them, despite my usual awkwardness around people.  Some time later, friend X stops going to the club, files a complaint against me and tells me not to contact them ever again  due to the comments ive made. I couldnt reply because i was already blocked.   
I have no idea what i have done, i havent even had the chance to apologize. I do not remember saying anything as everything was fine, they even paid for my entry fee last time we met(you pay at the end). I am worried that the only place i felt i belonged to is going to shun me now because of this misunderstanding. it realloy hurts me because i thought i could trust X, and as awkward as i am with people it seems like a recurring thing. that i push people away. dark thoughts are coming back. i feel really lonely. like noone understands my suffering. i really cant connect with people. i dont belong anywhere on this planet
