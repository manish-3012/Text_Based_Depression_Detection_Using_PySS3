Do I tell my best friend?I dated her for a year, we were best friends. She was so in love with me; I meant the world to her. She cared so God damn much for me. But my mind continued to degrade. I told her about my depression and possible DID; she believed she could help. However I began to want to end it all; I began cutting ties. I quit my sports team that I had participated in for 6 years. I began avoiding my friends. My mind convinced me to distance myself from her. Not only that, but make me unattracted to her. I couldn't be intimate in our last month, I didn't want to kiss her the last week or two. I ended our relationship without a real explanation. I was going to end my life.
 Three months have gone by. I met her mother the other day at the store and she revealed that my ex is worried about me. I was planning to reach out to her, and now I had no choice. I called her and we talked about our first year of college for 58 minutes, then she had to go. 
My question is: do I reveal the real reason I left her, or do I leave her in mystery? If I tell her, I'm admitting the reality of my past situation and may cause her to worry and possibly feel guilt that she wasn't there to help. If I leave her alone, she can move on with her life and forget the whole thing (she probably won't, I was her first love).
