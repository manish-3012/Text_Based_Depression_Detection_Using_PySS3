Stopped taking my medsI have stopped taking my medication (buspar, seroquel, lamictal). I haven't told my treatment team, and I don't know if I plan on it. 
I feel like I have been hit by a truck. I never stop thinking about suicide and my anxiety is so bad that I can hardly talk at most times. I don't know if I want to take my meds again, because I feel like ending my life is the only way to truly escape the way I feel. I am a burden, ugly and pathetic. The shame I feel for being myself can't be cured with pills. I don't know what to do with myself.
