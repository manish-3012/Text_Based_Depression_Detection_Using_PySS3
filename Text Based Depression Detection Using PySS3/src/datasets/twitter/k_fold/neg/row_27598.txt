Idek anymoreHi,
I'm just gonna start off by saying I know my writing is probably gonna be all over the place. I'm really sorry about that. Writing isn't my forte. Especially when you're tearing up too. 
I've suffered with depression for a very long time now and only within the past 2 months been given a diagnosis and prozac. It really didn't do anything. 
I'm also stupidly anxious and have panic attacks pretty often. This whole combination really isn't fun. I will be fine for 2 weeks to a month and then will have a really bad episode. I will cry, I will panic and I will genuinely want to commit.
 I haven't told anyone about this apart from my GP and other half. My other was amazing. And was honestly a beacon of light in a very dark and lonely place. This week hasn't been the best. She was busy and wasn't able to message. (long distance). This happened for the whole week. Just a week of nothing. Caused me to have a huge anxiety attack. Unfortunately, this morning she decides to call the relationship quits. She doesn't want to hear from me. This has made a bad week into I'd say the worst week of my life. I ask why and if I can fix the relationship. She just says no and blocks me on all methods. What hurts is that I will never know what caused it and the fact I know she isn't coming back. She hates my guts and I don't know why. Mix that with other external factors and you someone suicidal who is even more suicidal. 
I've attempted before but failed. I'm also in a multi story car park. If I was to jump from the top. 20m I'd guess. Would anyone know the chance of survival? I'm contemplating but my choice isn't set in stone. I know many people would not know or care what happened to me if I somewhat dropped off the radar. Is there even any point of living anymore?
