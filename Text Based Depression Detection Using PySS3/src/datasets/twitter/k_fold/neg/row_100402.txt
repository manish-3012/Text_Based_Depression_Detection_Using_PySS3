I feel like an outsider of my own lifeHello fellow redittors.. this is my first time ever posting I think.. I don't really remember... 

Please excuse my bad English, it's my third language.



Let me talk to you about how I feel ..

I (19F) have always felt like an outcast either in my life or others.. it's quite funny to explain. 
Sometimes I see myself doing things.. from outside, like I am watching me living this life and doing these things I wish never happened. 
When I recall things, I do feel like an absolute failure. 
I just scroll either through Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, watch videos, play games and sleep all day.. I am currently on Paroxetine (30mg a day) diagnosed with depression and anxiety not so much ago.. I think February? Although I have felt like this, all my life and it's quite sad.
I don't feel permanent in anyone's life, like I am just someone who gets into one's life then disappear after a certain time. No questions asked, no worries.. just basically nothing. 
People seem to get tired of me all the time. They can talk to me every day of the week then suddenly cut me off. 
Which totally kills me since I have 1 close friend but we aren't anymore so.. 
I have a partner whom I truly love and it's reciprocated, but sometimes I feel like I tire them a lot. When asked it's denied... I know I shouldn't feel this way.. but I am just so tired.. 
At this point, I have no self esteem, I can help everyone but myself. 
I don't feel understood, I am an outcast and I feel disgusted by myself.. I swear I try hard to blend in even when my anxiety and shyness both kill me internally. 
But still everyone ignores me at some point with no valid reason. 
Trying to stimulate me while being enthusiastic never helped nor threats, I feel like I've a void in my person that will just stay.


I am sorry if it's long, thank you for reading.
