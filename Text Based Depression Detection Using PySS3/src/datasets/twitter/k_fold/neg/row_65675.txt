Recurrent suicide thoughts on Saturday's nightsHello everyone. This is my first time here. I'm male and 30 and live by myself only.

I feel completely overwhelmed and tired, by work and relationships. Dealing with people is really exausting to me.

It has been a while, some months, that I suffer from suicide thoughts everyone Saturday nights, when alone. It has been increasing lately the weekends that I spend alone on my apartment. Apart from suicide thoughts, I suffer, from time to time, from paranoia and obsessive thoughts, panic and anxiety attacks and from insomnia in the last months. I usually only get to sleep in the morning. If I try to sleep at night, I wake up in the middle of the night. I really don't know how to deal with this and I wish I knew I could just fix it. Currently, I'm not doing and don't intend do take any sessions from a professional like a shrink or psychologist. During the week things go relatively more easy for me and suicide thoughts don't occur as they do on weekends. Any reply or kind words would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
