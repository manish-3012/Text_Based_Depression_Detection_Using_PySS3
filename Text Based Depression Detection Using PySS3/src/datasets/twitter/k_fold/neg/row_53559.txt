Nowhere else to turnOnce my long term boyfriend left me I noticed I have nothing for me, the emptiness he once filled is now just a numb pain, unconcerned family, no friends, no future, isn't this the point where I give up? Yet I can't bring myself to do it, I worry about being found after the act, I wouldn't want to do that to anyone, I just wish I could go away without giving so much thought into the act itself.

I understand I'm going to be getting messages about how life is worth living and so on, but lines of text don't fix the feelings.

I also know how selfish suicide is and that my family, despite not being too involved in my life would of course be upset, but living an unhappy life for them seems too hard to consider.

I don't know what I wanted from this post; help, a place to vent, just something to do? I don't know.
