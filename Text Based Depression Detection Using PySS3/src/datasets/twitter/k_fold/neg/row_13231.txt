I feel so lost and beaten down, it hurts so badSo much has stacked up on top of other things, I'm so exhausted mentally and emotionally. My fiancÃ©e and I are only better off than homeless people due to a roof over our heads, we have a collective 55 dollars for the rest of the month to eat and live.

Our apartment is a complete mess from laundry to dishes stacking and we both suffer from anxiety as well as depression, our car won't start either and it just keeps dying. 

My abusive mom is still in my life be because I adore my dad. 

I cut the back of my arm a month ago, I freaked out but nearly did more tonight after something so stupid. And people supposedly close to us are doing good at not helping me when I need it mentally. I reached out talking to distract from cutting and she just told me how I needed to change, she never mentioned my fear. 

I feel so alone, lost and helpless, I want to not wake up...I struggle to see good in anything and it's just so crushingly heavy. So lost.
