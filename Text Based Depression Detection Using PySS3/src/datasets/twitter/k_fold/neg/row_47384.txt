I have no idea what even to do anymoreIâ€™ve left an abusive relationship but I feel hopeless in so many areas of my life Iâ€™m overthinking everything and honestly if Iâ€™m wondering if ending it all would just make it stop, I have a friend that deeply cares about me but heâ€™s going through a lot and feel like another burden he has to deal with so I havenâ€™t said anything but this feeling has gotten worse over months.
