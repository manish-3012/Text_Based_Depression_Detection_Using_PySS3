Itâ€™s suicide prevention day and hereâ€™s my story !Iâ€™m sitting in my car right now, waiting for my classes to start at college . 

In high school, specifically around 9th-10th grade (being the pinnacle of my issues) I became self harm. I came close to attempted suicide several times, but never went through with an attempt (luckily)

I was thinking about those times and how I felt, and specifically what it would be like if I had done it .

And the BIGGEST sense of relief flooded over me. Iâ€™m alive , and able to experience life in its fullest. 

I never thought itâ€™d get better. I felt lost, hopeless, and misunderstood . I know things are different for everyone and circumstances vary, but Iâ€™m here to tell you that while killing yourself may seem like the right idea, it will take away all other possibilities .. and the inevitability of things getting better. Someday. The hard part is, ultimately, it falls on you. Because in the end , you are fighting for your life . Whether literally or figuratively.

You ALL are warriors, every single one of you suffering from depression.. utterly unfair life circumstances, anxiety .. whatever it is, you are a warrior. And you will survive .

Much love from me. Iâ€™m here to chat if you need it
