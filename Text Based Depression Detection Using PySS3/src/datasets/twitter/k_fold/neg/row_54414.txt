My grandmaShe died of cancer the 7th she treated everyone as if they were family from the second she met them, I'd trade myself. I don't care if she was almost 70 I'll never compare and that's fine because she was exceptional. I'm having a fucking muscle spasm as I type this because of my goddamn Tourette's I can't even get a license and the bureaucrats are killing me trying to get my disability because they don't give a fuck well it stopped which is cool I guess but I'm so cold without her I expect a call or a text asking how I'm doing and to go over and visit and get a 20 no matter how much I protest her giving me money she didn't get to say goodbye they had to sedate her to put her on the ventilator and she didn't wake up she was so beautiful with her hair shaved I'm at a loss
