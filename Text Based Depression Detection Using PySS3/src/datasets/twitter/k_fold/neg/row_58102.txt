I sent an apology letter to a friend who dropped me when I was in my most depressed suicidal stateI wonâ€™t go into detail what the letter says, but itâ€™s a summary of what tormented me last year and what drove me to suicidal thoughts. I said my regrets and apologies, and even though I donâ€™t expect them to reply, it would be nice to hear from them again. I hate and have a lot of grief over losing loved friends in my life due to my depression. Even though Iâ€™m in a better state, I still struggle and I have know one to talk to about this.
