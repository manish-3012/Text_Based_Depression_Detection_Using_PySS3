If it went through?Does anyone else wonder about if their attempt actually went through and succeeded? What wouldâ€™ve happened in your immediate surroundings? If your ghost would finally be glad and free or regret? 

I wonder so much and at times rly wished it didnâ€™t fail. Then maybe wherever I wouldâ€™ve been would be better. 

After the failed attempt, my mind uses it two ways on me â€œoh since it failed, thereâ€™s this somewhat good thing that happenedâ€. Or it goes â€œpathetic idiot, u canâ€™t do anything right, not even that. Howâ€™re u gonna get anything right in life then?â€
