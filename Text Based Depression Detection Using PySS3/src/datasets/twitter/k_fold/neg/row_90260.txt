Just a talk, to forget about the pain and feel a little human againThere is a past to me that I still feel a victim to. Almost as if I am addicted to what happened even when a part of me knows that I want different. The pain seems to be my priority for most of my life, attempting to control it. I realized that today, leaving this life behind seems tempting. I've done things that most wouldn't understand and would make me a bigger outcast than being suicidal. I just want to feel a little human again.
