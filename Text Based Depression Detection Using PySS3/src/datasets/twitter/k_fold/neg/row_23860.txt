Iâ€™m an attention seeking shitheadI donâ€™t have any access to suicide hotlines, so I come here instead. Itâ€™s all I can do. I feel like Iâ€™m just a cheap gimmick at this point, like anyone who sees my posts watches what I do like Iâ€™m some sort of shitty tv drama 

I feel like life has turned me into the next Chris-Chan and I feel nothing but disgust towards myself. Why canâ€™t someone drop a rock on my head?
