I lost her forever, because Iâ€™m a piece of shitI loved her so much, I really did. I was talking to my ex still in the beginning, and she found out, and I lied about things, and I spent the past two years failing to truly show her how much I loved her because she always had to tell me the right thing to do. Eventually she fell out of love too, and she got with another guy, and we broke up. Sheâ€™s been with other people, but has more and more been regretting things (I know this cuz we still end up talking like once a week) but now she doesnâ€™t have a reason to. My ex made like her 4th insta to try to talk to me about things. Since me and my love were broken up, I figured I should just say something so she would leave me alone. I chatted with her a bit, and then I told my love. And now Iâ€™ve lost her. I shouldâ€™ve just blocked the ex. All I want is to have my love love me back. Iâ€™m so tired of fucking up. Iâ€™m so tired of making the wrong decision and hurting her and failing her. Iâ€™m wasting away, all I do is drink, and Iâ€™m fucking things up with college. Iâ€™m hurting so badly.
