i broke a bug rule of minei (M 16) cried on someone yesterday. 
weâ€™re close as fuck and he was so supportive but iâ€™m so embarrassed.
i told him i donâ€™t want to be here anymore and that iâ€™m sick of saying iâ€™m okay but i have to or people worry or pay attention to it.
i told him that i sit in town hoping a bloke will come beat me up, that i starved for 5 days, that i was laying in bed staring at the ceiling and i wanted to die right then and there.
i donâ€™t know if iâ€™m better or worse for it.
