My family hates meI've been diagnosed with depression since I was 12. I'm 18 now. I'm not sure if my family's just used to me being depressed but I've been BEGGING for help and nobody will. I cant afford any care on my own so for a year I've asked to be put back in therapy or on medication. I even asked to be hospitalized last night because I knew I wasnt good enough to trust myself alone. I want to be better and I cant alone. it hurts.
I can say whatevers on my mind about how I feel and the only response is an eye roll and some "yeah, ok" bullshit. My mom knows I want to die. She just told me shes sick of my negativity and that I just need to shut the fuck up or do it already. Well mom, I guess you'd be better without me.
I am a parasite. I survive off your money and bring you down. that is it. I'm worthless.
6 years of suffering and no hope of it ever getting better.
