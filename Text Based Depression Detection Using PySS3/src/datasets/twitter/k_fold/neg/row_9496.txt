Brother, mom and best friend have all diedHi, Iâ€™ve never posted before so here goes. I had a mental breakdown 9 years ago shortly after my dog, a perfect companion, died. Then I lost my job, and due to the job loss, lost my home as well and was forced to move thousands of miles from my â€œfriends.â€ As time passed, Iâ€™ve felt like, for the most part, Iâ€™ve been forgotten. 
Now everything that kept me going is gone. My dad is dead, brother died from cancer 5 years ago, my mom died last March and the only friend I still had died of a heart attack completely out of the blue 4 weeks ago. Our last conversation was awful, she said some terrible things to me, and Iâ€™m still trying to understand why. I donâ€™t know if she wasnâ€™t feeling well and took it out on me? 
Now Iâ€™ll never get the chance to talk it over with her; sheâ€™s gone. I canâ€™t get that last conversation out of my head and I want to forgive her, but I admit I sometimes still feel very angry with her. 

Iâ€™ve been suicidal for at least 10 years now and I feel this past year has just been the final straw. Thereâ€™s just nothing left anymore. I have severe social anxiety so making new friends seems almost impossible. When I got the phone call that she had died, I did a test of trying suspension hanging. It scared me. I donâ€™t want to fuck up. There are train tracks near my home and every night I listen to the train and fantasize about standing on the tracks just waiting to get obliterated. I donâ€™t really feel like I know how to keep going or even why? It seems like a decade of nothing but pain and I have no faith that it will get better. Iâ€™ve been on meds and seeing therapists for years. 
I know there are many people much worse off, but I just canâ€™t shake the feeling that thereâ€™s nothing left on earth for me. 
How does anyone keep going in a world where there so much pain and loneliness?
