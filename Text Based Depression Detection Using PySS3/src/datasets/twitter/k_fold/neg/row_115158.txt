My last cope was working outI tried working out so some girl would finally think I'm normal looking. I worked out so hard that I think I've torn something in my shoulder/back. Doctors have no clue what it is but it's painful.
It's not getting better either. It's over for me.

The one thing I liked, I can't do anymore. Fuck this life.

I have nothing else to do. I'm ugly, short, have zero friends. No women has ever liked me.

Worst of all, I have a garbage degree and will never find a good job.
