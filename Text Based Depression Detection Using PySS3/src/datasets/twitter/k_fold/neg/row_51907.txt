Why does no one care?I feel numb. I donâ€™t recognize the person looking back at me in the mirror anymore, everything I used to enjoy I donâ€™t anymore. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever been truly happy, growing up in an emotionally abusive home, being assaulted, not reaching any of my goals. Iâ€™m so angry lately, I lash out on everyone close to me, I donâ€™t mean to I just donâ€™t know how to handle myself. Every night Iâ€™m alone, I donâ€™t have any friends, and my family has made it pretty clear they donâ€™t care. Iâ€™ve been feeling like this for quite some time, made a plan to kill myself and before i did it I decided Iâ€™d try one more thing. I asked for help, yes thatâ€™s right. First I went to my mom, she told me I was being dramatic. I tried to go into detail, I poured my heart out to her. Sobbing, she told me that I was acting crazy and Iâ€™d never actually do it and to go to bed. The next day I decided to go to the er, they didnâ€™t help at all. They looked at me like I was a chore, and didnâ€™t seem to want to give any time to me (maybe because the pandemic) when I finally got back there, they told me everyone was feeling anxious right now and I should re evaluate my feelings. I told them no Iâ€™ve been feeling this way for a long time, also poured my heart out to them. The nurse response was â€œwel I can see if we can send you to a mental hospital if you wantâ€ really. Thanks. I donâ€™t get why Iâ€™m still trying, whatâ€™s the point? I donâ€™t have anyone who cares about me, and I donâ€™t have anyone I even care about myself anymore. Whatâ€™s the point of living like this?
