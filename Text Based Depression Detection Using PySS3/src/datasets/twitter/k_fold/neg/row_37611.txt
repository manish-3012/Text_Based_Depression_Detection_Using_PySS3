I am scaredI am actually scared of committing suicide, but it seems like the perfect exit. I regret opening my third eye, ever since I did. I know how ugly the world is, and I cannot live in it. Sometimes I wish I had a normal life. I dropped everything for a dream that I had, and that dream is dead now. and I will be dead soon too. I don't want you to tell me to not Kill my self. I am thinking of doing the door knob method as it seems less painful.
