I'm doneI just want to die... I'm a mess. I'm a fucking sex worker, bulimic, and I have no feelings anymore. It's bizarre, but I just don't feel. No happiness, nothing. I have no people who love me and I'm so fucking alone. I want to do it so badly, but I'm scared. I'll go to hell and be no more than a footnote. I'll be nothing. I'm scared of insignificance but I can't bear face my future.... I have no idea.
