Who else here just misses the wonderful past?I was alive at 1-13 years old, but now i'm 16 and been feeling dead for 3 years. And over those 3 years i finally found 1 possible solution called "psychedelics"
If i get caught ordering them online i will kill myself then, since i'm still going to prison for ordering LSD/Shrooms. I honestly don't mind! Either death or illegal medication. I don't understand why the government doesn't let people feel alive, while religion and alcohol rules America.

The past is like a natural high, were you can't feel bad at all. Now that the past is dead i am dead as well.

I really miss the past, and i believe once i die i will re-live this life all the time, until earth dies.
