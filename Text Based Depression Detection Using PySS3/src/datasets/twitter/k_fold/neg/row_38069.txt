I have nothing..My mom is dying and I don't...  I don't understand how she's this sick when she was fine before last friday... She won't even look at me anymore.

I can't even grieve properly because the hospice keeps acting like I'm the one in charge of my mother's estate and I'm not and I don't want to be and I don't have a job... I don't have anything, I can't even figure out how to pay the rent.  I have nothing.

what am I supposed to do? what's the goddamn point of anything? Everything I try to do, I fail at, I've gotten rejected for like 5 goddamn jobs, I'm not going to be able to pay bills, or rent, or anything, and I'll live out on the street and I just... what is the point... 

I can't do this, my dad died five years ago and I'm about to lose my mom... She's all I have in the world, and she's dying.  I feel like I just want to run away, or give up completely and end it all... I don't have anything...
