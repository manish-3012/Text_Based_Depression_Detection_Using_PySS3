Being sober sucksI'm trying to deal with alot of things at once and I'm also trying not to drink by choice but I'm too used to turning to the bottle and I had the one person I could talk to, she was everything to me but I fucked it up and now all I want to do is drink so I can at least sleep. Nightmares and dreams about her keep me up so I stay up drink water and coffee and watch Netflix. It's hard being sober because now when ever I think of anything I cut myself and I don't even have her to talk to. Ironically I don't want to talk really but she at least made me want to live but now I gotta find help because I promised.
