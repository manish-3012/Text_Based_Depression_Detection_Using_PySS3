I'm 26, and I'm scared I'm becoming suicidalFor the last year since my uncle passed away, I've felt like I've wanted to pass away as I don't feel like I deserve the love I get from family and friends, I spend most my time on the internet, as that is where I feel most comfortable, I don't think I want to kill myself, but I do want to die, I don't know if that makes sense, I am just confused and I feel like this life is not for me the last year.
