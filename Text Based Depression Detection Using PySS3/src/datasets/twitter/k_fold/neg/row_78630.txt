Just letting it outOkay, so I just want to write it out. It is okay if you donâ€™t want to read it (It is too long anyway). I just want to verify with myself that suicide is what I want.  I never done this sort of thing before, but I heard it helps. I donâ€™t plan on telling anyone. So I figure I might as well post it here. The best alternative, I guess.  Before I go on, I would like to apologize for my grammar. English is not my native language. So with that being said, letâ€™s start from the beginning. 

My childhood was okay. My dad was an asshole. So I donâ€™t even want to talk about him. Honestly, the only good memory I have of my childhood was with my grandma. To me, she was the best grandma I could have asked for. I remember she always wanted to go to her homeland in china. But due to her bad legs, she wasnâ€™t able to travel. When I was around 10 years old, my mom, my sister, and I left for America. We basically left my grandma. In the end, she didnâ€™t get to go to her homeland. She died 5 years after we left for America. The funny thing is I didnâ€™t even shed a tear. I donâ€™t really know why. I thought I loved her very much. I guess Iâ€™m just a terrible grandsonâ€¦

My life in America wasnâ€™t so bad. At least, my dad isnâ€™t here. Elementary school was fun. I made a few friends. At around 6th grade, my friends and I started to play a game call Runescape. That game wasted 3 years of my life. God, I hate that game. I introduced Runescape to my sister. She became addicted to it, and she never stops playing since. I am pretty sure I ruined her life with that game. Needless to say, my social life sucks. I never really have a girlfriend. Surprisingly, it doesnâ€™t really bother me as much as most people. I had about 3 close friends when I was in middle school. When high school started, my three close friends and I decided to start doing drug. It was nothing too dangerous though. One day, my friends managed to get a drug called DMT, a strong psychedelic. The day we did DMT was the day I realized that I wasnâ€™t afraid to die. While I was tripping on DMT, I felt like I was dying. I guess it was a bad trip or something. At one point, I thought I did die. I saw myself on the floor, lifeless. And I was okay with itâ€¦
A year later, one of my closest friends started to lose it. His girlfriend dumped him, and he became extremely depressed. He stopped hanging out with us. I knew he was drifting away from us, but I did nothing. I just pretend to not notice. I just didnâ€™t know what to say to him. Maybe thatâ€™s just an excuse I made up. I donâ€™t know. Maybe I just didnâ€™t care enough to help him. Eventually, he dropped out of high school. I did go to his house after that to try and talk to him. He didnâ€™t let me in though. So I stopped going. Eventually, I lost contact with the guy. As his closest friend, I didnâ€™t try hard enough for him. I guess I was a pretty terrible friendâ€¦

Before I knew it, it was time to apply for colleges. I didnâ€™t apply to any. It wasnâ€™t because I didnâ€™t want to. I was just too scared to do it. Throughout most of my life so far, I have been living day by day. I never thought of my future. So I didnâ€™t really know what major I want to go into, or which colleges I want to go to. I also have nothing to write in my personal statement, because I have done nothing. So in the end, I ended up in a community college. 
Ever since I started school, I always thought I was smart. It was the only thing I thought I was good at. My grades in school were always Aâ€™s, with an occasional Bâ€™s. But now that I am in a Community College, I realize I am not smart at all. I am in the process of failing two of my classes: Physics II and Calculus 3. Believe it or not, those classes really open my eyes.  Now I know that grades donâ€™t mean shits. Having a good grade doesnâ€™t mean you are smart. It just means that you are willing to do the works. To be honest, I always knew I wasnâ€™t smart. I just never wanted to admit it. I guess I was lying to myself in order to feel good about myself.

Sometime around my high school years, I started to think about how Iâ€™m going to end my life. I decided Iâ€™m going to do it when Iâ€™m 21 years old. And it is going to be on Oct. 13th.  I still havenâ€™t decided on how I am going to do it through, or where I am going to do it. Should I let people find my body, or should I do it at a place where people can never find me? Also, should I leave a note or something? All those questions are running through my head every day. Without realizing it, I have managed to drive away all of my friends. If you think about it, it isnâ€™t so bad since I am planning a suicide anyway. So now, I have 0 friends. In other word, the only people who will miss me when Iâ€™m gone are my sister and my mom. Now here is the problem. I donâ€™t want to do this to them. But, I canâ€™t take it anymore. Like most mothers, my mom wants my sister and me to have a bright future. She worked so hard to try and make that happen. Believe it or not, I only had only one goal in my life up until now. I just wanted to repay my mom for what she has done for me. But now I feel like I canâ€™t achieve that goal.  So every times I look at her, I feel guilty. I donâ€™t see myself having a bright future. And I hate to say this, but I donâ€™t see my sister having one either. In the end, it is my fault that my sister became like she is now. Undoubtedly, I am a terrible brother and an awful sonâ€¦

These past few months, my suicidal thoughts have become more frequent. Every time I get into my car, there is a feeling in the back of my mind of wanting to ram my car into a concrete wall or something. I feel like I am slowly going insane. There are different scenarios running inside my head almost every day. The thought of how I am going to do it, the thought of where I am going to do it, the thought of a fail suicide, and the thought of what will happen to my family when I am gone.  Most of those thoughts arenâ€™t scary for me. But there is one that terrifies me.  A few weeks ago, a thought came across my mind. It was a thought of killing myself along with my family so that they donâ€™t have to suffer pain of losing me; So that my mom wouldnâ€™t have to deal with the embarrassment of having a son that committed suicide; So that my sister wouldnâ€™t have to be a failure. But obviously, that is selfish and wrong in so many levels. The fact that a thought like that even crossed my mind proves that I am fucked up. A few more months left before I turn 20. Thus, I have about 1 years and a half left before Oct. 13th. I have to make my decision by July, 2017. That will leave me 3 months to plan if I do decide to take the easy way out.
