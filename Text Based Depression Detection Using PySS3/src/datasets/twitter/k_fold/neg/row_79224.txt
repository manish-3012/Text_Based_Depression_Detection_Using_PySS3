"Just talk to someone"I've tried talking to 3 separate people it today and I just flat out got ignored by them. 

"What's wrong?"
"Sometimes I just want die, I mean it's-" 
"Oh by the way, what did you have for lunch? I'm kinda hungry."

All three conversations ended in a minute. This is why I can't "just talk to someone". Because clearly, no one cares.
