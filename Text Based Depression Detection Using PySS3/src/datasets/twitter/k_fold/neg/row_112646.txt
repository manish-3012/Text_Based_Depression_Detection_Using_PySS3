Lost all reason to liveThe woman I have loved for the last 4 years has left me. I have no job, and no house. I'm living in her guest room, until May 1st, then I'm homeless and houseless.

Today she's finally gone on a date with another guy. She lied to me and told me she's just seeing her friend, but I saw her phone over her shoulder when she was making plans for the date.

She was the only thing my life had going for it. Now I'm homeless and jobless, with no foreseeable future. I'm only 19, but that doesn't mean things will get better. I dont have the resources to make it better.

I just want to die now. Nobody loves me, and the fact that this girl, who is the most loving and forgiving girl in the world, could stop loving me is proof of that. I don't have any reason to carry on, so why should I?

I only have 3 reasons I haven't killed myself yet.

1. I promised her that I won't.

2. I'm afraid I'll go to hell if I do.

3. I still get hopeful for us sometimes, but it's been proven several times that there really is no hope.

I just want to die.

I even know some ways I could do it either quickly or painlessly. I own a shotgun, or I could buy some helium and use a plastic bag to suffocate myself without feeling it.

Is there really any reason I shouldn't?
