Goodbye noteIâ€™ve been in this subreddit for quite a while and helped out as much as I could, but I have to leave now. Iâ€™ve recovered so much and scrolling through Reddit, reminding me of these awful times isnâ€™t helping me.

I wish everyone here the best of luck in your future endeavors and I love every single one of you.

Peace out :)
