My life is in shambleseverything has gone to crap, my life is shit. The outside world has been cruel to me, nothing but pain and suffering from family to school. I've tried creating a personality online different to that in real life so that I could start over but no I tried and failed I tried changing, there was one thing keeping me from killing myself and that was video games, I never had a good irl life so i sunk myself into video games and online friends but I just my steam account hacked and stolen EVERYTHING IS GONE! ALL I WORKED FOR IS GONE! VIDEO GAMES KEPT ME FROM DYING AND ITS ALL GONE! YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GO TO SCHOOL KNOWING THERE IS A BETTER SYSTEM OUT THERE?! YOU KNOW HOW PAINFUL IT IS WHEN YOUR FATHER TREATS YOU LIKE A 9 YEAR OLD KID 24/7?! I MADE FRIENDS ONLINE THAT I CARED FOR BUT THEY DESTROYED OUR FRIENDSHIPS JUST BECAUSE OF ONE SMALL THING!!! ALL THESE THINGS AROUND THE WORLD MAKE ME PISSED AND SAD! WHAT WILL A HUMAN BEING OUT OF THE 7 BILLION ON EARTH DO?! **NOTHING!!!**
