My friend won't even give me a hug reddit. Nobody loves meI saw her today, and we talked, and before we left, i wanted a hug, gave me a side hug, and i knew she didn't even want to hug me. She sighed, and said she's tired and just wanted to leave. I felt heart broken, and my eyes welled up. We were best of friends, and she doesn't want to give hug eve when I beg for one. I would've asked anybody if I had someone :(. Nobody wants me or loves me reddit. I can't stop crying and I can feel my heart beating erratic and hurting in my chest.
