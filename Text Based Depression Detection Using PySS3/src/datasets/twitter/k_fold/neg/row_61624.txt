Need to get it outThank you to the two people that responded to my last post. If I find myself needing to vent, I'll come here.

I'm visiting family. I'm paranoid, so I won't disclose where, but it's near the capital of a U.S. state. I went to community college here. I have good memories of being here. I met my first girlfriend when I lived here, even if she was a he.

Now it's been a whole year since I moved back to where I grew up. It's the western part of my state. I hate it there. It's depressing. There are no jobs, no opportunities. There's nothing to live for here. I went there solely to attend the cheapest college in the state, but I dropped out. College dropouts die out fast. My credit rating's already shot. There's no way I can go back to college. There's no money for me there.

I worry about living life poor. I've lived in a trailer park before. I'm not there now, but it's in the back of my head. I can't live like that. I think about killing myself to stop that from happening.

Being here feels good, but I feel like I can only visit. My mother tells it'll be ok. "We can move back." But I just can't see it. Idk what it is about me, but I can't see it. It feels like I'll be stuck in the boonies forever. My father died there. My brother likely will. I don't know how to cope with this.
