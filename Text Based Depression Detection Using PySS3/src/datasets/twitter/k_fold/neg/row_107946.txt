Suicide is the only option m14Iâ€™m in HS and thatâ€™s not the best but itâ€™s bearable for the most part. Other than my friends kinda getting revenge on me... I wasnâ€™t the best person in the fall semester. They bully me which Iâ€™d say is warranted because I was a dick to them. But at home itâ€™s worse, getting yelled at, yelled about, too many expectations. Itâ€™s just all too much. It may not seem like much but when itâ€™s been for 3 years straight it grows and grows. 

Ending it would be an easy fast fix
