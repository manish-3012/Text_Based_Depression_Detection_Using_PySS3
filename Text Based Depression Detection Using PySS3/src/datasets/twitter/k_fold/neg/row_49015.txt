Why canâ€™t I be happyI work out every day.  I am comfortable with my appearance these days.  I have friends.  No one would ever guess that I have these thoughts....  and I feel like Iâ€™m going to push people away if I express them.  I was suicidal for many years and 
now itâ€™s back with force.  I am a hooker and I donâ€™t have any money right now but hopefully I can get some soon.  The guy Iâ€™m seeing probably wonâ€™t be too happy to find out that Iâ€™m getting money by sucking dick.  I have a college degree, I want to be an actor, I like all sorts of intellectual subjects.  I donâ€™t know how I got here.  Iâ€™m living in a dingy old building and I live in a very small space.  No heating and no cooling.  Share a bathroom w 6 people.  
Im pretty sure Iâ€™m headed for a really horrible future.  My life was pretty bad going into covid.  I got sober when quarantine started and then had a psychotic/quasi-spiritual experience which felt like the happiest I ever was.  Then I was so depressed.  Iâ€™ve been so depressed most my life but the depression following the pink cloud of my early recovery from alcoholism and addiction has been so bad that I feel debilitated.  Iâ€™m so poor and all I have are the things Iâ€™ve got stored in my little shoebox of a living arrangement.
I want to die so badly.  Every day feels like it just drifts by. I feel so stuck,  my life is really a mess.  And my past feels like it makes moving forward hard.  Been in two car accidents, been raped several times, been homeless before, the drug addiction was bad, I canâ€™t hold friendships for some reason... I go to my recovery meetings and Iâ€™ve been sober for almost 8 months but my life is still as much of a mess as it was when I was drinking.  Iâ€™m still a hooker.  Still living in a cheap old dump.  Still hopeless.  Depressed.  Stuck.
