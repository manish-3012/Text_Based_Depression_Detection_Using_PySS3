Worked up the energy to kill myself. That energy was all it took to bring me out of depression.I one moment said "What the fuck is the point in life?"

Then I said that's it. I said 100% energy mode. If 100% energy doesn't get me fucking rich or famous, i'll use that energy to off myself. Either way its time to go in to fucking overdrive

I was chosing to sit in bed in my feelings all day. That was a CHOICE. Whether or not free will exists, or it was my dopamine receptors deciding enough was enough, I said fuck that noise.
