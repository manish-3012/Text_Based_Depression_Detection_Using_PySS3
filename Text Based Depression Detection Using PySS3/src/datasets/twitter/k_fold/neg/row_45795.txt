I want to overdose so badlyBut im just too much of a pussy to do it. I've had this bathroom cup full of pills hidden in my room for a month now, and every damn day I think to myself "this is the day," and then I'll get home and I'll be too scared to do it, so I just resort to cutting myself and laying in bed. I don't even want to be alive to see graduation, and nobody would even care if I died. I'm not popular, I don't have a big social group, I mostly just fade into the background, like one of those people who you might've known was there, but didn't really matter much to anybody. If I died, it wouldn't be an issue for anybody, and yet im still to fucking scared to do it. I have absolutely nothing to live for, I have no hopes for my future, nor do I care about my future, and nobody cares about me, yet im still having issues with going through with it. Maybe im just scared of the pain, I don't know. One day I know I'll be able to, it'll just take time....
