Short &amp; maleI am alone 5'6'' guy.  I am just tired of this life. I have a need for strong feeling. No woman even want to look at me (except short height imho I am not that ugly tho) not mentioning any desire to even talk. Work, university, neighbours from block of flats, no single women from there wanted to go out with me. Brutal rejections. I can't stand anymore being treated by them worse than dogs. It's painful experience walking sidewalk in the summer as I see many of happy couples. Don't get me wrong. I am not angry at them. It's pure jealusy of their NORMALL lives. Being short as male is horribly painful. Maybe I am not giving up yet but I am really close to my last day. Pain is just slowly taking controll over my actions. Word is cruel except to people born with fortunate genes.

Sorry for long emotional post had to write it somewhere. My friends were tired of listening to the same story every time we go out.
