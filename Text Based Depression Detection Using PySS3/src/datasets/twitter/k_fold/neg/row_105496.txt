My heart is not in it.I had a normal childhood. My father was an agresive alcoholic that used to beat the shit out of my and once my mom kicked him out the house became a rare mix of neurotic and completely careless of how I felt about anything, being actually told things like "we don't talk abouy feelings, everything's fine, there's nothing to talk about". I had a small sister I had to take care of who had adhd and literally hated me for not being her real father. So growing up with the notion that feelings were a wrong thing to externalise and it doesn't matter what you do all stays the same was great, specially for i was the weird kid, I never liked football or pop music, I liked older music and reading and that kinda stuff I wasn't popular nor normal. Maybe if I had other background I would have been able to have relationships with other kids without sharing 100% of my preferences and attitudes. But as long as everything I had that felt with was my opinions (and you are not actually supposed to share that anyway) I had the worst time trying to even talk to others until surprisingly I've developed some sort of psychopath social skills and even I was able to fit and to fake anything needed to in order to be surrounded with people even though I thought they were nothing near of people I liked. So at some point I grew tired of doing so and just started hanging out with myself exclusively. I left home at 17 and been working ever since. I have been wanting to die since I was 12 or something. I'm 25 now. I am not able to have real relationship and on the other hand I don't want them because I know by experience they ain't fulfilling and that I'll never find anyone to trust and to actually share interests with. (Ive been with girls, I've had friends for some periods, I actually have been quite social and outgoing, but my hearts just not in it). I had a gf who was my soul mate but due to my depression and her depression it ended and now we ain't even talking just to let the other rest. I been working on a variety of things, spending time with a variety of people, traveling, volunteering. I've learnt languages, botany, playing music. I enjoy things such as cinema, music, nature, going to the beach. Is just that all those things ain't worth living. I cannot be just living by the beach in an eternal summer of doing nothing but what I like (which is being alone, cooking and reading). Existence is a prison. I already live by the beach so I've been thinking about killing myself already and at least getting some peace.
