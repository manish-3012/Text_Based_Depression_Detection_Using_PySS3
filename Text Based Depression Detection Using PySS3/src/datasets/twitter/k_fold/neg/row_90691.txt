I constantly think about suicide but I don't want to hurt my boyfriend/familyEver since I moved to the U.S it has been a nightmare. It has been 3 years since I got here, my dream was to get a PhD in some sort of biology. Being here feels like I'm a second class citizen. I had to give up my family, my culture, my home, to come here "for a better life" but in reality my life is more fucked now than it was in my home country. School is ridiculously expensive and I don't qualify for any type of aid or scholarships, I am currently holding on to the only free class I could find to hold my spot in the school. I have no health insurance so therapy is out of the picture, I have talked to my school's counseling center and they won't take me in, the other counseling center I contacted completely ignored me. Other major life events have happened but I don't want to make this post too long, school is the main thing that has me depressed. 

 I attempted suicide a few months ago but I chickened out and called my boyfriend in the middle of it. He supports me in everything I do but I know whenever I express my desire for dying he hurts a little bit. We moved in together in the middle of the year and I don't know what we would do with the lease if I died, I don't want to place that burden on him. I also have my mom and my little sister here and I feel like I'm responsible for them, I read stories about people losing their siblings/daughters to suicide and I just can't put them through that. I got to the point where I just want to be a vegetable, not do anything ever again and just get dragged by life, or simply die of some mysterious illness or something like that so it's not that hard on my family.
