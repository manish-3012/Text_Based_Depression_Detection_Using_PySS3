Every moment of my life is miserable for me.I am a male in his 20s still living with his parents. I wake up, go to my bedroom and leave only when I go to the bathroom, bathe or eat. I then go to bed and have very weird dreams that make me feel terrible in the morning. I sometimes even have nightmares that wake me up. This cycle has been going on for a couple of years.

My problems are really deep and I don't think they are fixable. I have been on countless medications that don't help my self esteem nor my depression. I don't have interests in life so I don't know what do to in life. I had to quit my job working for dad in construction because of misophonia. Any job working with people seems to be off the table because of the misophonia(mouth noises such as gum chewing makes me go berzerk) and I suck with dealing with people because of my social anxiety and awkwardness with people I don't feel comfortable with. 

The only logical solution will be to end it. I will never be anybody because of the dumb, weird lunatic I am. I already know of a painless way to kill myself. I just hope when I die my consciousness ends because I do not want to be stuck with these miserable thoughts anymore.
