I need advice and helpI donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m going to make it through the night.  I think Iâ€™m going to try to hang myself, or stabbing myself in the neck.  I think Iâ€™m at the point where I could take a knife to my pulse and just do it.  Iâ€™m not doing it at home, I donâ€™t want my little siblings to be traumatised by the sight and the smell of a dead body, I donâ€™t want them to see me there lifeless.  

Is there any point trying to talk to any of my friends?  Is there any chance trying to talk to my boyfriend about this?  Iâ€™m scared heâ€™ll leave me if he finds out.  I think heâ€™s already mad at me for letting a friend sleep over when they were homeless.  He hasnâ€™t talked to me in five days.  I canâ€™t handle the additional stress, but I donâ€™t want him to blame himself or hold himself responsible for my emotions.  I donâ€™t know, is there any point leaving some sort of note?   Would you prefer one if someone you loved committed suicide?
