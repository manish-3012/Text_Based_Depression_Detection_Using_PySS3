My inner peace got murdered. Again.I found a little bit of my peace again and thought I could make it till my therapy starts and I'm hopefully in safe hands then. But this morning I found out about a 4 year old YouTube channel of mine with videos of me (MY FACE, MY VOICE , MY LOCATION). I was doing dumb shit, totally not funny. I read the comments and argued with people that called me names like cunt etc (ofc everything 4 years ago). But they were anonymous and I called them names with all my infos. It only has 3k views. Luckily. The problem is i dont know the email or password so I can never delete this. I'm starting to panic, I dont even want to go any more in Details whatelse I've done that time. I was an absolute Idiot, and also kind of an asshole tbh for getting angry that easy at people calling me names. I feel sick to my stomach rn. What if this catches up with me one day. I feel help/hopeless atm. The people that threatend me are 4 years older now as well but fuck what person was I. If you see that you would never believe that that Person is me, I changed grew up. I just want to press reset button. Everyday I discover new bullshit from my past. It adds up and up and up, hope I can accept my life is fucked one day and stop suffocating. Everything is alright isnt it nobody will kill me? My brain has fun torturing me with this making things 100x worse then they actually are. I hope this all gets forgetten, buried under tons of new vids uploaded to yt ervryday. I'm writing in this sub because in the past the best help came from here
