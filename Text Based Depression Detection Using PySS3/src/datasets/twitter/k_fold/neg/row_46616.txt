It never gets betterI have already failed in hanging myself once, I have had many chances after that to try again but I haven't in hopes that maybe things do get better. They don't, I have spiraled farther into depression then I already was and recently on my 15th birthday all I did was mope around the house and study. This may sound stupid considering how young I am and my problems probably don't even compare to the rest of the people on this subreddit. I am a 15 year - old male freshmen and I can't pull my grades up for the life of me. I am basically going to be kicked out of my magnet program due to my shit grades and the chances of me going to summer school are high too. I can't get a girlfriend for the life of me and I am cursed with the fact that every girl I like are either in a relationship or don't like me in general as all my friends somehow magically get into perfect relationships. It seems that I can't ever do anything right and     the way its looking it will get far worse from here. When I tell my close friends my problems I always get the "it will get better" and I get my hopes up only for them to be smashed to the ground. I can't even turn to my parents for help because my dad is abusive and my mom is bipolar. If my life just keeps spiraling downward like this I may as well end it to prevent any further disasters that await me.
