I made a post talking about almost killing myself a couple nights ago and it just got downvotedMakes me feel great. Everything was in line for me to kill myself and I went to do it but survival instinct kicked in. I had no revelation that I wanted to live suddenly like you hear about, I still feel the same if not worse.


Post just got downvoted though and I got a rude comment. Makes you feel great when you tell that you almost died and people fight back about it
