EMOTIONAL NUMBNESSHi, i just want to ask is anyone here who has or had emotional numbness? Since my spine injury i can't feel shit, i don't vibe with people at all, i don't enjoy music or food anymore, even videogames and movies. I freezed my year at college because of depression that came with this and i don't see myself ever becoming a normal person again, i just want to end it all.
