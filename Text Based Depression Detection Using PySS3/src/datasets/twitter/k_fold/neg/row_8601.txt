MehI didnt ask to be born. I didnt ask to have a life. Why do i have to suffer it. I dont want to work but im being forced to work. I dont like my job. I always am nevous of my phone incase they call and i never pick up. I am always nervous they will give me shit for not picking up next time im in. I hate how the secudel changes almost daily with no notice ever. I am scared everyday i am at home because i have to walk on eggshells around my dad. My girlfriend of 3 almost 4 years is just about done with me and we are on the verg of breaking up. My counselor loves to play phone tag with me and we are unable to ever find a meeting time that ever works. I jusf want to be happy is that so kuch to ask? I just want it to end
