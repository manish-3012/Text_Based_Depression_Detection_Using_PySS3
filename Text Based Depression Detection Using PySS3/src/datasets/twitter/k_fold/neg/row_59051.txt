I'm just tiredNot too sure were to start. I'm 18, from a middle class family, got into college with some decent scholarships. I just can't be happy, every day I feel a little bit worse. I had planned on killing myself back in the beginning of May. A friend found out and word got around to my parents. 
I've been to several doctors, therapists, and psychologists since then. The general consensus from the therapists is that there isn't any underlying, non-chemical reason why I should be depressed. I've had three different medicines, Zoloft, Lexapro and, latest Wellbutrin - nothing has helped at all. The Lexapro actually caused me to have a episodes of serotonin syndrome. It seems like my body is physically resisting me being happy. All I can do is distract myself for a while at a time. Reading a book or playing some games will hold my attention for a while, but then everything just slams back down worse than it was before.
The only reason I'm still around is because I don't want to hurt my family and the very few friends I have. But even that is losing its hold. Everyday it is harder and harder to stick around, just to be around to suffer though the next day.
