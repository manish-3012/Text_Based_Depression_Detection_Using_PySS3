Happy People, Dont Give Advice. Me. 2020I wish I could Die,
Become nothing.
Hang from a rusty rope.
Overdose,
Make the pain end.
Poison myself with soap.

Lose, win,
Whatever you think.
All of you, from before
The brink.

An easy way out,
Those people would
Say.
Those who make us want
To die.
Get to live and smile
 another day.
