Drunk and suicidalI'm an eighteen year old alcoholic who can't stop drinking to have fun. Or make friends. Or function. I have tons of friends- they only know me when I'm drunk. I am lovable and popular like that


My grades are shit. I don't go to class anymore because I'm puking my guts out. I barely take care of myself anymore. I'm a party girl to the extreme- I have started to use hard drugs. College has destroyed me and I feel like I'm fucked forever my future is gone.

I babe had depression my whole life and this is just convincing me to do it. I was so excited to start college- 8?3 already ducked and made myself the drunken party girl.
