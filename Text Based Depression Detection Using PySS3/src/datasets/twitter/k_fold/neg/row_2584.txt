End in sight, present in mindI won't list much about me, but I'm curious if I might find any others who feel the way I do. 

I was brought up with an abusive addict of a father, and over the two decades that I lived under his roof, I endured more restless nights and beatings than I can ever recall. Scars on my flesh, plagues on my mind. School was easier, but not all that much better. Up until the last couple years of my life, I was the target everyone used; then went back home to get more for being the pacifist I was. I've been cheated on, assaulted, kicked out, injured and discarded by the people I held in my life. And between depression and god knows what other mental issues I have, I've tried to make something of my life to no avail. Off hand, I'd say I've attempted suicide at least forty times, which is sad since on one hand, I tried; on the other, I failed.

My life has gotten a little better in the last couple years. I found a girlfriend, I've gotten employed and graduated after years of dropping out, but I know; deep down in my mind, I know I'll try to take my life again one day - and I'll keep going until I succeed. It could be a breakup, a tragedy, a massive impact in my life. I'm suicidal, and I've come to terms with it as have my friends and close ones. I don't want to be, I want to be happy, I want to be able to enjoy this life. But I can't, and no matter how hard I try, I can never cling to it. 

Its like I'm on borrowed time, and I'm my own timekeeper.
