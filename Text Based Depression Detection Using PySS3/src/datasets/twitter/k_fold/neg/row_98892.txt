Time for a change.So I deleted all my old posts about self harm, suicide plans. After a recent failed attempt and a bunch of other stuff that I don't wanna go into I've decided I'm going to to make a real strong effort to get better.

I know it will take some time and to chance a self harm habit won't be easy but I've done it before.

I've an appointment with me doctor books and therapy planned. It's gonna be rough but this is the first time I really wanted to give it a go.

Actually seeing a friend might need help pushed it. I'm afraid if something I did would have a ripple effect onto them and that's not what I want. 

Hopefully it works out.
