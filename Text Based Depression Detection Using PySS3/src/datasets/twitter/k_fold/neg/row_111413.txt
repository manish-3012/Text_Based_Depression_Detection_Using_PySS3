I don't know how much "stronger" I can be.I just wake up everyday trying for everyone but myself and it feels pointless.

I only wake up for my boyfriend and he isn't even talking to me right now, not even because we fought or I did something. I don't know if he just wants to be alone or something. I asked him and he said "idk," in one of the few messages I've gotten from him.

I just really wanna die. I miss him. What if it stays like this?

If I kill myself it'll just make him sadder but it feels like he doesn't care right now.
