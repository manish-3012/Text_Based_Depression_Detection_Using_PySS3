StrugglingI have been struggling with thoughts of suicide for 3 decades.  When I was young people told me to keep a journal and exercise my athletic and musical abilities.  I went to a great private school in New England, graduation with honors the only way possible (spent 1.5 years writing an original thesis that hadn't been written before).  During that last half a year my mother got cancer.  After she was cancer free many months later, I moved to Asia and taught and went to grad school.  I guess I took some time away from reality.  I needed it.  

I went back to the states, got a job, had a boyfriend, married him, got close to his family and mine.  Of course there are rifts in the families.  What family doesn't have them?  But every few months, no matter how happy I seem and no matter how faithful I am in taking my meds, something seems to snap.  Yes, I talk to my Dr.  It's just a thing.

I realized tonight that even with some money coming my way I just don't give a shit and right now really would be fine with dying.  Sucks
