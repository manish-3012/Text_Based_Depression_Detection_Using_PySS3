Let them know.I'll be dead before this post is tracked and don't do that to me. 

I begged the two people I love most to respond and they didn't. 

My boyfriend stole my money and I had big opportunities but it's too much. He won't answer his phone. I can't pay my bar tab. I have no way home. My mom won't answer. 

My life is over. Just let them know what they did was FUCKED UP. YOU DON'T DO THIS SHIT TO PEOPLE.
