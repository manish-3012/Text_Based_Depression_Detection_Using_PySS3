been getting help for months, its not doing anythingim still worthless and insufferable i still make folks feel worse and im still socially emotionally and mentally retarded

i still dont do shit through my days except desperately try to drag others down with me or drinking and smoking to kill time to get to nothing faster

ive started getting laughed at and insulted by folks on the street more than usual

my job pretty much permanently puts me on dishwashing duty because im too shit at anything else

i failed last year of school and the backup plan

and the backup plan for that

im sorry
not that apologising is worth jack shit if you never change anyway

im sorry
