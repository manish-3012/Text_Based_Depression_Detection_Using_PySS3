Normal in the outside, train wreck in the inside.I don't really feel like posting anything since I feel like its bothersome and no one cares anyway but I kind of wanted to vent out even if no one really cares.   


People would say I should be even grateful about being lucky, having a wonderful family, being an honor student throughout my high school days, yes I am grateful. I do. People around me would always say I've got the best life, they envy, they're jealous but I would always reply that its not as great as you think it is. Why? People may look like I'm normal in the outside but they don't know me, they don't know who I am. A person with anxiety, depression, paranoia, insecurity and more. The moment I became a uni student, it all really changed. I changed. Even my trust change. The first girl I ever opened my heart to, left me without even a single explanation which caused me to be traumatized, my grades went horribly down and my scholarship is in danger, I'm the eldest in the family with only a little brother with ADHD to take care in the future, they are pressuring me to finish my studies to support them when even I myself don't even know what I'm doing anymore, I also have a brother who scribbled my bed room wall with "I HATE YOU" i didn't retaliate of course, also my father's health is declining which is making me even more pressured to keep up with their expectations, my social skills is so bad due to having overprotective parents, when I tried to change and go for a part-time job they declined, It's Christmas vacation and I was trying to change myself, but I just can't, for the past week I've just been playing games 12-17 hours a day, its sad. I wanna change but I can't, I tried to change, but I can't keep up. is this the end for me? please I need help. someone.
