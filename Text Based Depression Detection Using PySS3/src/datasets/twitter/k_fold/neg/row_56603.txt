It feels like Iâ€™m fighting myselfEverything is falling apart and I donâ€™t want to feel the pain anymore. But a part of me doesnâ€™t wanna submit to suicidal thoughts. I feel trapped. Like if I make one more wrong move I wonâ€™t be able to fight it anymore. I just want to be happy. It shouldnâ€™t be this hard to be positive and choose to feel happiness instead of all the negative shit I allow to overwhelm me constantly.
