Life seems meaningless. How do people deal with life?I can't see a future for myself. I'm young, but the thought of being alive for even 10 more years seems like such work. I have no goals and I don't find enjoyment in anything. I have tried so many medications and nothing seems to help. I just feel so broken and abnormal compared to everyone else who wants to do things in their life. I feel like I'm destined to kill myself, and if it wasn't for the pain I'd cause my family, I would've done it already. Does anyone else feel the same way? How can I deal with this?
