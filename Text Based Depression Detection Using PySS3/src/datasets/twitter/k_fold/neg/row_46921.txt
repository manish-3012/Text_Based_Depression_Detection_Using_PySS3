I tried, i really did.I have struggled with suicide for a couple months now. I always thought to myself, maybe killing myself is the best option, but i never that the balls to do it. The thought of waking up everyday was toxic to me, every night i would silently hope that i would die a painless death and never wake up. I have been a "christian" my whole life. I always looked down on those who committed suicide because i thought it was scientifically "stupid". Its funny thinking about that now, im suffering my punishment now. I always wondered why suicide was a sin, why i would go to hell if i committed suicide, and why i was fucking born in this world. I didnt ask to be born, i didnt ask for this life, my struggles, my insecurities, my thoughts, my race, yet i would go to hell for declining what i would receive. I went for help, everyone would say they cared, that they want to help. Every single one of them never fell through, i was crying out for help but no one came. I never liked the people who posted about their depression and suicidal thoughts, i always thought that they just wanted attention. I asked many personal friends for help. All ended with the same outcome, nothing. I always tried to live a life of helping others and being positive, but why does my life want to murder me after i've already died? I feel used everyday im tired of helping others and being abandoned shortly after. I prayed every night for help, searched for help, but nothing. My life is in shambles and my hopes and dreams have all turned into a painless death.
