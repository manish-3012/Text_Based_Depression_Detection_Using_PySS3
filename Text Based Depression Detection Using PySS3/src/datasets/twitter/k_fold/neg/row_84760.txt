I have no choice. I have to end it all.There is nothing I can do to feel better. Nothing anyone could do. My only choice is not to be. To be is not a viable option any longer. I am a voice crying out helplessly amongst thousands of others, hoping to be heard...but mine is peculiarly silent...I can't help but to look at all this going on around me with a stark thousand yard stare...it's all so futile and yet so many of us have no other option but to engage in this futile gesture...


In my eyes, I was a person with thoughts, hopes, feelings, and dreams. In the eyes of everyone else, I am nothing. I have been rejected by everyone throughout my life. So I reject everyone else in turn. I have no place amongst society, amongst everyone else. They've made this very clear to me. And the damn thing is, if they would've let me, I would gone into the woods, completely ostracized like I am. But there are so many laws against this. They won't let me. I have no choice but to live in this world that I don't belong to. I have to work at a job I hate with coworkers I hate while living with roommates I hate. I look forward to the day I die. It's the only way I can be free from this species that I was mistakenly born into. I think mankind is a particularly sick, demented creature, that most other animals regard as a monster that they have nightmares about. I don't have anything in common with anyone else. They don't like me and I don't like them. They won't leave me alone, though, they won't let me escape into my own world. So I very much wish to cease to exist altogether. I don't know what other choice I have in this matter. I don't know how else I can be free from everyone else.
