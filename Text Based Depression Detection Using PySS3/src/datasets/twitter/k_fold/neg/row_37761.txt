I don't know what to do.My family has been going through a rough time. In a span of three months, both of my grandfathers passed away, and as a result of that, my mother took herself and my two siblings to our home country. Of course, it was a mutual decision, leaving myself and my father behind. We thought that they would be back in a month or two. Unfortunately, they were gone for half the year, arriving back in May of 2016. Those five months were the hardest of my life. 

I thought everything was back to normal. Our family was together again. We were happy. For a short period of time. My mother and father argued constantly for the rest of 2016, with a few "honeymoon" periods in between. I didn't understand. If they were still sleeping together, why did they have head-to-head screaming matches? Things only got worse when my grandmother from my father's side came to visit. My mother is not a fan of my father's side of the family, and naturally, she was cold to my grandmother. I didn't care, it was your classic in-law feud. 

Everything started to go downhill from there. My mother tells me of past affairs of my father has had, my father tells me of my mother chatting with some man over Facebook. I don't know who to trust. I've seen countless suicide attempts from my parents, although no one is willing to finish it off. I haven't told anyone of our family's dilemma, besides you, Reddit. Now I'm having dark thoughts. I've thought of attempting suicide, but I'm scared. Every night, when they have their bouts, I imagine myself going down there and driving a knife through my chest, just to shut them up. The only thing that's stopping me are my two siblings. If I left this world, I would leave them with two parents who only seem to yell. Don't get me wrong, I love my mother and father, but they've given me a choice. Live with dad, or live with mom. And *I* can't live with that. I don't want to be apart from my siblings anymore. I don't know what to do.
