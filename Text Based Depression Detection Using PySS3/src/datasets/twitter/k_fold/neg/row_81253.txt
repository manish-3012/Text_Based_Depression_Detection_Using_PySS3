Not at riskI thought I was making progress. Since my suicide attempt two years ago my 14 years of depression came to light and I started getting help. I've moved across the province, rekindled old friendships, got a much better job, saved enough money to try to go back to college, left my extremely toxic relationship and started a new beautiful one.
Last weekend I made plans to go on a trip, and while I was working out the budget I realized that I didn't care how much it cost because in the long run I was still going to fail at everything and end up killing myself sometime in the next two to five years.
I hate it. I hate feeling like the hope I fought so hard for can be extinguished for days by a passing thought. I hate that instead of feeling like something's wrong and needs fixing I feel like I have returned to reason. I hate that hate is the only thing I can hold on to that makes me want to change on my bad days. 
I wrote this mostly for me to order words on a page, just reading it is helpful. 
I love you, thank you.
