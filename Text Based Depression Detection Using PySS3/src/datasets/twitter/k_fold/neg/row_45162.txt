I can't believe I feel like this again.I had felt suicidal for a long time during my teens due to my parents custody battle and that my mom eventually went to jail for only six months with time served when she killed my infant brother. Yeah, I still can't believe it either.

Fast forward about 10 years later and shit is good. Shit is cash money, even. I know, high praise. I have a nice apartment, nice girlfriend, pets and we have a baby on the way. He's born and he is incredible.

I lose my job due to downsizing and she says why don't we move back to the state where most of our family is?

After last week where she takes my child from me randomly, kidnaps him but the police won't do anything and files for custody and child support 7 hours away after... man. I'm gonna go through almost exactly what my dad did.

I think suicide isn't all that bad. My words will pass or maybe not even be read. They'll be glossed by and everything will just continue as it should. 

I evidently missed my child's first steps today from what my mutual friends have told me. She was posting them on Facebook and hadn't decided to tell me.

The only reason I'd consider not killing myself is my son and my cat but if the courts are going to side with the mom anyways, why prolong it? Who even knows if my cat likes me, lmao.

Life is fucking awesome sometimes and I can see the beauty in it but maybe it just isn't for me. I won't be missed. He won't remember me. I did however have some great times and it's weird, I have this peaceful kind of aura that feels like its washed over me the last few days. I think I've come to terms with my luck &amp; that everything will be ok when I am gone.
