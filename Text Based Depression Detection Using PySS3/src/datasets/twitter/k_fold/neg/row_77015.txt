Lonely and hopelessI'm thinking of ending my life in the next couple of days because everything just feels so hopeless. I've been suicidal for years if not decades. Now at 31 I'm just tired of cycling between feeling okay and being desperately depressed. I fucked up and missed an important deadline which has basically set my life back a full year and put my relationship in jeopardy. I can't deal with this sadness and disappointment on top of my normal depression. 

I don't want to kill myself but I do want to die. Help me.
