Lost myself Since my second year of college I lost who I was and my close friends after my best friend betrayed his girlfriend with me and said to everyone it was my fault and that I was a manipulative person. I held back for months while he kept saying that he couldâ€™t stop his feelings.
Ever since, I only met guys that got me drunk to take advantage of me. This Christmas I fought with my family, I have a bad cold and made my little cousin cry :( . I feel really bad and wonâ€™t stand the stares from my relatives from now on.
