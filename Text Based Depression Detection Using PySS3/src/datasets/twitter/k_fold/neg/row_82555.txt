Life is meaningless and I no longer care.I just no longer care. I had a shit childhood and my mother was an abusive alcoholic and my father was neglectful. Iâ€™ve had depression and ADHD since I was young and Iâ€™m tired of trying a shit ton of medication that has never worked. 

Iâ€™ve completely destroyed my body in a period of 3 years mostly caused by medications. Antidepressants and a antipsychotic have led to massive weight gain the development of gynecomastia. The only way to fix gynecomastia is through surgery which I cannot afford. 

Iâ€™ve had failed attempts at the university which has led to a bunch of debt in which they refuse to right off. I dropped in the second week due to depression and they want to charge $3000 for two weeks. I finally had one successful year at the university and I have $13,000 in debt from my first year. 

Without a college degree or a type of skilled trade training I cannot get a good job. I refuse to work for slave wages of $7.25 an hour and attempt to live of $1100 a month for full time work a month. Due to my ADHD I have a hard time managing fine and staying focused which has resulted in unstable employment in which I canâ€™t even list for work experience as Iâ€™ll get no good reference. 

I never asked for this life and I have to come to the conclusion our lives are meaningless. We attempt to just fine temporary fulfillment in material wealth or in the opposite sex. None of us asked for this existence and we were born as a result of our parents sexual urges and their emotional desires. 

Simply put Iâ€™d rather kill myself than continue to attempt to find temporary pleasures and exist for the 60-70 years till I die and fade into nothing. Might as well do myself in and that way I control my own fate.
