Everyone is better then me at everythingLiterally everything, Im always the worst at everything, from things like video games to school,  Im always the dumbest, the weakest, the least athletic, the worst aim etc. I know that "there will always be some one who is better than you at anything" but im always the WORST. There's no point in keeping me alive.
