I'm tired of hiding everything.Hi. So sorry we had to meet on these circumstances, but here we are. As with most others here, I'm just done with everything. My family is a little screwed up. I'm an only child, so I've been alone my entire life. I never felt close to either of my parents because I'm adopted. My mother disapproves everything I do. She wants me to be this girly girl that has a job in the medical field, but all I am is this tomboy gamer that wants to persue a career in music. My father is cheating on my mother. She has no idea and my father has no idea I know. It's not a misunderstanding because I have proof. My cousin molested me at a young age, and I can't tell anyone because it would tear my mother and her sister apart. My mothers sister is going through a divorce with her alchaholic husband, so she needs all the support she can get. My other aunt is also going through a divorce with her own alchaholic husband. My uncle is already divorced from his cheating x-wife. All of my friends left me for no reason, and the only person I have right now is my boyfriend. When my friends first left me, I started self harming. My boyfriend had no idea, and still has no idea that I do it. He's lovely and supporting of everything I do, but I'm afraid that if he knew this part of me, he'd leave me. I feel like I'm in a rut and the only way to get out is to kill myself. Nothing is going right and it never has. I don't want to tell my mother about her situation or tell my father that I know. I don't want to ruin things between my boyfriend and I. I'm actually stuck in something without a way out. I never thought it was possible, but here I am. If anyone has any advice for my little situation, I'd appriciate it. Thanks.
