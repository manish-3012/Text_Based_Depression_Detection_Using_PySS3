i need to kill myself asapthe longer iâ€™m here the longer iâ€™m wasting my families money and resources. i donâ€™t need to be alive at all. i wish the 21 years iâ€™ve been alive had been given to someone else. i realize that iâ€™m wasting my parents money even more with doctors appointments and things i need to stay alive and not be in pain and shit but for what?? cause iâ€™m miserable and wanna die anyway so might as well save them money. my ex claims itâ€™s expensive for funerals and shit well staying alive is expensive for them too. so i just gotta die honestly. iâ€™m planning it now so itâ€™ll be soon. i feel happier knowing this will all be ending and i wonâ€™t hav to be here much longer
