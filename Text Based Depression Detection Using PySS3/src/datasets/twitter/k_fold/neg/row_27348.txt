Iâ€™m so tired.I wanted to write a big, long post to get it all out of my system, but I just canâ€™t. I delete everything I write. Whatâ€™s the point of writing paragraphs when itâ€™s as simple as: â€œI donâ€™t want to be here anymore.â€ I donâ€™t need to explain why. It doesnâ€™t matter. Nothing matters anymore.
