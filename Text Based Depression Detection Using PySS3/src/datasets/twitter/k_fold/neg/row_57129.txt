(21F) what do you do when you have no milestones left to live forthe only thing keeping me going was a big show i was in in april

i finished that, i thought the next thing to keep me going was graduation from college in may

i just graduated. i have no job, no prospects, no hope, no SO, nothing. what do i have to keep going for

if i don't get committed to a hospital i think i might be dead soon
