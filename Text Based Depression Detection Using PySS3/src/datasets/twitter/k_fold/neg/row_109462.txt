I wish I was euthanized at birthIâ€™m only either an obstacle or a ghost to other people. I have zero friends, life at home is numb as hell, I have extreme social anxiety so I make myself look stupid in public, I have never been hugged, kissed, or loved. My parents see me as an obstacle, which I am. Every time I try to make a friend they just cringe at my existence. I have had a girl I liked, I have never had the same feelings for her for anyone else. She of course, didnâ€™t like me back, in fact, she also cringed at my existence. I cringe at MY existence. I should have never been born, and here I am typing this as if it would make a difference in anything. My life is not going anywhere. I have no one, and there is nothing I care for. All of this shit goes on every day, so whatâ€™s the point? Wtf am I living for? The only reason I havenâ€™t ended it then was because I was afraid of the pain that comes with death, but Iâ€™m not afraid anymore. I want to take a belt and hang myself, or OD on sleeping pills. No one can do anything but read this and comment, if they read at all. Tonight just might be the night I finally end it all.
