I guess I'll do one too.Hi, new to the sub. I'm not really on "the verge" of killing myself, but I haven't got many reasons not to. I'm 19 btw. In college. I had a good childhood by most of your standards, I mean my parents seperated but both love me very much. I also don't have any financial issues and I'm not ugly to the point of people making fun of me for it, though I could lose some weight. 

So, all seems good right? Well, I just feel like pain, and suffering, are guarantees, and happiness is just a phase (like the song). When I was younger, I always dreamed of exploring new lands and finding new life, that was my passion. I'd love to go to the Amazon or something similar some day just to explore some areas. But I feel like I was born at the worst possible time for me. I want to explore, but was born at a time too late to explore new lands, and too early to explore the universe. I'm stuck with living in a world of cities and suburbs and pollution and morons. I'm also atheist if that's relevant, which I think it is because everyone in my family is a christian, not hardcore or anything, but I just can't look at religious people and see them as intellegent. (I don't want to start a religion war, it's just my opinion!). 

 So I just feel like there isn't viable opportunity for me to actually pursue the very limited things I actually find interesting. I live in the midwest in a regular city, so when I go outside, 3/4 times of the year i'm too cold, and the environment is shitty there's nothing interesting because everything is property. I always wanted to just run away to a tropical island and live off the land, but found that being alone for more than a week I start going a little insane. 

I just feel like the majority of my days now, are looking to the end of them excited for it to be OVER. If most of my time is stressful, I just kind of feel like suicide might be nice even though I don't believe in any afterlife. I always thought people who wanted to off themselves were weak and bad people for hurting those who loved them. That's the big reason I don't do it, because of what it would do to my family. So I probably never will. But I feel like i'm about to waste another 4 years of my life in college, to end up getting a job for a few years till we are too overpopulated and polluted to survive and then i'll look back and see life as a waste of time.
