life is not worth livingi've dealt with so much in life. i literally spend a lot of my alone time just thinking "this can't be me. this can't be MY life." but it is and it will never get better. i used to believe it would but it just doesn't.

i had so much to offer the world and i still do. there's so many things i wanted to do but i can't because i'm too disabled to do them. it's not enough that i'm disabled but also my multiple chronic conditions make me unable to even enjoy a fraction of what i used to be able to enjoy without severely suffering and paying for it right afterwards. 

to top it all off i neither of my parents love me. my father never did and wanted me aborted and reconnecting with him after over 10 years of separation only solidified that fact. and my mother is an abusive narcissist and i have no choice but to live with her because of my disabilities. 

im so tired of living. the most painful thing in the world is to know that i dont deserve to have had any of these things happen to me and that i have so much inside of me to give to the world but can't. my future is so bleak but the present is terrible already. 

i think of that poor kid from canada, johnathan pitre, who passed away because of his skin condition and how he lived in excruciating pain every day. i wish i were gone like he is. honestly, holding onto hope for a treatment or hope in god is starting to not be enough anymore. 

i wake up and spend a lot of time every day wishing i were gone and craving death. i spend my nights in bed crying my eyes out. i'm so tired of this. im so tired of living.
