Not sure how I feel.Life is getting hard, my girlfriend of 3 years left me with no reason given. She didn't want to try and work on things we never fought, so I don't know if I'm blind or stupid but I don't know why she left. The worst part is that's the good news without going too deep into detail I have a terminal disease and will be dead within a year at current estimates. She had no idea I am gonna die so that's not why she left. 

I feel life is getting overwhelming and I don't know where to turn. I will be falling asleep soon, I'm not going to kill myself but the thought keeps pushing into my thoughts.
