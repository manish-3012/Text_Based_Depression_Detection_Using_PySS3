Is it okay to find friends and have a gf when I know i'll eventually kill myself? I know that i'm going to kill myself eventually. It can be this year or next year or maybe even in 10 years but I know it's coming. I don't want to get into specifics I just want to know is it ok morally to try and make friendships and relationships if I know it's coming. Whenever I try to connect to someone I just can't help but think that one day I'll hurt them really bad and I don't want to do that to someone but when I try to distance myself from people I just feel a lot worse. I don't know what to do with my current friends or family but I don't want to hurt more people.  
Sorry if this is the wrong sub I just don't know where to go.
