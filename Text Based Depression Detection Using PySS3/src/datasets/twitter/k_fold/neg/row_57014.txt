wish there was a flick to switch and call it a night or trade my vital organs and save a life of a dying kid etc.nothing exciting here Iâ€™m healthy and donâ€™t live a particularly bad life but itâ€™s just how I feel man, never really been happy always felt like I wish I could just not wake up, anyone else?
