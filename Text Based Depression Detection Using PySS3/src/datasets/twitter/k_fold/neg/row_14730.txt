I was recently hired, but I'm not happySorry english is not my main language.           
               
After all the rejections I've dealt with recently (relationship, job interviews, etc.) plus that one company who turned me down just today, another one decided to give me a chance. I have applied for this job just because it's near from where I live. I was never hopeful on getting this job, I was actually hoping to be hired in the other one. I'm not happy, I feel the other way around. I'm scared shitless that my depression will get in the way and I'll end up losing this job because I was hired for a technical support job for a satellite TV, and this job requires a lot of memorization and paying attention. I don't have that as of the moment, I can even barely get out of bed and take care of my child. I'm still lucky we have a helper that does house work for us.
                         
                
And yet I find myself browsing the web, looking for ways to kill myself the fastest and least painful way. Please don't tell me there is one because I already know the answer. I just can't find the energy to keep going. A lot of the internet folks have told me to channel my remaining hope to my child, that I should do everything I can for her. Let her be my shining light. But I can't. I just can't. Call me a bad parent, idfc anymore. I just want to end this pain. I've been planning to swallow pills but I'm not sure if they're enough. I don't want to wake up in a hospital to find out I was unsuccessful and be an embarrassment. I wish I have friends irl to talk to. I wish my parents were still alive.
