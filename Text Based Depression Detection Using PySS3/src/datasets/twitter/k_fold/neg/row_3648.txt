Exhausted to the point of giving upHi Reddit, I'm a 20 years old girl and have been having anxiety attacks as long as I can remember. Now that I'm at uni, things have worsen. The attacks are more often and results in self-destructive behaviour. My motivation, energy and happiness is very low at the moment. I am bullied and ostracised on the daily basis then I come back home to a very unsatisfied and tired mother. I don't have friends or family and I feel very lonely. I feel like independently of what I do, people will always hate me so I have given up hope on friends.


If things continue this way, I'm scared I won't make it to 21. I just want someone to tell me the usual crap, that everything will be fine so I can carry on for maybe a week or two.
