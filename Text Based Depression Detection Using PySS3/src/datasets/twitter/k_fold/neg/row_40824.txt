Whats the most painful thing I can do to myself that won't leave a scar? [serious]I can't live with a mistake i made in the past. i hate myself so fucking much and wish i could end it but im just not brave enough, but i cant just live with myself like this i need to punish myself for it because the mistake that i *chose* to make would have changed my entire life for the better. i dont want scarring because i dont need anyones pity. please dont ask for specifics or try to help me just answer the question
