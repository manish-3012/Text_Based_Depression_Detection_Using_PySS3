For life begins and ends with purposeI was born. Then my creator(my mom) died almost three years ago. February third is the anniversary of her death. The days leading up to it have been unbearably miserable. Iâ€™ve realized i have no purpose on this earth. My life ended when my mom died. My drive and passion for life depleted. Itâ€™s a waste of time trying to help me and if I wasnâ€™t so much of a coward Iâ€™d be gone already. I have two options: let my therapist know my plan or to follow through with said plan.
