Advice.With sleeping pills, is it more effective to take them on an empty stomach or after a meal? I'm also going to take them wine, so I would assume empty so as to keep the alcohol from being absorbed too fast.

That is all I ask. I don't want people telling me to not do it, because I'm going to regardless. One way or the other.
