Iâ€™ve never hurt like thisi am a 14 year old girl who lost her dad last year to suicide. i wonâ€™t go into details but i made a choice, a choice to help decide which parent i would stay with back when he was alive. i choose my mother because i loved him but i was so numb and depressed to the point where i didnâ€™t care what happened to me. long story short we got into a bad accident and i got 2nd degree frostbite and they asked me did i want to leave him and i said yes, a few months later he killed him self. i recently found some messages and i think, i think i made the wrong choice. i was the reason he killed himself, i couldâ€™ve stopped it. i donâ€™t know how to live with myself, i canâ€™t numb it. i killed someone, i donâ€™t know how to go on.
