I don't necessarily want to die, I just feel like such a lost cause that it's the only option at this pointEvery time I read advice on here on how to get better I consider it for a moment, but then all I can think is that "better" is so far away that it's impossible to reach. I don't give a shit about anything, my grades are slipping (most were bad to begin with), and every single interaction with other people ends with me berating myself to the edge of suicide. 

I'm only staying alive at this point because of my family and friends, and the fact that death scares the shit out of me. Whenever I make self-deprecating jokes that go a little too far, my friends always suggest therapy, which I used to want. But these days I'm just waiting for something to push me over the edge so I won't be afraid to die anymore.
