I just want this feeling to stopThere's so many details I could give you and so many things I could say about why I'm posting here but the short version of it is that I've never truly wanted to die as much in my life as I do today. I've suffered with depression my whole life, untreated, until about a month ago when I got put on new medication. before that, my life was awful. I treated the one love of my life horribly and pushed him away until he hated me. Now he wants nothing to do with me while I desperately want him to love me the way he did before I lost my will. 

The pills made me feel amazing up until yesterday when he told me he didn't want to be with me anymore. I was so happy and doing so well living on my own while he was in a different city - i was adapting and growing and happy for the first time in as long as I can remember. Until he told me he didn't want me. I cried on the phone for hours until he told me we could try one last time, but I know his heart isn't in it. I'm all alone. And suddenly I can't breathe - I can't get out of bed. My whole body aches with sadness for what I've lost. What I fucked up and let go before I realized what was truly important. I should have seen it before. and now that I have seen it, I'm going to lose it. 

He doesn't want me. I don't want to feel the pain of loving someone so much who doesn't want me anymore and knowing it's entirely my fault.

I don't want to worry anymore - about family, money, rent, work, school, my future - none if it feels like it matters. I've been lying in bed staring at the ceiling thinking of ways to make sure I don't fail. I want to end it. Nothing can be worse than the way that I feel. Not even dying
