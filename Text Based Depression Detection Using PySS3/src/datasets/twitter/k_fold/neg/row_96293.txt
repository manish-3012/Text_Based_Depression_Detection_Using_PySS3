I'm not going to be able to keep this up much longer.I'm. Fucking. Tired.

20 years old, and I feel like I carry the pain of a 98 year old woman. I can't do it anymore. My heart is just...drowning. That's the only way I can describe it.

I've been all about trying little things to make myself happy. Clean the apartment. Put up decorations. Take a bath. Organize my room. Pick up my guitar. Pick up an extra shift at work. Painting my nails. Picking out a cute outfit. Window shopping. Donating money and random good deeds.

Nothing is working. I'm happy for a short amount of time, and then I retract back to this miserable, unbearable fucking feeling. My lows are getting even lower. And they're lasting far too long. This is miserable, and I have no energy to try anymore. I don't know what to do anymore :( It's a mixture of loneliness and emptiness, and it fucking hurts. I can't take this fucking pain anymore I CAN'T FUCKING TAKE IT. I feel like a fucking MUTE. Like nobody hears me no matter what I say or do. 

I'm afraid because I keep having these thoughts about killing myself (which isn't too out of the ordinary). Except this time...I actually see myself doing it. Before it was just theoretical and hypothetical. I *wanted* to kill myself, but I was such a coward and wasn't able to. Now...I feel like I don't even care what's on the other side. I don't care about how it'll make anybody feel.

I just don't care. And that sounds dangerous. There's obviously still something keeping me from doing it...but there's not a lot of whatever it is left, and I'm afraid it's going to run out, and I'll just do it.

I'm sure nobody will read this. I don't really know what anyone can say to this anyways. I guess I just needed to vent somewhere I knew I couldn't be judged or scowled.
