Do therapist ever help?I am contemplating seeing a therapist, but I donâ€™t actually know what I will get out of it. I think I am kind of depressed right now, but for the most part me wanting to kill myself was not because of depression. Itâ€™s a logical decision based on my own reasoning.  I think a lot of people see a therapist for medication, if I donâ€™t want medication, is it mostly a waste of time?

I guess I want someone to listen and maybe surprise me with an insight/angle I have not thought of. I am also afraid Iâ€™ll be sent to a hospital if I am being too honest.. 

Iâ€™m getting better, but Iâ€™m really just taking it one day at a time. The future scares me, and I donâ€™t have motivation to do anything other than sitting at home after work. To me, itâ€™s actually more comforting to think about dying than to live.
