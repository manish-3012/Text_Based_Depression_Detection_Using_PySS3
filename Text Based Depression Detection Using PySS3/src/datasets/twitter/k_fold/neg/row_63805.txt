Help with making a noose out of a bedsheet? (X-post from r/gore)I am not trying to be talked out of this. I'm a pretty uncoordinated girl and I'm trying to make a noose out of a bedsheet. Nothing happened in particular. I'm just done with life; I don't want to see anymore. I already wrote a note and requested my photos be uploaded to r/gore for their viewing pleasure. Can someone kindly instruct me on how to make a noose out of a sheet? It's all I got and I don't want to make my roommates suspicious.
Love and light
