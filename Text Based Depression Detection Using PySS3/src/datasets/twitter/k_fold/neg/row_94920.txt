Does anyone else have persistent depressive disorder?I just feel like I donâ€™t deserve as much treatment as someone with major depression. Like Iâ€™m not depressed enough to get help. It just seems that they have it worse than I do. Iâ€™ve only gotten crippling depressed about three times in my life. Idk I just feel out of place.
