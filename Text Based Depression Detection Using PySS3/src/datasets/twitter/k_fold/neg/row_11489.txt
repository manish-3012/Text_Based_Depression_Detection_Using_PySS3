My ex keeps making suicide jokes, should I reach out to him?So we broke up almost a year ago and it was a very short lived relationship. I had a feeling something was up but he never wanted to open up to me and I respected that. Eventually he left me, stating that he â€œneeds to find himselfâ€, which could be a cover up but idk. 

I have moved on and unfollowed him everywhere but I have friends that still do and they give me updates (I donâ€™t ask for them). He makes suicide jokes and captions on his snap and Instagram posts, and a while back he told my friend he was depressed. 

Iâ€™m not gonna lie, I do feel worried and want to reach out. I 100% guarantee itâ€™s not to get him back but Iâ€™m pretty sure heâ€™s gonna feel that way and leave me on read. I donâ€™t really care that he views me as crazy anyways, it would kill me to know that I never reached out if he did do something to himself. 

I donâ€™t have a gut feeling that I should reach out, really itâ€™s just worry. Being his ex, I donâ€™t want to stir up anything and cause more trouble. Should I talk to him?
