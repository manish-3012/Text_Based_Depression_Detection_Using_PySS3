My own worst enemyThe words I overheard seared into my mind. Every so often I recall the events in emotional and vivid detail. It hurts just like the moment it happened. 

Iâ€™ve gone through this before, Iâ€™ve been weak and tried to take my life. Itâ€™s been a fight, constant. But Iâ€™m ready to give in. 

Iâ€™m just so disappointed in myself.
