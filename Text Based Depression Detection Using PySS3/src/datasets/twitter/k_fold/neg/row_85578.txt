I'm not even sure how but I'm gonna do it tonightMaybe jump off a bridge or some shit. Life sucks. Can't find a goddamn job, lost almost all my friends. I admit I have 1 or 2 who have been there for me but no one else in this world is. I'm thankful af for them and I think they care about me but my life is so hopeless. Not in college, have BPD, no skills (for real), and too fucking depressed and anxious to get out of it. It's not worth living anymore for me it isn't.
