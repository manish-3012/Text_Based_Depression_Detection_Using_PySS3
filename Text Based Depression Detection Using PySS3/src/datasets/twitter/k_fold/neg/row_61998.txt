I really need someone to talk to right now.  My mother commited suicide Friday night and I just found out Saturday morning when I got to work.  Anyone around to talk?28/f feeling a lot of guilt right now.  What else could I have done to help?  My mother was living with me until about 2 months ago.  She has been mentally for a while now and it has gotten worse as she gets older.  I was frustrated with my mom while she lived here and often would yell at her to take her medicine or to seek help.  I feel so bad and guilty like I should have not been so hard on her... however she had an attempted suicide infront of me a year and a half earlier due to depression of my parents spliting.  My mother just told me 3 days ago she was disgusted with herself.  She told me I did all that I could and tried to help her as much as I could.  It still doesn't make it easier.  Has anyone else delt with this?  I go from being mad at her to being mad at myself to guilt and depression.  Work has given me off the entire week... I live in the place she lived with me for the last year up until she left 2 months ago... I'm in the place alone now and it makes it really hard.
