From happy eyes to the saddest I've ever seenHello everyone and I hope that wherever you are, you are in a better place that the one I am in right now. Please be kind to yourself, as I am not with me and it's painful. I always feel like I have so much love to offer, only not for myself..

I have been struggling for a couple of months with various things that happened throughout my life, being them recent or past and the closer I get to my 23rd birthday, the more I want everything to end as soon as possible.To sum it up, all my life I've been the good kid that took other's responsibilities, which burdened me each and every day. Never really had a childhood, as being a girl, my father considered he should be strict with me and easy going with my brother. Never had true, genuine friends, as no one really wanted anything to do with me and to be fair I craved silence and intimacy more than anything. For the exact same reason, almost all the people that came into my life later on, either wanted something from me or wanted to treat me like a trophy they could show to others. My mother is not even able to keep a conversation straight with someone without going into what's happening to HER and how SHE is affected by everything, meanwhile I was the one that kept my parents together in the last decade, and to be fair I hate myself for it now.

It's been more than a decade since I started wearing a mask of happiness in front of everyone, while trying my hardest to make sure at least the people around me are happy. I hope I succeeded and that they are, as I am not. I also have an affinity for malevolent people as the only times I offered my trust to someone so that he/she can see the real me, they used it against me in every way possible.I finished college but couldn't continue in the field as the most important skills (the social one) were the ones I lacked the most) and now every time I look at that period of time I get sadder as I could be so much more if I was able to be strong and move on with my life. Plot twist : I'm not and I never moved on.

I can't even write anything about a love life as I'm shitty at this too. Stuck myself to the guy that made me feel even worse than before only because, at some point, we all feel the need to have someone close to us. Right? Well, wrong, please do not choose a person that gives you red flags from the beginning, it will fuck you up in ways you never knew were possible. I ended that relationship after almost 5 years of giving all my time to that person and almost never getting more than bursts of jealousy, screams and "wonderful" comments about how ugly, fat or boy-ish I was. I was not supposed to have any friends, and if I had, he would read my conversations with them when he got my phone. I couldn't bear the thought of moving in with him so I had to break apart from that. 

That got me to therapy, which helped in the beginning and now I'm just spiraling into something I am not that sure I like, and as I am always blaming myself it is surely because of me. I tried making friends but I am always feeling like a burden to them as I feel the need to talk about how I am feeling at some point and I come to the conclusion that what I am feeling is too much for anyone else but me to take on their shoulders.

Some time ago I created a plan, a plan in which I was supposed to write, over time, some heartfelt letters to the ones I considered close to me even though it was one sided, give them the letters before or on the day of my birthday, and then just go to the closest bridge in the night and just straight down, eventually with my hands tied so that I can't go back if I decide that I'm not brave enough to do it anymore.

My birthday is in less than a month and I am thinking about this plan more and more as each day passes and I feel more depressed than yesterday. I just wish days pass at a faster rate, I am looking more at myself in the mirror lately and I can see the sadness in my eyes spreading throughout my whole face. I am so tired of crying my heart out, I am so tired of this physical pain I am feeling everyday, like a fist in my heart when I wake up and I hope that at the end of this, people do see me as I saw myself all these years, a ghost in their life, someone they can easily forget over the course of a day or two.
