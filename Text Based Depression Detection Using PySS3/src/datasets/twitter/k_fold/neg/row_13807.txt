Ending everything today.Yesterday I lost my job. I can't take this anymore. I feel like I'm in a circle of debt with no way of catching up. I've always had issues with low self-esteem and self-worth. I'm not strong-willed enough to continue this life. I can't keep burdening my sister and family anymore.

I have a 14-year-old son, but he's strong and will be okay. My sister and brother-in-law make better parents than me anyway. They're better capable of caring for him after I'm gone. I plan to tell him that he can have any of my electronics he wants after I go, including my laptop, tablet, and gaming console. I already wrote a note for my sister to read when she comes home from work tonight. Hopefully I'll be unconscious by then.

I researched online and I plan to die by drinking antifreeze. I normally stay in my room anyway so by the time anyone notices something wrong, perhaps it'll be too late to treat and I can be pronounced DOA.
