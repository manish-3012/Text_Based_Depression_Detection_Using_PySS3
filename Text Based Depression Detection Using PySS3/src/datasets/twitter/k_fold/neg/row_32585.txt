Anyone get this way?I'm sorry for posting here more frequently. 
Do you guys ever find yourself in this situation: 

You're alone in the house. You've been thinking about suicide a lot. You have a plan but arent sure you're going to do it. You feel more intensely about attempting in the moment, but you also still wonder if you should call someone. But you dont want to call anyone because if you're not going to do it - they dont need to be called. And if you are set that youre going to do it - why call someone and mess up your plan? 

You're feeling reckless and desperate so you want to post all sorts of crazy posts on social media but deep down you really dont want that kind of attention and you are a considerate person so you dont want to interfere with anyone's day or cause alarm. But you're still feeling the way you're feeling - so instead of posting crazy things you just shut off all your social media. 

But now you feel more isolated. 
Which on one hand you wanted. 
But on the other hand, you just want to be able to call someone. 

Not that you're even sure what they could do. 

So maybe you should just get it over with.
