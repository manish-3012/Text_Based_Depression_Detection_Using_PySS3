Today is the first day in awhile that I haven't contemplated killing myself.Everything still sucks of course and I know the moment I get my 24 hour notice to vacate, which is likely to happen on Monday or Tuesday if not tomorrow. I'm probably going to breakdown. However, today I had a feeling I might just be okay. Someone mentioned selling my possessions and travel, I kind of thought that's just not possible for me, but randomly last night I hit the random button and ended up in r/vagabond. I spent quite a bit of time just digging around and seeing if that lifestyle is something I'd be able to handle temporarily. It doesn't seem too awful, I'm hoping I can make it work as that's really my only other option aside from ending it all I feel like. I have a few things I can sell(bed, couch, computer, and monitor), but have had no luck yet since posting on craigslist. I'm hoping I can get a couple hundred dollars, otherwise it all ends up in the trash since I have nowhere to store any of it. I don't know how long this feeling will last where suicide doesn't have to be the other option, but it has been nice to not feel like it is. Maybe its the lack of nutrients making me delusional. Sorry if this shouldn't be posted here, I don't have anyone to talk to and felt I had to get this out somewhere.
