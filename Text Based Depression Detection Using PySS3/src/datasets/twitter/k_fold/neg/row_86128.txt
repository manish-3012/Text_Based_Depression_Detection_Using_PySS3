I want to die. But my pets keep me here. I know it would be fucked up to go without themWhat do I do? I don't have a gun yet I was looking at gun shows. I live in Texas so I know it be easy. I have little family and friends, but we're not that close. It's only like 3 people, but I've been gone before and they were happy without me. Honestly, it's my dogs that make it difficult. I feel bad that they wouldn't understand. What a piece of shit I am. But honestly I don't see the point in living. The thought of dying comforts me.
