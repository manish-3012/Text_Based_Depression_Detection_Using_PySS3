I live in delusionI don't actively believe it but I like to feel it. I feel like i'm missing home and that home is some fantasy world similar to some of my favourite movies. That if I take a strange path through a forrest i'll find somewhere else. That my brain wasnt correctly wired to be efficient in todays economical system and i'm too weak emotionally to carry the burden many people have to keep on living day to day. I should stop eating animals, they have it way worse in this world, why am I complaining? I still miss home, though
