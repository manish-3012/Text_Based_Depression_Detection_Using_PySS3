found the actual love of my life but we're both wrecks...and they have so many more reasons to want to die than i do. and i know love doesn't really fix shit. just had my first real, full-blown panic attack in months because i've lost so much already and i think losing them would break me past the point of no return. but all i can do is be there, and i can't even be there physically because it's an LDR. im so torn because i get it but GOD do i want to let myself be selfish. i can't. i can't lose this and recover from it. im actually thinking about my future, and it's in a positive light, and it's with them. if i lose them i have nothing. 

i know it's not healthy. i know it's selfish and greedy and disgusting for me to think like this. i just needed to.. i dunno. i'm sorry.
