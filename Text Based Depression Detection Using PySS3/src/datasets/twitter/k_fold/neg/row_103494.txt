sry for putting my problems here, no one has to do anything about this, but still if anyone wants to i'll only be happyI've tried taking my life before by cutting my veins open but it's too painful for me to make a wound that big, this time i'm just gona jump off a bridge, i think i can do it. The only problem for me is that i'm a little scared at the moment and ofc i'm not gona talk about this with the people i know, but i'm just looking for a little comfort i guess, ending it all isn't as easy as i thought it would be. Writing this here and asking strangers for help isn't the smartest thing i've done but i don't really care, it's gona end soon anyways
