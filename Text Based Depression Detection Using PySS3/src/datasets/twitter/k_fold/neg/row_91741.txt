I don't have too much written here21, didn't graduate, skinny, ugly voice, mother hates me (should I somehow change my life I want to forget about her entirely anyways), no friends, wrists have hurt for a year I fucked up because of tendinitis/carpal tunnel, no future prospects, substance abuse, bad leg, Ill never ever be happy and have just fucked up too much

There isn't anything I can do I feel like just running away and dying
