So my girlfriend might be breaking up with me.My girlfriend told me she hasn't been happy and thinks we should break up, I love her with all my heart and have made so many commitments lately to try to be the best person I can for her.. What do you do when then person you love knows you are trying but it isn't enough? She literally said that she knows how hard i've been trying and she feels shittier as a result. We aren't officially done, but I guess we're on break? Idk what to do at this point.. Putting myself in that dark corner I was in 3 years ago.
