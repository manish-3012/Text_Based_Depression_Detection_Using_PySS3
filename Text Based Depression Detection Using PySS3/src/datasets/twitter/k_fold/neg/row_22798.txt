Im writing my letters to the people in my life.Itâ€™s nearly the end of the road for me. Everyday I do the same thing. I wake up and everyone has left for work or school, get out of bed at 1pm, skip lunch, feed the cats, maybe make cookies or cupcakes, watch Netflix, wait until people are home, make dinner, feeds cats, go for walk, watch Netflix, binge eat, everyone goes bed, I stay down alone, put the cats in the utility room for the night, head upstairs at 12, self harm if I feel like it, stay awake for a couple more hours because my brain doesnâ€™t shut off, have a restless sleep. And repeat. 

Any happiness is covered in sadness. Happiness is a fleeting emotion, it lasts a few mere minutes, filled with doubt about whether or not Iâ€™m lying to myself and Iâ€™m not actually happy. I donâ€™t trust my emotions. Most are fake.
