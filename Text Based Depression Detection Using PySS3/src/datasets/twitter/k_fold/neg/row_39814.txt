Is this life?I am an 18 year old gay male, and I have struggled with suicide ever since I was 14-15. Through this period there were some times that I felt kinda happy, things were working out slightly better than usual, but those times are heavily outnumbered by times that I felt like a waste of a human that deserved to die. I have seen a therapist for over 2 years, seen multiple doctors and for me, none of that really helped. The fact that I am gay has destroyed multiple of the best friendships I've ever had and left me completely alone. I am not the kind of person to just get over things, I am very emotional and get hurt easily and I have some trust issues. I still go to school (final year) but work a job too. Recently I got interested in one of my friends and I'm really starting to get into him. It hurts me deeply knowing that we'll never be a couple. There is a very small chance he's gay/bi but even then how am I even supposed to know that. I am tired every single day and don't have any motivation to do anything anymore. I cry very often, which makes me feel weak and destroyed. I have no real talents and play videogames every day. I honestly feel like I should have never existed in the first place and that I am a complete waste. I wish that things just worked out for me once.
