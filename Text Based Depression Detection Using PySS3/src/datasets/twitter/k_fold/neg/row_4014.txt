Want someone to talk toHello:
I never thought I'd be here but here I am.
I'm 46 y/o male. CSA survivor, extreme anxiety attacks, feelings of panic and fear constantly, worry and feeling overwhelmed.
Two kids (under 10) and a wife. Currently working but career is largely dead...

Don't know what to do. Feelings of ending it all, especially in the mornings if that makes any sense.
On meds but don't seem to be helping, keep thinking of going off ..

I realize the above is not particularly special or interesting, but really just want someone to talk to.
