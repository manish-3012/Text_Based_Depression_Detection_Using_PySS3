family, school, friends, work, I don't careI don't want any of it. I have no ambition, no goal other than to be dead. Every day I inch closer and closer towards the inevitable. My "untimely" death will only cause a tenth of the suffering I would cause in a lifetime of being a completely useless burden. I wish it was acceptable to just tell everyone that I have wanted to be dead for as long as I can remember and just be granted the freedom to do it.

nothing has ever worked. there is no fixing this, and there's no good reason to think thee ever will be. they say it's up to me, now. I agree. I want to take charge of my own being and do what I have always wanted to do.
