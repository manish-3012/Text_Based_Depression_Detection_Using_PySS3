11:11 8-8-15 attempted but didnâ€™t work. Not a day goes by Iâ€™m happy to be aliveI donâ€™t always remember the date, on the date. Was listening to some Audiomachine this evening and it reminded me of my attempted suicide. Rx and party drugs and alcohol. In a damn bullet mixed, drank. Out for 4 days. Alone. Fuck it, didnâ€™t go to the hospital, dragged my sorry ass around the house, drank apple juice and took liver detox pills, hot showers with clay all over me to detox. Was surreal. Wiped my brain clean, was not depressed or suicidal for almost 2 years. Got through some really wretched shit. Not one freakin day since 8-8-15 to now have I said â€œdamn, Iâ€™m glad to be alive!!â€ Its all just been a drag, waking up, oh damn, another day on this wretched godforsaken planet. Under enormous stress right now, homeless, jobless. O hope. KMN, as I like to say. Life is not worth living. I donâ€™t have an exit plan this very moment, but it could become impending doom again. Have a good night.
