I feel like even if I donâ€™t kill myself Iâ€™m going to die either wayI have been suicidal for a long time. But my suicidal thoughts stopped for a couple months earlier this year. But I have those thoughts and urges back in full force. I feel like Iâ€™m trapped and I have no choice. I feel like even if I donâ€™t suicide Iâ€™m going to die some other way soon enough. I really want to talk to someone but I donâ€™t know if itâ€™ll help..
