scaredbecause i know i'm not gonna make iti've tried a lot to stay alive, been in therapy for so long, but I feel like it's a waste because I'm supposed to kill myself.  


i don't know how to explain it but it's like I can see my own death at all times. I have nightmares all the time about different ways i'd die or kill myself. it feels like I was born only to kill myself, which is very sad and somewhat unfair, but i think this is just how it's meant to be.  


i cannot see a way out, i used to kid myself and lie and say i'd find a way, but things get worse each day, and even worse than that as each year comes to pass. I have nothing left to give, i've tried and failed.

i will say, even knowing that i will kill myself, it's scary. it's very scary and uncomfortable because I can see how my mental state has slowly deteriorated. I can look back and somewhat remember when my thoughts weren't totally bizarre and incoherent and when I still had a decent working memory.

&amp;#x200B;

i can hardly remember conversations i had just hours ago, I am full of fear and scary intrusive thoughts and bad images and horrible feelings at all times, i can't focus, I'm going to quit my job soon and run away from my family and especially my father and then slowly keep losing whatever part of my old self is left and then I will kill myself and fulfill what i Was put here to do\\

predestined to die, it's not very fair, but oh well ,.
