When I have a panic attack, something else takes over, and it wants to kill meSo like a couple of weeks ago I intentionally overdosed and went to a public hospital who referred me to my community mental heath centre. I saw a.... really really awful psychiatrist and they also ring me every day to check up on me... they say itâ€™s an optional service but I actually donâ€™t know how to opt out lol. Actually itâ€™s kind of nice in some ways to have someone ring me. 
Anyway. One of the things they always say is if Iâ€™m feeling unsafe, to call them or a friend or go to my family etc. but honestly if that thing inside me tries to take over again, thereâ€™s no way itâ€™s letting me call for help. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m worried. I feel fine right now but what happens when i have another panic attack?  I donâ€™t want to traumatise my family, but I know that it wants to finish the job, itâ€™s just waiting. I never thought that it would get as far as it has, but it did. And I survived but what about next time?
