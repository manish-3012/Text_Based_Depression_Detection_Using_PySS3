I am not in control of my lifeSince I remeber, I had never have real control of my life. I always did what I was supossed to do, what people told me...I never take decision on my own, I do not if is cause by some kind of trauma or I am just to pathetic. 
I hate my life,as I dont feel I own it. To give an example a couple of friend insisted on going to a big party lan, I did not want, mostly because of my social anxiety ,but in the end I say yes...
Even worse, now I do not have access to anxiety meds now because of reasons....so I just need to find a way to kill my self fast(For know hanging is my choice,but it terrifies me) to stop living this meanless life.
