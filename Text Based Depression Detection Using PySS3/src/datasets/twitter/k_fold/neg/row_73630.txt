Waiting to leave this worldCant believe im so desperate that id post this but..

Im 18 and been diagnosed with chronic clinical depression. Ever since the day i was born everyone around me knew something was wrong with me, i never smiled, seemed genuinely happy, or acted like anyone else. I was just a blank faced an never showed much emotion in any situation. 

Throughout my young teenage years, ive tried to better improve myself by smiling more, showing more enthusiasm, and trying to be a basic human being. Eventually i developed those habits and everyone around me started to open up to me. They always compliment me on how happy i am, how i can smile all the time, but holy shit if they only knew

Every day i wake up from suicidal dreams, wishing i never woke up. Whenever i see my friends, id wish that they just forget about me, or atleast that i can be of some use to them. Everyday i have to hide the vertical slits on my forearm. Everyday i have to try to be a normal human being, but i really just cant.

Ive tried therapy, counselors, psycological meds, mediation, you name it. Mostly everything just doesnt work. The only things that do work to just numb the pain is booze, weed, cbd, and sleep. I wish i could feel atleast alright when im just breathing.

My life isnt even that bad, ive done great in school, living middle class, going to a prestigious college, and already built up savings for the future. Whenever i mention if i committed suicide, people who know me would just say the same "wtf, id do almost anything to be in your position", but never did they mention that i shouldnt, or that im worth something.

So now here i am, thinking how spoiled i am to even consider taking my life, reaching out to you guys... if i missed anything that you need to know, ill be more than happy to answer them â˜º
