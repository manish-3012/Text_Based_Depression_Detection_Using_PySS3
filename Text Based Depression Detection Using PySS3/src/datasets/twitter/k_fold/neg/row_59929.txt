My insulin pump is yelling at me right now, insulin is low. I have to put more in. Insulin is fucking expensive because drug companies are greedy. I'm their piggy bank. 

My house is sinking into the ground, can't afford to fix it.

I was at work late again for the 5,000,000,000 time, HR doesn't want to give me a raise.

My younger brother is getting married this weekend. I've never been on a date. I'm 35. I'm best man, I have to give a toast, but I'll never be married at this point. I have no clue what to say. I have bad social anxiety, I'm terrified.

People bullied the hell out of me in high school, which created the anxiety.

Therapy is not helping much. This is my 4th attempt at it.

If this is what life is, I want no part of it.
