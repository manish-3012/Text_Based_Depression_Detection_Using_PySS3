I think about it every dayI used to only think about it on the bad days, but lately It pops into my head all the time. I work in a lab, and I have access to some chemicals. It wouldn't have to be so painful.  

I thought he was the one, I gave him everything, and he tore me down bit by bit. He made me feel ashamed of myself, unintelligent, dirty, lazy, and unremarkable. There is only so much criticism a person can take. I used to be someone who others regarded as strong, but I have been reduced to this. And I let it happen, so I guess I deserve it.

All of my drive is gone. All of my joy. My wonder and passion for life have been replaced with ....dead air. I smile around others and sneak away to cry when I can. I dream about him every night. I open my eyes in the morning and wish I didn't have to wake up, to face the day ahead of me.

I didn't know it was possible to feel this way. Everyone thinks he is such a nice guy. His emotional intelligence allows him to hide his true character so well.

I know I'm rambling. I know nobody cares, and I sound stupid and immature. I'm almost 30 and I should know better. I'm just so fucking sick of feeling this way, and I want out.
