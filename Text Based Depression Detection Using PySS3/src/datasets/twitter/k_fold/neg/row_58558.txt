Looking for more options.First time posting. First time talking about this at all. Ive been thinking about suicide for years. I have no job. Im about to be kicked out of college, and in return ill be kicked out of the house. No money and nowhere to go. Im not a smart man, I cant think straight and i havent been able to for years. I plan on parking my car in my garage and just listening to music before the monoxide gets to me. I said i dont mind dying, but I still want to live for alyssa and jake. i dont know what to do
