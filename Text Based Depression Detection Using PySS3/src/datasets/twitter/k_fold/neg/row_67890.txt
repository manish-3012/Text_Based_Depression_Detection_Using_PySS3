Psychomotor RetardationI canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m physically ill, if I have Lupus or some other disease they canâ€™t diagnose

Maybe I have chronic fatigue syndrome, which is a catch all for diseases they canâ€™t diagnose.   

Maybe Iâ€™m depressed, maybe Iâ€™m weak, maybe I have heart disease, maybe Iâ€™m a toxic person.  

In the end Iâ€™m dysfunctional.  Itâ€™s a waste to live a life like this.   I am not happy with my suffering, I see no purpose for it.  Iâ€™ve found no higher cause nor do I have a single person who cares or depends on me.  One friend would be justifiably upset if I left and thatâ€™s all.

Iâ€™m not sure if I can even bring myself to finish the day-by-day struggle.  Itâ€™s been clear to me itâ€™s over for years.  The gig is up.  I kept going because why not.  I went far beyond my limit.   Far beyond my comfort zone.  Iâ€™m just done - I see no more purpose.  

The holocaust survivors who said that the ones who gave up hope were the ones who died - I get that.  Iâ€™m at the point in this journey where I would have walked off into the snow and drifted off to sleep to die.  I would have given up.  The people who called me pathetic were right.  The people who said the girl may have left because I wasnâ€™t resilient enough were right.  Iâ€™m a loser, Iâ€™ve lost.  Iâ€™m ready for the game to be over.  Iâ€™m having a hard time struggling to keep playing until it is.
