It's half 2 in the morning and want to get something off my chest because my head is bursting.Throwaway, bullets because I'm lazy and it's complicated

-18 yo female
-Been with bf for 1y10m
-bf has a history of sexting on facebook (found bra photo of girl too)
-he deleted his account ages ago
-reactivated his account recently
-Terrified of him doing it again, seen flirty conversation with a girl he goes to college with and it dug back up dark feelings.
-Failed a-levels
-Didn't make it into uni 
-Working shitty fast food minimum wage job
-Not enough money to move out of parents house/get driving licence 
-Feel like my life is going no where
-Posting here because I feel I have nowhere else to turn.

Edit: forgot to mention I have 0 friends.
