Feel like I'm stuckI feel like I'm stuck in my own "world" and can't get out. I'm turning 28 this coming June and I feel like such a waste of life, I'm still living with my mom and I'm working at a dead end pizza shop. My best friend just went away for wrestling school and he is living his dreams and I'm so happy and proud of him... how come I can't do that? I can be motivational for him and my other friends but when it comes to myself I always put myself down and can't get any motivation. I've been like this for awhile and I can't get myself out of the loop.
