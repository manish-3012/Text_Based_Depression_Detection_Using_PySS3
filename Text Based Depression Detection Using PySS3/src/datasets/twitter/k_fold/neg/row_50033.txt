todayi just feel compelled to write this. I want to just take the time and do something for myself. I don't really know how this post will turn out, i feel like its just a stream of consciousness that there is an urgency to write down. 

I'm sat here, with a cup of tea listening to my CD. I'm planning to go into the city with my favourite book, and just chill out in a coffee shop. I know this seems incredibly boring, but i just really want to do it. I will call my grandmother, and have a long conversation with her. Its my favourite thing to hear about her past, her childhood, how she met my granddad etc. I know she likes this too, she gets ever so lonely. 

Maybe i'll call my parent's, just to tell them i Love them or some bullshit cliche. 

I'd also like to write my friends a note, there is something ever so special about a hand written note, don't you think? I don't know what it'll say, i guess it will be something that will just happen. 

Its bonfire night in the UK tonight. Its my favourite time of the year. I plan on wearing my favourite cosy hat and just watching the fireworks. 

I will go home by myself. I don't know how i can finish this post. I guess you get the picture. 

Thanks for reading my boring post, i think i will make sure i enjoy today.
