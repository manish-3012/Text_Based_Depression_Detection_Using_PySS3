Feels badI'm 18. I only have happy memories of my childhood, travel, friends, happiness... But since, like, 5 years, I feel uncomfortable. I don't find my spot. I don't see anything but a dark future. I'm so shy, the only times I don't feel too bad are when playing video games with some virtual friends. When I'm at school, I'm not isolated, I have good relationships with my class and even some friends but nothing that matters. I know I'll be alone after getting graduated. I got a little relationship with a girl, on Skype, how pathetic right ? It began one year ago. I was playing with her, talking every day... Some conflicts because of mutual jealousy, but always reconcilement. I was hoping so much. It seemed like we couldn't be separated... Well she rejected me... For one of my only "real friend". I lost him too. I feel so lonely. I think of her everyday.  Today I received a messave from her... It was only my name. I don't know what to do. I only want to die. She only wants to see if I'm still alive... She doesn't care about me. Noone does. I'm so affraid. I tried to end everything 2 months ago, when it happened. I hanged myself at my window with a belt. I woke up on the dirt, the belt was broken. I feel like shit. I'll disappoint everyone around me. I'm sure of it. I'm a fucking nerd eating money that my family doesn't even have. I want to be more social... But I'm way too self concerned. I try to go out, but... I can't even have fun anymore. I miss the younger me. I miss happiness. I miss her. I miss her so much. Tho, I hate her... I want to die, no longer be a charge. No more pain... I'm sorry, I've never spoken about that. English isn't my native language, I hope someone will read it and I hope it wasn't too hard to read.
