Worried about my friend who feels hopelessHey guys, I just reached out to one of my friends (20) on snap that I met while gaming a while back. I asked him how everything is going and that I havenâ€™t heard from him in some time.

He responded with: â€œEverything sucks, like everything is terrible.â€ And after asking him if he could elaborate and that I was willing to lend an ear, he replied â€œLiterally everything. Every aspect of my life is shit. Thereâ€™s a lot. And honestly at this point Iâ€™m just gonna give up.â€ After several attempts at trying to console him and tell him to talk to me about it and that all is not lost, he finally gave in.

Heâ€™s broke, is driving a car thatâ€™s on â€œborrowed timeâ€, and his unemployment registration was investigated and withheld because he was using a vpn when he registered and his IP location was in Sweden. He has since cleared things up with unemployment but still has to wait some time before they pay him again. Heâ€™s said he may try to take a loan out soon which I fear could make his situation worse if he doesnâ€™t have the funds to pay it back on time.

He has over $1200 in expenses currently. A large chunk of it for tickets and his rent. Heâ€™s been late on his rent 2 months in a row and I asked him if heâ€™s spoken to his landlord about his situation to see if maybe things could be worked out there. He said he doubts it due to his latency. 

Any advice that I can give him from you guys? I donâ€™t want to lose my friend. I canâ€™t imagine the grief and worry that heâ€™s dealing with right now and I donâ€™t want him to take his own life because of it.

All help / advice would be greatly appreciated.
