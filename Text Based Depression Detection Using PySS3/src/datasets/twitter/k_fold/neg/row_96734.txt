ObsessionA little over a week ago I tried to kill myself.  I was stopped by someone who saw me standing very close to a very steep fall.  She didn't press (in fact I'm not sure she even knew what I was planning or  just thought I was being inattentive) but we had coffee and talked, and I remembered what it was like to feel... like a person that strangers want to get to know.  Later that day I made a list of the practical reasons I would never try again.  (Cost to my family, fiscal and emotional both if I succeed or fail, primarily.)

Since then though, I've gotten happier.  I'm not as sad anymore, even if I'm not really happy.  I definitely don't want to kill myself, but I keep thinking about.

I constantly think about different ways I could, the best ways in any given situation.  I can't be in a new place for more than a few minutes before wondering if I could do it there. 

These feels awful.  I want it to stop but it just won't get out my head.  Does anyone else feel this way?  How do I stop it?
