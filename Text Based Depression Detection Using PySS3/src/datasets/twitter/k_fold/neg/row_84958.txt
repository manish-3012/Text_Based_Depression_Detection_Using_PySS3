SUICIDE: A friend keeps threatening suicide, if they talk about it, is it less likely they will do it?This person is kind and good through and through, they have just been dealt a rubbish hand, and they seem to have lost hope. He seemed so much better today, but is now in a hotel room saying that he has a bottle of pills he is debating on taking. 

He is honest when he says he wants to take his own life, and I believe that he would rather not be here, however, I have been told that while someone is talking about it, it is less likely they would see it through. Is this the case. 

He has been emailing me, he will not speak on the phone, I told him how gruesome a death paracetamol suicide would be and this is the response: 

Thanks. I've read that so many times and it certainly isn't appealing.

I started writing out my reasoning but I know that isn't really the point.

I'll sleep. I'm sorry. Mostly I wish there was a way of doing it that wouldn't worry anyone, just erased from existence style and everyone would just instantly forget I'd ever been, but alas that is not an option. Anyway get some sleep yourself.

What would you do? He has threatened this a lot before.
