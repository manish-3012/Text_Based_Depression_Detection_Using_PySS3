21 years old, socially awkward, easily intimidated, lack of confidence, I dont think I can continue going on anymore.I have been in denial about it for a while, I am depressed. I guess I have been in denial due to pride. I dont know. I didnt want to accept that I am depressed because it feels weak. Especially the petty reasons I am depressed over. Here I am whining about small issues, meanwhile there are people in this world who actually do have good reasons to be depressed. This post may be a long post but I have a lot on my mind and I would strongly appreciate it if you could just read what I have to say. I have no one to talk to.

Throughout most of my life I have always had trouble making connections with people. Typically I am very quiet around new people and I am a terrible conversationalist. 99% of the time when I try to strike up a conversation with someone the conversation lasts for about 30 seconds and ends in awkward silence. Because of this it is so difficult to find and make connections with anyone. I wouldn't be surprised if I have slight social anxiety. I remember back in my tenth grade year I used to hide in the school bathrooms during lunch because I was anxious to talk to people. I was at a new school and I was unable to make new friends there. I was anxious to talk to people and I didn't want to be seen as the guy sitting alone at lunch. I am not quite as socially anxious as I was back then, certainly not to the point where I would hide out in a bathroom to avoid it, if anything I would now argue that its not as much social anxiety that the problem is, but more the simple lack of social success. At work I do have a few acquaintances but no one who I would consider to be a friend. No one who would want to hang out with me outside of work or anything. I see other coworkers click so well, making plans together, etc. Im not proud to say it but it makes me feel very jealous. Why cant I make friends with my coworkers? Why cant I last in a conversation with someone for more than 30 damn seconds without it fucking turning into awkward silence. 

I only have one friend. My girlfriend. Who I am only with out of pure dumb luck. I have never had any success with women and this one was 100% a pure fluke. We have been together for five years, she is truly one of the greatest people I know, but I no longer have feelings for her and I am gonna have to end the relationship soon. Lost feelings about 6 months ago and have been to scared/afraid to tell her. Both for selfish and selfless reasons. Selfish because I am terrified of being alone, selfless because it breaks my heart knowing how hurt she will be. It isn't fair to her to be stuck with a guy who cant give her the love and attention she deserves. Around her I still feel very alone. When we break up I will literally have no friends other than family. I hate being alone. I hate doing things alone. All my life I told myself that I enjoy being alone, that I enjoy having alone time but in hindsight that was not true, that was just to make myself feel better about my lack of social success. It feels better to think "I am alone right now because I am choosing to be" instead of "I am alone right now because I don't have anyone to hang out with". But I cant keep kidding myself anymore. I am alone because I have zero social skills and dont know how to make friends with people. I have zero confidence. I always feel like I am being judged when I am having a conversation with someone. It fucking sucks. The rare occasion when I do manage to strike a genuine conversation with someone I dont even enjoy the conversation because the whole time I am stressing. So even if I did have people to hang out with, even if I did have friends, I would constantly be paranoid, wondering if they even enjoy my company. What if the second I leave they immediately trash talk me. etc.

There is a girl at work who I have had a crush on. I am still in a relationship so I am obviously not going to pursue anything (Other than maybe small talk and flirting which I know is still a horrible if not evil thing to do) with her yet. But even if I were single, I have zero confidence, I have no game, theres no way I would actually be able to have success when it came to dating her. Even if I somehow were able to make plans with her outside of work I wouldnt be able to enjoy the plans because all I would be able to think would be thoughts such as "Am I boring her? Am I fun to hang out with? What if her friends bad mouth me when I am not around? What if she enjoys the company of other guys better than me? etc etc". And it hurts. Obviously the thought of not having a chance with your crush hurts but in this case what truly hurts is knowing that I will never have much of a chance with people when I do pursue a relationship. Thats what hurts. At least thats what hurts as far as depression levels go. When I am around my girlfriends friends I get easily intimidated. I automatically tell myself "This person is a bitch" and stuff like that which I now realize usually isnt true but instead is a defense mechanism because I am intimidated. I will sometimes get temporary highs but that goes away quickly and turns into an extreme low.

To recap, overall I just feel very alone. I want to have bros, I want to be able to date and talk to people, I want to have just a little bit of goddamn social success. Doing anything in life alone now feels very empty and meaningless. Playing video games, watching a movie, going for a walk, it just all feels pointless if no one is there to share it with me.

I am 21 years old, and I more than likely have about 59 years ahead of me. My life is an estimated 1/4th of the way over and while that should be good news it isnt. It just makes me more depressed. I am an atheist so I dont believe in an after life. At least if I died I wouldnt be able to feel lonely, or embarrased, or intimidated anymore. On the other hand, I do believe that this is the only life we get, and whether I spend it being miserable or whether I spend it feeling happy, in the end it wont matter, so its difficult to convince myself to kill myself throwing away any slight chances I do have of one day changing. But then again, I find it very unlikely that I will ever change. Very unlikely. I dont want to do it anymore. I do think that I am gonna do it eventually. Maybe I should just put a date on it and get the fucking thing over with. If I do I am gonna make it look like an accident because I know what it feels like to have a loved one kill themselves and its a terrible feeling. I say this because I know it would be heartbreaking to my family.

I know I am ungrateful, I know there are people in this world who are in significantly worse situations than me who are still satisfied with their lives, but regardless, how I am feeling is how I am feeling. I am sick of crying myself to sleep every night, I am sick of feeling like a pussy, I am fucking sick of it all.
