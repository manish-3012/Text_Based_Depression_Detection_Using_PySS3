Does anyone care?I'm 17 years old. my life has gone to shit in the past year and idk what to do anymore. 11 months ago my friend killed himself, 6 months ago another friend ODed on his anti depressants, and 3 months ago was Raped by a 40 something year old man named Sean Lyyn Lafferty. I blame myself for it, i don't think i did enough or tried hard enough to stop him. I'm openly gay, and kids at school fuck with me all the time and i have to pretend that im okay at home so my parents dont yell at me. Please, someone tell me what to do.
