Im so emptyMy life has just been a chain of pain. Everything leading me up to this point has been absolute suffering. Ive been abused by my mother my whole life, gained two loads of sexual trauma, recently hospitalised for anorexia, i struggle with self harm too of course. Ive already been so deep in depression. Today i went in and started the last year of school, and i forgot how much of a loser i am. Sat alone by myself in every class because i have nobody to sit with. Its reminded me how worthless i truly am. I am no one. I am nothing. Only in death i would be free. It feels like suicide is just the natural end to my life.
