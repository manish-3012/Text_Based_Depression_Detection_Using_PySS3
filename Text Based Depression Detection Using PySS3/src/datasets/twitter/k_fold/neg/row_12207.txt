Fuck you father.Youâ€™re the reason Iâ€™m suicidal. Youâ€™re the reason I want to be dead. You are not my dad. You abused me. I will never forgive you for it. You took my emotions and invalidated them. You said crying was bad. You didnâ€™t let me be angry. Your ego pisses me off. Everything about you pisses me off. Fuck you mom. Fuck you for everything. Fuck you grandpa, fuck you zach. Fuck you blake. Fuck you Henry. Fuck you fuck you fuck you. Fuck you family. Fuck you Heather. Fuck you Chris. Fuck you all. Fuck you, for not having any emotional intelligence. Fuck you for not allowing me to follow my dreams. Fuck you all for shooting down my ideas. Fuck you all. Fuck you. I want to die. I want this to be over. However, I can change. I can go running more, I can go snowboarding. I can go hiking more. I can go outside more. I can look at the moon more. I can teach myself to love others. Yet I know not how. I can do it. I can do it. I canâ€™t do it. Do I scream? What do I do? Do I have a seizure? How do I kill myself. Where do I go? Fuck you all. But fuck you Allan. Fuck you for not changing, for taking part in all the impulsive behaviors. You can change. You can change. Iâ€™m tired. I think Iâ€™ve reached my breaking point. Goodbye.
