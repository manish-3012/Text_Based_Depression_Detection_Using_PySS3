7 months......It's been 7 months since anyone hugged me. 7 months. It was when I had to put my dog to sleep. He was my best friend. He was my only friend. And now the father of my 2 children and 1 I'm 9 months pregnant with is leaving me here and taking everything with him bc I stood up for myself when he continually leaves us here to go get fucked up and goes out of his way to mentally abuse me. I have been depressed for years and it's been a very verbally abusive and occasionally physically abusive relationship and I can't take it anymore. Now he's laughing at me for crying, calling me a fucking child for being upset and yelling and telling me to decide if I want to stay together or I can get all his stuff together and he'll leave and take everything with him. I can't stop throwing up and I can't eat. He said he's taking the kids for the day and I honestly just want to find a way to kill myself while they're gone. But I have to find somewhere to do it bc I don't want my kids to come home and see that. Maybe that way, if I'm gone, they'll never have to grow up with such a piece of shit mother. All I wanted was a hug.
