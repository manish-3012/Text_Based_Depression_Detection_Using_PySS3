What keeps us hanging on?Guys, I wonder everyday...i seriously ask myself, "if I want to commit suicide so bad then why don't I?"

I mean, doesn't life ever seem like it repeating itself. Like if I stay here there will just be something else that comes along? Another huge battle? Why not end the cycle?

Honestly, why don't I just move to a third world country? South America, Central? Why not just leave my entire life and make a new one?

Fear? Cause I'm afraid? 

I'm asking because on the 7th of December...well it's gonna be a big and shitty day the could destroy the rest of my life. Basically some "holier-than-thou" officers want to punish me for something I didn't do.

Don't worry about that. But why not hang myself just to send a message to them. Why not?
