Telling my Girl FriendI plan on committing suicide but that is not exactly what this post is about. I am looking for some advice on how to handle the issue with my ex girl friend. We broke up about a month ago mutually but we still talk every single day almost all the time and I'm pretty sure we are still the most important people in each other's lives. What I am asking advice on is if I should tell her my plans ahead of time, or leave a note, or just nothing at all. My biggest concern is just making sure she is hurt the least amount possible and understands that she had nothing to do with it. But at the same time I'm concerned that she might try to intervene if I tell her ahead of time. So I just need help weighing the options, thanks ahead of time for the responses.
