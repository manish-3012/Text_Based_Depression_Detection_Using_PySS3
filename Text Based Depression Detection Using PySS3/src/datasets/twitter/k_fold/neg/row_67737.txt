Just wish there was somewhere I could go to get euthanized.Just like a humane way to turn the lights out.  Why can't I just show up a hospital and say.  "I'm good.  It didn't work out."  Hook me up to the injectors, let me hold a nurse's hand.  Ask for forgiveness and just hope the only thing waiting for me is the peace of oblivion.
