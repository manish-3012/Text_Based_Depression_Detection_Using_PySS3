Extreme anxiety over potential crime, advice neededI (19M) have been struggling tremendously with OCD, especially recently, and my recent intrusive thoughts are causing me tremendous anxiety and rumination.

Relatively recently (think a few weeks/months ago), I messaged multiple girls from nsfw subreddits such as gonewild.  Nearly every single time, there was no reply.  However, my mind just thought of something which is giving me tremendous anxiety.  What if the people I messaged were underaged, even though I didnâ€™t know about it?  I always subconsciously assumed, due to those subreddits having an 18+ limit, that I would only be messaging adults, however my mind is going insane thinking that they may have been underaged.  I never thought that I was messaging anybody underaged, and if I ever had reasonable suspicion that a person was, I would never have even thought about messaging them.

I donâ€™t know how valid it is, but Iâ€™m just thinking that what I did is a horrible crime and that Iâ€™m going to get sentenced to prison for multiple years for what I did.  Iâ€™m incredibly anxious that Iâ€™m in some kind of legal trouble due to what I did.  This is my sole cause of the anxiety.  If there is any lawyer or person with extensive legal knowledge, could they please comment and let me know if I am going to go to prison for this.

I swear, I never knowingly messaged an underaged person.  To this day, every person I have messaged, I do not have a single reason to believe was underaged.    All the subreddits that I found the people I messaged were strictly 18+.  Itâ€™s a question of what if.  This is really bothering me, please help.
