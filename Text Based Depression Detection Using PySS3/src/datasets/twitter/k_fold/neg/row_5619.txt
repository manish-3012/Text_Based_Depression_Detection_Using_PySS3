Why are we all alive? Weâ€™re better off deadI honestly donâ€™t know why people choose to live, idk why Iâ€™m doing it. Thereâ€™s no point in anything we do, weâ€™re going to die anyways.

Why donâ€™t we all just end it? End the pain and suffering of living. 

Idc if people care about me or not. Iâ€™m too selfish to care. I just want to end it. I donâ€™t care about the people thatâ€™ll be upset when Iâ€™m gone.
