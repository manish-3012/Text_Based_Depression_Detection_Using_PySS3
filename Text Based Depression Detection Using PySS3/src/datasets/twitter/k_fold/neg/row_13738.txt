Long time lurker, first time poster. I have been thinking about suicidal for a long time. I never thought Iâ€™d be posting here.Months to be honest. 
I have had my number of shitty days and terrible abusive relationships. 
I recently started a new relationship and it has been with the most amazing person I could imagine.
I have never been treated so kindly in my life. 
But I donâ€™t know how to accept the love and affection that I am being given and I have unfortunately pushed them away. 
We just broke up and I have already told myself of it doesnâ€™t work for me this time with someone who treats me the way I should, then there is no hope for me and I am going to end it. 

I know exactly how I will do it, I have played it out over and over again in my head. 
Iâ€™m just not sure when I am going to. 
I feel the urge to do it every day, now even more so than ever and I think that I might finally do it.
