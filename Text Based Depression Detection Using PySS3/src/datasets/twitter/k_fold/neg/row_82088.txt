NoteI wrote a suicide note today.  I know how I want to kill myself.  I just haven't yet.  I'm in my last semester of nursing school, and I'm failing. I'm having a really hard time keeping up with everything.  It's so frustrating because I've worked so hard, but life has been very difficult.  My best friend/roommate is still in the psych ward.  I feel so alone and lost and just like I don't have what it takes to do it anymore.  If I go to the hospital, then I have to wait out school a year.  I've been trying to make it through, but it's been really hard.  I feel like no one will really miss me or care if I'm gone. I know suicide is really selfish, but I just don't know if I can keep on.
