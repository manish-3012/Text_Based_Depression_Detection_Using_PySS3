im 14 and i already wanna die hi, well thats my first post on reddit so idk how to do this properly, anyways, a long time ago (like rlly long) i started feeling like shit, a complete waste of time (around 10 yrs old maybe), i love dancing, singing and talking to my friends but i didnt feel good, didnt wanna do anything (thats just a little bit of context so u can understand whats going). now, i wanna die, literally. literally everyday i think about suicide or murdering someone (dont get me wrong i would never do that cuz imma good person and love helping others) even tho i wouldnt murder anyone, i just like to think abt death. i was the most productive person maybe like a year ago and now i just procrastinate til i have no escape. sometimes i dont remember the last time i had a shower, i dont eat almost anything (i cant even remember the last time i had a proper meal), i always wanna go sleep cuz im always tired and lazy but when i lay down its like going to hell and usually i stay up til 4 am cuz ill be just overthinkin in my bed or on my phone so ill be distracted, i am rlly smart and recognize that, and i am a very extrovert person, i laugh at anything and i dont like that cuz i wanna stay alone and quiet but my extrovert side does not allow me, everyday when i get back from school i overthink abt everything i said even tho it was just a simple joke or a greeting (thats why i dont like being an extrovert) and i am so cringe cuz i am not afraid of doing many stuff that other people are, like talking to strangers or in public or even talking abt period, gross stuff etc. last year people started calling me a goat cuz i climbed a tree and screamed (someone challenged me to do that and i did) and i feel so bad for it, really shouldnt have done that and many other things. quarantine is killing me and i cant go to my therapy. sorry for my english, its not my first language, i just wanted to talk abt this with someone that maybe will understand me..
