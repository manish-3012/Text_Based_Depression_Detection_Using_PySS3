Life and death just are, and neither are immoral or moral.I'm not suicidal, but I just want to say that humans need to realize that life is not "good" or "moral", and death is not "bad". They just ARE. The only reason people have a problem with suicide is because they are so used to their overrated existence and being aware that they can't fathom how someone else would not want to exist. Suicide is natural, just like living is natural and just because someone does not want to live or exist does NOT mean they are mentally ill or not thinking clearly. No one is obligated to live for society and especially for humanity.
