This is it.This is it for me. My dreams have been destroyed, I really don't have anything to live for anymore. 

I have always had trouble finding love, finally a girl I found that I thought was good gave me Herpes. I haven't been with her for about 6 months now and never had a breakout till a few days ago. 

Then my brother comes home and says that he has Shingles (form of herpes). Well that is what the doctor told him because its impossible for him to have contracted the disease because he has been with the same girl for the last 6 years. So now I'm thinking I some how gave it to him. Something I could not bare to handle to tell him or live with.

I haven't been checked yet but I'm going in tomorrow. If I do in fact have herpes which I inevitably believe I do I cannot achieve my one and only dream, which is to be in the military. See you cannot join if you have any type of incurable STD. So that is basically it for me.

If it comes back positive I'm going to kill myself. I'm no longer scared of death because I'm more afraid of living. I will never find someone else to love me, and I would not be able to burden them with what I possibly have.

 I don't even know why I'm posting this right now I guess I just needed to tell someone, for I don't plan on leaving any sort of note with all these details. I guess this is just one last goodbye.
