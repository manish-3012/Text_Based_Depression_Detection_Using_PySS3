I have nothing to offer, I feel guilty for being alive and Iâ€™m a waste of taxpayers money.Iâ€™m a 29 year old â€œhigh functioningâ€ autistic male and Iâ€™ve been living on benefits all my life. I have a severe panic disorder that society likes to pretend doesnâ€™t exist so they can call me lazy etc though right now for the past year or so itâ€™s pretty manageable. However my depression has taken the spot light but strangely that is manageable too and there seems to be a pattern. When Iâ€™m really depressed my anxiety gets better, when Iâ€™m really anxious my depression gets better, probably because they serve as centralised distractions.

I used to be dramatically depressed, very emotionally volatile however I made huge progress with depression around the age of 22, I (personally) saw suffering as a choice from then on and still do now and itâ€™s strange to feel like I might take my life someday but also not feel like Iâ€™m suffering or struggling, I feel disappointed in who I am and my limits, I feel pretty numb but most of all I just feel useless and at worse I feel like Iâ€™m just cheating life playing my PlayStation, doing art and music all with fairly expensive equipment that Iâ€™ve never earned while people have to struggle working jobs they hate. Itâ€™s not fair, I shouldnâ€™t be here, I deserve nothing.

My art and music Iâ€™ve done my entire life and always had at least a glimmer of hope that I could make something of it but as I get older I realise my limits, I know my capabilities and Iâ€™m never going to get anywhere with them and get out of benefits. Iâ€™m selfish for not wanting to work a job that will make me even more miserable, I wanted to be a firefighter but donâ€™t have the qualifications and donâ€™t have the capability of achieving those qualifications as Iâ€™m severely discalcular.

I recently got into a relationship 6 months ago and feel guilty for being her boyfriend because she deserves so much more. 

I wish I could be a better son to my parents who I feel sorry for because Iâ€™m their son and me just being like this makes them feel pity and even though Iâ€™m not a parent I can painfully see what itâ€™s like to worry about your children as I see it in my mother.

Iâ€™ve always fantasised about suicide even as a child after being around two suicides. It feels like a desire in a way and really it feels inevitable.

Iâ€™m nothing, I have undeserved wealth, I donâ€™t get called a scrounger anymore probably because I havenâ€™t socialised properly in almost a decade now and stay in my flat literally over 99% of my time, but Iâ€™ll always feel like a scrounger, Iâ€™ll always feel like an outsider, Iâ€™ll always feel completely incompatible.

I just donâ€™t know what the point is, itâ€™s too selfish to keep ignoring it and enjoying the things I still enjoy and havenâ€™t lost to depression and anxiety.

Thatâ€™s it, I just wanted to say something to someone, Iâ€™m not even sure why because I wonâ€™t really take on board anything anyone says to me because Iâ€™m set in my ways and I know my personal truth and my capabilities.

Thanks for reading though if you did.
