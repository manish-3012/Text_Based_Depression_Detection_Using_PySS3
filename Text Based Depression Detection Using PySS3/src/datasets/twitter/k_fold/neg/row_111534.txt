I let everyone in my life down. My life feels like one big failure.I have severe mental health issues that my parents will never be receptive about. I canâ€™t take care of myself. I opened a business with my fiancÃ©, who I just repeatedly let down over and over again because I canâ€™t remember things. My dad is drowning in his business and Iâ€™m supposed to take the work load from him, but I canâ€™t keep up with it. So Iâ€™m just letting him down too. I have dissociative amnesia, which means I lose entire days to dissociation and I forget important tasks. I have been struggling to stay alive for so many years. And I am so fucking tired.

I find out I have DID, which is a whole new level. I started having these flashbacks of my being abused as a kid, which I have no memory of. So, I could be making it all up, but Iâ€™ll never know for sure. I canâ€™t find a therapist who knows how to treat me, and my last one thought that working on â€œsuppressing my DIDâ€ would be a good idea, which it isnâ€™t. I just had another flashback not even 10 minutes ago, and then I come into work only for my dad to start screaming at me because I forgot to do something (yet again). He doesnâ€™t know how bad Iâ€™m doing. He doesnâ€™t know I have amnesia, or that I am so. Close. To just checking myself into a hospital. I am so fucking tired of suffering. Iâ€™m so tired.
