Felt loneliness before the pandemic. Now it just turned it to 11. I was trying to improve myself socially, til this hit. Canâ€™t help but feel like life is over. Ive always had trouble with social interaction. Trying to meet people and maybe meet a girl.

Things felt like they were coming up. And this hit. I met someone that seemed like something could work out. But it got ruined and she doesnâ€™t text back anymore.

I cant see the light at the end. Doesnâ€™t seem there will ever be one. And even when lockdowns are over, people are gonna be masked and wary of each other.

The future just seems bleak and lonely now. Like whatâ€™s the point? I thought the world was ruined before but now it really feels that way.

I wish I couldâ€™ve been with someone before all this. Im with family but everyone keeps to themselves and it feels like everyone is sick of each other. 
I donâ€™t really have my own place so I sleep in a laundry room. I work from home but my desk is there too. So I donâ€™t have any peace and quiet. Just noise. Washing machine, TV giving room always on. Theres no spot I can go to in order to just rest my mind and think.

I feel like my stress level has been pushed into overdrive and Im starting to feel like I wanna end it..

I know its a pandemic and my experience pales in comparison to people that have actually lost someone. 

I just keep having thoughts about wanting to die.
