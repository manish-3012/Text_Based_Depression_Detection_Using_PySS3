I just got ripped a new one by the president of the company I'm interning for and am going to overdose to tonight.This just happened an hour ago. I intern for a software company and have been for the past 2 months, so I'm familiar with project management stuff. Long story short, the one project that was important to the president, I somehow fucked it up and he literally shouted at me in front of the whole software team for over an hour about everything I did wrong and kept being patronizing and clearly thought i was too stupid to grasp the concepts.

 I'm also a senior in college with a 4.0 but a point of insecurity has always been that the university I go to is pretty low end (in a low income city with a high acceptance rate), and everyone else I work with (literally every one of them) has gone to a nationally acclaimed school that has a very selective acceptance rate. The fact that even with a 4.0, i cant keep up with normal people is pathetic and i feel beyond worthless. On top of that, i am the only female on the software team and I am African American (both things I am acutely aware that people look down on me in my field for being).

There's only so much stupid a degree can cover up. I'm clearly not cut out for being around intelligent people even though I desperately try to learn all I can and be polite and try my hardest, it's not enough. Never enough. The software team would get more work done without me around anyway, I always fuck everything up and need help, they would be faster if I weren't around. They dont even like having me around, I can tell they're all irritated by my mere presence, even though I try my hardest not to annoy them.

I have enough meds to fall asleep and never wake up. I'm done being a failure. I thought for one moment I could maybe be able to keep up but this just showed everyone what a piece of black dumb trash I am. I see now I will never measure up to anyone like them.
