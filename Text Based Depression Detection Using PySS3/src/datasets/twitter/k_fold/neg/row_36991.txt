Loneliness is making me feel horribleI've been single for 6 months now and I don't see any sign of that changing. I need someone to cuddle and watch movies with, hell I miss it so much. I do have friends, but only because I have to see them every day at college. Nobody wants to spend time with me on weekends or during holidays. I haven't been invited to a party since high school 2 years ago. I just feel this sense of unwantedness, I don't know why things are this way. Maybe I'm not the greatest at holding conversation, I do try, but I just feel like people get bored of me within the first 5 minutes. I'm not witty nor interesting to talk to. I guess me and my ex were good because we were both similarly socially awkward, but she left me for someone else. Now I've got nobody. These days I fill my free time with watching YouTube, playing video games, and jerking off. I don't know, it keeps me up at night wondering if things are always going to be this way. If they are, is life really worth living? I want a good social life and all that, y'know. And a girlfriend who's actually gonna stick by me. That'd be nice too.
