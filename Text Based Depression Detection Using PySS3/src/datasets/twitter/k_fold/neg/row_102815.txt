The Abyss has taken me and it won't let goI used to think suicide was for the weak. That I would never let myself fall into such a thing. I never understood why people would do it.
But I have stared into the abyss and now... Maybe I should. 

It's probably very clichÃ© to say, but I feel like I'm the only one like me. A few days ago I came to see a friend under a new light. I thought they were like me. I value the mind above all, and they seemed to do the same. We have been friend for years, and we've shared ideas and thoughts on every and anything. But a week ago I told them about it. 
You see my concept of love is not like most people's. I am the most loyal person you will ever find. I do not enjoy romance, I enjoy the union of the mind. And I thought my friend was like this. She was not.
And now I am lost. It is something I imagine when you find someone you love, and you want to stay with them but this is different. It's like my mind was shattered and I don't know what to think. Without them I am lost. Imagine if the voice in your head suddenly disappeared. With them gone everything also crumbles. Everything I thought I wanted, everything I thought I had under control I realize now that they held my thoughts in place. 

All of what I'm thinking now, I've thought it a million times over, before I met my friend. And she knew everything. She knew more than I could ever hope to know and all I wanted , all I crave is a connection of the mind. It doesn't happen often. Only a handful of times in my lifetime and Everytime they leave I feel shattered. The very first time wasn't so bad because he moved to another city but we kept in touch. 
But this time is worse than all other. It's like being a drug addict but having no more drugs. And these drugs are not ones you can buy. They only happen by chance. 

So now I'm left again with no one to echo my thoughts. All I think is, why me. Why can't I be like everyone else. I deeply want to be normal. Normal people they are content having a relationship, forming a family, having a job that pays well.

I would rather die than have this. I need to do something. Something bigger than me, something that matters. I don't care for family or love. Yet I am ever so stupid that I can't do anything and now I don't even have anyone to talk to. It kills me inside.

Have you ever thought about why we are? I'm sure everyone has come to the realization that nothing means anything all you do is pointless. Yet we forget it quick. Not me. It's all I think about now. I need someone to be a catalyst to my thoughts because I can't escape this by myself. 

I dream to be the savior of the world but I can't even save myself from the knowledge that there is no such thing and that even if there was it would be pointless. I am too stupid to be anyone's savior and since nothing is worth anything then maybe I should go gentle into that good night. 

I know my family will be sad , but over time they will forget. As for me I'm not afraid of death  , I've always been curious about what happens. I'm just afraid that if I live, I will waste my life.
