Iâ€™m so tired.Iâ€™m just weary from life. I get it, bad stuff happens and it gets better. Iâ€™m just tired of bad stuff happening and waiting to get better. Itâ€™s like my life is the same thing over and over again, and I just donâ€™t want to do it. Iâ€™m tired of feeling uninteresting and unattractive and hating my job and doing so much for other people without feeling fulfilled or wanted. Iâ€™m tired of pouring so much into other peopleâ€™s lives when no one is willing to make the smallest sacrifice for me.

I donâ€™t want to spend another sixty years working. I just donâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to quit my job and do something else, I just donâ€™t want to do anything. I donâ€™t want to try to find people who give me what I need, I just want to stop having to worry about my needs at all, because Iâ€™m never going to get those things. I want to just sleep and not have to ever wake up.
