i'm so tired of feeling like thisThis is about the last place I have to turn to.
    Currently, I'm failing most of my highschool classes. I'm doing my best, but to most people, it probably looks like laziness. I've had academic performance problems since the start of middle school, but there's not much I can do about it. I'm depressed, suicidal, and I recently started self-harming again. 
    I don't have any friends I'm close enough to talk to about any of this, and my relationship with my parents is... Strained, to say the least. I probably can't bring myself to /actually/ commit suicide, but the thought of ending my life has come up a lot more than usual (the usual being a couple times a month). I don't expect to live past twenty. 

 I'm exhausted. I just want it to be over. I keep waiting for it to get better, but there's nothing really there for me. None of my skills will be useful in the real world, and none of my interests will help me get anywhere in life. It really does seem like ending it would be a good solution -- If I can't solve any of my simple problems now, how will I be a functioning adult?
