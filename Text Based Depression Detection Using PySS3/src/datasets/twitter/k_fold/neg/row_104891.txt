I feel like hurting myself.I have a past of self harm and a suicide attempt last year by ODing. I've been feeling so crap majority of the year, I'm not able to handle stress properly and I feel like hurting myself. 

I feel like driving and not picking up my phone, I feel like disappearing, I feel like jumping off a cliff, I feel like using a door handle to hang myself. Idk who to tell, if I tell my family then they WILL freak out. Idk if I go to the hospital... I Don't know
