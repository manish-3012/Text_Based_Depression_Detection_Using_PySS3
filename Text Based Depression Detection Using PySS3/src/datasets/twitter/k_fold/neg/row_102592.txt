Dad Was My Hero. He beat me to it. Bipolar has stolen everything I used to love: My dad, Wife, Job, House.My dad took his life in December of 2015 and with the current path and direction I'm on I feel like I'm next.  I'm only alive because I promised my mom i wouldn't do it myself.

Dad was undiagnosed bipolar.  I'm diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. Everyone only cares about when I'm manic. Bipolar has taken everything I cared about and loved. I feel like I'm just waiting to die. No direction no friends no one to talk. I'm stuck and lost.
