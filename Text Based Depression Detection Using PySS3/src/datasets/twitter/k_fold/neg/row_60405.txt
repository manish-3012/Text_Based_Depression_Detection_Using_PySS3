My job makes me suicidalMy job makes me want to die. Iâ€™m an essential worker. Most days I cry at my desk sometimes I cut myself. Iâ€™ve talked to my manager about my mental illness and Iâ€™ve been asked to provide a timeline when Iâ€™ll get better. I canâ€™t get time off to get better or utilize the FMLA. I havenâ€™t even been able to take a vacation day in 1.5 years because of the change in roles/companies Iâ€™ve had. (You must be in the same role for 1 year minimum to take time off or FMLA). I want to die and canâ€™t even get time off to get better. 

Itâ€™s been months since Iâ€™ve been able to get dressed or even brush my teeth in the morning when I do get to work from home. The days Iâ€™m in office I plan ways to die. 

I canâ€™t leave my job because I need to pay rent to my boyfriend. I also donâ€™t want to hurt my boyfriend if I do kill myself.

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore but I feel lost and alone.
