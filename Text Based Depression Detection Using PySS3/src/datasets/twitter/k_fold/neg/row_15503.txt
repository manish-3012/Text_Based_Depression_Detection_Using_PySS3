I need advice on getting adviceI don't know if this will make sense or if it's stupid or not but I need help with it. Well normally with darker thoughts I go to my girlfriend for support and she's really good at helping. Now she's worrying about me and I'm feeling bad for stressing her out. So I'm not really telling her things and trying to hide my problems because I don't want her to worry over me or stress out alot. I don't want her to become taken over by stress because of me, but I don't know where to turn to get advice.
