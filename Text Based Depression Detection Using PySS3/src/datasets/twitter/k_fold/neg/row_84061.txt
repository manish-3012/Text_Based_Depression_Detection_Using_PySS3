Does anyone else answer â€˜Noâ€™ to being asked if youâ€™re suicidal or have had suicidal thoughts recently?Sorry if title is weird. Itâ€™s late and Iâ€™m typing this on my phone so Iâ€™m not very good at articulating. 
Anyways some back-story: Iâ€™m 20F and have probably been suicidal since I was 16. Iâ€™ve been to a mental hospital once in high school and hated it, I went in for suicidal tendencies I guess, like I didnâ€™t attempt suicide but I was afraid I would try something so I told my mom and she took me to a hospital which I was thankful for but at the same time it just wasnâ€™t the best experience. I have a very supportive family especially my poor mother, just writing this out makes me cry because I put her through so much and she never asks for anything from me except that I live and Iâ€™m trying really hard just for her. Ugh okay back to my main point sorry. 

Recently Iâ€™ve noticed that during my therapy appointments I find it easier to just say Iâ€™m not suicidal or have no suicidal thoughts, but this isnâ€™t true at all. In fact I think my suicidal thoughts are returning at full force and thereâ€™s no one I can tell except strangers on the internet. I want to tell someone in my life whatâ€™s happening but Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll get pulled out of college and referred to a mental hospital. This canâ€™t happen again considering I took a year off for my mental health last year. 

I really want to talk to my therapist about whatâ€™s going on but Iâ€™m really worried that as soon as I mention the thoughts sheâ€™ll pull me out, is that what happens? If I do tell her Iâ€™m struggling and suicidal can she really just snap her fingers and have me sent away?? I know she wouldnâ€™t but I feel like I have to be careful with what I say. I donâ€™t know what to do but I donâ€™t want to leave college again, I just want to finish out the year thatâ€™s all I want.
