I hope someone understandsI have a pack of gremlins that cling to me.
No matter where I go or what I am doing,
They are there to tell me what i should and shouldn't do.
Sometimes they'll tell me that I shouldn't leave the bed in the morning, because I have nothing to contribute if I had otherwise done so. They'll tell me to not do any simple thing because I'm reminded of how tired I constantly am. 
They'll tell me that no one cares that I exist, and its why I haven't amounted to anything as a human being. They tell me not to try too hard, that it wont take me far on account of not having anywhere to go. 
They tell me to find that gun in the closet. They tell me to find a secluded place that wont bother anyone. 
They promise that once I feel the pain, itll all go away quickly.

Their voices get agonizingly louder each day. I got the point the first time they've said it 10 years ago and now that things have exponentially grown, I've come to realize my waking moments have all but denied them. 

I think I can go now
