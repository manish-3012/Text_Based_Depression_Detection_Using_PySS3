Death is my only resort.I don't have the capacity to go into details right now and try to explain why I feel the way I do, I'm just to fucking exhausted in every way but feel the need to write something here.

I've struggled and suffered enough for what feels like a thousand lifetimes and I know that death is my only way out of this excruciatingly painful, meaningless, lonely and soul killing existance.  
I want to commit suicide and I think about it all the time but I'm afraid that I'll fail and just fuck things up even more. I'm really scared and I wish someone could just kill me instead or that I could die in my sleep.. I just can't do this anymore.

P.S.  
If you're here to tell me ''it will get better'' or any other clichÃ©s or stupid suggestions to try to make me feel better while simultaneously invalidating my feelings, please fuck off.
