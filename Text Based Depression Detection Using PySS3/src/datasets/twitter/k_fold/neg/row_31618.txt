Suggestions or a guideline to move towards suicideI need to kill myself in a couple of months, but it has been hard motivating myself to do so. I do have a method, jumping, and I sort of envisioned what I'll do that day: drink lots of booze to sort of put myself in a state of unawareness, cover my upper torso in a large garbage bag, and jump.

However, there are a few things I need to do first that are sort of points of no return for suicide, and doing those sober (and getting to the place I'll jump in sober) are really hard. It's not that I don't want to die, I sort of HAVE to (don't bother asking why), but I need that extra push to overcome my instincts.

So what do you recommend? Anyone has any particular line of action in mind? It's hard to ask this question because anyone who has successfully gone through it has, well, died.

And I ask you please not to go to the route of convincing me not to kill myself. Trust me, I HAVE to. Please help me accomplish this, or, just don't respond at all.
