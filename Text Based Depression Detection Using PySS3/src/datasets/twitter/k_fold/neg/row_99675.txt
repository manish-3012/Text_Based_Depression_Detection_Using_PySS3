Definitely not going to kill myself, but I could use a little help :(I'm 15 years old and in high school. I get good grades, I'm a good musician, and an okay athlete. I'd like to think that I'm a perfectly nice person but that must not show through to others. I feel like all my friends are gone. I still talk to them at school from time to time, but I haven't done anything social outside of school in months. Things aren't so great at home, either. My dad gets explosively angry just about every weekend over basically nothing and I usually go to bed crying after these fits of rage. I've talked to the two people left who I thought I could confide in about my depression, but neither of them have made any attempt to get in touch with me in any way since then. I guess that leaves me with nobody. My experiences with girls have been terribly awkward and I can't tell what turns the opposite sex away from me. I spend basically all my free time on the computer playing games and reading reddit and other sites. For some reason I've been watching videos of horrible things: 9/11, people jumping off bridges, Columbine footage, etc. I don't know if it's morbid curiosity or something my brain is trying to tell me.

I know my "problems" PALE in comparison to those of other SW posters, but I just need to talk to *someone* about this. I'm tired of spending so many long days and nights with nobody to talk to. I used to have plenty of friends of both sexes and go hang out with them all the time, and less than a year after that I feel like nobody even cares. I know I'd hurt many people by killing myself, but I think about it all the time. I can't stop it from entering my head.

I'm aware that I didn't really make it clear what I'm asking for in this post. I guess I just would like some advice on how to not feel worthless. Sorry if this made no sense. It's 1:35 AM and I'm going to bed soon anyway.
