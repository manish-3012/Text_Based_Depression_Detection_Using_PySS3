No friends, no family, no reason to liveAs the title says I literally have no friends. My ex-best friends are two faced backstabbing bitches and I haven't made any new friends since. I still don't hate them as much as my abusive parents and sister though. They're all dead to me. All my other family members are strangers since they live in other countries. I have no one. All I do every single day is go to work and sleep. I'm only 20 and I can't imagine having to do this for next 45 years until I retire. And then do what for 20 years after that?

It sucks to say but the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is my dog. I don't want him to go to an animal shelter or anything. He's old though, he'll probably die in the next year or two. And then my time will come. We're all going to die anyway, so since I don't like this part of "existence" why not just skip to the end?
