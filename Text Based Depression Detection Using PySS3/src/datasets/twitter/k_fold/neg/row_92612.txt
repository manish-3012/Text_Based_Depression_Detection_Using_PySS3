Literally no one to helpHey. On mobile, so no fancy format and whatnot.

I just want to start first by saying that I don't have plans to kill myself. At least not today, it's my sister's birthday; it would kind of make me a dick if I tried to commit suicide on her birthday again in the space of three years. 

It's 05:46 in South Africa and I just tried to call the more well known suicide crisis hotlines and all of the counsellors are busy. I then Googled contact details for other such hotlines in the country and they all were also busy.

I don't want to call anyone I know because it's just going to scare them and ruin my sister's birthday if I have to go spend the night in the emergency room again (I did that earlier this year when I felt unsafe by myself).

I'm feeling really, really calm. Not sad, not crying, nothing. I'm just able to make this post because I KNOW that what I'm thinking and feeling is unsafe.

I think I'll be okay today. All bets are off if I happen to find myself on a rooftop of a decent height, though.

Wish me luck.
