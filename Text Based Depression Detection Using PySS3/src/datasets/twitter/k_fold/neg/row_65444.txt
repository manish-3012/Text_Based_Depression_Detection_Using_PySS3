Idk man I think I need to goI can't break off the idea that maybe me ending my life is the best option. I quit my job bc I was miserable and treated horribly, my girlfriend left me bc she just wasn't happy and my family is simply disappointed and never liked me really to begin with. I am scared of dying but what if it's for the best ? No one would care that much a couple hours should be fine if that, really it should be all of 10 mins. I don't want a funeral when I die bc I don't want to be remembered in the slightest and a funeral would just bring people who "cared" about me I don't think my life was a waste I think it's here on accident. So maybe I'm the one exception I know i shouldn't kill myself well I should but people tell me not too but idk I'm just stuck should I buy a gun? Should I hang myself?  or should i actually do something crazy and live this life? I know it'll never get better and I'm ok with that but like I said I'm scared to die. Also I'm not expecting anyone here to tell me anything I just always found death to be the most logical most perfect answer I'll be gone and everyone will be fine and happier it's everything I've ever wanted death sounds like a dream compared to my brief and shitty existence. I think out loud I'm very expressive which is another thing I absolutely hate about myself these are just my thoughts so why not put it on Reddit lol a bunch of strangers can either relate or laugh at my pain I also think I just lost my mind so now I'm just letting the world know I'm fucked I'm ranting my ass off about it bc I'm mad and idk I'll never be given a chance   I hope everyone is having a good day tho and thank you for the time of reading to my very sad pathetic thoughts
