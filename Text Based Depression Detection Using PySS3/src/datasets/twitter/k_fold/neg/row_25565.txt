I have nowhere to go in life. I have nothing to do. And pleasure isn't exactly something I derive from just.. living.I'm 14. I know you're ALL going to say that I'm young and I've got my entire life ahead of me, and the thing is, I do, but I have no direction in my life. I will grow up to be a failure to my parent's expectations, and indeed my own. Living long enough to go to college would just be a continuation of feeling like shit everyday.

I've gotten help, my psychologist says I'm not depressed. I don't know what else to do, really. There's nothing in the future, nothing at all, that makes we want to be there tomorrow, the next week, or the next decade.
