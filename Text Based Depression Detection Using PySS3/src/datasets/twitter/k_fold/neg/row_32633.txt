My marriage just evaporated, my life is endingToday I was blind sided by my wife wanting to separate for issues that I was not aware of and was not given a fair chance to reconcile. I can't imagine how I am going to live the next 24 hours, let alone for the rest of my life. We were together 7 years and I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. And now over the course of an afternoon, my life is over. I can't survive on my own. I died today in all but the literal sense, why not just make it official? I have nobody to turn to, no family. I'm fucked.
