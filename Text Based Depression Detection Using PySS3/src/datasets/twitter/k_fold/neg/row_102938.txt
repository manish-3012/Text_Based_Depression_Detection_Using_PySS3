Help meI want it to end.  This emotional roller coaster.  I want it to end.  I want my life to end.  I am to the point where I just dont care any more. I can't fucking stand it.  I have no motivation to fix myself - not any more at least.  I have no will.  No power.  Nothing. I sabatoge myself and I am beyond repair.  

When I meet a new person, I fuck it up each time.  Especially with the people who invite me to open up.  They aren't opening up a flood gate to a mere river, they open the Hoover dam of emotions.  I tell them thise and they say its ok.  Then?  I am eventually ignored.  I'm so fuckin naive.  I take people assuming every one is being fucking honest - They can't handle me.  I want to do what I can to end it all.  Just fucking END IT.  I CAN'T STAND IT.  I can't STAND THIS PAIN.  

When I am gone?  Fuck it, I'll leave a legacy of pain.  I don't care any more.  No.  I do care.  BUt the pain is too much. Its just too goddamn much. I haven't cut much in the past, but its feeling like a good God damn idea righ tnow. 

Help me.  Some one help me.  I'm unable to help myself now.  I've tried so hard. I fear I have become a hopeless waste of time. Please God, Help me.
