Before I do anything, I hope you may all learn somethingOn a personal note, I'm sorry for being a disappointment to my family and friends. I'm sorry to my mom and dad, my brother and sister, my ex-boyfriend, my best friend... I've been trying really hard lately but it's no use. I've lost all hope. I don't want to wait for the future to come. I don't want to be disappointed and disappoint. I don't remember what it's like to be truly happy. I'm alone in this world. I've only got myself, and I'm falling apart.
I don't think I have a purpose. If anything, I tend to make things worse for everyone, despite my intentions. I'm worthless, useless, a burden. No one needs me or wants me, and I couldn't blame them. I deserve this.

As for the rest of you, I hope you cherish those that love you, especially those who show you their love. As one who has lost the love of those who should be closest to me, it is a huge grievance on my heart, something no one should experience.

Suicide is not the answer for everyone. But I think I could be the exception. I wasn't meant to be on this earth. I have to leave.
