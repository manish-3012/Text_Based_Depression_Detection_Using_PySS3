I relapsedI just have those dark thoughts over and over again. Everything starts feeling to be a chored. Even BJJ a hobby that I love is sometimes hard to get to. I have some anxiety issues everytime I want to go to the dojo. Thus I am starting to think I will be better off dead. I know already how I want to end it all. I went to psychiatry earlier this year. It was a dreadful quasi jail experience. I know for sure I'd be rather dead than to go to psychiatry again. At least when I am dead, I am free.

I thought I was healed. But I was wrong. Life seems like a never-ending hell.
