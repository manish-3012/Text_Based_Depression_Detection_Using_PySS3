I'm done 

I wish I could just tell everyone and have them be ok with it. 

I'm not sure why, but I felt like I needed to write it down somewhere, make it real not only to myself.

I'm gonna end my life sometime in the next 6 months.

I was not made for life, I'm slowly making my peace with that. I had every chance to make a better life for myself, but I made it worse instead.

I chased everyone away when the only one I ever wanted to chase was myself.

It's too hard to change, I'm done.
