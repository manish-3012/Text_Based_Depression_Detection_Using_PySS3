OblivionI made the noose and it works. I hammered the hook into the wall. I deleted all the data on my phone. I wrote the note I wanted to write and I texted the people I wanted to text. I had the thing around my neck and all I had to do was jump off the radiator. I don't know why I took it off and am just sitting here like I'm sleepwalking, looking for solace from strangers like a blind man in the desert. I can't live in this lonely corner I've painted myself into for one more second. But I can't die either. I don't know why. I wish someone would tell me what to do.
