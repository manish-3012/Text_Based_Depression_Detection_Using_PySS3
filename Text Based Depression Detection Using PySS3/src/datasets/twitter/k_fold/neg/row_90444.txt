Would it help if I became a Christian?Or got involved with a faith of any kind? I've seen and read lots of stories where getting into a religion saves people or something. I'm really feeling shitty and have been having thoughts so I'm kinda taking a shot in the dark here.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for pitching in. I'm glad to know there's a community here where so many people are willing to be supportive. I am going to my local church on Sunday with one of my friends, who's also been having issues. I personally identify as an atheist, but I'm not going to get any better sitting here on my computer. Getting out of the house and getting involved with something like this is probably a good idea. Thanks for sharing all your stories as well!
