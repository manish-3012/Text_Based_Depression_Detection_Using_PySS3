My Mom SuperstitionsSince I was little my mother has told me of her superstition of seeing a black crow and having it look at her when someone she loves is going to die. It wouldnâ€™t caw or make a noise, just turn to her and sit for a short time. She told me this never freaked her out or scared her she just knew and waited to hear the news. Itâ€™s early this morning and Iâ€™m in the parking lot of a store stocked up on my favorite drugs hoping to overdose. A few seconds before Iâ€™m ready to back out of the parking spot I see a crow. It sits on top of the shopping cart return section in the parking lot and it just sits. Strange to me but I donâ€™t think anything of it. I get back to my house with the feeling of ultimate nothingness. When my phone rings. My mother. I havenâ€™t spoke to her in a time because I recently wrecked my car. Not as a suicide attempt it was truly an accident one where I wasnâ€™t injured but totaled my car. Her as well as my dad werenâ€™t concerned with me at all. Just the car so I just wasnâ€™t really speaking to them. Iâ€™m 19 and moved out about a month ago. Anyway I get a call at about 8am. She tells me sheâ€™s sitting on the couch (this is strange in itself for she doesnâ€™t usually wake until about 11 or later) she said she was having bad dreams that I had hurt myself. She didnâ€™t specifically say of a suicide just that I took my life. She called and apologized for her behavior. My heart is having stabbing pains. I havenâ€™t taken these drugs. Still want to. Weâ€™ll see. Just a strange story of what happened today. Thank you for your time.
