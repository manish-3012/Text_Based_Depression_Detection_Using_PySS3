My ProblemThis is sorta a throwaway account. A rant - not ment as a pity party I just don't know how to word it  


I am a 21 y/o male. I live in a scandinavian country. First time I told my parents I wanted to commit suicide was when I was 11. Since then my parents and I haven't really had any talks about it. From the age of around 13-17 I self-harmed using whatever I could find to cut my arm, also used to scratch my arm to the point of my arm being raw. I don't want this to be a pity me post, but more of a rant or question. At the age of 16 I went to see a youth-counselor, for my parents - at the time I had told my mother and father about my self-harm, but the counselor didn't help me, nor did he do anything when I told him I wanted to kill myself. The counselor didn't help, but I stopped my self-harm for my parents sake. They knew I wanted to kill myself at that time but did nothing. I don't know what to do any more. I'm tierd of living this life. People only contact me when they want something from me. My parents will ask me how I'm doing from time to time, but I feel weak when I open up. Nothing good came from it when I opened up back when I was 16, so why would anything have changed..   


I graduate my gymnasium here in a few months. Everything about the town I live in is horrid. I have no one, and all I do is feel sorry for myself and hurt myself in various ways, playing it off when asked about anything. I feel so alone, and that makes me so scared for the future. I'm scared that people might forget who I was, Who I am. I want to die, but I am not brave enough to do it myself, nor am I brave enough to ask for help, I feel like it is too late for me. I sit in my room all night, every night, wishing someone would come and murder me, or just take me away from myself.  


What do I do. I don't want to live like this.
