Although I know no one will read this, please help me, I need you.I am a 15-year old male. These past 2 months have been the most I have cried in my life. My friend group split up a month ago and the realisation that they were the only people I regularly hanged out with devastated me. I have been talking to a female friend who doesn't listen to my problems and complains about me. I basically have almost no one to talk to, and I am afraid to talk to anyone. I won't tell my friends I have been feeling suicidal and felt like ending myself, they'll think something is wrong with me and they won't care. I can't tell my grandparents as they wouldn't understand me. I am scared to tell my parents, they'll send me to a mental hospital and they will be mad at me, they'll permanently look at the in a completely different way. I have been feeling so helpless and I haven't left my house for days, which made my situation even worse.

I just need someone to talk to, to help me. Thank you for reading this annoying wall of text. Reach out to me if you are even slightly interested at helping me, thank you in advance.
