I don't think suicide is wrong, in certain contexts.In certain situations, I can see suicide being the logical choice.  If you don't have anyone who loves you, no friends, no job, etc., you're choice wouldn't hurt anyone else.  And who's to say it hurts you?  The fact is, we don't know what happens when you die.  Could be hell, could be nothing, could be your greatest dreams come to life.  It's a risk, sure, but if you think it's better than your current life (which maybe I do, personally), I wouldn't feel ethical about stopping you.

Keep in mind this is only in the context described above, and that's not to mention people with terminal illnesses and the like.  

Anyways, these are my thoughts going into it.  Maybe, just *maybe*, there's something better.  Maybe I'll have a family who loves me.  Maybe I'll meet my lover and best friend again.  Even if I don't, I see no reason to stay here anymore.  I've been battling with these thoughts for over 2 years, and I think I've finally reached a conclusion that makes sense.
