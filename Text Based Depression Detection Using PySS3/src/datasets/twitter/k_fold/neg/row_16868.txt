IDK Why My Brain Is Trynna Kill MeI dont know, I came home from dialysis and there was a check needing to be sent into the bank. I was mad because my dad could not dribe me there because the dialysis day that he dosnt dribe. 

I tryed to take pics of the check for edeposit and it wont take pics for some reason or other. I kept getting madder til I just tore up the check and thought to kill myself. I called crisis line and said "help, my brain is trynna kill me again!" I told them about the check and other things not working today and that I did tear up said check. I wanted to call delivery tonight for somthing to eat.

I cant stand peares that are in the fruitbowl, so I nearly also threw them out. I just wanned something to order, not pares. Pares taste like chlorinated swimming pool water to me. I tryed it out a couple times. So that just added to the problem. And the pics dont do good on the laptop that i HAD. I did end up smashing it. I was so mad, I thought, so you broke the laptop, why not just kill yourself.

Then I called crisis line. Wondered if I should have gone to the hospital. I hope I can get over this one and feel less bad in a bit or so. Yea, I am going to look for counseling.
