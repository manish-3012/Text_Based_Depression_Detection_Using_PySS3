Why live?All I've been thinking about lately is how useless I am and why I shouldn't live. I'm a male and not tall, have a small dick, not particularly attractive and dirt poor. I also have a pretty shitty attitude from anxiety and depression. There's no hope for me in life. I'm just going to live to please other people and to be used for my entire life. Some problems are fixable and everyone says suicide is a "permanent solution to a temporary problem" but it's not. For me, it would be a permanent solution for a permanent problem. I can't convince myself to live even though I don't really want to die, I just can't deal with losing the genetic lottery and basically having natural selection make me want to die. I have white guilt from the liberal media, feel like a burden to my parents and know my family doesn't love me as much as my older brother and feel like I can't compete with my girlfriend's ex's. Can anybody help me or convince me life is worth living even with permanent shortcomings in almost every area of life? The human experience is garbage to people like me and makes people that exceed expectations feel like kings and queens. Therapy is a joke as well I find. People always tell you if you feel bad try therapy and I have and it's just a way for lazy people to take your money to talk to them about your and have them all just tell you the same thing's you've already tried or know.On to taking 6 antidepressants a day and nothing I do is working. Just laying in bed every day waiting for my parents to die so I can finally kill myself; no parent should have to go through the hurt a death of a child gives them.

Tl:dr: natural selection sucks and makes me want to die.
