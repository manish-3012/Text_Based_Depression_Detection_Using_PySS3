I don't know what to do anymoremy online friend is suicidal, self-harms, and has an eating disorder. they lie to their therapist about how they're doing. i tried helping and helping but they ended up blocking me. like i said in a previous post, i did get angry and jealous of them at some points but as we drifted I grew more and more concerned. and i still am.

theyre on the verge of suicide and i can't do anything about it. if i make an alt account and try helping them i feel like i'd do more damage (and it feels like i'm stalking them)

i just don't want her to go
