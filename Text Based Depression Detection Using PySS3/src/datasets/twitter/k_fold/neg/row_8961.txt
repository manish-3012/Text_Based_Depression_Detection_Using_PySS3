Like making new friends, joining a gym or getting new hobbies will change anything.I was told to make new friends start new hobbies joint a gym get a personal trainer so I did all the above to no avail. I then go to a doctor today because my therapist recommended anti depressants. WHAT a big mistake that was the doctor tried to get me COMMITTED!! Yes I want to die but i know that I'm unable to at the moment why does that mean I should be put away how is that going to help in anyway. That's how I came to the believe the world is just undeveloped. One day they might accept people like me.
