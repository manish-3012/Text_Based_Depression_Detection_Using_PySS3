Please kill me (Albuquerque, NM)A few days ago I posted about having a plan. Today came home to discover my bf had moved himself out of our house. He texted me after an hour of my panicking to let me know he was on a plane and that it â€œhad to be this wayâ€.

This man was my best friend, my everything. 

I will give you all the cash in my bank account if you shoot me in the head.

Please, Iâ€™m in so much pain. I donâ€™t have a family, I only have a couple of friends. He was my everything. I donâ€™t want to live anymore. The magnitude of this betrayal is immense; there were no signs it was coming.

Please kill me. I only have a few hundreds but please.
