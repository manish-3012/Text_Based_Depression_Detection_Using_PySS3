I canâ€™t take it anymoreThe person who was my first best friend. My boyfriend of over 2 years. The person who I was the closest to, who knew everything about me. We were two peas in a pod, closer than I can describe. He left me for another woman 7 months ago and came crawling back telling me he fucked up. All my love and attachment and trust came rushing back. He promised me he would never hurt me again, promised me that he cares about me so much and he loves me so much. I tried to talk to him about how I felt on Sunday about what he had done in the past and he blocked me on everything. Tried to have my friends contact him, they were all blocked. Iâ€™m left so confused and lost and hurt. I tried to kill myself on Monday with Xanax and a bottle of whiskey but failed. I think I almost did. I wouldâ€™ve if my brother and his gf hadnâ€™t rushed to find me vomiting and sobbing and passing out. I am so emotionally attached to him and I feel like Iâ€™m falling apart at the core. Iâ€™ve missed this whole week of work. I spend all my time in my bed sobbing hopped up on Xanax and alcohol. Iâ€™m losing it.
