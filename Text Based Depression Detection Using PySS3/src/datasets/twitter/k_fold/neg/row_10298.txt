Want to know if this is a good ideaIâ€™ve been thinking and planning for a while now, trying to find the best way to go. Will try buy as many sleeping pills as I can get, a litre of vodka. Donâ€™t know if I should sit on the edge of a bridge and wait to full in and hope I donâ€™t make it out of the water. Or just swim far out into the ocean until I give out. Trying make sure Iâ€™m not able to change my mind halfway or anyone will try save me
