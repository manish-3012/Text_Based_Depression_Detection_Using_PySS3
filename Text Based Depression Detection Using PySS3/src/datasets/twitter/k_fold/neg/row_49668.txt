"Just get a hooker!"When I turned 18 I did get hookers. I thought either it'll make me comfortable enough with sex that it won't be a big deal and it'll help with the trauma, or it'll make it so I'll realise an apparent mundane quality to it and stop pedestalizing the idea of a romantic, sexual partner.

How blithe of me to forget that my life is just suffering amplified by reminders of what could've healed.

It's bad enough to be a fat, neckbeard incel.

It's bad enough to be a male rape victim.

It's bad enough for no one to take your trauma seriously.

It's bad enough to be utterly unlovable, and for no amount of work to fix that.

I can't handle all of it at once.

I can't handle wishing for someone to share that tragic intimacy with when I can't even accept the reality that I'll die having never kissed a girl.



I genuinely used to think that whole "sex workers won't let you kiss them" thing was a joke
