StuckI'm tired of being alive, but I'm desperately trying to find a way to escape committing an act I can't reverse.. I've been bullied for a very long time both at school and at home. I've always felt less than important because of how heavily I was bullied and beaten. I don't like myself and I'm very anti social. My mom wasn't really around when I was younger, and when she finally settled down, she had another child and I become the middle child. I was abused mentally and psychically by my sister. I've failed college and it took me until age 20 to finish grade school. I've tried doing youtube for money but that has also failed me. I've been on ssi for awhile but I rarely, very rarely get any money from it. My mother claims to use it to pay rent and what not but she has a huge shoe collection, junk food in her room and more. I have no friends and I get no calls. I'm all alone and a failure. I'm 26 years old now. I've been making up personalities online since I was 14 to make friends, but this no longer works for me since morals are in the way of that now. I live with my mother who teases me for having fits or being down. I sleep, wake up, eat, weep and repeat.. I feel trapped and I can't escape this misery..
