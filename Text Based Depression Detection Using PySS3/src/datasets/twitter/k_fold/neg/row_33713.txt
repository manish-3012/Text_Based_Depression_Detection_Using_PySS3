Someone please give me a reasonThe obvious one is that I have a kid, but he is still a baby and my baby mum has already got a new better boyfriend and is pregnant to him while my baby is 12 months old, I am a drug addicted failure, can't stop coke and opiates and I can't hold a job down for longer than a month, now claiming benefits and live alone.
End up drunk and high 4 times a week, considering suicide.
The only thing keeping me going was seeing my boy, saw him as much as possible while working, and when I'm not working, I'm with whenever my baby mum's bf is away. (We never even get close to getting back together).
She's moving away with her bf now, taking my baby with her. I'll be lucky to see him once a fortnight. If I die now he will grow up with her new man as his daddy.
He's a better man than me, better job, less drugs, more confident, there's still time for him to grow up thinking he's his real dad.
