Everything is so monotonousEveryday I just feel like no matter what I fill my day with that its just monotonous and bland and that time just slips away. Minutes turn into hours and hours into the entire day just spent so quickly. I work out and run and play video games and talk to people but its all so boring. Its like I'm just waiting for something, like I am some side character for some story thats about to end. Why do I feel so bland. I have university coming up but I cant even get excited for it because EVERYTHING is so quick and joyless no matter what I do..
