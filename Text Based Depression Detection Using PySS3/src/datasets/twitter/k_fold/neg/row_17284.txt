Just really tiredI usually think about suicide like only once a week for 30 minutes and return to normal. But today that was the only thing on my mind and I couldn't force myself to get out of my chair for an hour. The only thing I did in that time was googling on how to kill myself. Now I'm on reddit exhausted even though I did nothing the whole day. I hate myself because I'm a lazy as fuck and can't put work in anything. I'm really behind in school and skip constantly. I have no hobbies, I'm pretty bad at everything and social anxiety doesn't fucking help. Anyway I made this post to get things of my chest. English is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes.
