I forgot what it felt like to want to die until today.I felt so good for a few months and I literally thought "idk why I ever wanted to die" but then today, that feeling crept up on me... And i remember what it feels like to want to die.

Currently breaking down in the Walmart parking lot just not wanting to put in effort to live anymore.
