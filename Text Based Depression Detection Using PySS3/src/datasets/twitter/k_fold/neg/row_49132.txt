NOT suicidal, but support would be nice.Hi. I'm NOT suicidal. But I need support, and your number 1 guideline says: 'This is a place of support'.

I'm revising for my final year university exams. The problem is: I can't function. My aim today was to revise 4 lectures. I did 1 page of 1 lecture. But then I re-did it, and re-did it, and re-did it. If I highlighted the wrong word, I re-did it. If I highlighted with the wrong colour, I re-did it. If my handwriting was untidy, I ripped the page, re-printed it, and started again. I recognise it doesn't need to be perfect. But if it isn't, I re-do, it's automatic. I can actually feel my brain tensing, fighting the urge to re-do it. But no, I have to. lkjhfwporehg;OHBUQI - FRUSTRATION.

Thank you for your time - you're amazing!
