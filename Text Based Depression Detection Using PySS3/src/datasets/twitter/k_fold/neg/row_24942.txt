The only reason I havenâ€™t done it is honestly so patheticI tried to do it a month ago and didnâ€™t work but when I woke up I thought of something that has stopped me from trying again and itâ€™s so pathetic. In my head, if we are meant to be together in our next life then we canâ€™t die too far apart in this life because then there will be a huge age difference in our next life. So stupid.
