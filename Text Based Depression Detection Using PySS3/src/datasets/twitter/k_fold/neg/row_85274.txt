Do you ever wish some shit could just stay in the past where it fucking belongs?Throwaway_x000D_

At this moment I am on the verge of finding the sharpest thing near me and slitting my wrists. I can't stop thinking about how nice that razor blades looks as it's splitting my skin in half and blood pours out. I want it so bad. I want my past to stay there and I want to move on. I hate when people bring it up and won't let it go. I just think if they are going to bring up the past I will go back to the past and do what I used to do. I need something to take away this pain inside, I need to bleed it out. Sorry for any typos I may have made, I am very very upset at this moment.
