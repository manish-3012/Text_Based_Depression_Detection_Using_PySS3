If life sucks then why live it..."Life sucks deal with it" "Life is unfair"

I think at this point I'm thinking why live unhappy. I am so depressed that I physically can not put in the work to make my life better. I work 70+ hours per week (and that's after getting fired from one of my jobs last month because they scheduled me for another day I was working another job). When I'm not working I'm sleeping. The only good I eat is from McDonald's $1 menu on my lunches. I don't see my life going anywhere. I have no chance of a raise or premotion in any of my jobs. I own so much money for things that I had no control over. I have no one in my life and no time to meet anyone. 

I just don't see the point to living unhappy anymore and I have no foreseeable happiness in my future...
