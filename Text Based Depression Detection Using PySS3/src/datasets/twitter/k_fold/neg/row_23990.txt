DepressingI've been on this forum for about a week now almost every day reading peoples misery to see if they relate to me. I'm almost making myself sick with all the reading and I feel like I'm exhibiting other peoples symptoms. I need to stop ruminating and reading too much into things. I feel for each and everyone one of you and I truly hope we all get the help we need. Life seems so miserable and at a standstill right now. I wish I had something better to stay besides this. I'm no help either. I'm sorry all.
