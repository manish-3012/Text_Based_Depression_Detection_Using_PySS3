Think I'm on the tail end of this boutI'm almost always depressed but the last month has been the worst it's ever been.  I feel like part of me snapped that won't ever heal.  I'm doing a bit better now, though.  I'm just back to my normal depression, which is at least marginally manageable.  I'm not gonna do anything bad.  At least not yet.

Just thought I'd post in case anyone was worried.
