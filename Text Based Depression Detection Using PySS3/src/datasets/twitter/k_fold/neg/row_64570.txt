Donâ€™t feel sorry feel happy for meIâ€™m going to do it on January  1st 2020. My decision is final and hereâ€™s why:

1. I canâ€™t find my place in society. Iâ€™m lost. I donâ€™t know what I should do in the future and all the people I trust donâ€™t respect me. Except for one person but I can only FaceTime him because I moved to a different country. I have plans for the future but they are just impossible to fulfill and knowing that I lose all motivation to live.

2.Iâ€™m a bad person. Maybe even a psychopath. I donâ€™t care about anybody except my dog and me. When I look in the mirror all I see is a depressed loser who doesnâ€™t want to bring anything good to the world. I make kids mad and cry for my entertainment. I donâ€™t care about people anymore. I donâ€™t trust them. One moment they are your friend, the other they bring you down so bad that you stand with a knife in front of a mirror wanting to cut your wrists and imagining how nice it would be in eternal darkness. 
I smoke. Iâ€™m a huge disappointment to my parents. Iâ€™m bad at school I had to repeat the year twice and failed twice. My parents invested high amounts of money for education and I failed them.  I make the teachers mad to the point that they drop my grade from a B+ to a F.

3.My philosophy is fucked up. 
Why are people so obsessed with bad stuff. Drugs, Crime etc. If thatâ€™s what they like why not give it to them. Well they alway talk about famous killers and how they shoplifted something or got into a fight with somebody. Nobody talks about charity or doing good in the world. Well so I thought I kill myself with a message. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do but it will be something very public. Iâ€™m not going to hurt someone physically.


In December Iâ€™m going to start to give all my stuff away to people who need it and on New Years eve, after I experienced the change of a decade and hear the fireworks all around me Iâ€™m going to die and my life would be fulfilled without fulfillment. Thank you for reading. And you wonâ€™t hear about me after the start of 2020 anymore. Have a good day or night and I wish the best to you and hope you donâ€™t end up like me.
