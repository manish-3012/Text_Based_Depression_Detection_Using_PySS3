I am fucking miserableAnd it's driving me bat shit crazy. I feel like I want to open up to a woman I really like hell love.  She is super sweet and kind but my gods be damned anxiety keeps me from saying any of my feelings to her about it. I just don't know how to get over myself and just tell her how I feel. Sometimes it would just be easier to write a software program than tell her how I feel. This misery will not end. Death is easier than suffering I just want to be happy for even ten minutes I can't continue to suffer like this. It will kill me
