Can anyone relate ?So I recently cut off all the people i considered "friends", and it is for several reasons. I have already lost plenty of friends in the past, and it has hurt me although it shouldnt. I am 22 now, and I'm just fed up with always being there for people when theyre feeling down but them not really even hearing me out when im going through shit. I hate that the only time I hang out with people is when we all drink, which alcohol is indeed ruining my mental health as well because I am an alcoholic. There are plenty of other things that make me want to cut off all these people but those are the two main things, also because i want to cut them off before they cut me off and i do think it will happen because theyre really not good people. What I plan is to let life bring me to better things through me going to the gym more often, and finally starting college again next semester. I'm hoping i might meet new people or get into better hobbies. I have also decided to stop smoking and drinking since i dont enjoy it at all anymore. i do also want to get a new job soon but feel as though i am not ready but we will see what happens. Anyways, im hoping anyone can give advice or share similar experiences where they just cut off a bunch of people, thanks for letting me share :)
