RamblingThis year. Fuck this year. Life does this thing to me where it dangles what I want most right in front of my face and then just when itâ€™s within my reach itâ€™s snatched away from me and I thrown back into the same cycle of hating my life and telling myself that itâ€™ll get better eventually. Guess what? It doesnâ€™t get better. Ever. Existence is suffering. There is no good and evil. There is no morality. There is no love. All these things that we are supposed to believe in are simply illusions that keeps us from noticing the pointlessness of life. Love is the reason Iâ€™m forced to continue this wretched existence. Because my family loves me I have to keep existing even though I donâ€™t want to. Every second that Iâ€™m alive is a struggle. The only things that distract me from the truth are drugs and porn. Things that provide a momentary release from the void. This is my reality. This is what life will be until I die. Hope and love are demons too, we just donâ€™t realize.
