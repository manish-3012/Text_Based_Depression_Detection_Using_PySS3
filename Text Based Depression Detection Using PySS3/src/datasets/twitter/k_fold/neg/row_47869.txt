Does anybody else here feel the way I do?My immediate life isn't that bad. I am unemployed, but I have an amazing gf who also doesn't want to have kids. I have animals I love. I have endless entertainment. I have been completely unsuccessful at making friends. I have been unsuccessful at enjoying this existence. I have been completely underwhelmed by the people I come in contact with(online and in real life) I fucking hate everything. I don't belong to this world. I want an exit. Please convince me that everything is ok. Why does everyone seem so insane to me?
