Did I do the right thing?So a friend of mine was saying some pretty peculiar things.  He'd just received some pretty awful news and was saying things like, "It doesn't matter anymore..." and "The reason why I stayed with you guys is because you were holding me together." Then despite my persistence he demanded to be left alone.  After just saying the reason he stayed with me in my tiny dorm room was that it helped him hold it together he demanded that I leave him alone.  So, after many attempts to change his mind, I left him alone but followed him while he went for a walk.

Both of us are currently serving in the military and we are trained constantly about situations like these and a lot of bells were going off with these being key words to listen to and not leave him alone.  So, while really conflicted because of the ramifications of letting my chain of command know the situation, I made the call.  So right now he's with my First Sergeant as well as Flight supervision talking about I don't know what and I feel really guilty about the whole thing.  

What if he really wasn't going to do anything?  I could have tarnished our friendship permanently for bringing this up to people that he didn't confide in.  How can he trust me with personal things like that again without being worried I'll just panic and make the call again?
