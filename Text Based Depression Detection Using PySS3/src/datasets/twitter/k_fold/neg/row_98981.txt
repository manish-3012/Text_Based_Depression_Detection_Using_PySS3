the only way iâ€™ll ever be worth something is when iâ€™m food for the wormsnobody wants to be my friend once they get to know me. iâ€™m too intense. iâ€™m too loving. iâ€™m too annoying. i need too much validation. anytime i meet someone and form a close connection with them i scare them away. i get attached to people too fast. i have borderline PD and if i wasnâ€™t like this i would be worth more. if nobody cares about me and nobody loves me and nobody wants to get to know me then i shouldnâ€™t be alive. i want to be dead. i want to be fucking dead. let me bleed out.
