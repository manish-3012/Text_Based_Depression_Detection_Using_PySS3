If I donâ€™t graduate fix my grades and graduate this year, iâ€™m not going to make it to college. If i donâ€™t make it to college, Iâ€™m quitting all of it.I have 2 Fs, a D and two Cs. Graduation isnt looking likely, my entire immediate and extended family is pissed, and my friends are drifting away for the millionth time. 

Graduation is in three months and isnâ€™t looking likely. So good job whoever cursed me, you win this time.
