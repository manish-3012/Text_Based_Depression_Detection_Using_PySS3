I have no clue what I could do other than dieâ€¦For many years now I was a quite bad person. And I hide myself behind a wall of fake emotions. But obviously this canâ€™t be the best solution for a living. I guess there is no meaning of life or anything like that, but I thought it might be my duty to make the best of the situation. And so I became nicer and more open to the world. And what happened? The world f***ed me hard. I feel like Iâ€™m losing most of my friends and I donâ€™t have any clue of who or what I am. Iâ€™m getting even more depressed than during the time I was an big asshole, but I donâ€™t have any ideas what I could do other, than commit suicide. And for the record: Iâ€˜m really a horrible and socially destructive person. Just a waste of timeâ€¦
