I only feel good in my imaginationIsn't it sad? The only time I ever feel hope or even happiness is when I daydream. My recent fantasies involve winning Powerball (a lottery) and imagining what I would do with the money. How I'd finally be free and have a place to live. How I wouldn't have to be a wage slave living under the authoritarian control of employers any longer. And so on.

These fantasies are really detailed too. What would I do first? Would I dare tell anyone or would I keep it secret. Where would I buy my house? In the US? EU?

The delusions are strong. I've already blown $50 on lottery tickets. I know I will likely never win but it's that sliver of hope that keeps me going. That ever so slight chance of finally achieving true power and freedom.

It's the only way my life will get any better as it is unsalvageable at this point. It'll be back to reality soon enough, where I get to live in grinding poverty and decide between killing myself or just walking away from everything, giving myself wholly over to Fortune and starting anew.
