I'm scared.I don't know what to write here but i've lurked awhile, have another throw away on a venting subreddit.

But I want to do it so much. I've written multiple notes and had them in diffrent envolopes for multiple people to say my goodbyes, I waited by the side of a closed off section of the train tracks, I know the times of the trains off by heart  phone in hand ready to call 999 to report a suicide at the last moment, and to give my name . A train went by and so did a couple more, im just to scared to do it. I couldant cry, I didn't feel stupid, angry, upset,happy ect i just felt scared and I don't know why. I'm not scared to die so i couldant work it out.

So after a few hours I came home destroyed the letters via burning, I want to try again but i know the same thing will happen it happened 2 years ago too. I chicken out at the last second and then just feel nothing after. I feel like this isent relivent for other subreddits but I had to say somthing.
