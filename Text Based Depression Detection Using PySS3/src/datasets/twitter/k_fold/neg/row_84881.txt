Did stopping your meds make you suicidal?Iâ€™ve been on some form of antidepressant for six months. Recently, I stopped Cymbalta cold because it was giving me nightmares and I was losing sleep. I now experience suicidal thoughts almost constantly. My meds were prescribed by my PCP and I stopped because I felt like he threw random ones at me without taking into context my actual situation.  I have a history of being anxious and depressed, which I think stems from a painful childhood. 
Iâ€™m bulimic, Iâ€™ve self harmed, and Iâ€™m currently helping to take care of my mom with dementia. Sheâ€™s only 53, Iâ€™m twenty. Because of this, Iâ€™ve had to quit my job and Iâ€™m broke, and now I have gone from a 3.7 student to failing my classes across the board. I feel as though I have nothing left to live for.  Part of me feels like itâ€™s situational, but I feel bat shit crazy being off of these meds. Yet, I donâ€™t want to be the person who needs antidepressants to function. 
I just feel like it would be easier to stop waiting for my mom to die and just kill myself instead.
