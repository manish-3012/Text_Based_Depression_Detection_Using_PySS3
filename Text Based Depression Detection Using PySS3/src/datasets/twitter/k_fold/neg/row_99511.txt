Iâ€™m pretty goddamn sure no one would notice if I was deadI went on tinder and swiped right until it said Iâ€™d run out of people to swipe right on and didnâ€™t get a single match. Didnâ€™t really care just wanted to prove that no one wanted me

Went on Facebook and messaged every person I knew â€œhey whatâ€™s upâ€, every person on my friends list, no one responded

Did the same with every number that wasnâ€™t a family member. Nothing

Nothing nothing nothing

Nobody knows I even exist

Nobody knows

Nobody
