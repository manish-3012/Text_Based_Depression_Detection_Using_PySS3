What do I have to live for?I no longer have contact with my dad, and now I feel like my family is slowly starting to hate me. What do I have to live for? Myself? I never cared about myself. I care more about the people around me than myself.  I love my family more than my own life. Now that they don't like me, what do I have to live for? What is really bad about ending my own life? Sometimes I wish something would just strike me down, some natural force so it wouldn't seem like I was killing myself. I wouldn't kill myself, nor do I plan to but seriously, what the fuck. I don't want to live anymore. I will continue to live, work and do whatever we humans do but I don't have a will to live. All I want is something to just end me. I am fucking miserable.
