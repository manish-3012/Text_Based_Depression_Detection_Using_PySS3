one more week til I get to party in heavena year ago I made a post here. I was told to stick around for another 365 days and if my life didnâ€™t get better, i could at least kill myself on good conscience that I had at least gave living a go for another year. 358 days have gone by and if anything my life has gotten worse. Iâ€™m at peace with it though. I took the advice and Iâ€™ve given it my best shot. just one week. I can get through one week.
