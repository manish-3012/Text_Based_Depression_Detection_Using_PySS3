Iâ€™m just so tiredHi, Iâ€™m kind of nervous so this may be everywhere. 
I have no one really to talk to because I either push them away or tell them too much to where they donâ€™t want to be associated with me. I have no friends, so no one to mourn me if I die. I have an intense fear of abandonment, which has gotten so bad to the point where I would do reckless behaviors in order to keep someone from leaving me (they always end up leaving anyways). 
I also have no social skills, so Iâ€™m extremely awkward. I canâ€™t hold a conversation and Iâ€™ve been told I donâ€™t talk about anything so people use that as an excuse to not talk to me at all. 
I feel like I was handed the short hand of the stick in life. Every bad trait that you wouldnâ€™t want in a person is me. And I try to pretend like I donâ€™t care but that only makes me feel worse. Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts more frequently, but Iâ€™m scared to voice them because I know people are tired of my shit. Iâ€™m tired of it too.
