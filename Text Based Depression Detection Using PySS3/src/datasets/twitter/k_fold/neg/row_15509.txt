I literally see nothing for myself beyond 22Iâ€™m 17 years old and iâ€™ve been battling depression the past 3 years now. My weight has fluctuated so fucking much and it only adds to my insecurities. Iâ€™m riddled with bright purple stretch marks and I keep on begging my mom to get them microneedled because I canâ€™t stand looking at them. Iâ€™m supposed to be looking at colleges. I canâ€™t stop crying and cuddling with my mom. I thought i hated school until we had to go to online school and I canâ€™t be surrounded by friends or just people in general. I have so many regrets and Iâ€™m trying to not focus on the things on the things i cannot change but itâ€™s so hard sometimes. I worry about never finding love or new friends or happiness. Sometimes I wish I could just be an orphan so i wouldnâ€™t have to worry about anyone missing me if I were to commit.
