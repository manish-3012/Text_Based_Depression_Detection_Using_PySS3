NothingIâ€™m just done. Iâ€™m done with everything including myself. Iâ€™m done with the past, present, and future. Iâ€™m done with rude hateful people. Iâ€™m done being discriminated against for being lgbtq. Iâ€™m done explaining myself and dealing with hate. Iâ€™m done with my ptsd(Ive been diagnosed for the people who like to call everything fake). Iâ€™m done with years of trauma just to probably experience more. Iâ€™m done with being in an abusing relationship and not know really what the best bet for me is. Iâ€™m done not having a family who truly cares. Iâ€™m done feeling lonely and bitter. Iâ€™m done with politics. Iâ€™m done caring what others think. Iâ€™m done with this fucked up hateful world. 

Im â€œdoneâ€ so I say but I still have a smidge of hope in me somewhere and thatâ€™s what really breaks my heart. I have moments where I tell myself that things could go in any direction and that maybe Iâ€™ll eventually find the path for me. Itâ€™s not that I want to die. I just want to be able to live and not only in constant misery. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting on here. Itâ€™s not like it even matters to anyone anyways. Iâ€™m just another anonymous stranger online that is complaining of how bad my life sucks. Im not saying Iâ€™m going to hurt myself. Iâ€™m just exhausted and suicide keeps coming into my mind over and over without anything even setting it off. In general itâ€™s always there in my mind waiting. Why canâ€™t I just be happy, and not be used and abused by life, people, places, and myself? 

Anyways, I guess Iâ€™m done writing this out. Good luck to whoever... oh and by the way, please be kinder to others if possible. You never know whoâ€™s on the edge waiting to jump or back up.
