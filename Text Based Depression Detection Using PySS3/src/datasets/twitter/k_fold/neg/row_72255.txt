I want to commit suicideI want to commit suicide. I see I've gotten myself into a lot of shit and I am shit so I just want to die.

So a while ago I signed up for a volunteer position at my college. I forgot I signed up for this and didn't finish my tasks as I was asked to.

I told my parents what happened and they were angry. They said they had advised me to check the schedule and get started on that volunteer task but I never properly got started.

They called me out for being a jerk even though that wasn't my intention. I got angry (we were having lunch at a restaurant) and I started shouting and banging the table. They were extremely angry. Now I just want to die and kill myself.
