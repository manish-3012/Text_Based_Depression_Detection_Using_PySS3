When am I really an adult ft. Is it my fault or theirs?My mom asked if I was looking for a job because, y'know, once I hit 18 I'm an adult and capable of doing adult things. Like I haven't told her and everyone else who asked how bad I wanted to kill myself when I was in SCHOOL. 

The idiot doctors think the same way, they've asked if I've been socializing, how school is going, what I plan to do after school ends like every minute I'm awake isn't spent thinking about how much I'd **love** to cover my room walls in my blood. 

I've told them that their stupid pills don't work, they said that **I** won't notice changes but **they** can _(the months before they said they weren't magic pills and wouldn't help me)._
I said I wanted to start testosterone and they said that I was too unstable and would have a higher risk of killing myself if I started now _(after telling me months before that the pills **ARE** helping me and I'm getting better)_

So how the fuck is everyone going to hear me say I want to kill myself then say _"we hear you and we understand, anyways you're almost 18! any plans for the future?"_.
The real kicker for me is that these professional idiots have heard me say _"I hate living"_ and _"I stopped taking the pills"_ then believed me the next month when I said that _"everything is ok"_ and _"I've been taking the pills"_.

In the last 5 years I didn't change my mind about being transgender, so why do you think I'll change my mind now? I've told them all how I feel and it's always been _"oh but you're not old enough to decide"_ and _"you're not stable enough"_ 

Now they ask me about my uncertain future as a functioning member of society, as an adult? What makes me old and stable enough _now_?

I warned them all a _VERY_ long time ago that I didn't think I was worth so much trouble because I'm sure I'll be dead before 25, and they decided to try anyway. Now I'm in my room, wishing for a final push.

It's really funny. My mom is pissed because I told her I spent the whole day cutting myself, I wasn't even going to tell her. She said that she was glad I stopped messaging her to tell when I feel self destructive, it got to her head and she thought my depression was gone. She took most of my sharp things, it's ok though because I have 2 she **doesn't** know about.
