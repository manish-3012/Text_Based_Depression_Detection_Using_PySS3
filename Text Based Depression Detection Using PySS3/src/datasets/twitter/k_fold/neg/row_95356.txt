I accidentally my lifeI'm nearing 30 with half a brain, meagre savings and  close to no recollection of my twenties. My back is covered in scars from boils, and my ass is covered in boils. My mom is sleeping in her own piss from cheap vodka. I'm not sleeping much.

Spent the last decade doing drugs to feel something and making money to get my mom's quality of life to the point where she doesn't have to worry about anything. She didn't have to work for years and needed for nothing. Drinking only got worse and now my brain is fried. Been clean for months, still can't think straight or recall much. Might lose my job soon. 

I always knew I needed to exercise, but my longest run in over a decade has been 3 months. Watched all the videos, made lists, bitched on forums, even went to church. Never really got in shape. Never really helped my mom. Never had a relationship or even felt love. Never had creative success. 

I really don't think working through all that is worth it or is something I'm even capable of. You can only hate yourself and do nothing about it for so long before realizing you actually can't. Some people get taken out in car crashes and freak accidents. Some are just born weak-willed pieces of shit headed for a miserable life. Someone has to serve as an example. I'm making some orders online.
