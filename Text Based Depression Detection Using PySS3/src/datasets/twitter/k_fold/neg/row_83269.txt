The thought of ending it allIve started writing my letter and my noose is ready to hang myself from the tree out back. Im 25 and have given up all hope.  Ive been to the hospital several times and at this point its just embarrassing to go again. I don't want to burden one of my friends knowing they were the last person to talk to me and knowing that there was nothing they could do. I guess this is the last miniscule sliver of hope in me thinking something might change but ive held on to this sliver far too long with no change.  The sliver just works its way deeper and deeper like my razorblade has in the past.

I know it will hurt alot of people to see me go but i feel that if they read my letter they will understand and not hold ill will towards me
