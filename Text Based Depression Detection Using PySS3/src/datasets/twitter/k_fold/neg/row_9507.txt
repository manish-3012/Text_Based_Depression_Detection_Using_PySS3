My friend whoâ€™s a minor is being refused medicationThey are suffering from daily anxiety attacks and being overwhelmed 24/7. This has made them extremely suicidal and their parents and grandparents are refusing to get them medication. This is taking place in the US and Iâ€™d really appreciate if I can get information on how to help them see a doctor. Also Iâ€™m 18 in case thatâ€™s important information.
