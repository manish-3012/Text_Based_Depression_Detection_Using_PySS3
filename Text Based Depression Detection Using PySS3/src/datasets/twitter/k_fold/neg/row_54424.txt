i don't belong hereI've had suicidal tendencies in the past-- not actionable, just... didn't want to be living anymore. Didn't want to kill self, because of all the bother that would be, but I wished somehow I wouldn't be forced to go on-- two years ago i twice acted on an ex calling my bluff to walk into traffic. I'd been cutting at that time, just to remind myself I was made of flesh and blood. 

Cut to now-- I have a too-good-to-be-true boyfriend who will be deploying abroad, not for very long, but we've been together about six months now-- I find myself attached, loving him, and absolutely terrified because of it. 

I'm beginning to realize now that I will never be ok. 

Everything in my life is good-- I finally got un-unemployed and have a good steady job. I have a good boyfriend. Nbody around me is dying, and if I could just force myself to give a shit, I can move forward. 

But I know there are parts of me nobody in the world can't touch. The wider universe frightens me, and contemporary society disgusts me. I disgust myself because I know I can't change myself or society for the better. 

I have nothing of value to give back to the world, and nothing beautiful to add to it. I'm selfish and immutable. 

I shouldn't get married or procreate because I would only ruin lives-- so what's the point of going on? I'm too weak-minded and lazy to continue on, and all the fuckall good I'd do trying to give my physical life more meaning will only lead to more scorn and despair. I know this, because I grew up as a fucked up missionary's kid. 

I'm not quite sure why I'm posting here, so feel free to ignore. Maybe somebody will find this one day and use it to figure out why I was so goddamn miserable.
