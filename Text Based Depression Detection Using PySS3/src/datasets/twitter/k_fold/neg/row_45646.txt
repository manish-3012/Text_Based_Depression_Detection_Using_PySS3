Here once againIâ€™m just in pain. It really feels more and more like my mental health issues are terminal. I donâ€™t know what to do. It feels like everyone gets bored of me tbh bc I keep just losing people. This guy seems into me but now Iâ€™m not so sure, I thought finally, something good. But life just fucking sucks. I donâ€™t know if I really want to be here anymore.
