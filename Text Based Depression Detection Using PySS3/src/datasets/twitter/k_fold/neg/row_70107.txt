i want help... i don't know where else to go.I have a hard time talking to people about how I'm feeling... At times I usually don't speak to even my parents about how I'm feeling but lately I've been feeling suicidal... I hurt myself purposely to feel something. Right now I'm just dead inside and out like I'm a ghost. I look at everyone like they are speaking another language and I just don't want to take the time to translate or understand because even if I do like what can I do to help.. I'm useless to my parents, siblings, "friends", and my boyfriend. I don't know what to do and I feel like I already talked to much about it with the ones I at least trust so I don't want to let my anger and sadness get on their nerves till they don't love me anymore.. idk if other people feel this way.. I just I feel so hopeless.. I'm tired of crying at my job, in the shower and at night when everyone is asleep.. I want to have friends that understand and appreciate me even when I'm down..  I just want to know I'm not alone with these problems... I feel so alone.
