I wish no one liked meThen I could just end it all and no one would be bothered. But I feel so obligated to stay and try to be remotely happy for the people who care about me. 

I feel shitty and selfish, especially since I've been so content for the past month. My family deserves better than another relapse but I can't give them better, and I can't kill myself because they'd be devistated. I feel so trapped inside myself, like I'm drowning in my own thoughts.
