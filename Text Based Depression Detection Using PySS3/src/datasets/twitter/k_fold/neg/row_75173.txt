first time in my life i'm considering suicide, i live alone and i'm gonna get fired from my jobi live in santiago (chile) working as a programmer,i'm 34, my family (parents and brother) lives 3000km away
i don't want to be an economical burden to my parents again :( , i'm desperate and i don't have anyone to talk to ::(::
my job search is going to be horrible at my age, i don't what to do, my dad is coming here to visit in two weeks... i dont want to tell him, i don't want to make them worry, i don't want to be a disappointment....
for the first time in my life i'm thinking they would be better off without me, i feel like a total failure
please someone ... i feel like i shouldn't exist
