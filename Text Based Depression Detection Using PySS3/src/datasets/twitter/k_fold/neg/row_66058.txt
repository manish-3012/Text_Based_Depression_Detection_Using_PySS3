I have 5 years to donate as much blood, organs, and hair as possible before I do it.Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My father killed himself when he was 34. I was 3 at the time. I'm 30 years old now. I've been sexually, mentally, and physically abused in my younger days by both men and women. I've never had a good and loving relationship.

I've struggled with depression my entire life. Not the "can't get out of bed, low energy" kind of depression but the "I just ran up a mountain and I should feel good but all I want to do is jump off" type. My highs are \*always\* followed by even deeper lows. I've tried meds, several kinds and dosages. Meds are like Lake Missoula for me; they hold a lot of stuff back but eventually it breaks and all the growth is wiped out.

I thought losing over a 140 lbs would make me happy. It didn't. I thought becoming a long distance trail runner and becoming a mountain guide would make me happy. It didn't. I thought getting out of tech and working with people would make me happy. It didn't. I thought being a sport camera operator would make me happy. It didn't.

Despite all my best efforts I am not a good person and I've struggled with this my entire life. I have bad thoughts constantly but I don't act on them. This causes me a lot of guilt. It's crippling. I've never seen a future for myself and it's why I never finished college, despite being intelligent and curious. I think in the short term because honestly I've always thought I'd kill myself. I've been sure of it since I was a pre-teen.

So I came up with a plan. I'm going to donate my kidney first, then a part of my liver. I've been growing my hair out for over a a year and I'll be donating that as well(if possible, I know it can be selective). I'm a registered organ donor as well and I'll be committing suicide in a manner that will my major organs in good condition. The kidney donation is already setup and I'll be flying out there in a few weeks. I don't know the recipient. Really I don't want to meet him. I've had his phone number for a month and I've yet to reach out to him.

I can't tell anyone in my life about this for obvious reasons. I've been thinking about it for over a year and I'm pretty content with this plan of action. It feels calming. I know I won't have to go through this anymore once I'm done.
