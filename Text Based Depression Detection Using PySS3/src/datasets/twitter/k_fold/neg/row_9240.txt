Im posting this on my main account. I don't care anymore. I doubt I'll make it to the end of the year.As I write this I'm not really feeling a whole lot emotionally. Physically I sort of feel like crying even though I just feel numb. It's a strange feeling.   


I have no real plans to hurt myself, but I've kind of given up. I barely get out of bed most days now. I'm kind of just letting myself wither away at this point. In the past month I've left my apartment maybe 3 times, to get groceries. Can't get myself out most of the time honestly. 

My family doesn't really seem to give much of a shit about me. I think it would take actual weeks for them to find me if I were to die. I've expressed so many times that I'm really \*\*\*NOT\*\*\* doing so great and that I'd really like to move home - not even permanently, maybe for a couple years. I just can't stand living alone anymore. I miss my family but I get shrugged off by them all. Or ignored. My mom keeps saying "We'll talk about it" but really what she means is we're not going to talk about it. She's saying that to get me to shut up. I really have no redeeming qualities, can't hold down a job (my record was about 9 months, woo fucking hoo), I can't fucking socialize like everyone else, there's literally nothing to live for. I used to get joy out of eating good food but now I don't even get joy out of that. I'm just fat and food has become a crutch. I want to starve myself but my fat ass can't go a god damn day without shoveling some garbage into my face.   


I know me dying would hurt my family a lot but why should I have to suffer like this? I contribute nothing to society, family only contacts if they really need something, I have no friends. I think the earth would be better off without me in it.

Too bad I'm too much of a fucking coward to kill myself.
