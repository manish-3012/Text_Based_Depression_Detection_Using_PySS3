It seems fitting I die on the same day I was born (11th June)I feel like death has been calling me for the last couple months. Like It wasnâ€™t even intended for me to exist on this wretched earth. Iâ€™m tired of living solely to exist with no meaning or purpose.   

These thoughts have been amplified as my 19th birthday approaches making me think what Iâ€™ve even achieved in my inconsequential life. If I die tonight then people will only have to mourn me on one day as my life comes full circle, I mean I wonâ€™t get this chance for another 365 days right.   

Atleast Iâ€™ll  find out if there is an afterlife, if heaven or hell really exists.
