Why am I never good enough?Thereâ€™s a numbness that iâ€™ve built up when I look in the mirror and feel so worthless. I try so hard to be strong for my friends &amp; my father but I donâ€™t know if using them as my fire will be enough. Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to work on the positives in my life but the only thing I feel is my head tell me I should just quit. So many losses. So many goodbyes. friends that should still be here &amp; the one I wanted to marry. I think of you every day, wake up &amp; cry because Iâ€™m still breathing &amp; I have to look at my own reflection again knowing Iâ€™m stuck in my own head. I want so hard to achieve my dreams but every night is getting harder to make it thru. Every night something tells me to just end it all and stop the suffering. I donâ€™t want to say goodbye to my friends or my dad but I just want to close my eyes and go to sleep forever. Please just take the pain away
