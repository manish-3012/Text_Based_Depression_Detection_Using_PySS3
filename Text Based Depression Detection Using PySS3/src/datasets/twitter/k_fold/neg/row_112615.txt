I feel like a failure.I feel like I'll never make any progress in my life. I can't stop thinking that I don't matter, no matter what the thoughts always comes back. I've had therapy a few years ago but it made it worse. I haven't told anyone about this and as far as I know no one else knows. I keep making jokes about it to cope. Whenever I've tried to kill myself or self harm I can't bring myself to do it which makes it worse.
