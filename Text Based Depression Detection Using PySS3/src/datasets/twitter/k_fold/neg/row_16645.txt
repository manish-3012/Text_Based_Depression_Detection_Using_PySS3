I Don't Know What to Do AnymoreI'm an insufferable asshole. I love my boyfriend but I don't know how to show it and he thinks I don't. My family thinks I'm lazy and I just lie to get out of things. Whenever I try to be happy it never works out. Meds don't do shit, but I still take them. I've been in therapy for like 6 years and things have just gotten worse.
