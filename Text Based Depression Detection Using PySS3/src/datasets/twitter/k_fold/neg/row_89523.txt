Why do i always do the wrong thing?All throughout my life ive made terrible decisions. Almost exclusively. My wife thinks im how i am because of my mom trying to kill herself a few times my junior year of high school causing us to move out of state. Yeah that whole mess fucked me up but i mean ive always just done the wrong thing. I lie like its my job. Even about little shit. I get terrified if things start going good because thats usually when shit hits the fan. Im self destructive in every way.  i KNOW whats right and wrong and i choose wrong. I do what i want regardless of who i hurt. I dont do drugs besides pot. And you would think marrying the girl i married would fix me right up. Nope. I make good money at a shit job which takes up all my time (60 hour weeks 12 hour work shifts 7pm to 7am)
I have no time for hobbies. Not that im good at anything beyond being decent. Im decent at alot of things. But im not GOOD at them. Id love.to start a band and play shows but in alabama the music scene is a little shit. Noone plays soccer here but its not like im good enough at it anyways. All my friends back home dont keep in touch. I have no friends here. i have my wife. Thats it. Im going nowhere in life and its getting tiring dragging myself through the same shithole everyday. 
Idek if i can do a tldr to summarize. So fuck it
