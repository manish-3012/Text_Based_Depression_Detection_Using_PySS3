Thinking of killing myself because of lockdownI live in boulder. Iâ€™m not allowed to leave my apartment. Have been considering jumping off my 4th floor room for a few weeks now. 


Iâ€™m sick of being treated like a criminal while that faggot Jared Polis pronounces around like a flamboyant French king. 

Thinking of suing for false imprisonment. But then again I think I deserve to die. Always been a burden to everyone around me
