Recently disabled and life is badI have recently been disabled for the last three months. I have a job i cant go back too and have been looking for at home employment for months. Im in pain randomly throughout the day and need to stop what i am doing to deal with the pain. My wife is blaming me for all her problems. I told her tonight im not happy anymore and i dont know what to do. I have been dealing with depression since i was a young child and have kept it in check for a long time. Its been a little over a year since i got married and now im a fat worthless gimp. I'm only 24 and i cry in pain all the time.
