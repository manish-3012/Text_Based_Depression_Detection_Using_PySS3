I will kill myself if I don't do something different.I am finishing up law school and I hate it. I hate law, I hate it, if I have to practice this every day I will die. I feel like I was forced into it by my parents (which is an immature outlook that I try to bury down deep). Everyone tells me not to throw away talent, that I can do everything with a law degree!! But I can't do what I really want.

The only thing that had me remotely interested was the idea of becoming an EMT, taking prereqs for medical school, and taking the MCAT. I would kill or die to be a doctor. It's what I've always wanted to be, from when I was a little girl. It's a dream up there with unicorns and santas. But it's too much, I'm too stupid, I'll never get in, ever. I don't even have the mental fitness for it. 

I got a gun, it sits in my drawer every day. It's like it's calling to me. When I see doctors online, talking, or when I see doctor TV shows, it makes me want to pick it up because I know that I lost my chance to be what I truly wanted to be.

I know I sound very immature. Like I know nothing. I know that I'm not who I want to be. If I live, I'm always going to be haunted by the me I could have been if I had been stronger, or braver, or smarter. I will spend my whole life filling out paperwork so that another big company can make some more money.

Every time I try to think about pursuing my dream, I think of all the reasons I can't do it, and I want to pick up that gun.

I'm pathetic.
