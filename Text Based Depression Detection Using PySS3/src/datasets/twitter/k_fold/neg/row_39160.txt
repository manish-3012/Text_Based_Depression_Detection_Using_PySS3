Not actually wanting to die but trying to die/suicidal gesturesI struggle with wanting to commit suicidal acts but not wanting to actually die. For example, Iâ€™ll reach out AFTER overdosing or doing something self destructive... idk itâ€™s weird. Does anyone else have really intrusive thoughts of slitting their wrists or ODing and then calling 911 or a friend to ask for help and ending up in the hospital instead of ending up dead
