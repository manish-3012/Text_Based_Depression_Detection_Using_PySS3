Somebody please talk with me (not in danger)I posted here once before and I'm back again. I know I'm not lonely because I have good friends and family, but I feel so far away and so alone. I just can't seem to appreciate or enjoy spending time with them. Well I can't really seem to appreciate anything really anymore. 

I don't really have fun or value anything I do anymore, really only get a kick out of drugs and alcohol. Drugs and alcohol make me feel so alive and warm but it takes a heavy toll on me. All I can really think about these days is my drinking or drug use. 

I'm feeling so lost, I'm experiencing that moment when suicide seems so comforting and relieving. I feel ok with letting myself go. I don't feel like struggling. 

I just feel so cold and so empty. 

I just want to talk. I would love to exchange some stories with everyone.
