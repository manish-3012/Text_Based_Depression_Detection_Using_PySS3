Goodbye. (and not in the bad meaning.)(I'm not sure if this kind of posts is allowed here, let me know if it's not so I'll take it down)
I just remembered that this account ever existed. It's been almost exactly a year since I even looked at this account. And you know what. It got better. I'm sitting right now, reading what I posted, straight up crying into my phone. I never thought someone could feel this terrible, yet here I am, reading things I have written myself, that I barely even remember. I didn't have any hope for the future. Now I can finally say: I am feeling happy. It means so much to me. If you told me a year ago, that I would be able to say that, I would think you're a liar. But you wouldn't be one. The memories of the moments when and where I wrote those posts still haunt me, but I manage to get through them. I still have my ups and downs, and it does get really bad sometimes, but it's not that bad anymore. I can finally go through a day without having suicidal thoughts. So much has changed in my life. I want to say goodbye to everyone here, and I wish you good luck in getting better.
