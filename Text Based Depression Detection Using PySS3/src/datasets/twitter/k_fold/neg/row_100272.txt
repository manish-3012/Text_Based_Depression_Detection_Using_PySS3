I dont know what to doFirst English is not my main language so im sorry if u have trouble understanding.

Hello my name is Mario and I'm 23 years old I live in Germany.
I suffer from serious depression cause I had a really bad time growing up.
Last year I visited a hospital for treatment I stayed there for 6 months after that I went to a psychiatrist till now so 2 times a week speaking about what is in my mind and so on... I take a lot of pills to help me stay calm currently I live with my girlfriend and I'm trying to get a job now cause we really need money. My girlfriend works but its barely enough and I dont want to live with her money only. I tried different things but I didn't find anything where I could stay more than a week cause the work made me even more depressed.... I really want to work but it's so hard to find something that fits... now I'm just so hopeless I think I will never find something for me I'm scared that my girlfriend breaks up with me if I dont find work soon I feel like I don't belong on earth i have suicide thoughts hourly and due to the stress I make myself I have really bad time to sleep through the night
