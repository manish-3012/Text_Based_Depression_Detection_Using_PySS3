i don't know why I do this anymore.every fucking day is just pain and hurt. I wake up and the first thing i do, ever, is think about how I'm a waste of space and how I shouldn't be alive. I could've been doing schoolwork for the two hours I've been home, but I don't see the point. I'll just become a worthless piece of shit anyway. I don't know why I keep trying. everything just hurts so much. i don't even want to listen to the support anymore because I know i won't follow through with it. life is just a living hell I'm too cowardly to end. i don't want to live anymore but i'm too much of a coward to kill myself.
