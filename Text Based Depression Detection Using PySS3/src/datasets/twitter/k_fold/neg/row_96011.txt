I can't withstand more lossOver the last two and a half years, I've lost:

- My academic career and goals
- My family, especially my father
- Essentially all of my friends, even my two best ones
- My writing career
- Multiple housing situations
- My ambition, hope, and dreams
- The woman I thought I would marry
- My idealism and sense of self
- My spirituality and my connection to it
- My ability to write, which eroded with depression
- My faith that I would reach the future I envisioned
- For the last month, my ability to sleep
- In summary, everything but depression/anxiety/sleeplessness

I cannot remember the last time a good thing happened to me. It's been unrelenting loss for the last two and a half years, to where I cannot remember how it was to be as I once was. I dread waking in the morning, and I feel worse than when I went to sleep. I cannot withstand more loss than I've already experienced.

It feels like the world, my body, and life itself wants me to die. I feel the pull to oblige constantly, every day/night now. I really want to go through with it...it's my only escape, rest, and reprieve from everything. It's the only way to finally admit: you win, everything and everyone; I am a failure and lost everything in life. I just want to admit it, and then leave.
