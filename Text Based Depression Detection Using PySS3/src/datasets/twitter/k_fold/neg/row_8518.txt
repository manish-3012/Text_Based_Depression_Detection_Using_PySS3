I'm an empty husk! Nice to meet you!My first suicide attempt really scared my mom and traumatized my little sister. I don't want to hurt them even worse, but there hasn't been a day for years where I haven't wanted to end it. It's because of them that I'm still here, but sometimes I wish I didn't have those attachments so I could end things easily without having to worry about hurting others. I don't want to hurt anyone else, I just want to stop being alive.

I guess it doesn't make that much sense I guess because my life is pretty good objectively, I have people that love me and I'm really grateful for them, but a built up past of constant childhood abuse and years of depression have made me into a husk anyway. I don't really have any ambitions or interests. I don't bother trying to talk to others besides the family members I live with and I don't really have any desire to even leave the house. I don't see myself *going* anywhere in the future. For years, the only future I've seen for myself is an eventual suicide and I still believe that's true. I'm going to college now and I'm pulling through alright (due to a light course load), but even this feels pointless and useless if I'm going to die soon anyway.

I have a chronic illness that causes me a lot of physical pain and I have mental problems too (as you can probably tell). Because I have a variety of issues like this, I feel like I should never have been born anyway. I think me coming into the world was probably a mistake somehow because if my body and mind are this messed up, then it seems clear that I would have been better off as a miscarriage or whatever. 

Sorry for the stupid post. On the bright side though, I made it to 21 years of age without dying, which was unthinkable years ago, so who knows how long I'll be able to hold out. Thanks for reading I guess
