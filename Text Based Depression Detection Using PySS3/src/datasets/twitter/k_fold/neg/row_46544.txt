SuicideI ingested forty crushed taxus baccata seeds, a seed containing an alkaloid that shows no early symptoms before leading to cardiac arrest- consequencing death. I will pass at approximately 3am. I desired to tell my beloved companion who will likely really this at some point in the near future: it is not your fault darling. You know that you had nothing to do with the extinguishing of my life. I love you until my dying breath. I hope the reward for this action will not be too severe, but I realize that is not the case. Goodbye my good friends, may your lives be enriched â¤ï¸
