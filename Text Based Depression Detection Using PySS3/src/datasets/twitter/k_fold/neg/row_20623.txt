Iâ€™m so lonely,i have no friends . thereâ€™s no point in being aliveI canâ€™t talk to anyone. i donâ€™t talk to anyone at school iâ€™m all alone. i try so hard to make things better but it never works. iâ€™ve been trying to go to the gym and think more positive but no matter what i constantly canâ€™t get over the reality of my life. i hate it. i hate everything. I want to die
