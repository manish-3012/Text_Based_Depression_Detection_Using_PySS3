I have no other option.I am an awful person to be around. I have good intentions but no matter how fucking hard I try to be different I always end up being a fucking asshole to everyone around me. My three best friends stopped talking to me in January. I got pregnant in March and lost the baby, and my tubes and am told I canâ€™t get pregnant now. My live in boyfriend just told me to be out by the end of the month. I have nowhere to go and no money. The thought of living with a roommate is so excruciating, I canâ€™t bear to be close to another person and have it end with them hating me. Every single relationship I have ever had has ended with me being unbearable to be around. I really try, but I fail, over and over. Iâ€™ve done therapy, EMDR, Iâ€™m not going to change. Iâ€™m not going to get better.
I want to get a hotel room and shoot enough heroin to die. Iâ€™ve been clean and sober five years, I just graduated nursing school, but none of that matters when you literally make everyoneâ€™s life that you encounter, worse. I am so tired, I am so scared, I am so disappointed in who I became.
