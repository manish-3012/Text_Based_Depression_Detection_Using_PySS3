I just want to be happywhy do I have to live a live I do not want to, why do I hate to try and fix my grades because I'm failing and I fail at everything I try to do, why do my friends need to keep pretending they are in fact my friends and why can't I take the thought of suicide off of my head and be happy and live not caring so much about everything? I want to be happy but I am incapable to, and I believe death is a great solution, but I still want to feel things and have a life and marry someone and be happy. am I allowed and able to do this?
