is it okay to be mad at my sister for killing herself?why. I just don't understand, she never talked to us about her problems. but looking from the outside. she has everything I've always wanted. i look at my sister and I see someone who could do anything, excell at anything. She has a large circle of friends, she graduated college on time, got a job straight out of college in the field she wanted, has a boyfriend.  She had everything I wanted to have in my life at her age. . My parents love her more than they ever loved me, and it's not hard to see why. She's everything they wanted in a child. I'm 30... still in school, i can't do anything, I'm overweight and lazy. I've spent my entire life alone, no social network, no girlfriend. She's achieved everything.

Why would she do it, why would she leave our parents with me. why leave them with me as a failure of the family. I'm the one who should of killed himself long ago, but just like everything else. I cant do it, and she can.

i don't understand. I'm so alone, everyday is so awful, I sit in silence unable to communicate or connect with anyone. I've wanted to die so many times, but I always told myself it would get better, but it never does, it never did.  I never had love, I never held anyone or been wanted ever.  what was so bad that she did that. Maybe if I died instead of her, she owouldn'tf done it.

I see my parents, they don't even want to talk to me, they don't want to look at someone like me.  I remember so clearly the differences between us. She always had a birthday, friends, mom and dad would give her gifts. I never got anything after middle school. I don't even remember the last time someone wished me a happy birthday. They were so happy when she graduated college, they bought her a nice used car and help with her new fancy apartment in NYC.

When I graduated, they didn't even realize it, they just told me it was about time.
