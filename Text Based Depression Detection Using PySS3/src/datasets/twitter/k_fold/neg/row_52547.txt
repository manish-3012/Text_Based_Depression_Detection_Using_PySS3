Cat poop saved me from myself today.Maybe it's just my messed up state of mind right now, but I just found this funny, and hopefully it will make you guys smile too. So this morning I was dangerously close to ending it. But then I realized that I needed to clean my cats' litter boxes, and apparently that was enough to snap me out of it. I don't understand myself sometimes.
