I think tonight I'm finally doing itI moved a year and some ago to live closer to my fiancee and her family. I'm on the west coast of Canada and she lives about an hour away across the border.

My life has just been a continuous shit show. I'm 27, already been divorced. Went through Hell once she left me. I bounced back. Met this girl. Moved across the country to live closer. I got let go after my contract was up at a job and no employers have even responded to my applications. I've no idea why. I feel like I'm cursed. I'm in so much debt and bills are backed-up. I have no more hope in things getting better. We are planning on having a small wedding, then going through the immigration process for me to move from Canada to the US but I'm not even sure how the fuck I'll be able to afford to start the process as it's expensive to apply/move.

I talked to my fiancee briefly about moving back to live with my parents for a few months, bounce back and save up and she was pretty hurt that I'd suggest it. I'm tired of fucking up. I'm tired of my life being a bunch of disappointments. Now, I just want to know how I can end it.
