I'm at the top of my apartment complex, I'm jumping at 12 tonightMy mind is set, just asking to hear something interesting before I fall. 

Our goverment treats ex soldiers so poorly, fuck Australian politicians 

EDIT: after chatting with you lot I think I won't jump, I don't know if that makes me a coward or what and I don't mind. In the next week I'll be getting a dog hopefully so he can keep me company.
