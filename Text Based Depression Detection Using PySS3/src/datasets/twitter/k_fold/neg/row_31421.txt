Bored. Depressed. Lonely. I'm not sure.I really don't know what I am feeling, but despite the amount of people I know or "friends" that I have, I am really lonely. I have not really seen my friends in a while because I have been attending school as a full time nursing student and I have been missing out on a lot of events. I know people and acquaintances, but I just feel like no one really has the time. It makes me feel that everybody is selfish, including myself at my best. I don't know what I need or what I want to come out of this post. This is a throwaway account, and maybe I'm just venting. Who knows maybe I'll feel better tomorrow. Anyone ever feel this way?
