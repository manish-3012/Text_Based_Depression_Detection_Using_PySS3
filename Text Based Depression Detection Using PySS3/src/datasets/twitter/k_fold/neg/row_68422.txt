Am I suicidal?Am I suicidal to think about the death of myself? I already thought about it and sit myself on the roof of a building just to know the feeling and to look what I would feel in that moment and if I would be ready to do it. Also I'm not afraid of dying, if it would happen by an accident, I think I would be ready. I'm scared that I think this way. The reason is a girl. 17y/o male
