Please don't do it.Hey guys and girls,

&amp;#x200B;

Police officer from the land down under here.

&amp;#x200B;

New account for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of back story to this post;

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a Police officer for the past five years and I've pretty much seen it all. From petty theft to suicide. Today I attended  a suicide job that has hit particularly hard.

&amp;#x200B;

See the problem was, we didn't know what we were walking into. We came across a car that was parked just far enough out of the way to peak our interest. As we approached the car a familiar smell filled the air, it's a smell you don't ever forget.

&amp;#x200B;

As we investigated the scene we found more and more of this persons final few moments. The pile of cigarettes in the centre console, the crushed cans of beer in foot well. 

&amp;#x200B;

This person had laid out photos of his kids on the passenger seat of the car. They then wrote the words 'Please forgive me' on the back of their hand.

&amp;#x200B;

The mess was unforgettable and has played over and over in my head since I left work.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm sharing this is to plead with you, please, for what ever reason your thinking of taking your own life; please don't.

&amp;#x200B;

You won't have to be there when we come to comfort  your wife, husband, son's and daughters.

&amp;#x200B;

You won't be there to tell your children that mummy or daddy won't be home for Christmas.

&amp;#x200B;

You'll have no idea of the hole you've left when your gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Please, please don't do it.
