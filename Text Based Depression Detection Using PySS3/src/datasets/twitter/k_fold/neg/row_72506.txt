My girlfriend is suicidal and has been off her anti-depressants for a month, please helpShe is always constantly in pain due to her fibromyalgia, has a gluten intolerance, and either bipolar depression or Major depressive disorder, which was inhereted from her mother. She believes she has BPD. She also breaks down a lot and often says if she just dies no one would care but that's just a lie. She also tells me she just wants to get away and go to a place where no one knows her so she can peacefully kill herself and also tries to break up with me because I'm an emotional obstacle in the way of her suicide. please I feel useless whenever she breaks down I have nothing comforting to say.
