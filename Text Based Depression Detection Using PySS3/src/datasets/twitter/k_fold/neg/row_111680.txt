At least it was honest."Fall into that trap again? I don't think so."

Good, thank you for finally opening up to me. I wish it didn't take the end of our marriage for you to finally let me in to your mind. What I wouldn't have given to hear your honest thoughts when I still had the means to do something about it. You weaponized your vulnerability, when this entire time I wanted you to let me in freely so we could heal and grow together.

Everyone is struggling, I know I am. But you never let me see it. You built up so many walls that I started to do the same, until we were worlds apart. I remember when I stopping drinking because it was tearing us apart, I thought I was doing the right thing. In reality, I was just self medicating for what I was already losing. 

My health is failing me. I wake up dizzy, I can feel my heart palpitations get worse every day. My mental state and cognition are going too, and yet I keep guzzling these pills to try and make it through the day. If I do enough, he'll love me again. If I do everything for him, I'll have value. 

I can barely grab things in my hands these days. The shaking has gotten so bad I might as well have no hands at all. And yet, the smallest plea for compassion is met with stoicism and disgust. I am nothing. I am worthless.

I'm sorry that I turned out to be so far from what you wanted me to be for you. I'm so sorry I made it so easy for you to build a life for me but not for me. But mostly, I'm sorry I bothered you with my existence for this long.

P.S. Also quack.
