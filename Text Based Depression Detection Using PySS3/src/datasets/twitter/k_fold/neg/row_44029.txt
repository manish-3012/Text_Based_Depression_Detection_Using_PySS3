I think Iâ€™ll kill myself after tax returnsWell guys I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself after tax returns, after I waste it all on a road trip to Vegas where Iâ€™m going to kill myself 

30 years old, fired from my job as a bartender a few months back for having a shot or 2 with my regular customers on occasion. Girlfriend just failed diversion weâ€™re awaiting a court date on when sheâ€™s actually going to be back in court she already had a 2nd chance but her weed levels werenâ€™t going down fast enough which they implied she was still smoking marijuana (we live in Oregon, itâ€™s not illegal here, yes I know itâ€™s still federally illegal) so weâ€™re waiting to see what sheâ€™s gonna get jail time wise (1st DUI sheâ€™s 28, had one speeding ticket prior)

Live with her and her kid and her crazy (seriously insane) mother whose threatened to kick us all out even though we pay all the bills rent etc, but sheâ€™s getting her disability next month and could realistically kick us out. She does this for no reason she woke up yelling yesterday literally woke up in the morning and started yelling about kicking us out after taxes. Nobody woke her up I think sheâ€™s seriously bipolar

Canâ€™t find a decent job, watching my savings dwindle. Ordered a gram of clonazolam (RC benzo 4x as strong as clonazepam. So the equivalent of 4 grams of clonazepam with some booze and sleeping pills should do the trick.

Already on anti depressants, take the RC version of Valium for anti anxiety already.

Dad doesnâ€™t talk to me for no reason in particular he just doesnâ€™t care, my mom is too busy to with her alcoholic boyfriend. My 2 good friends are in different states. I think Iâ€™ve spent enough time on earth

I wish you all the best in your struggles
