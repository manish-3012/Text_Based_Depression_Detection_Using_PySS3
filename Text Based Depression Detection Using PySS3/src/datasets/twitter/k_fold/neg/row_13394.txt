I lost someone very special to me this week due to suicide.I knew that she had depression, and I had been trying to help her the best I could since October.  We would have great days, we would have normal days, we would have bad days.  I would listen to her and talk with her on her bad days.  I wanted to help her so badly.  She kept complaining "Its never getting better, no matter how hard I try to be better its not getting better." 

I just did the best that I could and became her friend, listened to her whenever she needed someone to listen to her.  Sadly a multitude of negative events or concerns hit her in the middle of January which led to a lot of bad days.  Then at the start of last week (1-29) she started to stop having bad days.  She didn't have a bad day all that week.  Every day talking to her or being around her were great days that week, I heard her laugh more last week than I had heard her laugh the other 6 months I've known her.  Then something that could have been completely avoided happened on Tuesday morning, which upset her a lot, and she went into her kitchen and cut herself across the wrists with a knife.  

Was that last week of greatness her having already decided she was going to kill herself?  Was it what happened Tuesday morning?   Was it my fault?  Could I have done more to help her?   These questions run through my head all the time now.

I miss her so much, I miss seeing her, I miss her laugh, I miss her dumb jokes, I miss her smile.  I just wish I could see her one last time, talk with her one last time.
