i just give upThe other thing that really bothers me is most of the people I see saying "I'm gonna be alone forever, am I unlovable, etc" they've been single for 6 months since their last break up. And not to minimize anyone's pain or hurt but like I've been alone my entire life. Not one single person has ever been interested in me. Not a "playground" crush in 5th grade, not a middle school "hand holding only" crush, not a "thing" or "hookup" in high school. Like, I had no one and I have no one. At least you had someone at one point so it's possible and reasonable that it'll happen again.
