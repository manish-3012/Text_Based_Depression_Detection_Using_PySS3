I planned to kill myself on the 1st and I couldn't even do thatI finished senior school last year since then I've been preparing for college. Without the ever-present stress of school to keep me distracted my mind has gone to shit. I sleep at odd hours (I'm writing this at 04:30) for random amounts of time and spend most of the night with only my thoughts to keep me company.  
  
Not the best year as you'd guess, so on the 13th of November I decided I'd end it on the 1st of December. I counted down each day, even feeling a weird jolt of excitement when I realised November had 30 days instead of 31 and I just wanted to check out as soon as possible.  
  
Then I wake up on the 2nd of December and realise I was still alive. I never had any real plan on how to off myself and I didn't even have a note drafted. I guess I just hoped I could wish myself into dying in my sleep. Every night I hope that I actually can just wish myself to death so I'll die in my sleep, but I guess I'm too lazy even to do that.   
  
I can't believe I thought I actually had the guts to do it. I'm a joke.
