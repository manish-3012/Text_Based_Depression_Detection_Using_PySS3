What the fuck do I do now?I suppose it's my fault for falling in love with a boy four years older than me who lives on a total different continent, but I seriously don't want to live. Let me explain; I met a boy. I fell in love with him. Hard. I know I love him, I know I do, I have never felt this way towards anyone. This boy was the main reason I've been happy, been alive these past few months--the skies were bluer, the air was fresher, music meant more to me than just sound, my sense of touch was emphasized, the colours were all brighter--but, Christ, I fucked it all up. He believed we could meet, we could last, but we clearly didn't. Yesterday, he found out that I was pressured into getting with my ex again, but he doesn't believe that I was pressured into it. I truly didn't want to get back with him, however--you don't know me at all, the person reading this, I have no reason to lie to you. I don't love my ex at all. I just didn't want to hurt his feelings when breaking up with him, so I was taking my time because I didn't want to deal with the backlash. As of now, I've broken up with him, and the first boy is seemingly done with me romantically, however our friends seem to think if he truly loved me he'll take me back after awhile. The thing is; this boy is the *only* reason I'm alive right now, and I've been really contemplating suicide. I don't know why I'm still writing this, it seems like I'm doing everything for attention, truthfully, but I truly just want help. I'm on the verge of going home and taking all of the meds I can find. If not, I'll just starve or dehydrate myself to death. Life truly sucks, and I can't find a will to live. Please help me.
