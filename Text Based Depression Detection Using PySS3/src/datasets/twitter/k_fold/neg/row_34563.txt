Suicide QuestionSo, I've pretty much decided to take my life, although not sure yet when.. As a matter of family and stuff like this.. not like I really care about them, but generally speaking, what would be the "best way" for them? So far I came to these options:

* Make it look like an accident
* Dissapear so they don't really know if I'm dead
* Just kill myself so they know I did it on purpose

Which of these options would you consider as "most bearable"? Anyone who would like to ask stuff like why or try to support me, altough I appreciate it, just stick to my question please, appreciated **:)**
