I want to die because of my familyI know this is a bummer and kinda common, but the stress is too high, I am picky, a liar, and a overall horrible person, I have a relative, they can grow up with the life that I canâ€™t even imagine living. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Everybody has an expectation that I cannot reach anymore, I feel completely useless, like eating resources on something that is basically useless. I hate confrontation, and my close family hates it. I just canâ€™t do anything.
