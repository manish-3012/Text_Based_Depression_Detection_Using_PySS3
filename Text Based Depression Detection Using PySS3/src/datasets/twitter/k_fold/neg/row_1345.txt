Finallyonly 2 more days of suffering before I get to leave for good.
2 days bc I dont want to inconvenience my work by not showing up for my shifts. 

ik my friends and family will probably be sad but like. once I'm dead it's not really my problem anymore? I cant feel bad if I'm dead

it's not fair that I have to spend my whole life suffering and being a worthless untalented lonely piece of shit just so they don't have to feel guilty about my death.

I've been depressed since I was 5, and its obviously not gonna get any better, so it's time for me to just man up and fucking do it already 

Dont try to talk me down, I've made peace with myself and I'm ready to go, this is the most peaceful I've ever felt in my life. I wont regret this (cant regret shit if ur dead)
