The inner void is growing.Its getting tougher and tougher to keep going. With each day i wake up im growing more tired of everything. I dont really want to. Although i have an appointment in two days in a psychiatry. Mother isnt believing me how fucking awful i feel. She tells me that im either lazy or should go and pray to jesus. I dont fucking know anymore what to do.
