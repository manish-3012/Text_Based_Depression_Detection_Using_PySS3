Anyoneâ€™s else have this?Sure, traumatic shit had happened to me but thatâ€™s not why I wanna kill myself. Lately Iâ€™ve been having an existential crisis where life is pointless, we are out on this earth to breed and die. No matter what you say thatâ€™s basically why anybody exists. Iâ€™m not depressed, just think that itâ€™s gonna happen no matter what so why not hurry thing along?
