RantI constantly think, "I wish I was dead" even when I'm doing something I enjoy. I don't have a bad life really. It's just these constant thoughts about how pointless everything is and what a scam so many things are and just this general cloud of negativity over my head. I've felt this way since I was a teenager and hoped it would fade but 30 years later I feel the same, worse actually. I use drugs to escape I guess, to numb myself. Existing is just painful right now. I don't know how I'd do it but I think about it constantly. Ugh just had to rant, sorry.
