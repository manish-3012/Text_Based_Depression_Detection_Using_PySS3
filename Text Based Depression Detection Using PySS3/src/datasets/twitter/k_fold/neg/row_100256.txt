I'm tired of all of this. Turning to Reddit for one last piece of advice.Hello r/suicidewatch, how are you all today? Well, if you're like me, you're probably feeling pretty shitty. I don't feel the need to give any details, but I've been dealing with this shit for 4 years now, I'm a 15 male, and I'm ready to end it. I've got an assortment of ways to do it, and I'm finally ready to. I decided to come here for one last chance. I would like to know what you all have to say. My name is Nick, by the way if that's of any importance. I'm just so tired of everything. And Jordan, if you're reading this, I love you man.


EDIT: Thanks for the help guys, just even responding shows me that, even though I don't know who they are, there's still some people who care. I'm going to bed now, and I WILL be waking up tomorrow. Love you guys :)
