I think my girlfriend may be suicidal. I want to help but I don't know how.She is exhibiting many red flags and I do my best to communicate and talk through anything when she is feeling emotional. I try to listen and talk all of the time. Mainly listening. To be honest, it works out really well most of the time, but we somehow circle back to the same things. It it me? I try to just kind of spoil her with things I know she enjoys and appreciates but it doesn't really have an effect long term. I know some form of treatment for her depression is probably certainly necessary, but if I bring up therapy, or god forbid medication, she severely balks at the idea. I'm kind of at a loss and I'm totally terrified.
