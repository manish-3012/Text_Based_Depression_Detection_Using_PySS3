I don't really like my therapistI know therapist are supposed to help you challenge things about yourself or tell you things you don't want to hear. We almost got into an argument my last session.
I don't feel comfortable sharing my suicidal thoughts with anyone except warmlines.
Her tough love approach comes off as bitchy to me.
I know it is important to challenge our perception and we never know anything for certain.
I honestly think at some point, I know when someone is being condescending towards me. No one directly says it. I read tone, actions and body language. Sure there are million reasons someone's body language may seem condescending but that doesn't negate my opinion.

Sometimes I feel like she doesn't respect my opinion or is too rational.
