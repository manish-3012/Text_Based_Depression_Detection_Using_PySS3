Is there anyone to talk to? I only have a couple hours left.Hi. I don't know where to start. I've always been daddy's little girl (I am 23 now) and I feel like since I was 18 all I've done is continually disappoint him. With school, my relationships. He has no trust in me anymore, and understandably so, because I just let him down any time I try to do anything. I was so lucky to be born into everything I could ever want, but now I just want to end it all. I have some sleeping pills here and a slew of other medications and some wine and some rope, and I'm ready to just finally end it so I can stop disappointing him. 

Deep down I know this will hurt him more than any of the things I've let him down from before, but at least this way I won't have to bear the brunt of the punishment. It may be called selfish but I just can't continue on with this. I feel like I can easily be talked out of it but...I don't know if I want to to. I just don't know what to do. I have to go home tonight and talk to him about where things went wrong - yet again - and I am dreading it. I would literally rather die than have him lecture me again, and that's why I am here. What can I do? I wish I could tell myself I could pick up and grow stronger but I've tried that, so many times, and it hasn't worked. I just am lazy and unmotivated -- even when I know that failure will result in hugely negative consequences. 

I know this is just such a small part of my life, too, but I can't help but let it consume my thoughts. I just wish I could know that the pills would work. I don't want to wake up, and feel like shit again. I just want to never wake up again. I don't know how much I need to take. I don't even care about pain. I don't mind if it hurts, I just want it to be effective.

This was longer than I had planned. Thank you for reading.
