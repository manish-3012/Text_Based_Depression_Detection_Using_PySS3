the natchez trace bridge seems like my best friend right nowI got fired. It wasn't really my fault, but I got fired. I lost more money at the job than I was making. I have no money, now. I moved home, transferred universities, and was so excited for my new start. Someone I care for a lot came back into my life and I finally felt like I found my group. But I was manipulated and lied to. I have, really, nothing here. I was assaulted by my boyfriend last weekend and I feel disgusting. Yikes.
