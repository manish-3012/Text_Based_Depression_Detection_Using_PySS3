I Can't Do This AnymoreI feel as if everyone in my life would be better off without me. I am about to turn 22 and I can't imagine a future. Everything is too much and I am too sensitive. I have done bad shit and I am mean to the ones I love. I don't deserve to be alive. But I can't take action. I feel like im living in hell everyday whether I'm at work, home, with a friend. I try so hard but I can't stabilize my moods and I go off the deep end every other day. Everything sets me off. I hate being like this. I think I have bpd but I feel like a life of taking medicine that makes me feel numb and unable to cum isnt worth it. I have no personality other than being really sad, angry, or hyper.
