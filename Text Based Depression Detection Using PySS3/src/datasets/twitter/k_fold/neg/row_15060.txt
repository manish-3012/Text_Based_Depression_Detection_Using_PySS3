I just can't do it anymore. It hurts so much, I hate myself so much.I just want to die. So badly. I'm pathetic. I'm fat and ugly and covered in scars and just all around an awful example of a human being. I don't have any friends in real life anymore, since I left school they've barely talked to me. I frustrate and anger my parents more and more lately. They used to yell at me occasionally but now it's pretty much every day. My brother used to look up to me, but now I'm just a disappointment. I haven't done schoolwork in so long, my entire 11th grade year was just me rotting in my room. I used to be smart too, straight As in a top school, but now I can barely do anything. Fuck. I've done so many horrible things to the people around me. I'm a disgusting excuse for a human being. 

There's no point at all. I don't want to live anymore. I hate everything about myself and my life. I wish I could start over as someone completely different. It hurts to be alive. Physically and mentally and emotionally. I'm on meds. I have been for over a year. My therapist quit in June, and I won't have a new one til October. I don't even know why I'm posting here. If any of you actually knew me, you'd agree about how much of a waste of space I am. I just. Can't. Not anymore. I hate myself so much. I always have. I remember hating myself at age 7, because I was too fat. One of my earliest memories is being called piggy by my cousin. 

God, just, what do I do? All 17 years of my life have been full of mental illness and me being a burden on the people around me. If it weren't for my parents being crushed, I would have killed myself a long time ago. But they're angry at me all the time now, I know it would be better if I had never existed. I wish I was dead. Everything hurts.
