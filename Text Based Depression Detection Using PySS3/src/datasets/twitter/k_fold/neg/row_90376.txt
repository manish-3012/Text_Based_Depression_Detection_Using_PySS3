a comedian is keeping me aliveI don't really know what's been happening to me lately. I think about killing myself quite a lot, but in the last week the thoughts have been - I'm not really sure how word it - more intense? Serious? 

I'm so sad. Tired. Empty. I just want to slip away

A month ago I was attacked when I was walking home alone. When it was happening, I couldn't take my eyes off the knife they were threatening me with but I wasn't afraid of it. I wish they had killed me when they had the chance 

Maybe my thoughts are just repercussions of what happened? I've not been dealing with it well, but I thought time was supposed to let me heal? Not make me feel worse? I'm just so sick of being afraid of going outside 

The comedian I mentioned in my title is the only reason I haven't done anything seriously damaging to myself. I have a long history of self-harm, but I refused to let what happen give me an excuse to go back to old habits and I've been relying on him (the comedian) to make me feel better when things haven't been so bright 

It's been like this for about three years since I started recovering from self-injury. I followed him on Twitter very shortly after I made the conscious decision to get better and I'm not really sure how to explain it, but it became a weird promise to him that I wouldn't ever hurt myself again. (He didn't know this for a very long time but I did tell him eventually.) 

I don't know. I guess I just turn to him when things are bleak. I read his tweets, watch his videos and go through his blog and I'll feel better. He makes me insanely happy 

Him and I are verging on the 'friend' status at the moment. I don't really know why, but recently when I think about ending it all, I think of him and for some reason he's enough for me not to do it. Is that weird? Relying on a comedian to keep me alive?
