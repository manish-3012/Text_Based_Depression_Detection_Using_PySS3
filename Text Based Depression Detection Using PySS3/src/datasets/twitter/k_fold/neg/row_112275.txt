There are no real optionsThere's nothing more unmotivating in regards to seeking "help" than the complete catastrophe of the Mental Health industry.

I have been battling depression most of my life, but it's been almost 8 years since I've been seriously contemplating seeking help. I just lost my job and barely have any money (enough to eat for a few weeks and pay rent next month), but I keep thinking about going somewhere or see someone that can provide some sort of value to me to improving my mental health.

Honestly, I can't remember the last time anyone asked me how I was doing, feeling etc...Including the people in my life that are aware of my constant battle with MDD. There's still medical debt in my name from the last time I attempted suicide and I'm just getting around to repairing my credit.

It sucks that if you want to admit that you're suicidal you're almost pretty much considered a criminal and have to sacrifice pretty much everything you have in order to HOPE that you can get help.

I'm really not sure what to do, are mental health resources truly a lost cause? Should I sacrifice everything I have worked for the past 8 years for the slightest bit of hope that there's a chance that I can get the help I need?
