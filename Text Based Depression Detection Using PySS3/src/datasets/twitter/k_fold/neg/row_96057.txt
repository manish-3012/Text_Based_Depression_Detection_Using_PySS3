No one understands and I just need someone to talk to, September gets close every day that passes.I have an amazing boyfriend, but Covid has made us distant from each other. My family tells me to just move on, grow up and get over it, that they probably arenâ€™t even thinking about me, and Iâ€™ve tried, I guess it is the whole not having closure thing. Iâ€™m hiding in my room and they are throwing a fit about it. Two years ago, within a week of each other, my sister, best friend and girlfriend all attempted suicide. I had to rush home to be at my sisterâ€™s side, and literally had to hear my mom say that I should focus on her and just forget about the other two also in the hospital whoâ€™s side I couldnâ€™t be at. I feel guilty because I didnâ€™t even know my sister was feeling so alone. We were so close, all each other had growing up, I have been blind since birth and she was my rock, always willing to take up for me when no one else was. I always told all three of them that they were worth it, that they were good enough, I did my best to show how much they meant to me. My sister is ok and my friend is to. But the thought of my mother almost losing her daughter had numbed her, almost to the point where it seems she is now spiteful and cruil. I know she is hurting, but how can she tell me to move on when she hasnâ€™t done the same? The last message I got from my girlfriend was that she would be ok, then she went radio silent. It hurts. Damn it fucking hurts. I did my best to be loyal, true, caring, kind, and honest. I would have done anything for her, I have only ever loved one other person in my life that was a romantic interest. I just feel like I didnâ€™t do enough. Was there something else I could have said? Something else I could have done? Maybe been there more? I talked to all three of them every day? Maybe tried to find more ways to make them smile, they always told me I was the best thing in their lives. Now Iâ€™m afraid to open up to anyone else for fear of getting so truly hurt again. And Iâ€™ve heard it all before, there was nothing else you could have done, you did all you could, you canâ€™t let this hold you back but on nights when everyone is sleeping i still cry. It is August now, and the pain and guilt and anger and fear have all come crashing back the way it does each time September gets near. And Iâ€™m so lucky to have the people I do in my life, I donâ€™t know how to get therapy in my state, I had counseling but they stopped when all this Covid crap started and I just need a friend.
