my story, please tell me yours or your thoughts about mineThe only years I have been really happy in my life was 2.5 years long. Those 2.5 years was with my ex-girlfriend. after those two years we didn't speak that much anymore. a month ago she hung herself. It killed me. I feel like I might be happy again somewhere in my life but also feel like it is not worth waiting for. years and years of pain that i could also just end now. the only thing holding me back is that it would hurt people around me. I just miss her so much and i know i will never see or talk to her anymore and I will never be as happy as i was the only hope i have of having a connection with her again is to die, to join her. I don't see the point in living anymore. i feel like the only point to life is to be happy, a lot of people say the point of life is to make it better for others or change the world for the better but that would only be the point of life because it makes you happy and gives you the power to go on with life, But i know i will never feel that happiness anymore. can someone tell me why i shouldn't end my life, why do you want to live or die?
