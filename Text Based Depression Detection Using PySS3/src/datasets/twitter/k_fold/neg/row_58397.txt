To my Millennial brother.I have never seen a Millennial who acted like a Boomer anywhere, but my home. Every time I get an F, you would threaten to cancel my online school. Every time I say I donâ€™t like school, you come up with a bullshit answer as to why students need to learn every subject whether they like it or not. Iâ€™d rather not say as the where he learned how to do taxes because he would just come up with an even more triggering response. I wished I was wiped out of the Earth forever just so I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with his shit that was scaring me.
