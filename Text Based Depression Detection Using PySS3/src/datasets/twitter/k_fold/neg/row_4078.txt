I hate my job and subsequently my life. A little back story, 3 months ago I took a job for the money and I thought I'd like it. I'm stressed all of the time now and I hate my life. It makes me physically sick daily. I did it to try to help my family. 

Now I've decided I'd rather just be dead. My wife doesn't understand, I feel like a horrible father and husband. I think it's time I just let it all go and make peace with myself. 

Tell me I'm wrong, please.
