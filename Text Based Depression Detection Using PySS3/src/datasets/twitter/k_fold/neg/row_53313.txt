I can't be content with myself and I don't think I can keep dealing with thisI'm a 18y/o Male-to-Female transgender person, and I want to kill myself. The fact that I was born a man and not a woman weighs heavily on me every day of my life. I don't want to be a man, and I don't want to be some freakish cheap imitation of a woman. I want to be a woman, and no matter what that's not possible. I wasn't born a woman, I can never have all the same parts as a woman, I act like a man because I wasn't raised as a woman, and others will never perceive me as a woman. Inhabiting this body of mine is emotionally agonizing for me. The only thing keeping me here is that I have the best girlfriend anyone could ever ask for, I love her so much, and she loves me so much, and I know it would mess her up too badly if I killed myself. She wants to be with me for the rest of her life, she talks about how she wants me to be her bride some day, she tells me about how I've given her direction in life and inspired her to pursue the career she's going to college for, all because she wants to make enough money that we can move out together. She's literally the best girlfriend I could ask for, the best person I could possibly have in my life, and I'm so selfish that I don't care and want to kill myself. I wish I had killed myself about a year ago when I was planning to instead of getting on HRT and giving transitioning a chance so that I wouldn't die with regrets when I killed myself, because now we're in love and in a relationship and I've missed my chance to kill myself back when I could do it without hurting the most important person to me in the world. I still feel like I'm going to kill myself, and feel like it's all just a matter of time and that the longer I take the more drawn out my suffering will be. I hate myself and wish I hadn't ever been born, life's been too uncomfortable and awful.
