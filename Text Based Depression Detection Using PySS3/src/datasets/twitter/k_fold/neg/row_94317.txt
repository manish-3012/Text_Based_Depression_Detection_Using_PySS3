Why am I posting here?I just feel like I can't do anything. I look forward and I see nothing. I can't see a future for myself. Most of my time I spend thinking is thinking about going back in time
to day one and changing eveything. Chaning things so that maybe somehow life will be better. Everyday I go to bed and pray that I will wake up and it will be the day of my
birth and that I will be able to change everything. That I will be able to better myself. Start fresh. Meet people sooner. End the pain. The only other way I can end the pain
is to just fucking kill myself. And the only thing keeping me from doing that is my mom. I know that it would destroy her. She gave up everything for me. She still does
everything for me. I do love her, but I just feel like I can't put up with this pain anymore. The constant thought in the back of my head is to just end it all. Its the only
way.

I have set a date. Its the day after my bestfriend is getting married. I want to see him on the happiest day of his life. I want to see him and be there for him. I don't want 
to leave before then but if my life hasn't gotten better or somehow it gets worse by that time then the next day is where it has to end. I once said that I would wait untill
I was 30, but I can't fathom living through this much pain for that long. Everyday is a struggle. I wake up and want to do nothing and I honestly have done this to myself. I
think about things I can't control. I do things that are bad for me. I drink constantly and worry about stuggles that again I can't control. I get attached to people and when
they leave or I can't see them, I shut down. They consume my thoughts. There are days where I wake up and feel like I can take on the world. I get excited about living and
doing things I enjoy, about seeing people I love to be around. And then BAM without any warning I want to fucking kill myself. No feeling I have ever felt is worse than when
I feel good, and feel like everything will be okay and then it is ripped away from, sending me back to the endless abyss that I know so well. I just want this to be over.
