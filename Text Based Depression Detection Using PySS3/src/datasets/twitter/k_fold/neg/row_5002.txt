I Never Exist Until I Threaten To Take My LifeHonestly I donâ€™t see the point of talking to people

Throughout this whole quarantine not one person.. ONE.. asked me how I was doing during this quarantine

I have to be the one to start the conversations

I have to be the one to keep relationships alive

I have to remind people I exist

Why do people suddenly change when I say Iâ€™m killing myself?

I know why

They want to feel like they did their part in helping me so they feel like they didnâ€™t contribute to someoneâ€™s death

Because if anyone found out they didnâ€™t their reputation is tarnished

Nice if them to finally care about me

I guess all it takes is a suicide threat

Thatâ€™s stupid

This is why Iâ€™m done with giving people chances. Everyone is the fucking same

Itâ€™s already bad enough you donâ€™t ever notice me

Then you say Iâ€™m demanding too much time or Iâ€™m overreacting or Iâ€™m making it an obligation to talk to me

Those are the dumbest things Iâ€™ve ever heard

If I send you a message and you leave me on read that means you ignored me

If I send you a message and it was from 2 hours ago but your last signs of activity were 15 minutes ago that means you ignored my message and youâ€™re too insecure to let me know by leaving me on read

ITâ€™S THAT FUCKING SIMPLE

So stop saying stupid shit to justify your actions

Just stop it

I hate how society just accepts this like itâ€™s normal

This is why I want to kill myself

But noooo.. you want me to live

WHY??

Keep the same energy you had when you ignored my message

Fuck all of you
