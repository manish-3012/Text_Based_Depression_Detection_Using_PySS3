I dont know what to do anymoreI don't even know why im typing this, nobody is going to see this anyway. I don't know what to do with myself, I've never been so down and depressed in my life. I guess this might help me bit, just to type and get it out. Nobody understands, nobody gets me. I can never catch a break. I hate my family. I can't wait to get out of this shithole that I call home, its so exhausting. I don't know how people have it so easy, I'm constantly thinking " why me". Why couldn't it be someone else. It had to be me. I don't know how much longer I can deal with everything. I don't even know how people deal with me. Im constantly unhappy, it's getting harder to hide. No matter what I do, it's never enough. I feel like a burden, I feel like nobody wants me around. I feel like everywhere I go someone is judging me, I act like this big tough girl but really im fucking dying inside. I don't know what to do, I think the only thing that stops me from doing anything are my friends and family. The little piece of my family that I actually like. I just want to run away, I want everything to be over. I'm so sick of being unhappy, constantly trying to cover up the feelings I have. Nobody gets it. All I hear is " you'll be fine" " you're too soft" " everything will be okay", will I though? Am I really too soft? Will everything REALLY be okay? I-. I just don't know what to do. I haven't self harmed in years, but I'm getting to that point again. I just get the urge, but I don't want anything to be noticeable. I don't want anyone to see how much I'm actually hurting, I don't want to make myself a burden to my friends. I don't want anyone to pity me, sometimes I just feel like it would be better if I disappeared. Does anyone feel like that? Like me? I feel so alone even though I'm surrounded by so many people that "love" me. I guess maybe I thought I could stick it out, but I'm starting to second guess myself.
