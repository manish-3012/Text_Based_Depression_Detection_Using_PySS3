I shouldn't be here.But I'm so frustrated right now. I haven't had human contact in 2 years now. I've reached my limit. This is no way for a human to live hahahahahaha. 

I could go on about all the bad things in my life but fuck that shit, I just want someone to love and hold me right about now and I know the chances of that are slim to none forever. I prefer non-existence over this shit.
