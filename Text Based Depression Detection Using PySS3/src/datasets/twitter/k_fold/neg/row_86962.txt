I'm over itThis life is meaningless. I'm so sick for hearing the same this will pass. It's been years and things only get worse. Reach out for "help" right back a square one. I don't have kids hate my job. Have no hobbies don't even really know who I am any more. I don't believe this will get better and I'm sick of trying.
