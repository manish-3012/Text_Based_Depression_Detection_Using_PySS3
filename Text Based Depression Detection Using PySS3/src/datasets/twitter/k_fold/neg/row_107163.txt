I'm just so alone, I'm tired of life, it's just a struggleThe only people who give a fuck about me on this planet are my parents.  I can't just live my life for my parents, I can't be a mommy's boy my whole life.  

I have no friends, I have never had a serious girlfriend, I've only had one for a really really short brief moment.  I keep getting passed over by girls for other dudes.  For example, I just found out a girl who turned me down stating she wasn't interested in dating or hooking up, is now fucking a guy that I know.  

What a blow to the ol confidence, I'm not even good enough to fuck for a girl who has fucked 16 dudes by the time she's 20.

Tinder doesn't work out, I never get any matches, and the one or two I get every now and then never work out.  In fact, I just had a girl unmatch me after I sent her a nice little message asking about her.  

I just work a shitty job, come home to my parent's house, and go to sleep until I get up the next day to go to work.  Weekends are typically me just doing nothing in particular.  No friends, no girls are interested in doing anything with me.  

It's really a pathetic existence that I lead.  What's the point of it all?  I'm unhappy, I'm lonely, I can't even drown my sorrow in booze or weed.  I have to face this shitty existence called life head on with no way to dull the pain.  

My co-workers all tell stories about how they find girls, date them or bang them, and move on.  How when they broke up with a girl they had another one they were talking to within a few weeks.  I'm hearing stories of what normal male adult life should be.  I can't even function as an adult.  

There is no point to all of this, why not just end it all.  We all die eventually.
