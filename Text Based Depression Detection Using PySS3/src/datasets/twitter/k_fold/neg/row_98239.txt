I'm not coping anymoreThere's so many things that have gone and are still going wrong with my life since the start of the pandemic, I don't even have enough energy to talk about it, especially when I have to explain everything from the start. Long story short, I wasn't doing great with my mental health before it all started (to say the least), but what's going on in my head now is way beyond what my issues were back then. To be fair, I don't even think the things that happened to me, or went wrong, would be this devastating for most people, I think most people would just go on. But I guess I was never strong enough to begin with, and yeah... Anyway, the most recent mishap is that I think I got corona after being SUPER careful for the past six months. I still can't think of any way I could have possibly got it and I'm so sick of everything going wrong in my life ALL THE TIME. Also I live with my parents and yeah, they're not exactly the healthiest specimens as it is, and I'm terrified that I could give them corona, or maybe have done already (it's too early for the symptoms to kick in if they're infected). So atm I'm just sat here locked in my room crying constantly. Also have exams coming up so I should really focus on that but I just can't anymore, and it adds to everything. Also feeling so awful and guilty for putting my SO through all this. And yeah I'm so worried that once I start coughing my lungs will be finished. Bye bye breathing! It's all just too much, I've been thinking about taking my own life so much recently, I just don't know how to cope.
