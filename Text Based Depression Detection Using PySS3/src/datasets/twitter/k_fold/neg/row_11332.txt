I'm never going to be happy.I constantly want to end my life. I don't want to be alive. Every time i feel better, i go back to feeling badly. I can't even self harm where i like to anymore because my work uniform shows it. I have bpd and i push everyone i care about away. My FP makes me feel like a piece of shit. I used to look for help when i was feeling suicidal because i knew if i killed myself it would hurt the people around me, but now i dont even care.
