No one in my life cares about meI feel like my family and friends just don't care about me.

I'm ignored by most of my family. My father is abusive. I'll try to have a conversation but they'll just flat out ignore me and talk to someone else. I tried telling my mom about how I feel and she was very judgmental and said she'd help get me therapy. That was months ago and I've asked her about it and she starts getting mad and disregards anything I say.

Nobody is ever interested in anything I say. I feel like I'm just their punching bag, I only ever get yelled at or made fun of.

I tried meeting up with friends, but they literally just left me waiting there. They didn't even bother to tell me they were busy beforehand. They weren't busy, they hung out with each other and started posting it over Instagram.
