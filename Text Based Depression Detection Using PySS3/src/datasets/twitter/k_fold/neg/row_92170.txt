I don't know what to do.So things haven't been going really well this year. Been thinking of self harm, suicide and all that bad stuff. At this point I don't really know what I enjoy  because of how my parents pressure me into everything to the point that i don't really know what I'm doing in my life or why I'm doing it. I feel like my whole life is about making my parents proud or just fitting in with everybody. I just feel like my life is worthless and I have no control over it whatsoever.
