GrievingMy ex boyfriend who was also  my only and best friend died of cancer about a month ago. He was the only person who I could rely on and who never left me no matter how bad my depression was.

Now he is gone. He told me he would be there for me no matter what. Now he is gone.

I feel isolated and feel as though I lost my voice.

My depression is sinking in. 

They are having a memorial/funeral for him tomorrow but I decided not to attend it. He didn't care about his funeral. I don't think he even wanted one. It is arranged by his family and I understand it is intended to help those who are left behind, but honestly, it won't help me at all to live through the pain again. 

am I selfish? 

I miss him.
