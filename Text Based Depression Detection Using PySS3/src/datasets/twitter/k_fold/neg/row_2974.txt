I hurt one of the only people I've ever loveI've been dealing with depression, anxiety, and a host of other mental illnesses to varying extents over the past few years. Recently, after experiencing months of mounting paranoia and hallucinations I had a psychotic episode and assaulted one of my friends. She wasn't hurt very badly, but I don't even recall the incident.

I've been contemplating killing myself for as long as I can remember. I've had two previous attempts, and now I'm ready for my third. I've lost the only thing I've ever cared about in my life, no, I've completely destroyed it. Everyone thinks I'm a monster now, but I wasn't even in control of my actions.

I hate myself more than I can express. I'm ready for this pain to be over. Maybe people won't be as upset about my death now that so many of them hate me...
