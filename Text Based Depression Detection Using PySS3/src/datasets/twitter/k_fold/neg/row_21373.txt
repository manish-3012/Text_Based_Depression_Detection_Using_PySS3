Request for assistance/advice Keeping this short and to the point, apologies if this is outside the scope of the subreddit:

Have a friend, she is in California, and I just found out she tried to OD last night.  She has had suicidal episodes in her past a few years ago.  I'm on the East Coast and no place near her.

She has access to the VA (was Air Force) but her complaint is that she was placed on medication and not assisted otherwise.  I am in no position to assist her emotionally, physically or otherwise.

Questions In Order:
#1 - Is there a group/support structure in place for veterans that will reach out to her

#1a - Without the draconian responce of just tossing her in a hospital to be observed

#2 - Barring that in the Huntington Beach area is there somewhere I could direct to for people who basically have no spare cash and clearly are in need?

I've given her the National Hotline and have been talking with her, but I am not a professional in this arena and tried pointing her towards some of the support communities on here...she was not really receptive to the idea.  

Next steps?
