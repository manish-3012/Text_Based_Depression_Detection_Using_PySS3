i am killing myself may 29th.i fucked up again.
he was so perfect and he left because im fucking psychotic, and fucking depressed.  i dont blame him.  i miss him.  everyone ive ever had has left because im so fucking sad all the time.  everyone knows im too much of a pussy to do it so no one is even worried.  im tired of being fucking ignored. im tired of everything.
ive been depressed for 5 fucking years. 12-17. its all i can fucking remember.
i do nothing for anyone in this world. i just take and threaten.  i ruin others fun.  im a broken record.
im probably too weak to follow through, but when i was drunk itold someone id kill myself may 29th.  and they told everyone. and nobody gives a fucking shit.
i doubt ill be able to do it. i really do.  right now all i want is to slit my wrists.  ive wanted to for so fucking long.  if i dont do it tonight, ill probably do it tomorrow.  injuries heal.  maybe people will care for once.  i cant change myself.  i cant do anything at all.
all i ever say is im sorry, but i do nothing to back it up.  and to those reading this, im sorry, but im not doing anything to help myself.  i have lost.
