I'm tired of being in painI've attempted since my last post. I don't know what else to do. My best friends hung out without me. They didn't invite me and one of my friends excuses was because my parents would've said no which isn't even true we've been talking abut hanging out for a long time. I'm cutting them off. I'm completely alone. I need help.
