Iâ€™m Doing Great, But I Feel I Donâ€™t Have PurposeIâ€™m 17, I have a 3.8 GPA, I do track, cross country, plays, musicals, and play guitar. I love the arts and am interested in a computer science degree. I have plenty of friends and family that I know love me. But at the end of the day it just all feels empty and it would just be nicer to not exist. I should feel extremely fulfilled but I just feel empty and useless.
