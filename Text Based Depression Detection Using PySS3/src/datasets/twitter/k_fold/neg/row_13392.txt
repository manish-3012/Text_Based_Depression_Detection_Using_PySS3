Transgender, Severely Ill, Terrified, and Running Out of IdeasI'm FTM transgender, and I came out three weeks ago. I'm having some bad dysphoria. Almost everyone took it well except my mom and my boyfriend. My boyfriend broke up with me, and I live with him and a friend who he's banging, and it kills me to see them be intimate. I was just diagnosed with a very rare brain chemistry disorder, in which I produce dangerously high levels of a naturally occurring acid in the brain, which has caused profound depression, migraines so bad I'm passing out and throwing up constantly, irrational thinking, erratic moods, focus problems, and extreme fatigue. I can't get the treatment I need due to a hiccup with my insurance. I'm so physically sick that I can barely function, let alone work, which is super bad, because I work quality assurance for funeral homes while my mom and grandpa are dying. I am getting evicted this week, and have barely eaten in weeks. My wages are being garnished, and I am terrified. My friend and ex are tired of being around me because of the mood disturbances that the brain disorder has caused, and I am trying to control them, but I can't completely. I feel abandoned, and I have no circle due to crippling social anxiety.

I am feeling like I want to walk to the most beautiful place I know and watch the world fade away as I overdose. Hopelessly romantic, I know, but it sounds like the nicest self-inflicted way to go.
