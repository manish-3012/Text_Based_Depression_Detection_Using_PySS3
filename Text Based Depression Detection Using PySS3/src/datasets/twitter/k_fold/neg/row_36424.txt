I'm probably going to do it soonJust had an argument with my emotionally abusive father. He threatened to kick me out of the house, but I guess I'm lucky to still be here. I can't even cry really loud right now, because he'll come into my room and start yelling at me. I have no friends or other family I can talk to about this. I am going through this, all alone. This is the only place where I feel safe talking about this. But even he found out that I was posting here, and got pissed off at me. Then tomorrow, I have to go to school and hide my feelings, otherwise I'll be mocked. I want to escape, but I have nowhere I can go. Death seems like my only option. Fuck this shit. Fuck this world, and every piece of shit human being that walks on it. I deserve better than this.
