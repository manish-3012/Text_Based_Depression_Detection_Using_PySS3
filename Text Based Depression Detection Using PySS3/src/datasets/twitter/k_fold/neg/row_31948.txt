I donâ€™t know what to do (cw mentions of self harm &amp; suicide)Iâ€™m failing in my first semester of college. I had the Act scores, the grades, etc to get into an ivy in high school- even with all the mental illness I managed to make it through. But it didnâ€™t get into any of them, and the school I did get to and wanted to go to my mother suddenly withdrew my deposit from because she wanted to redo the floors instead. 
I havenâ€™t learned anything. I havenâ€™t found any of the work engaging. Everything is so fucking awful. I rot in my room all day will slowly I start developing more and more neurosis. I canâ€™t focus for more than a second. The body dysmorphia makes me not want to open my computer because I could see my face in it. I canâ€™t read any more the letters all come off the page Iâ€™m speaking this out right now because itâ€™s hard to type. My parents are assholes as usual. And god the anxiety and the depression- everything and nothing at once, tou know the gist, itâ€™s under it all. Iâ€™m almost at the same level I was when I first tried to kill myself 4 years ago, before my current anti depressants. Iâ€™m taking my meds. But Iâ€™m still this fucked up. 
So Iâ€™m failing. I canâ€™t transfer. I hate my body more and more and the only girl who ever thought I was hot was an abusive cheater. I donâ€™t see any opportunities. The world is falling apart and I canâ€™t even finish one goddamn hw assignment. How the fuck do I explain this to my professors or my parents? I just want to walk into traffic or **** ** ******
should I hospitalize myself? I want to die so bad but it would hurt the person I care about more than anything and I canâ€™t do that to her. A what do I do?
