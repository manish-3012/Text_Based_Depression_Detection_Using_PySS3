Suicidal thoughts increase as I begin to recover from depressionHey guys, so I've been depressed for a while. I always had thoughts of dying, and only began having thoughts of suicide about 8 months. They were very spread apart, and not very intense thoughts but they would cross my mind. Mainly I would wish to simply disappear or to die in an accident that would be out of my control. Two months ago I realized I couldn't tackle my depression on my own and sought professional help. I've been put on citalopram and have had no side effects from what I can tell, and I feel like I have control of my life again. Things are going well for me I suppose, but I've begun to notice that during brief periods of thought - I often begin to think about committing suicide. It's seemingly out of nowhere and it doesn't really cause me to panic, its just a sad moment when the thought of no longer being alive overwhelms me. 

I don't feel as though I'm going to actually go through with anything, but if I'm going to recover from this stuff it would be a lot easier without wanting to die whenever I try to chill out. 
Thanks everyone.
