How long does it take to recover when someone betrays your trust?Feel like I won't be able to trust anyone again. I am not sure how people manage to lie so perfectly on your face. Its my 2nd day after the incident and don't know what to do, can't sleep don't feel like staying awake, feeling like I am gonna go insane.
