will end this life soonit has been a wonderful many-many years with a lot of rollercoaster, the highs and the lows and yet she stick with me and the kids...
i was recently been released from a very traumatic depressing place, God's will...
and now in a new place with a relative, starting a new beginning, again...
yet the nags is constant for my wife and kids from the relatives...
hence making it a concrete reason for her to leave me and the kids, to care for her family back at the old place...
i totally understand her stress...and the kids too
she doesn't want us to relocate to a different place, she just wants to go back there...to the old place
and if she does this soon which i believe it will happen, i will be left with the kids, they are very close to my wife and this will give a big blow for them mentally...
and i can't bear watching them suffers without a mother...
and so i decided to sacrifice myself soon, end this life so that at least the kids will have a mother that will dearly love and take care of them...
