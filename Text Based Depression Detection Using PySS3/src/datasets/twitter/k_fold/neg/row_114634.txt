Imagine trying everything the world had to offer, and still feeling empty.A lot of you ("helpers") on here seem to think the world is full of vast opportunities. I guess that depends on who you are. I've tried everything the world has to offer *me. I'm not rich, white, or a guy. Not saying that matters...not saying it doesn't matter either.
Some days I feel like life is worth it. Today isn't one of those days.
Tomorrow, I'm hoping isn't one of those days. I plan to go to Walmart and find something I can kill myself with. Will it be a flame or a sharp object. Will it be poison. Not sure.
Life is sort of weird. If you are dumb, you will go far. If you are smart, you might go further. If you are neither, just mediocre, in every sense, you go no where. Or maybe you go everywhere, with nothing to gain. 
I'm signing off this trashed reddit account. I'm signing out of the world. Thanks for your attention.
