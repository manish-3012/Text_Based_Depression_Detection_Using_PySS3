ROTC didn't work out, considering suicide.Background: I applied to USAFA in 2011, received a congressional nomination but lost my appointment to budget restrictions (thanks Obama). I decided the best route was ROTC. I went to ERAU-Daytona AFROTC for a year, left because I ran out of money and transferred to KU for 3 years. I was in Engineering, Electrical to be specific, and the first year i was there I was denied an enrollment allocation to attend officer field training. The next year, I was up for my slot but was told that I my slot was again cut because of budget considerations (2014 RIF act). It was the biggest devastation I ever went through. 3 years later, I am in deep student loan debt, (178,000$) and working in the private sector. I wanted to try again with OTS but am unsure. I am considering Guard or Reserve. Can you guys help me out? Maybe their is an underlying issue that isn't being seen and I need a second set of eyes to come to terms with it?
I thought about this tonight and realized that my peak was really about 2014. It's been a downhill slide since then and I'm now considering suicide.
