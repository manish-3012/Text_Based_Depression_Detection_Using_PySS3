How do I deal with it?Right now Iâ€™m just staring at the clock, anxious because of work. Iâ€™m relative average at my job. I make a lot of mistakes and hate when I do. Why am I always thinking about negative things, why canâ€™t I be happy and deal with it. Every time I know I have work the day after I feel like throwing up. Why is it that Iâ€™m so mentally unstable. Nothing is really wrong, but I feel like everything is wrong. Bad things are going to happen. Itâ€™s going to be a shitty day. I canâ€™t stop with the negative thoughts. I just want to die. I just want the world to end. FUCK MAN. I canâ€™t control my emotions either. Something is really wrong with me. Iâ€™m probably going to commit suicide for no real reason at this point. Iâ€™m useless, my family probably will be thinking Iâ€™m selfish if Iâ€™d killed myself. I just canâ€™t stop it. It just hurts. I wish the world would just end. Please just end.
