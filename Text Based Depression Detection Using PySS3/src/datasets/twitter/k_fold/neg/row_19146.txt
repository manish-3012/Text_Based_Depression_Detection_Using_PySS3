It's funnyI come here to have someone listen to me. Maybe show some compassion. But how much can this place really help? It's full of total strangers saying that im worth something. That life gets better. That so many people love me. Well with my birthday coming up tomorrow, and the previous couple years being absolutely miserable. I can't help but feel the same things I've felt in the previous years. I feel completely alone. Worthless. Unwanted. Showered with clichÃ© happy birthdays from Facebook, with zero personal attempts. I dont want to be on this earth another year
