I've no doubts Math will drive me to kill myself.Hi, I'm xRiho. I love making jokes and posting hilariously retarded comments on Nintendo game threads. I feel like I should voice my true feelings on reddit now. 

I'm in my senior year of high school. Ever since I've entered High school, I've been failing Math. My studies have been equally shared. I've almost failed Math the first semester (76%), huh... Maybe I could put more effort into it. I did. 40% of my study time on Math among six subjects. End result? 77. One fucking percent. I barely passed the first year. I barely passed the second. Here I am now, with a 72. My parents have been honors students, they tried teaching me. If that didn't work, Math majors. Nothing helps.

I hate failure. I detest it so much. I cheated by copying homework, and both our parents were called. I'm so pathetic I got someone else in trouble for failing. I have no friends anymore, because I keep trying to understand trig. Sine, Cosine, Tan, Cotangent, Secant, Cosecant. I can't even remember a single value, or what each would even mean. I'd rather die than disappoint and humiliate my outstanding parents. Nobody would give a damn if I killed myself. I know, I've tried. My parents just told me they'd rather cry a while than live retirement in disappointment.

Give me a reason not to give up when the single roadblock I have against me is something the adult world measures as a testament of worth ; critical thinking. Literally purposeless.
