Not interestedYou can tell me I have so much to live for, I get that. But I donâ€™t want to live for that. Sure, itâ€™ll be hard on my parents and friends, but the problem is I donâ€™t care. Iâ€™m so damn numb that nothing matters. Iâ€™m just numb. Is it selfish? Probably. But once again I donâ€™t care. I have a thing starting with a guy but I want to genuinely die so badly. Nothing matters to me. No motivation. No willpower.
