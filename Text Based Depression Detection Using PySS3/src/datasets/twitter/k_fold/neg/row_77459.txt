I don't think I can do it anymoreNobody cares about me. My "friends" are closer to each other than they are to me and don't give a shit about including me in anything, or even trying to hide the fact that they don't care if I'm even there. 






My parents don't care about me, everything I do is disappointing and not good enough. I'm a fucking parasite locked in my room in their house all day every day. 




I'm terrible at my job and can't get another one no matter how hard I try. I'm disabled and because of that nobody wants to befriend me and guys are repulsed by me. 





I have no talents, no money, no prospects, no future. I just want to kill my self. Cutting is the only thing that calms me down nowadays and I have 2 bottles of sleeping pills ripe for ODing on. 




I'm just fucking tired. I don't want to wake up tomorrow. Every moment I'm alive is pain and sorrow and I'm fucking tired. I just want to die.
