Not doing it anymore. Iâ€™m killing myself before the end of 2020.Iâ€™m done. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m trans, so thereâ€™s one big reason. Being trans fucking sucks, itâ€™s not this beautiful amazing thing the media paints it to be, it FUCKING SUCKS. I gotta deal with shit nobody else in the fucking world ever even thinks of. Have barely any support. Going to undeniably lose my brothers, who are the closest people in the world for me. I lost the girl I love, and Iâ€™d do anything to get her back but I never fucking will. Iâ€™m being set up for failure by being forced into college after I graduate. I canâ€™t transition in college, have no money, and no idea what I want to do. So Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m killing myself around the time I graduate or soon after my birthday. I tried to kill myself last month but I guess I didnâ€™t take enough pills. Fuck everything, fuck this world. Iâ€™m done.
