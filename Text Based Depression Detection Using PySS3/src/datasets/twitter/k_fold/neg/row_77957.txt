Finding comfort and peace in suicidal thoughts and thinking about death and how it would beMe 25 f I really enjoy and find it peacfull thinking about my own death, about the places i would like to take my own life and how it would feel like to do it and to be dead. I somehow know that it's messed up but is it really that bad finding peace in those thoughts? I avoid thinking about it at my suicidal/ worst moments and only let myself thinking about it when i'm rather very anxious, stressed out or really feel the urge to escape reality for a little while. Sometimes i also just think about it because it's something beautiful to me. I searched for some responses but all i can find are videos etc about having suicidal thoughts (good videos tho) but i'd like to know if it's really that dangerous or bad to feel comforted by those thoughts. Maybe i have to say that i also enjoy really sorrowful/melancholic music, poems, books, art etc.
