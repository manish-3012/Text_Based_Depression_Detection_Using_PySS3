Wherever i go whomever i talk to i see a disgusting hypocrisy. Especially in women. Like, you "hate" racism but you bash short and ugly men. You "have empathy" and "help the weak" but you bash virgins.Women don't have morals. They really don't. They only help and support what's "cool" to help and support. They lack the emotion of compassion. Their morals don't come from the emotion of compassion like men. Their moral is just built by social dynamics. I hate you women.
