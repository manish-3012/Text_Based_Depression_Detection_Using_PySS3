Tailoring My Beautiful Funeral Dress TonightIâ€™m fitting and tailoring my funeral dress I bought. Itâ€™s a little bigger around the waist and chest, and I want it to fit just right when Iâ€™m laying in a hole in the ground. 
Iâ€™ve got them plan all figured out, too. Iâ€™m going to write notes to all my friends, my family, my husband and daughter. Of course, they wonâ€™t find them until after Iâ€™m gone. I was going to cover my perfectly made bed in rose petals to match the colour of my dress, lay down with all the notes and everything in one big envelope in my hands, and take a bunch of pills. 
Iâ€™m really going to miss my husband and daughter when Iâ€™m gone, but I know heâ€™ll find a nice woman who will raise my baby right. 
Iâ€™m going to tell my daughter in the note that mommy always loved her, and that Iâ€™m  very sorry that I never got to see her grow up. But just know that Iâ€™m always with her, every step of the way. 
Iâ€™m going to die in a very elegant way. Surrounded by rose petals, in my beautiful dress, hair and makeup done up perfectly. And maybe, just maybe, Iâ€™ll work up the courage to wear rose red lipstick on my lips...
