So is it still "giving up" when you are completely out of options and hope? I am ugly.

I am poor.

And I no longer even have a personality to make up for it due to PTSD.

I have sabotaged my credit and life beyond repair.

I can't find a job.

I will be alone forever even if I take a shit job.

The pain is too much.

I am just a burden right now, and I can't handle it.

I was always the one that everyone could rely on, now I am pathetic.

I think this is my last week alive.
