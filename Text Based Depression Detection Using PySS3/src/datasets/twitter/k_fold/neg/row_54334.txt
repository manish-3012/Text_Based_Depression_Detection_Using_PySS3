Iâ€™m starting to think that no one can help meI canâ€™t talk to anyone. I have too much past trauma, too many bad memories. I want peace but Iâ€™m tired of suffering in my mind. Iâ€™m tired of the triggers, the could be ptsd, Iâ€™m tired of the memories, the trauma. The praying for help when it doesnâ€™t come. Why am I still here? Why? My mind might break. I donâ€™t want to lose myself. Iâ€™m tired of this. So tired. Iâ€™m tired of being the way I am.
