Apparently my Social Darwinist Father wants me to kill myselfI will never be enough for him. I was born a female, I didnâ€™t graduate with honor, Iâ€™m still jobless despite Iâ€™ve been trying my best in every interviews but no phone calls returned. 

And now my social darwinist father, shouted to my face that Iâ€™m his biggest failure. He wanted a boy, he wanted his child to be CEO of top ten multinational companies, all money that he had spent for my education, wasted to a big loser. 

Iâ€™m done. With everything Iâ€™ve been trying for the past 24 years to please him. Iâ€™m going to kill myself.
