I feel like Iâ€™m going crazyI donâ€™t know why but yesterday I just collapsed emotionally. Itâ€™s so damn hard acting happy all the fucking time. I kinda have to snap out of being in a stupor because I get this lifeless stare. I feel so useless. I know I have to do things. But itâ€™s so hard trying when I know that I donâ€™t have any prospects for myself. I even feel like a different person, I just feel like a broken person. Iâ€™m always nervous and I have a strong fear of being abandoned because of things that happened.

I was laying in bed yesterday when I broke down curled up in a ball and crying. A relative walked in and tried to help me. Iâ€™ve never felt so embarrassed. How do you tell a normal person that you donâ€™t want to live anymore, especially someone who you care about. It breaks my heart even more. I canâ€™t. I kept giving them vague answers because I didnâ€™t want them to know whatâ€™s going on. Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™m just blabbing. I guess I just wanted to let it out.
