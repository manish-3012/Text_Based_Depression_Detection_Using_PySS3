â€œyou canâ€™t depend on someone to save you, you need to save yourselfâ€ thatâ€™s bullsh.ti had a teacher/mentor who used say this to me all the time, and iâ€™ve always believed in this quote until the last couple of weeks. i see why some people think this way, i mean they think everybodyâ€™s minds work like theirs, their mind isnâ€™t pointing out all the things they hate about themselves all the time. how am i suppose to save myself when iâ€™m the one whoâ€™s destroying me? i know iâ€™m not strong enough to save myself. maybe all we need is someone whoâ€™ll be there for us, someone who wonâ€™t give up on us.
