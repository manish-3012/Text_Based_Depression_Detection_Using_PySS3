Should I do it?Okay. So a long time Iâ€™ve been very depressed though suicide has always passed my mind I never entertained it very much. 
But since quartile started I started to think of suicide more. Figuring out ways I can die and give myself enough time to kilo myself. But I always seemed to be able to snap myself out of it. 
But recently I just been so suicidal. Like I tried to overdose but kid eating pills my sister knocked on my door and I immediately stopped. Went to the bathroom and forced myself to throw up. After that day I cried so hard and asked god seriously if I should kill my self and to give me any sign to not to. And my life been hell ever since. 
I guess that is a sign right? Iâ€™m not scared of dying. But I donâ€™t know?  Iâ€™m tired. So tired. And Iâ€™ve been acting very distant and not really paying attention. My parents saw it as disrespect and think that Iâ€™m being rude and are yelling at me constantly. Itâ€™s just Iâ€™ve been so suicidal and I just canâ€™t stop thinking about it. 
My sister depends on me so much what will happen after I leave. Will she have someone to look over and defend. I donâ€™t know. But I know she has a bright future and I know sheâ€™ll be an amazing artist that will inspire many. I just dokt want to be her reason for downfall. 
Everyone thinks Iâ€™m so so strong and have no emotions but they donâ€™t know how hard Iâ€™ve been struggling. I canâ€™t ask them they never understood and found the fact that I wanted to die as a joke? 
Iâ€™m tired. I donâ€™t want to be here. All the signs are there. And I say Iâ€™m ready and I donâ€™t care. But donâ€™t I care if Iâ€™m still posting this and searching if I should kill myself. I tried to text a suicide hotline to ask questions but all they send was fucking robotic ass answers. Like I want to talk to someone not a robot. 
I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m tired. I just donâ€™t want to keep fighting if it just gets worse from here. I feel like I have nothing going for me. I guess this is the end. I donâ€™t know
