I hate birthdaysI have dreaded every birthday since I turned 18, it's a milestone where I can look back and see what a pathetic waste I am, best case scenario I work all day to keep me distracted, get home cry for a couple hours and go to sleep, worst case scenario I have to sit at home and *think* all day I hate the goddamn thinking should really put a stop to it with a bullet. Hopefully I will eventually.
