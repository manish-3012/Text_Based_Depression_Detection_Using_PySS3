Stress.My grandmother is going into surgery soon, Iâ€™m really scared about it. I have already enough I am stressed about, schoolwork, my brothers mental health that is getting him taken out of his own school, my recent loss of a friend who betrayed my trust, my grandfathers death, breaking up with my girlfriend, recently going to the ER because I had a food allergy that I never knew I had, and dealing with psoriasis and autism. The only thing that keeps me calm is the penguin plush I own, itâ€™s the only thing that makes me feel safe.
