Give me reasons not to kill myself...I posted here almost 90 days ago saying Iâ€™d give it 90 days to get better. They havenâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to give up, but Iâ€™m so exhausted from the being build up for a hot minute followed with sadness, disappointment, hurt, and anger. Iâ€™m tired of fighting. But Iâ€™m terrified to be seen in a coffin and be a tragic story for people to forget about a week later.
