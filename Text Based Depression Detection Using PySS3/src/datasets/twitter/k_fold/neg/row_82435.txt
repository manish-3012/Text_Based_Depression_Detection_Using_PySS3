Itâ€™s my birthday.Today sucked. I sat in my office all day, with one coworker, who never mentioned my birthday. 
I came home and tried to be normal. My kid slapped something together for me in ten minutes, I acted like it was the best thing in the world. I got one card, from my mom, that didnâ€™t even have an envelope. My fiancÃ©â€™s birthday was Monday, so we already had cake and ice cream in the kitchen left over. I went to dinner with my family and my brother was a big dramatic mess. They all went to the movies after and didnâ€™t even invite me. It was awkward and all I could think about is how I wish I was never born. 

I know this sounds so stupid and materialistic or something. Itâ€™s been years since anyone really paid attention to my birthday, which I used to absolutely love celebrating. 

I thought it might be different today. I donâ€™t need a lot. Really. I just wanted to feel wanted. Not leftover. 

Two weeks ago my fiancÃ© and two best friends sat me down because he had gone through my phone and browser history. He knows I spend a lot of time lurking here. That Iâ€™m texting crisis hotlines and reading about painless ways to go. They all said they were worried about me but I feel like they made me feel worse about myself. 

I think about killing myself Every. Single. Day. Life just keeps getting harder. Every breath, every blink, every pump of blood aches my soul. Iâ€™ve been like this since I was 14 and even in the best days, I think about it. 

This is just a ramble. I canâ€™t talk to anyone anymore, I donâ€™t want to deal with it. I just thought maybe today would be the kind of day that I could bare through without sobbing myself to sleep in the dark. I thought the couple people I care about would get that Iâ€™m in the dark place harder than ever, after that little intervention, and maybe reach out. Call. Something. 

Sorry 
Thanks for reading I guess.
