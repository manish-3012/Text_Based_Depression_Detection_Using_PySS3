I've reached my breaking pointBeen suicidal for months. In the depths of the worst depression episode that started a year ago. I feel absolutely no joy, nothing but constant numbness and sadness. My whole world is falling apart. My dad hates himself for the pain he caused me, and that makes me feel even worse. My mom is as blind as usual. Ever since I was a kid I have had the worst things happen to me: abuse, bullying, ostracization, compulsions, chronic health disorders, never ending mental illness. 

But I can't kill myself because it would completely destroy my dad, who has his own history of depression and suicide attempts. I just can't. He's reliant on me, he wants to live with me after he finalizes his divorce from my mom. While my sister is in college living it up without a care in the world, I will be living with my dad who will be in his 60s while I will be in my mid 20s. I had hoped to be able to free myself from this suffering by running away and enjoy what's left of my youth. But I'm starting to feel like I will never ever be able to live a life that isn't entangled in a very painful past.
