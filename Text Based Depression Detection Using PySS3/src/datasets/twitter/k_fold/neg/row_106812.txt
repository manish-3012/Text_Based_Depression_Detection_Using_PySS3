Getting tired of tryingIâ€™ve been extremely depressed ever since I was put on medication last summer. I made my second suicide attempt in March. Iâ€™ve been in therapy ever since. The kicker? I canâ€™t go off the medication because itâ€™s treating my cancer... which is killing me. 

My two best friends know about this. But Iâ€™m so tired of them feeling the need to watch out for me. To keep me safe. I donâ€™t want to be the friend that drags their atmosphere down or holds them back anymore. 

I know without a doubt that this is my meds talking. When Iâ€™m off them (I get one or two days off a month), Iâ€™m my usual happy self. But Iâ€™m exhausted of the fight. This feels like a waiting game, who will kill me first, my cancer or my meds? 

Iâ€™m at the point where I canâ€™t stand the thought of my friends finding my body, because I know theyâ€™d feel guilty. Iâ€™ve found myself planning a less suspicious suicide, some sort of car accident  where I hit a tree and kill myself without it looking like suicide. Then maybe they wonâ€™t feel bad. I try so hard every day to see the bright side but itâ€™s growing dimmer all the time. Cancer really is the silent killer.
