i only have one reason left to liveand that one reason is someone that would be heartbroken if i was gone

i want to disappear so badly but heâ€™s holding me onto this world that hurts me so

i sometimes wish he would let go so i could end it all without causing him so much pain. heâ€™s a good person. absolutely extraordinary. i donâ€™t know why he chose me to fall in love with. i guess iâ€™ll never know. i wish i knew why even after i hurt him so many times he still stays

he obviously doesnâ€™t know how badly i want to die but the hard part is honestly just doing it. if i just had a button that would zap me from existence forever then i would click it. but dying it painful and iâ€™m afraid of pain. pain is how i got here in the first place. i guess i donâ€™t really know what to do anymore. maybe iâ€™ll reach a point where the pain overrides the fear and guilt and iâ€™ll do it and finally be free. but weâ€™ll see
