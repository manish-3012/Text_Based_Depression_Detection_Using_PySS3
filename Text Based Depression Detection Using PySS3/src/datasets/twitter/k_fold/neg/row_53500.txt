Struggling after a failed suicide attemptI attempted twice last year and I nearly succeeded with one of my attempts.  And now ever since I failed I have this lingering feelings/thoughts of â€œIâ€™m not suppose to be here right nowâ€, â€œI should be deadâ€, â€œthereâ€™s somewhere else I have to be right nowâ€, â€œwhy am I still hereâ€, â€œI have unfinished business/I need to finish what I startedâ€ 

There are moments where I can completely fine but then i can just switch in a matter of seconds to feeling suicidal and capable of committing again if I just get the resources I need.  

Has anyone else felt the same way?
