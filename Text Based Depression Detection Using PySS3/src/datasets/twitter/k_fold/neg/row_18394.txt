First post. I'm struggling here. Asking for help.I've lurked for years and know yall help people sometimes when they're down.   

Im 25, military aviator.  I was planning to go home to Texas to see a girl I love.  Found out she is seeing someone else.  Now I'll be spending the holidays alone.  If I make it that long.        For a clique. . . I was holding on too tight, I think I lost the edge.
