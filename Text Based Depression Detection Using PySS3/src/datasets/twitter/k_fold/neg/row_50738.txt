A hopeless situationI'm fat, ugly, socially withdrawn and I'm doing a degree which I have absolutely no interest in. When I was thinner, things weren't too much different because ultimately I'm ugly... I believe there is no way out except plastic surgery which I won't be able to afford till 4 years later when I get a job after my education. Family situation is no better as they have rather toxic personalities.

I wish I have the courage to commit suicide and end it all for once on my terms.
