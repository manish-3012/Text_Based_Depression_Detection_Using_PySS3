HeyDidn't exactly know where else to go.  turning to the internet is definitely the lowest i've been.  

I've suffered with self-diagnosed depression for years.  For as long as i can remember.  And with those years of depression came thoughts of suicide.  

The reasons i have for not doing it are getting slimmer each day.  It's currently just down to my family.  I don't want to hurt them.  I don't want to be the cause of stress in my parents' life.  

but it's gotten too far.  I have the strangest visualizations and daydreams of my self-caused death.  

I don't know where to turn, which is why i'm here, I guess.  I don't want to utter the words to anyone in fear of being  heckled or mocked for my reasoning.  At times I think my reasons are fucking ridiculous, what is my friend/a suicide hotline attendant/a therapist going to think?  

I just can't understand living with this much mental fatigue.  

Thanks for reading, at least someone, somewhere understands.
