I cant deal with thisI have a lot of family issues and I really just want to go live with my mom because i have a very bad history with my dad that i dont want to talk about  and we just moved to utah and i really dont like it here i never agreed to it and said multiple times i dont wanna go and i visit my moms house for like a month and then i to go. Reaching the end i was really sad and in pain because i love my mom and my brother and sister and my stepdad because they are the only ones that really care about me and make me feel like i have something worth living for but i left now im over here i feel as if nothing matters anymore and i keep seeings things that remind me of my moms house and the fun times and its just a lot of pain that nobody understands we made a deal i could move in eventually but its a very long time and i dont really trust it and i just dont have the motivation to get through anymore. Nobody helps me and we never try to find a solution and there arent any all i want to do is move back but i know that no matter what i do nobody understands how bad i feel. I know this is a stupid reason to post and there are people that get through way worse problems but im just going off of what i feel.
