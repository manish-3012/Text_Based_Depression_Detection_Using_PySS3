How do you deal with suicidal thoughts?Hey there guys.

Lately I've thinking a lot about suicide and it kinda scares me, but I feel like l as time continues I am starting to accept my fantasys about killing myself. I am afraid of actually committing suicide before I get the chance to talk to professionals. So do you guys have some methods to deal with these kind of thoughts?
