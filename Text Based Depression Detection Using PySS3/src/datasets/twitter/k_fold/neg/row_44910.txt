Circling the DrainOver the years I'd gotten used to the apathy side of depression, you know, the part where you don't really have any pronounced emotions anymore, even the sadness. Every now and then something in my life would happen that temporarily brings some happiness, but it being temporary means I get reset into the "immense sadness" part of depression eventually. I got kind of half-reset recently, and I don't know why. It's certainly not winter blues, but it's also not just plain sadness, it's more like dread and apathy mixed. I'm 22 right now, I used to think that if I don't change myself, or external reasons don't change me, by the time I'm 25, I'll conclude that this is just how it's going to be for the rest of my life and I'll do you-know-what, but now it feels like a year should be shaved off. Work is unfulfilling and with no future, I feel like I might have developed some kind of learning disability so learning is seemingly off the table too, dating and sex life is dead partially due to just not being a desirable person and I stupidly was picky about the one person who was interested for longer than a week, then again she didn't know that much about me yet so who knows how long that would've lasted. I'm the black sheep of the family and I'm fairly certain my one remaining best friend doesn't actually care that much for me, she has jokingly said I'm just a "distraction" to her rather than a friend, but honestly I'm not even sure if it **was** a joke.
