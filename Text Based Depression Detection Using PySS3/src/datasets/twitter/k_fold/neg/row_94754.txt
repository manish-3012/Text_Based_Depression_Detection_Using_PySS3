So closeI find no happiness or enjoyment anymore. All I want is for this all to be over. I have been suicidal on and off for most of my life but I really don't see myself coming back from it this time. I just want to opt out of life and all that it entails. I wish my family and friends would just let me go. I can't even go to psych emergency with corona virus, I'd just be wasting space. It's only a matter of time...
