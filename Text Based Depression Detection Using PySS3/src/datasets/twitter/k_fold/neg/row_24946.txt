I wish I had the guts to do itI am 50,000 dollars in college debt, I work a job where I am treated like a chump and have to take it, while they underpay me, only let me stand at a spot until a customer gives me purpose. I canâ€™t read I canâ€™t write I canâ€™t draw I have to just stand there and reflect on the fact Iâ€™m a worthless pile of shit that has literally wasted my life thinking working hard, being kind and following passions leads anywhere. Customers insult me and my coworkers and our managers donâ€™t care at all, weâ€™re replaceable grunts.

I truly wish I had the resolve to go across the street to Walmart use my pay check money to buy a gun and just end it. But Iâ€™m too afraid and still have some deluded dream things will get better and that tiny fantasy is what keeps me from getting it over with. Once that gets snuffed out I hope Iâ€™ll be willing to say enough is enough.
