iâ€™m back and i have a planiâ€™ve been suicidal for about 3 years straight now. iâ€™ve posted to this sub many times before on different accounts. but now it seems that offing myself is the only option.
my life is a mess. but whatâ€™s driving me to feel this way the most is the fact that i have a crush on a teacher. iâ€™m 17, sheâ€™s 26. iâ€™m not in her class anymore, but i still canâ€™t stop thinking about her

youâ€™ll probably think this is gross or crazy or whatever, but to me sheâ€™s the love of my life. i donâ€™t know what to do. my plan initially was to give her a letter explaining myself at the end of the year, when i graduate and am finally 18. but what good will this do? i know sheâ€™ll never feel the same way about one of her former students who is almost a decade younger than her. the only thing i want out of life is her. thatâ€™s it. but apparently thatâ€™s too much to ask.

so now, i feel like my only choice is to just die. school is shit, my grades are shit, i have no ambitions other than drugs and drinking. why live a life i despise? my plan is to make enough money and then buy a gun when i turn 18 in december. i will write my teacher a lovenote and then shoot myself. what else can i do? iâ€™ve tried to better my life so many times, but i get nothing out of it. she is the only thing on my mind. constantly. i canâ€™t concentrate on anything else. i love her to death.

if youâ€™ve read this far, iâ€™d like to thank you for caring about my perdicament. i just wanted to see what everyone thinks of this. i still have a few months to live if i stick to the plan, so i might change my mind. but right now this is how i feel. c, i love you.
