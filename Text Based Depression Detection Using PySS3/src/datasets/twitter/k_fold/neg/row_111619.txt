Nightmares about looking in the MirrorI've been pretty fascinated by some recurring nightmares I've been having in the past 5-6 years. 

They involve looking in the mirror .. and seeing someone in the reflection who isn't me ...  ... sometimes I even see people who I already know in real life.

Last night, the dream was slightly different. I looked in the mirror, and I didn't have a reflection at all.

And it's kind of ironic .. you'd think I should be able to see my own reflection at least once in my dreams, considering how I spend a lot of time looking in the mirror, as soon as I come home, as soon as I wake up .. before I go to bed .. etc.

Then again, I've already solved the mystery of this dream. It turns out, I can only see myself in the mirror reflection .. after I've spent time socializing with people in real life.

In other words, my dream is trying to tell me that I have no soul, that I'm a non-existent entity on this Earth .. ... because nobody on Earth is acknowledging the fact that I exist. There's nobody there to tell me .. you are real, you are here, you are You.

I've been socially isolated for years. I'm nothing but an animated piece of meat, blood and bone. The living Dead.. trapped between worlds.

It makes me wonder .. is there any point in even dying, considering how I'm .. metaphysically, already Dead? 

Nobody would care, just as nobody has ever cared about me to begin with. Maybe if I became a celebrity, things would be different .. I'd be a real girl, a real human being .. for once ... but until then, the curse goes on, I guess.
