'The last time I'll' reflections.Since I was little I have been suicidal. So many plans. Fewer attempts. The attempts, have perversed this sense of 'last time Ill see my wife...last time to kiss her...smell her..'..it almost makes you reappreciate just everything youre going to miss. Im back to that feeling. This is the last time. Will this be the last time? One way or another-would be awesome, but my heart of heart tells me the pain isnt enough to give me the balls. Guess I should go the other way then.  Always a failure. Last time. Positive, we are always dying, for we never are who we were again, and we are always being reborn, in the new moment. Ha. Load of bs.
