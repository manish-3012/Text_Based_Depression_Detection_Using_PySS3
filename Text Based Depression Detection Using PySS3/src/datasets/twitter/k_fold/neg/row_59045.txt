I don't deserve to live.Hello.
That is the thought that has been troubling me since the last few days. Why? Well, let me show you please.

- Kindergarten friend killed himself as a teenager. He gave me a letter before doing so. I wasn't supposed to open that letter until a few hours later. I didn't and listened to him. He later was found dead with slit wrists, or so I have been told at least. I do not know If that actually was his chosen method. First person I could have saved. Did I? No. I did not.

- Began taking drugs. Mostly painkillers, anti-depressants, tranquiliziers etc.

- Financed my addiction with my own money first. Then I had no money anymore. Stole from my parents. Stole from other relatives. Stole from stores and sold what I stole. How many problems I caused with that? How many employees lost their job because of what I did? No idea, but probably not too few.

- Still not enough money for my addiction. Began selling drugs myself, ripping off other people and providing them with more of the stuff. I know of at least 4 persons that overdosed through me being a reckless asshole. Dozens of other people spiraled down even deeper until they were at the complete bottom because I kept them supplied. How many lives I destroyed with that? No idea again, but probably not too few either. 

- Wanting more money I began breaking into houses and appartments. Stole money. Stole expensive items. Stole jewelry.

- Joined the military at 18. Faked some documents, lied and covered self harm scars. 

- Partied a lot, slept with dozens of women basically using them to get over the daily night terrors I had (or nightly night terrors? Ha.) Had dozens of relationships, most of them ended after a few weeks due to me being a horrible partner. I always tried to be the best person someone could meet. Always wanting to be nice, always trying to care about other people. Obviously I failed at that.

- Got away from drugs for some time.

- Fell into old habits. Began stealing from people in casinos and bars to finance addiction. Why? I don't know why. 

- Left military. Began studying.

- Continued using women to get over my night terrors. Still wasn't good enough to have a girlfriend for longer than a few weeks. 

- Met the love of my life ~5 years ago. Did everything for her. She was the best thing that could've happened to me if I'm honest.  Never before have I seen such a nice, kind, smart, caring, beautiful, funny and understanding person. Every day with her was like being in heaven. About a year ago I took her out on a date, intending to marry her after 4 years. She said no. Why? Honestly? I have no idea. But because she wasn't the first I'd say she finally realised who I am.

- 2 days ago on my birthday: Looked through my basement. Found the ring. Got upstairs, knife at wrist (I've had it there often enough the days before though). Was sure I'd finally do it. Finally strong and good enough to do one single thing properly. Nope. Began cutting my arm instead. About 35 times. Repeated that yesterday. 

- Good friend literally talked me out of wanting to kill myself. Still couldn't stop cutting myself as a punishment for everything I did back then. For the countless lives I ruined and people I disappointed. 

- Said friend is also going through a rough time. Said friend stopped me from wanting to kill myself for that day and I can't even cheer them up a bit because I suck at it. Pathetic in my opinion. Pathetic and disappointing. 

Now I'm sitting here, arms covered in blood and kinda running out of space for new cuts, seriously regreting everything I ever did. All I did was hurt other people or disappoint them. Someone like me doesn't deserve a normal life. I deserve being dead or in prison. And I'm too scared to make either one happen. Truly a disappointment. For everyone. 

Thanks for any comment.
