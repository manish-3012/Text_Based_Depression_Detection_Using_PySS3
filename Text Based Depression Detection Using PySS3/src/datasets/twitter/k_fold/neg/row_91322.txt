My spouse and I will die together.He's hurting and so am I. We are in completely different countries and he's just hopeless. I'm not strong. I can't handle both of our sorrows. I love him and want to be with him, but as living being it's just not gonna happen. So why not make our last moment together our last moment on Earth.

We have both attempted suicide a couple of times before, obviously we failed. We are scared and not sure how to do it to guarantee success. He's more into drowning since he can't swim, and I would rather suffocate using a plastic bag. My fear is if we somehow decide to die one next to the other, and one dies while the other stays alive. Just the thought of it scares me. 

There is absolutely nothing we can do about our situation. Nothing we can do to make him feel better. I can't handle it anymore. I just want us to feel better. If that means death, then so be it. I'm terrified but so be it. I don't want to live a life without him and I'M sure one day he will kill himself. And I would rather be with him that day, doing the same. 

I'm desperate and sad and scared but what can I do. I truly don't know what to do. Maybe he's dead right now, who knows. He abruptly just stopped replying to my messages. I tried calling him but his phone is disconnected. All social media, he won't reply and the message won't even reach him. I sent him a message saying I'll come to his country and let's do it. I don't know if it was wise to do so but I'm just so sad and desperate. I don't know what else to do. Literally nothing will help us. Nothing.
