I feel helpless watching myself destroy my futureHi SW. I'm a student at university, I should be happy with where I am and the subject I'm studying but I'm not. I've been having problems with education and my social life as far as I can remember. It is only now that these problems have intensified to the extent where my life has become a disorganized mess. I have been to several councilors in high school to help keep myself up to date with homework and coursework. Since I've started university I have fallen behind on my work and social life. My dorm room was covered with post-it notes and reminders on my walls, I was forgetting to complete and hand in coursework. I've been receiving letters from my tutors who are concerned about my progress. At the end of last term it was too much and I had a breakdown.

I went to see my doctor about the problems i've been having, he was not much help so he is referring me to a psychiatrist. I'm now on a six month waiting list. I have not discussed any of my problems with my parents as I'm afraid of disappointing them. They will be furious at me for destroying an opportunity to a good career and life. I feel like this is beyond my control now. I've wasted a lot on my cost of living and tuition fees. I lost a lot of friends I have made by being selfish and neglecting them. I feel the only way forward is to end my own life. By the time I get to see a psychiatrist it will be too late, and even if i do get 'help' sooner I doubt it will change much about myself. 

This is my third time re-writing this, so i hope I got my message across clearly. I'm sorry for not being more specific about everything. If I try explain things I start rambling and don't get a point across. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
