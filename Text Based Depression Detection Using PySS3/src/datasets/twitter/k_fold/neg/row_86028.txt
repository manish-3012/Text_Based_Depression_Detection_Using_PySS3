I don't know what to do.I fucked up bad at school some days ago. I won't go into detail about what I did but know that I regret it a lot. I have been having constant anxiety since then and it won't go away. I have been thinking of switching schools to one in another city to get away from it all but I don't know if I can. My friends told me they won't be interacting with me for a couple of days and now I feel more alone then ever, I never really felt part of that group and felt like they just hated me and now I am sure of it. I know that my problems might seem inconsequential to yours but I am just so alone, scared and tired of it all and I just want it all to end so I am thinking about suicide. 

Please help me, a 17 year old boy.
