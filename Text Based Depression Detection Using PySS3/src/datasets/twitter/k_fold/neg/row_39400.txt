I'm living my life as a bystander.t may just be the sleep deprivation talking, but I feel as if i'm living life as a bystander. Im not really included in much, just laughing when Im supposed too, frowning when the times right, but never **actually** experiencing said emotions. I turned to SH before, and quit about a month ago. Im gonna relapse soon anyway, but im trying to keep of that stuff, covering cuts is annoying as shit. Anyways, just figured i'd post this, letting the internet have my last memo. keeping people aware of me in my death is a lot easier than making them aware of me now.
