Fight or flight responseWhatever is going on in my head right now it is not a good thing. To keep it short, i've basically had a good life but to cope with life problems i began isolating myself and escaping reality in some way or another. When given the chance to stay calm or feel intense emotional angst, i chose the latter. I used to be in the swimming team and loved adrenaline so that may have something to do. However i keep repeating the same mistakes in order to feel this 'rush' and it has only made me feel worse. Like i know i am hurting myself but i choose this feeling anyways. I'm 22 now and am living with my dad who just keeps me afloat. I have a part time job that gives me some cash but i don't know where my life is going. Dropped out of uni countless times and don't know if i will ever make it. Everyday i wish i had mental strenght and not be this weak person that struggles with his own thoughts and desires. I think my brain has just shut down some of it's normal functioning due to all the anxiety and can't help but feel like shit whenever i stay with my own thoughts. Reality is mirroring how i feel with myself, i see people at work or on the street and i am just drifting at whatever irrational thought my brain comes up with. I am not present. Red veins have grown around my irises and i look like a drug addict( i don't do drugs anymore). Meds just fucked me up for worse i think. Somehow i am still alive. But i fantasize how jumping from high above would put an end to these thoughts.

If it is worth anything, every action has a consequence. And me being in this twisted state is nothing but the result of my poor choices.
