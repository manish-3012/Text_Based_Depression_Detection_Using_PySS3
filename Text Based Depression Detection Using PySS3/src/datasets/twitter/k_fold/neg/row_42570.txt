I desperately want to talk to someone about my suicidal ideationsBut I don't want my family to find out. They are helicopters, and don't respect privacy at all. This includes two MILs, and extended family. I'd only trust friends and siblings, but even then it's a stretch because I'm so afraid of it getting out. 

I just want the pain to stop. But I cant envision a future for myself, and in so many ways would rather everything just end. I want it to end so badly. I want help, but am so afraid to get it. I don't know what I should do.
