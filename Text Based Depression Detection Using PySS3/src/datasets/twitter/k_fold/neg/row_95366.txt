There is absolutely nothing left to keep me going...I've been holding on by a thread for the last 5 years or so. I've reached many milestones done a lot of shit but I still feel like a loser. I'm bored with life. The last three relationships I had were bogus, meaningless situations that were more like distractions than anything else. I don't have the ability to love, I disappoint more than I make happy. I DONT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT MYSELF. My religious background and the fear of there being an after life is what stops me from swallowing a bottle of pills so Im fucking stuck.

I AM PRETTY CERTAIN THAT I DO NOT WANT TO LIVE.
