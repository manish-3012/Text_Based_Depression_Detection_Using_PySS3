The ultimate test.I have been in a dark place for quite a few years. I finally made it to 25, a qusrter of a century. I found this poor pup who needed love. I adopted her around 4 years ago. She was abused and neglected. She doesn't l like people in her face. My nephew "just went in the kitchen" where she was eating catfood and bit him on the face.

Now she will be quarantined for 10 days, and after - either given to a new home, or potentially euthanized.

I can't do it, I can't let her go. She's not aggressive unless provoked, but one mistake and now she's gone.

I can't endure it. I need some help.
