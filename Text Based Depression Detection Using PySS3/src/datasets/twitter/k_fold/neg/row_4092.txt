Not Sure what to doThis isn't about me but mostly my girlfriend. To give you a quick run down she is very suicidal. She's made two attempts in the past and used to self harm. She suffers from many mental illnesses including severe OCD and depression that she cannot get medicine for. Her parents have little regard for her life and tell her things that practically encourage the behavior. She tells me the reason behind her feelings is because she hates herself and that she loses everyone she cares for. She says that she is lonely and emotionally hollow and I feel like those feelings are being added onto since she just recently moved afar and doesn't have any friends there. Basically, my questions are as somebody who immensely cares about her what can I do to help her out of this hole? And what can I do to help teach her to understand the beauty and true potential she has a a person? 

She is a minor btw
