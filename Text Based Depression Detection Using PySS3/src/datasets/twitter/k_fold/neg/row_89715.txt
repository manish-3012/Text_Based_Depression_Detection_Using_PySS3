I have no desire to get better and I just want to fucking dieI'm fucking weak and I don't even want to get better and live a life. I'm an insecure and sensitive piece of shit who is scared of everything and does nothing but waste time and make others depressed. My existence is a burden to others. Maybe I'll be an even more terrible burden if I kill myself but what's the matter if I'll be dead anyway? I was selfish in life, so what's the difference being selfish in death? Why was I even born and why do I even live? To be a lazy, worthless fucking asshole who just complains about everything instead of doing something to get better?
