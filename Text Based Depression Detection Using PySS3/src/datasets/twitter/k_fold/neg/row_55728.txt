I don't want to grow upI switched to online school in 9th grade because I couldn't handle the stress of going to school. I'm super behind in online courses, so I'm taking the GED so I can start community college a year early. I'm usually pretty optimistic about what I'm capable of, but not so much right now. I want to have a job that I like and allows me to earn a disposable income. For that I would need to go to college. I don't have the work ethic to complete a bachelor's degree, since I'm so used to never working towards anything. Nothing seems worth working for, and that includes life. The prospect of having a well-paying job (that requires effort) is even too demanding for me. I just want to exist as I do now, with all of my things paid for by my mom, and with responsibilities only to myself and my things. I acknowledge that I can't do that forever. That's the problem. I don't want to be alive if I have to settle for anything different, so I just don't want to be alive.

I've been suicidal before (I had 2 attempts), but my depression has never been this existential. It has always been due to my immediate problems and feeling trapped in my then situation. Right now, not having to be an adult feels like the best reason I've had yet to kill myself. No amount of therapy could help me manage this utter distaste for trying. I'm just not equipped to handle life.
