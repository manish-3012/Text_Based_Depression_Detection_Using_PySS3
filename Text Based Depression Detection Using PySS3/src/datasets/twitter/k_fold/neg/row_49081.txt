Everyday is a battle...and I'm losing.    Everyday is a battle to keep breathing
    And I'm losing my breath
    And I don't know where it's gone

    Before when this feeling has happened
    I had this pin light of this thing called hope
    To grasp to
    To look to
    To light a candle off of to help guide me
    Not this time

    I don't know why to keep living
    To keep breathing
    The anxiety is drowning me
    And I'm okay with it

    The thought of killing myself does not 
    Frighten me anymore
    The image of cutting too deep does not
    Sicken me anymore

    I've told myself that if I can no longer find 
    Beauty in the world around me
    Then it'd be okay
    Then is the time

    The smiles that pass my face are not real
    This is a first
    I've learned I smile so very much when 
    I'm depressed
    I've smiled a lot in the past week

    Weak...weak...strong...
    Think about which one is easier to 
    Carve into my arm...weak.

    But I guess the thought that should console me is:
    Those who speak about it never go through with it
    So here I am speaking about it
    Hoping to save myself
    Because love certainly didn't do it

    I'm sorry for existing...
