I imagine dying all the timeI constantly fall back into depression even after picking my self back up from it. I'm maybe happy for one week every six or eight. I don't think I'd ever actually kill myself because of depression but I sure do fantasize about it constantly. I hate the noise and hustle bustle rat race around me. I hate seeing the drained look on my fellow commuters faces who are obviously feeling similar things. I hate seeing and hearing the happy playing and laughing of people who don't have this problem because I feel so jealous and sad that I can't be that way too. Everything feels noisy to me. I just want to be alone yet I feel so lonely I just want to be with someone. I have friends but no family nearby. My friends love me but are obviously tired of my constantly being down for no reason. I'm getting less and less invitations because of it.

I'm so good at hiding my pain that I really don't think anyone knows.

Every day I imagine ending my life. Though like I said I don't think I will, I wish I didn't feel this way.
