Depression and isolationHi all,

I've been in quite a severe depression  for as long since I can remember - since 7th grade, I believe. However, after believing that I found love, a serious, two year relationship ended today with no rhyme or stated reason... and I'm worse than ever. I tried to talk to my friends... they pushed me away and essentially encouraged me to kill myself, leaving me alone. So at this point, I'm grasping at straws - I've lost my love, my friends, and it seems the support of my family... and I want it to end. Just let it all end. Please...
