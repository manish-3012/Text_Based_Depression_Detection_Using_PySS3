Going to kill myself Thursday night after my girlfriend leaves meIâ€™ve fucked up too many times and she always took me back. This time I donâ€™t think she will. I followed her gps last night and confronted her about cheating on me with another guy. She wouldnâ€™t admit it. We have been separated for a week now. She was getting time to get her thoughts together about giving it another chance. But today she tells me sheâ€™s staying with her friend the next 2 nights and then we will talk. 

She will leave me and I will put a gun to my head and blow my brains all over the bathroom. My only sadness is my cat. I donâ€™t know who will take care of him. He is a good cat. 

Honestly this has been a long time coming.  I tried years ago and failed but it was really a call for help. This time I cannot fail.
