How do people enjoy livingIdk I go out everyday with the thought of things are better, and nothing can go wrong, then at night I sit at home in my room and think, well damn..lifes not better, it never will be, I just tried to commit suicide, and could feel the tie I hung around the door knob pull up at my throat and felt relief as my body weight made it tug tighter, but my body julted back up as I gagged..and I looked around and felt dred that I hadnt succeeded..why cant life be so much more beautiful as it was when I was smaller?
