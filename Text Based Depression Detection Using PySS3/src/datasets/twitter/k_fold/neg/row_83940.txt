What would you do before you die?Let's say, my background is a bit rough, I came from a lower class family background, My mom was diagnosed with cancer back in 2003, my dad went almost bankrupt because of all the chemotherapy and radiotherapy trying to save mom, and I thought that was the end of it, I thought life was going to be good, but I never knew he was paying a huge amount of debts for all the Therapy, then the financial loss due to global recession in 2008 came. He was bankrupt for good, To make ends meet he sold drugs back when I was 18 during 2011 (i was still in school and everybody talked behind my back),  I was playing life in hard mode from that moment, but we came through , I was ostracized and stigmatized as a son of a drug dealer from then onwards,I rarely go out from that point onwards, no more contacts with friends whatsoever, and I am still stigmatized till today for the hard decision my father had to make, when in fact I don't even smoke pot or do drugs or drink alcohol, but yeah life was a bit harsh  then 2013 came, my mom was diagnosed again with cancer, somehow we pull it off till 2015(with no drugs dealing whatsoever) , I got my first job at my birthday at 2014, I was 21 then, but things spiral out of control, my dad was depressed by June 2015, drank alcohol a lot and died that year, and then mom also passed away that very year. 2015 was tough for me, I lost my best friend and my parents, but somehow I make it till today and I don't even know how I did it, but things hit me lately, By now, I think most human who have to endure these shit will be a bitter cynic, trying to be an optimist and TRYING TO BE HAPPY WHEN YOU ARE NOT, IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE, I realized, how frail humanity is, How our mortal coils bind us to this very reality of life, of the nature of human suffering, and how pointless it is to have a gf who gives emotional reassurance. I AM GOING TO DIE, I DID HAVE A college degree in econ and maths, but I realised, I'm not even living a life I wanted to live so what's the point? I am going to die anyway, so what should I do before I die?
