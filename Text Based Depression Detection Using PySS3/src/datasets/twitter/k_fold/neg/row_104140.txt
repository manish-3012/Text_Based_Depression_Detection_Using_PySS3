I wish I could be hospitalizedI am at the worst point in my life so far. For as long as I can remember Iâ€™ve felt like Iâ€™m drowning in a swimming pool, but Iâ€™m able to come up for air and flail and to someone on the outside, it doesnâ€™t look like Iâ€™m drowning at all. Now it feels like someone bolted a panel of glass over the swimming pool and Iâ€™m running out of air. I canâ€™t be alone with my thoughts for even a minute because Iâ€™ll start thinking about suicide. Iâ€™ve gone back to self harming and I fantasize about slitting my wrists. A lot of my internet history is ways to commit suicide. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to my parents about this and they donâ€™t care. Iâ€™ve known my whole life I was unwanted and recently itâ€™s gotten worse. My dad told me he hates me and my parents want me out of the house as soon as Iâ€™m 18 so they can fulfill their dream of moving to Canada. I told my dad I want to commit suicide and need to be hospitalized and he threatened to call the police and have me arrested. I know if I hospitalize myself I will face serious reprocussions when I get out. Even though we can afford for me to be hospitalized, I will never hear the end of the cost and i know my parents will take from my savings to pay for it. I also know my parents will accuse me of lying and seeking attention, because they always do when I bring up my mental health. Iâ€™m so stuck, I donâ€™t know what to do.
