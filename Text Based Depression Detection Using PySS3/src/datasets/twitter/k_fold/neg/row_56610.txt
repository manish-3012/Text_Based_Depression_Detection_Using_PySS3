Not entirely sure where this belongs, But you guys seem nice enough to help me.  So where to begin... So I have facets of my life that are going great, and one that does not. And its the one part of my life that is not going well that is destroying me. So no matter how much I think of the good things, the fact remains that i have not had any real relationship with a woman. I am 21 and have had no girlfriend, and this bothers me as it makes me feel unattractive and incapable of finding love. I'm worried I'm going to be unloved by not finding one person who decided to love me. At least for a little while. So now comes the reason I have decided to put this in r/Suicidewatch. Shortly after my 21st birthday, I set a date. I decided to wait until September 10 to see if life improves or I would blow my brains out. the thought comes and goes now, but the date remains. So from this I'm not sure where to go. I think about telling my mother but the last time I told her of a failed hanging, everyone freaked out. So I don't want to tell anyone I know. Also I know enough to not go up to women and say "Hey do you want to go out? if you say no I'm going to kill myself." I have friends that are female but I'm usually friend zoned. You know writing it I don't feel better at all. I feel worse. I know this is rambling but I think I got as much as I need out in the open. any questions ask them if you need them
