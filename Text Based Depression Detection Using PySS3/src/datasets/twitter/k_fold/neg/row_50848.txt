My biggest fear is medsI often feel that the way i feel right now, that everyone would be better off to kill themselves is just the correct way of thinking. I feel like people are just awful all around, most jobs are terrible in almost every way, most things you can buy are pointless or unhealthy unless taken in moderation (drugs, junk food), i think humans are a plague on the earth, stabbing each other (also all future generations and the animals we exploit) constantly in nearly every decision we make. I feel like i dont belong in this world and i dont to. I feel ashamed that i havent ended it yet. I dont want to take meds even though i probably need them. I dont want to be numbed just enough to keep me from killing myself. I dont believe theyll make me happy, it seems all of the least happiest people i know take meds. I look at them and its so obvious theyre better off dead, a good number of them seem too often be a burden on everyone they know. I never want to be resigned to marching forward into hell. I feel a degree of freedom in not being medicated. If i feel good i know it isnt just because of meds.if i feel bad enough ill be able to end it (fingers crossed). I do think that some mental illness probably calls for medication but i feel like anyone, especially the mentally ill, should just get the suffering over with. I feel like a bad person but everyone around me seems so much worse. I feel like taking the happy pill and preocupying yourself with stupid things is not only unintentionally prolonging suffering but completely immoral. Even if everything goes great, whos to say you wont get crippled or widowed just after becoming too old to find someone new? Life seems like perpetual suffering and dissapointment. I never want to be someone everyone wonders about "why havent they killed themself yet?".
