I want to and Im okay with it.I think im going to take my life. I know when and how. And for some reason this brings me a lot of comfort. 

Im excited for the noise to stop. I dont believe in an afterlife much. But there is just something thats always drawn me towards ending my life. I just dont want to live. I have no other reasoning.

I have a family. A partner. A good apartment. Pets. Technology. And yet I still can never fucking be happy. And its just getting worse. Im tired of seeing sadness and forcing myself out of bed every fucking morning to be rediculed that im not working hard,enough. I work so hard for so very little. I work so hard to be happy and nothing works. Im done. And for the first time im happy.

Im so scared of what my family,will think and what my partner will think. But I know they will move on. I truly dont believe my existance has that much importance on anyone. And that literally anyone else in this world could replace me and nobody would bat an I. I was a mistake at birth. Im a mistake now. So why do it the rest of my life.
