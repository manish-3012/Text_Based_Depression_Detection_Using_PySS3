Sitting in my car...I could crash into a wall at high speeds or off a clliffside. It could be labeled an accident. My family would never know. I did originally think about driving into other cars, but I don't want to hurt others or take anyone with me, should I go. I just feel so numb. I told them I'm getting gas. It's been an hour and a half since. I have two kids...I don't want this feeling. I want to see them grow, but I'm in so much pain. They're all I'm living for, but I feel like I'm getting closer to just ending it. They would be with their dad, and he could be happier with someone else who's not fucked in the head like me. I don't know what to do. The last time I got checked into facility and it caused more problems regarding money. I'm supposed to talk to a therapist next week...been trying to hang in for the past month but fuck.
