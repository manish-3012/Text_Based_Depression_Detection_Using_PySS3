I honestly dont know what to doI'm 16. I feel empty. I have no more energy to pretend. I have no energy to live. I have no will. There's nothing to do anymore. I fuck everything up, I fucked up a great friendship with this girl that I loved so much named Addie. But I'm just so clingy. I don't wanna lose anyone else. She still hasn't left me and I feel like even more like a dick head. I feel like I'm putting pressure on her. I can't take it. I put to much pressure on myself. I feel like a nuisance and a burden to everybody. My heart literally hurts. Iâ€™ve lost 30-40 pounds in the past month. My body just seems like itâ€™s shutting down. Iâ€™m sick all the time. I hurt all the time. I overthink everything, and thatâ€™s what leads to me being clingy and fucking everything up. Life is miserable. I had a really bad panic where I couldnâ€™t breathe for like a minute. My mom tells me to try and make friends. I try. But no one cares. Everyone just kinda ignores me. Whatâ€™s the point in wasting what little energy I have to do something thatâ€™s useless. If they donâ€™t care then I wonâ€™t even try. Iâ€™m lonely. I want to go back to before this happened. I just want everything to stop. I canâ€™t stop overthinking. I keep putting more and more stress and anxiety on myself. I canâ€™t stop. Why. Why. No one would notice if just killed myself. I have what I need. Why canâ€™t I do it. Thereâ€™s no point in living when I may have lost the only person that made me feel alive. The only person I really loved. My mind is fragmented. My mind is scattered. I donâ€™t even know whoâ€™s me and whoâ€™s not? I donâ€™t know. I canâ€™t think. Itâ€™s all scattered.
