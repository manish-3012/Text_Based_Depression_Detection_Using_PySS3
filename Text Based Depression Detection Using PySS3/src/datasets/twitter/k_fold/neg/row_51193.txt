NumbI woke up this morning and felt like I couldnâ€™t   move. I lay there feeing completely numb like I wasnâ€™t even real. I feel like Iâ€™m in a world thatâ€™s moving around me time seems to have no meaning and life has no purpose. My optimism and motivation has always prevented me from killing myself but that seems to have gone. I feel numb and suffocated. I no longer understand a reason for life like everything and everyone is meaningless. Whatâ€™s the point like why. Does anyone else feel this this or is it just me idk?
