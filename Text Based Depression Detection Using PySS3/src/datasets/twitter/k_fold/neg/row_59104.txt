Fucking doneI just got a new car and then promptly crashed it into another one. Thousands of dollars lost not to mention the cost of the rental and my own shame. I can't handle shit like this anymore. I don't have the energy. I can't do it. 

Planning on hanging myself in my closet with a belt. That or in the garage before work on Monday, which I know I won't be able to handle.
