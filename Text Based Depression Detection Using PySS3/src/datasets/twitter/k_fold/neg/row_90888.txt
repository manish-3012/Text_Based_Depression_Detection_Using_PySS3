I'm degradingThe main reason I go home from college is just to remind me why I can't end it. It's not even just because I love them, I do love them, but the main reason I'm not dead is how hard it would be on my mom. I'm so tired of living. I feel like nobody loves me but I know she needs my help and I know it would be hard on her if I did die. I feel like a completely unattractive freak who's nothing more than a waste of space. I hate everything about my body and personality and interests. I feel like a completely useless bitch. I just wish I was never born. She wasn't even supposed to have kids. I ruined everything just by existing.
