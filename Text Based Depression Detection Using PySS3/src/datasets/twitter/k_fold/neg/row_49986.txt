My friends are planning a trip aboard for our whole group next summer but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to make it til then

I know Iâ€™ll be dead by then. They are all excited for it, and every time the mention it I try to change the subject or snap at them for going on about it. 

Iâ€™ve started arguments with a couple of them. Pushing them away is better in the long run for them. And Iâ€™ve hurt one of them emotionally, apparently I remind them of their abusive  brother.

They need to let go of me, Iâ€™ll only drag them down. 

I want so badly just to disappear. All I do is fuck up and hurt people I care about. They think that they care about me but they are just lying to themselves. They are just waiting until they can finally be free of the fucked up lowkey abusive and insensitive crazy ass bitch I am.
