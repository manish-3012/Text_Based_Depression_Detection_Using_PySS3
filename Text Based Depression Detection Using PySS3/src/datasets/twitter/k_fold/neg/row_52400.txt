I'm lostI haven't been able to sleep I am so stressed and depressed. My girlfriend of 6 year DOESNT want to be with me and I think she is seeing someone else. We have a 4 year old son together and it doesn't make a difference to her. I don't know what to do. I want to make things better but it seems less likely that things will go back the way things were. is there anyone I can talk to. Please I need someone right now. I stayed up all night looking up ways to end myself even though that wouldn't be what I want but I don't know what else I can do to take this feeling away. I love her so much that it hurts to the point where I don't even want to move. I writing this to see if anyone out there can talk to me. I'm so fucking pissed and stressed and depressed and hurt and so many tucking emotions that I feel like I would be better off not being here to feel this way. What the fuck can I do? How do I cope with this shit?
