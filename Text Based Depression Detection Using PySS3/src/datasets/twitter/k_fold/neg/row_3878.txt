Feels like I'm at the end.I've been struggling with severe depression for years now. I've reached the point where I can't take it anymore and things in my life are bad enough to where I'm considering ending it. I was supposed to be graduating college next week. I'm 27, I took a break from college to work. This was supposed to be the time I finally finished college, and started life on my own. Then COVID happened, my internship got cancelled and everything got pushed back. On top of that my two internships are all I have to complete now and since I can't take them at the same time, I'm losing my full time status which means losing my Financial Aid. All this work over the last couple years just to get shut down at the end because of something completely out of my control. There's other stuff too, the severe anxiety and panic attacks I've been dealing with for years,  one of my only close friends straight up turned her back on me and stopped talking to me. I didn't take care of myself growing up and now have major tooth issues (multiple broken teeth, messed up teeth etc.) I can't smile and If I ever want to date someone what girl wants a guy with messed up teeth? I also don't have health insurance because college student so it's not like I can go get it fixed. There's also a lot of deeper stuff that I'm not gonna go into here because i'm not here to write a novel. 

I have Asperger's Syndrome. Talking to people has always been an issue for me. I don't really have anything in terms of friends. I feel so alone. I love my family, I don't want to hurt them, but I don't know what to do anymore. Everything's just piled up and I feel trapped with no way out. Everyday right now feels like it's just a struggle to survive. I'm so tired of feeling this way every single day. I have no energy left and I'm done fighting.
