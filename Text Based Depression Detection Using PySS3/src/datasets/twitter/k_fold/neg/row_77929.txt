I'm on the edgeI'm so tired of having to always be on, I have to be funny, I have to be loud, I have to always be happy and act like nothing gets to me. 
Inside I'm dying and I just want it all to Stop, I hurt, I really fucking ache inside and I feel numb apart from this sadness and feeling like I'm nothing. I honestly think everyone in my life would be better off if I weren't here and  the only thing stopping me from ending it all is that I don't want anyone to find me because I've been there  finding a loved one dead and I don't wanna fuck anyone up more than I already have done. I hate myself and I know everyone else does too. I'm just so tired and I can't talk to anyone.
