Went through all my contacts, and there's no oneNo one I can say this to. Anyone I would turn to would never believe I was capable of this. My husband just told me I raped him while I was drunk. Sitting in my car alone thinking about all the ways I could kill myself, knowing I won't do any of them but feeling that's all I deserve. I thought I was a good person. I was wrong.
