Second attemptInstead of 14 pills, I took 25 this time. I don't know what can help me anymore. This is my second time in the hospital in a week and they want me to stay here until tomorrow. I really really wanna go home. I don't like being watched. My heart is breaking into pieces knowing that I did this because someone just made me snap. Just because someone said they don't love me anymore.
