I feel hopeless in a future in which I'll actually be happy with.(20m) Well my problems start the moment I was born I was diagnosed with Prilorics Stenosis and almost died and they had to put in a trachea or whatever and they misplaced it or something because I have the worlds most annoying voice I swear and it's even worse when I sing even if I hit the right note it sounds so bad everyone makes fun of me for it (especially when I was in Corous class despite the noticeable scar) then as I was growing up they kept calling me slow in school by the teachers because of my ability to spell was "lackluster". Despite my high reading and math skills I was put in slower classes till 8th grade and had an iep till 10th and tested at a college grade level in all my subjects on multiple aptitude tests before they released me from it. 
      From the time I was 4 I was big into martial arts especially Karate. I had earned my adult black belt at 12 and then switched my school to one where a very famous UFC fighter came from but I only went there because a friend wanted to go to classes with me there and after he left I found out about a new martial art called Ju-Jistu and I had restarted my belt progression there to learn as much as I could so after obtaining my 3rd yellow belt (3rd belt there) I joined this art and fell in love with it eventhough I was scrawny as hell. Well tradegy stuck because I was bullied by legitimate differently abled kid since 4th grade who the school would do nothing about and I couldnt hit or even say anything mean back because if well differently abled and this was the first time I ever tried killing myself I was 14. 
Then a few weeks later my younger brother jumped when i got out of the shower but naked and me defending myself cut my thumb so badly it won't move anymore and i cannot get a good grip for Jujistu nor make a fist fro karate anymore so i quit those for years because of the depression it caused me. I practice them now in Hope's my thumb may decide to work again so I can follow that dream but it's highly unlikely being I'm 20 and it still hasn't moved and surgery wont do any good.
       I was also always really really good in school and outside extra circulars for school but my Parents insisted I go to the local trade school for COSMETOLOGY because my mother is one and I am bi sexually so that must automatically mean I'm good at it. I HATED IT and the counselor in the school refused to let me switch because I was the only guy ik n the class and it would look bad on him and stuff even though other kids got to leave and enter shops a lot easier then the amount of time I put in to try and switch to literally anything else. I had a 3.9 gpa throughout 9-11th and was a member of the honor Scociety while the class president and vice president because I just ran for everything and would win most if not everything. I tried killing myself again in 10th grade because I was only getting 3hrs of sleep a night and became extremely overweight. 
I  then decided to join a thing called Junior Leadership. It's a very exclusive program that most kids have to be from very elite schools in the area to be apart of to join. I gave the best interview they ever seen and it was on the top and made my school go from the scum school to a school that seemed better then our highschool because of me and my influence this group caused. Then ending my 11th grade year I was announced President of the Honor Scoiety and my mother made me get a job and i got one as a dishwasher in one of the busiest restaurants in the area and was immediately working a 56 hour week under the table.
       When school started again an ex of mine told the teacher in charge of Honor society that I smoked weed and I shouldn't be in charge of it and held the reelection the same day and a day I wasnt even there and elected another pot head who I sold pot too on top of my 56 hours a week while in school i again only slept 3hours a night and maintained a 3.5gpa on top of this.
       During this time I was still a member of Honor Scociety and acted as the president because the actual president was never there and trained for the spot the 2 years previously. I was also a member of the art honor society and I became a student ambassador for my school to recruit more kids into trade schools and was a representative for not only my shop but another shop CIT as it was focused around programming a skill I picked up as a kid for penetration testing and was able to explain both perfectly. Well when reelections came around for class presidents and such they told me this year I can only run for president so I did and ran against 4 other kids. Well one of the kids friends was also made in charge of printing the ballots and counting them and made him an extra 300 ballots in his name when there was only 124 kids in my class and they never reprimanded or stripped the kid from his position which was a disappointment to me because when I saw the scores I saw I would have won again if it wasnt for that. 
Then March comes around I'm still trying my ass off in school trying to find a college on top of it and got rejected from every school I applied too and never heard back from my community college and this hurt because the only thing I was trained for wasto become a cosmetologistsomethingI despised with a passion. 
      Again I tried killing myself but this time I got close and was sent to a psycward hospital where I was placed with juvenile oldest was 15 despite being 18 and obviously much more mature for my age and they tried putting me with another gay kid who kept saying he was gonna try to sleep with me and kept trying to make advancements despite the fact he was 14 and I had a partner of my own all because he asked to be in the same room as me. I immediately requested a room change and requested it with a guy in there I knew was straight and by himself but they said I cannot request certain people and put me in a room with a differently abled kid who clogged the toilet that night before hand and they never fixed it so I had to sleep in a room that smelled like this kids literal shit. Thankfully it was my last night there and I had signed my 72 after they were trying to give me a new experimental medication for ADHD because I was a drug user and refused to give me my adderall because of it. that med felt like what happens when you mix 6mg of Xanax and a fifth of Jack. I got out and was wondering why my school never sent me my work for school. Well it turns out that during my stay I got a research paper and another teacher never gave them my work for it and was waiting on them to give me all my work at once when I came back it was the last day to turn it in and was responsible for it because I should have gotten the work. I failed 3 classes that semester and got a 1.9gpa for the quarter. 
      Then to help with my depression I took shrooms for the 3rd time with 3 of my friends who were also dealing with depression bad and they never did them before so I guided them. Well whe went on a nature walk while on them and found a big metal gate that weighed probably close to 400lbs I wanna say 350 but cant be sure. All 4 of us throw this gate down a cliff with my infront well the gate came down really fast and the bars hit me not once but twice in the back of the head and gave me what felt like an equilibrium shot. I almost died from almost falling down the cliff but sustained no injuries or side effects from the hit except I became completely sober 1 1/2 hours into my trip after the hit and realized how good of a fighter I would have became if I never got jumped by my little brother. 
      Then graduation is approaching and I'm getting even more depressed because I recently became a line cook and a dman good one at that. So good people would specifically request my cooking but I hated it with a passion too. And when they announced who was getting recognized for what I was only recognized for being a member of the honor society while kids who weren't even ambassadors or art honor Scociety members were given recognition for those so the night of the award ceremony I drank if fifth of vodka and cursed out my Counsoler and Principal in front of everyone exposing them for what they did. Most liberating moment of my life and are now in a lot of trouble for the lack of care they put into the school its infested with bed bugs and nobody in HRT is getting their CNA or what ever because they lied to these kids saying the teacher was qualified but they weren't.
     So now I'm graduated quit that awful job 6 months ago and have been bouncing in between jobs and after looking into every job I have found out no job is really suitable for me that I'll be proud of myself for having. I cannot apply for scholarships at this point because most of them require a military background which I cannot after being institutionalized or in school. I am moving to a state on the other side of the country because I still live with my parents because no job can support me to live on my own in the area without roommates and such but I cannot stand living with other people let alone strangers. My friends I have been avoiding because I'm finally out of my drug culture I was stuck in and they're all still in it and dont wanna be dragged back into it. And my partner is gonna be going to school here as they offered him a full scholarship for his major that hes always wanted to do. I'm at the point where I refuse to work another job I hate because I dont see the point in it if I'm just gonna be a miserable jerk instead of the "kind hearted sweet person" I am from friends and strangers alike. I dont know what to do and I'm at the point where I think it may be better for me to kill myself because my depression is taking a toll on my family and partner. But this doesnt even feel like depression like I still experience happiness and such unlike the past I just really dont see a future where I'll be happy career wise and if I'm not happy with my job it turns me into a complete asshole outside of the work environment. Theres a lot I left out but I can tell more in the comments. 

Tl;dr I am unoptomistic about the future as there's no job I enjoy nor would enjoy and be proud of myself at the same time and my career has always been the biggest part of my life and I wouldnt be able to stand myself if I worked something I hated, my hobbies and passions are unfeasible anymore because if fucked stuff that has happened to my body throughout my life and feel it would be better to end it all.
