Finally leaving r/SuicideWatchFor the longest time, I had been ridiculously unhappy with my life. I knew the moment I hit rock bottom was the day I woke up and just...didn't feel happy anymore. It was such a foreign feeling, like I had just lost the feeling of being alive 

I thought that feeling would never go away, or that I was exaggerating, because I had been through much worse before this. It just seemed like everything was going wrong at the same time, and life would never be joyous again. 

I had my entire plan written out and ready to go. My note underwent countless revisions and reworkings, because I didn't want anyone to think it was their fault. I even gave myself a deadline.

I said, if things didn't work out by my 18th birthday, I'm killing myself. 

I'm not 18 yet, still have a few months to go, but I can now say with certainty that those days are over for me. I don't know what happened. I didn't even realize it happened. I just woke up again one morning and thought, *I don't mind being alive*.

I used to frequent here a lot on another account, but over the months I've slowly just...stopped coming, yet never officially separated myself from this subreddit. 

But now, it's time. This is my official withdrawing from r/SuicideWatch. Not because I'm ending my life tonight, but because I'm starting it again.

I'm glad I no longer feel this way. I'm glad I no longer feel the need to come here anymore. I'm glad that I can feel happy again. 

I wish all the best to the rest of you here, hoping that the same thing may happen to you. I hope you have a nice rest of your day, wherever you are.
