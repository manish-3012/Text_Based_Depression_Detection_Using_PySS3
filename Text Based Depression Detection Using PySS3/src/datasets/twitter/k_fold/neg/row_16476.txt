Just pushed away my last friend, nothing is stopping me anymoreYet I just cant do it. I sit here and look at the pills I've amassed but I just can't. I want to so bad, but I just can't because I'm a coward. I wish I had the courage to just go through with it I want the pain to end I just want it to fucking end
