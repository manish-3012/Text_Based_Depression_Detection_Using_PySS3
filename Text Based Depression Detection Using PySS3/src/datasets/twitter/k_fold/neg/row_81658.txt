it hurts so badEveryday it gets worse and worse. I have this huge ache in my heart and I just want to scream and cry. I often just sleep the days away and I get yelled at for doing so, but itâ€™s the omly time I can leave it all. School is stressing me out so much, I literally canâ€™t. I have so much family shit going on. I have lost every person. They always leave me and it hurts. What do I do thats so wrong? I love every single person and I support nothing but peace and love. I thought I was a good person. My own dad doesnâ€™t love me. I donâ€™t know man Iâ€™m just in so, so much pain. I donâ€™t want to die, but I just genuinely canâ€™t do this anymore. I just canâ€™t. Somebody please help
me get my head on straight, I need something to pull me back in because all of my reasons for staying arenâ€™t working anymore and frankly, I just want to be better. :(
