Will never be self sufficientHi, thank you for reading. 

Iâ€™m in my mid-30s and really struggling. I had a rough early adulthood, filled with drug and alcohol abuse and suicide attempts. My only saving grace was deciding to go back to school in my late 20s, this gave me a lot of purpose. After completing undergrad and then grad school, becoming a masters-level scientist, I was recruited for a job only to be laid off during Covid. I hadnâ€™t even worked a year.

I coped by reminding myself that I hated the job, in fact I hated my whole career. It wasnâ€™t as exciting or gratifying as school had been. Instead I was overworked and miserable. But today I saw a job posting from my company seeking â€œgoodâ€ biochemists. This really stung.

As a woman in my mid-30â€™s with no partner for 4 years, itâ€™s beginning to occur to me I may never have a child or a family. This breaks my heart. 

I have no money and I come from a family with no money. I have no job and I have no desire to continue to gut myself for this unsatisfying career, which was very very underpaid anyway. I have no partner and I canâ€™t expect any family in my future. I will never be a happy or self-sufficient adult, I just wonâ€™t. I canâ€™t see any reason why I should keep struggling when everything is indeed a struggle.

Today I want to call it quits. I do not want to wake up tomorrow only to struggle through another day of unsatisfying existence. There is no proof that anything will ever be better.
