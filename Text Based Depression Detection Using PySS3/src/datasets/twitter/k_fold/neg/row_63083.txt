The only thing I can make myself care about is how to minimize the pain to the people I loveRight now, rationally, I know I have everything to live for. Theres nothing wrong with my life. I could pull myself together and achieve things, make my family proud of me.

Then I look at myself again and I can't see a future for myself or with any of my relationships. People are too good for me, I'm pathetic and don't deserve the life that I have. I know my life is fucking great but I just don't want to pursue it. I don't understand how this happened or what made me slip into this, but I know that if it keeps up I'm just going to let my life slide until its basically as good as gone.

As of right now, I'm making it work. I force myself to wake up in the morning, put on makeup and a decent outfit, force myself to sit down with my readings. If I don't, I'll stop altogether. I'll stop getting out of bed. I'll stop reaching for my laptop. Everything would just stop.

I only talk to a few people and I'm not particularly close to them, I'm ashamed to confide in them because my problems are all immature and pathetic. If anything I want to finish this before Valentines day so I don't give my boyfriend any illusions about me being alive in the long run. Heaven knows I despise myself enough for being okay with this.
