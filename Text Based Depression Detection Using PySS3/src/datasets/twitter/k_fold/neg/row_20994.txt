I just want it all to endI've tried running away from my problems, because if I try to solve them, I'll only make things worse, but it never helps. Every time something remotely positive happens, something way worse overshadows it, to the point that the good things don't even matter anymore. I'm only a burden to everyone I know. I'm a fucking coward. Parents try to help, but they never seem to anything but make feel worse. Everything I do ends up in failure, so I've given uo trying. I just my life to end already.
