Itâ€™s gonna happen soon. I know it.I told my parents I was suicidal almost 2 weeks ago. You know what they did? Nothing. The only people keeping me alive have made it clear they donâ€™t give a shit. Not a single person to confide in. And if I reference how I feel, Iâ€™m either completely ignored, or get snitched on to the counselor. My mental state is crumbling and grim. Itâ€™s just a downward spiral. Iâ€™m destined for this. I know it. See you bastards on the other side.
