I don't think I can go on.Im a 16 year old guy and I know some of you may be thinking that Im just probably going through mood swings or whatever but this has been going on for a long time. My parents have been divorced for a long time and it definitely has had a hard effect on me considering that the relationship between them now is quite hostile.
The reason Ive been feeling this way is because of some recent events. My mums abusive partner (not my dad) has finally left after 9 years,  however it isn't what I thought it will be like. Rather than me, my sis and mum being more united, we are arguing and fighting more than ever. The financial situation hasn't been the best either woth my mum running a business in which I have to work every weekend. I do enjoy helping out but more and more Om lacking energy, falling asleep in school etc. and I don't know how long I can keep up. 
The endless arguments with my mum sometimes cause her to be violent and every time we do argue I feel like shit later and feel absolutely worthless. I put up a fake attitude in school so that everyone thinks its perfect at home and that Im mean to people because I choose to be rather than me choosing to lash out because I can't hold it in anymore. Suicide has been something I've been really thinking about recently because it seems that everyone would be better off that way. The reason Ive posted here is because I don't think that I can actually talk to anyone about this. None of my friends would believe it and I don't want to talk to my family about it because they would all think I'm like my dad (who attempted suicide due to gambling when I was 1) . This may simply be the easiest way to talk about it
