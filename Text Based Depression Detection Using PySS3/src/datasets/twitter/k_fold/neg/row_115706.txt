Iâ€™m stuck.To preface: Iâ€™m 16 years old and grew up in an extremely religious household.

Iâ€™ve been thinking of killing myself for years at this point. I canâ€™t really cite a reason why other than I feel worthless all the time and just donâ€™t have any purpose.

Iâ€™ve taken pain meds, iâ€™ve cut myself and iâ€™ve beat myself up so hard that I bleed, and yet I canâ€™t tell a soul I know or Iâ€™ll be ruined.

Iâ€™ve got straight Aâ€™s in school. My parents only praise my siblings, who get C and Bs. I have hardly any friends and the only friend I can talk to about my feelings lives over in the UK.

I am worried to ask for help as I know that if I do Iâ€™ll be sent to a religious hospital to be â€œfixedâ€. I donâ€™t want that to happen, I just wanna stay where I am. I canâ€™t get any medications as Iâ€™m not 18 and if I got them now everyone would know.

I donâ€™t want to be treated differently or â€œbetterâ€ than I am right now. I just want to be happy. My school has a suicide reporting program and the only person I know who was affected by it only did it for the attention, and what they put him through was awful.

When I moved away from my childhood home, I left my happiest memories there, and now Iâ€™ve got nothing to show for it. Iâ€™ve been slowly descending into the darkness. Itâ€™s gotten worse and worse over the years that I canâ€™t really control it anymore.

I say Iâ€™m fine, that Iâ€™m just tired, but thatâ€™s just a safeguard to keep myself from worry. I donâ€™t know what to do. Since around 3/14 of this year, every day Iâ€™ve just been thinking that I needed to die.

I was thinking of just going up into a desolate mountainous area and either shooting myself in the head or just hanging from a tree.

I found this subreddit and am just hoping that someone may have some idea on what to do.
