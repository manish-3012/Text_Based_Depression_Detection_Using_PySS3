I'm sad and don't wanna write my reasons..im really not ok and way too exhausted right now to type and ask for advice or anything. i wish i had killed myself the first time i tried to. i wish i wasnt here to have gone through all that i have since then. nothings gotten better, things have gotten worse. my lifes basically over, idk what im even gonna do. i wish i didnt promise to give myself more time to work on my life and myself. every time i did that, nothing got better. i will never regret not killing myself. its honestly so easy to do, i wish i had done it. i think thats how im gonna die, ive dreamt of it hundreds of times. im ready to not exist
