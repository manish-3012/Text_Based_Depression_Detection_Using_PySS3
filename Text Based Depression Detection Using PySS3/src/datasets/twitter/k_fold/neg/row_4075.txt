What is the best way to kill yourself so you dont feel pain?I've been thinking about this for a long time time and was wondering what is the best way to die where you dont feel pain. Im scared and freaked about hanging myself or throwing myself off a bridge. Surely there is just some drug or number of drugs I can take where i wont wake up (and just fall asleep after i take them). I want to do it peace with no drama or so no one can stop me. Maybe i could drink a lot before doing it to build up the courage to take some pills. Im looking forward to having this wholw thing planned out so it can all finally be over.
