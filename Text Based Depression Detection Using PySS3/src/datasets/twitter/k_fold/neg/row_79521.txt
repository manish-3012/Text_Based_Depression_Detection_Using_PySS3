how can i keep wanting to live if this is my life?I wish I could blame the world, but it was my fault that I missed every opportunity life ever gave me. if two years ago I had not been a lazy coward and abandoned my dance group I could be dedicating myself and studying about the only thing I ever loved, instead of studying any shit that does not interest me now and will never interest me. it's my fault and even though I can say that the depression paralyzed me back then, it doesn't change anything, I still missed my opportunity and time won't come back.

now i'm here, stuck at home studying in the middle of a pandemic while all my friends went back to dancing in the dance group we were part of, but i'm the only one who can't come back because i don't have the money to pay for college and dance classes, and I can't just drop out of college. dance is the only thing that kept me alive and happy, willing to keep trying even in the worst moments. without dance my life is empty and I would rather just die. 

this may seem like first world problems because a lot of people are losing their jobs in the pandemic and dying of illness, but what can i do if i can't stand this life? i hate that i have to live like others want me to live, i hate to know that soon i won't have more time to even think about dancing when the internships start, i want my life to end because i can't stand it. soon, not even the possibility of ever dancing again will be able to save me. I'm more and more drowned in a sadness that will never go away, and when the day comes and all hope ends, on that day, I will be ready to die. I'm almost there.
