I lost my futureMy boyfriend of about 2 years ended our relationship on sunday. i met him when i was 10 and he was 11, and for 8 years i was always drawn to him but he picked other girls before noticing me, but when we fell in love it was the best thing in the world. 
We were secure and planning a future together, legitimately planning to get married and having a family and honestly until him. i never saw a future for myself and i never planned for it. Itâ€™s over and iâ€™m so lost. i didnâ€™t plan to live this long and iâ€™ve never been so hurt in my entire life. for a long time i was at my lowest and he became my lifeline, he isnâ€™t for me now but itâ€™s eating me away and iâ€™m scared it my swallow me whole. I waited 8 years to be the happiest iâ€™ve ever been, with my best friend and itâ€™s over in just about 2 years. 
Him and his cousin are leaving for the marines and iâ€™m scared that theyâ€™re just abandoning me.
