Am I pathetic? Well, yes.I've been depressed for about 5 years now. In the beginning, I would tell someone, and they would say, "Oh, it's fine. You'll be happy tomorrow. It's just a phase."

I've had 4 therapists, all of whom left, so I don't trust my current one. I can't talk to my friends, they just freak out about it. I can't talk to my family, they can't help me, no matter how much they love me.

I have no one.

My friends are all exploring themselves, becoming new people.

Not me.

I'm sad, tired, hungry, stressed, and I can't stop it.

Because once you tell yourself, "It'll be okay, just another day" for 5 years, 5 full years of self doubt and isolation, you stop believing it.

Someone please explain why life is worth living.

Someone tell me why I should keep getting out of bed in the mornings.

Because I'm starting to lose my sanity.

And I don't know what to do.
