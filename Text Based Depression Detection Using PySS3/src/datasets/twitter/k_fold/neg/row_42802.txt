I don't know if I can make it.I'm having a really bad run of things this past year, and I'm scared it's going to kill me before I escape it. I feel especially shit today, and I'm a little worried about making it to tomorrow. Suicide has always felt like an inevitability, not a way out for me and this scares the hell out of me. I don't want to die, but I can't shake the feeling that all this ends with me dead having never made it out.

I could do it right now if I decided too, I've got a bottles of pills that would do me in quite nicely. I just don't know what else I can do to fix this. I'm going to therapy twice a week, I'm seeing friends in person regularly, I'm trying to stay out of bed, I'm reaching out to people, everything. Any advice? Or if you just feel like cheering a girl up? &lt;3
