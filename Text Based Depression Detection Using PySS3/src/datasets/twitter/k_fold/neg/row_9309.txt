Embraced Iâ€™m going to eventually kill myself one dayWether itâ€™s tomorrow, or in 20 years. I know eventually 10000000% itâ€™s gonna happen. I honestly would rather kill myself at 55 with baby/small grandkids than be 90 in the hospital barely grasping onto life because Iâ€™m that old, fuck that. Itâ€™s going to inevitably happen regardless. Iâ€™ve had this same mentality since I was like 10. I know Iâ€™m capable of doing it Iâ€™ve tested the waters a few times, and I can say I have the balls to fully do it one day. Like I already know the cause of my death is going to by suicide no matter what, unless of course I die in a car crash, or I get killed or something along those lines. Other than that I for sure know my cause of death will be by suicide and Iâ€™ve honestly known that to be a fact since I was about 10. I know for sure I will be dead by the time Iâ€™m 60 without any doubt in my mind. Itâ€™s not a matter of if for me itâ€™s a matter of when.
