Struggling to find the will to keep going.The girl I have been dating for the past 6 months, who has been my best friend for the past year, told me she needed a break from me at least until I move to her state (about a month) because the distance is hard on her and all the stress I bring to her because of my various mental illnesses and insecurities. All my friends that have talked to her believe very strongly that we will get back together in a while from what she has told them, but I am having a really hard time. One thing I suffer from really bad is insomnia, and she works nights so she was always there after work to hang out with me and help me try to sleep (she would sing me to sleep sometimes)
But since we havent been talking this last week and a half, I have realized that although I have other friends, barely any of them ever respond to my messages, and its made me realize how really alone I am without her friendship, and while im certain things will work out my depression and loneliness are making it really hard not to off myself, which is something I have been fighting for years. I really miss my best friend and I feel really alone and I dont know how I am going to be able to keep going like this.
