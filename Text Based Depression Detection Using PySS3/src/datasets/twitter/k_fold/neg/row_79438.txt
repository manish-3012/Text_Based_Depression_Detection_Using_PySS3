I'm super stressed outI'm so stressed that I can't do anything, I can't even sleep. My depression is killing me because I can't do anything. Laying in bed doing nothing makes me feel the worst of all. I'm a total loser. I don't want to do this anymore, I can't lay in bed another night for hours before I fall asleep and be stuck with suicidal thoughts. I don't want to be here anymore. Ugh.
