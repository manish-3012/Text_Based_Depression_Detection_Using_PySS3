Iâ€™m doneItâ€™s my 19th birthday tomorrow and am just more surprised that Iâ€™m still here Iâ€™m not excited for anything anymore but I know that everyone will be wanting me to pretend like I am like they always do I mean the only difference from today and tomorrow will be I can legally drink till I canâ€™t fuckin see . Idk i just find that when ever I look at people older than me anymore I just canâ€™t understand why they are still here everyone seems so pathetic and Iâ€™m only worse itâ€™s such fucking bullshit. I just want to pull the trigger and do it already and I just look at the pills that I have to take every day so that I can change my brain chemistry until I feel some false happiness and I wonder if I took all of them would I even die or would I just end up disabled which would only be even more pathetic of a scenario Iâ€™ve been to weak to do it so far and I canâ€™t even find a proper way to do it Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to go jump off a bridge and I donâ€™t even know where I could hang myself. I just donâ€™t want to do this anymore I wish it would just end I donâ€™t want to get any older one more step to the stupid fucking nothingness
