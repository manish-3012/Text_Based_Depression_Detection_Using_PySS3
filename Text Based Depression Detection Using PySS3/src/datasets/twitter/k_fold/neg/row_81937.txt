I think I might do it tonight.I canâ€™t do this anymore man. The last few nights have just been pure pain for me. I just want to be happy like everyone else. All I do is cry and be sad and sit at home. Going on walks outside used to help me a lot, but it doesnâ€™t anymore. Iâ€™m in a constant state of depression because everyone who says that they love me never show it (especially my mom) and make me feel like I suck. They never want me around and I just canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve put up with this for too long. I just want to kill myself and I might do it tonight if I can build up the courage. Thereâ€™s nothing to live for anymore in this world. I fucking hate it here and I canâ€™t take it. Iâ€™m an introvert but I still need people and I hardly get to see people that I like. I try to no avail with multiple people. People will reply and say itâ€™s not worth it but why isnâ€™t it worth it? Iâ€™m on heavy medication right now which I feel so bad for because itâ€™s something not everyone who struggles can have. I feel selfish because itâ€™s not doing anything for me despite being 75 milligrams. Iâ€™m so on the verge and honestly donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be alive tomorrow. The things that I live for are pathetic, like video games and movies I wanna see. But even that has failed to subside the pain recently. I just wish I was born as someone that people genuinely liked. It feels like everyone is just so ahead of me and has moved on from me and Iâ€™m just stuck in the back. I hope my life had some sort of meaning for someone that I helped at some point in my life. Iâ€™ll probably chicken out but who knows maybe I can get the job done.
