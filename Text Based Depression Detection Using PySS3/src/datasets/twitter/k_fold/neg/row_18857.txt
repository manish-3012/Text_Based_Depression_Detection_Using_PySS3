I thought getting hit by a car would've made me grateful to be aliveSo I was literally just got hit maybe 10 minutes ago. I'm a bike deliverer and a lady didn't put her turn signal on and kept weaving in and out trying to find parking on a busy street. I was going probably almost 20mph and slammed into the corner of her bumber and went flying. Helmet was on. My hip hurts like a bitch were I landed though.

Lesson of the story? Why wear a helmet anymore. Made me feel like an idiot. I was so close. So fucking close.
