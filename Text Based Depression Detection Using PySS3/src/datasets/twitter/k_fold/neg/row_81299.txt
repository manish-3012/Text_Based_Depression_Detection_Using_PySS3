Tired of this shitI feel like this is the only place where there's some chance to be understood. You see, daily life can pretty much become a struggle when you suffer from Maladaptive Daydreaming and Depression. At the age of fuckin' 16. I feel like I've forgotten what it feels like to be normal, to live a fulfilling life without the sense of immense guilt for your repeating actions. I want this to end, but at the end of the day I'm scared of death just like any other human being. Every other day brings the same.Same walls. same thoughts, same daydreams, same guilt. All the same for already 3 years. Even my parents have started to talk about in past tense, as if I don't exist. This hurts, hurts badly. 

What should I do?
