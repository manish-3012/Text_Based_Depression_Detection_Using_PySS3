I fucked everything up and I deserve to die.I was fired from my long-term career-track job at 25 for violating the noncompetition clause in my contract. I was trying to do freelance work to make some money on the side instead of actual full-time work, but the company did the same thing my company did, and I was already on the ropes. I was let go. I have so much debt and so few options. I can't go back into the industry for two years as per my contract. How could I have been **so fucking stupid**? How could I have failed myself so badly? I hated the job, but I needed it. My mother is unemployed and we're in danger of losing our house.

I can't eat. I can't sleep. My guts are knotted up. I failed so badly. I failed **so badly**. We're all going to die anyway; why not hurry it up? I got too drunk the night of my firing -- coworkers showed up to celebrate my departure and fed me drinks on an empty stomach -- and pissed off my wonderful, supportive boyfriend by ignoring him in favor of coworkers and ditching him later to go drink more. I barely remember it. He won't talk to me. I'm terrified I'm about to get dumped, but worse than that is the knowledge that I hurt someone I love like that. Living in the face of my failings seems impossible. I'm a worthless piece of trash.

I'm not sure if I'm going to do it yet, but there's a nice high bridge close to my house. My mom wouldn't have to deal with finding my body. If she weren't alive, I would do it in a heartbeat.
