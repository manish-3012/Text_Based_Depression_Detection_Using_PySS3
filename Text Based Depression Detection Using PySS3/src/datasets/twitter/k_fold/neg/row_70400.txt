I hate my life.I try so hard to improve, but I just slide down into shit.

I'm a 27 year old loser, I can't do anything right.

I just want to be someone else, but I can't change like I want to.

I can't hurt myself, I don't want to hurt my family but sometimes i just can't stop thinking about suicide.

I don't know how to be happy and I'm so fucking tired of trying.
