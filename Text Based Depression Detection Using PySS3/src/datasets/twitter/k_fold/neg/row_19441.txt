Mom probably hates me, Dad lives in a different town, grades are shit and I've got zero motivation.I felt so bad on Thursday that I robo-tripped(I've never been high before ever, especially not on cough syrup), went to Confirmation practice( practice for a Catholic sacrament of becoming an adult in the church) quite high, when I got my mind back I realised I lived out an actual nightmare life is not going to get better.
