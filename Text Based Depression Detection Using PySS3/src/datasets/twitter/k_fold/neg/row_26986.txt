I donâ€™t know where to turn to, but I self harmed myself for the first time yesterdayI get anxiety, itâ€™s normal for me. A day where I get two panic attacks is a good day for me. I usually get 3 or 4, but one day I got five. 

So I started having my regular panic attack, but I started scratching my arm, scratching hard, digging into my arm. I didnâ€™t notice until I felt the wave of pain that went through my body. I didnâ€™t stop. I just kept digging till I snapped out of whatever was prompting me to do it. I then got my arm wrapped so I could make an effort to stop. 

Now, my arm hurts like hell and when I get the feeling that I need to scratch my arm, my fingernails arenâ€™t going to cut it. Sharper objects now have an attraction. Please help
