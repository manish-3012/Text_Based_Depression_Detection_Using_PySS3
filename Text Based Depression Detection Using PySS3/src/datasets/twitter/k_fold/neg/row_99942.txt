Iâ€™m alone and scared and itâ€™s all my fault, I donâ€™t know what to do?Iâ€™ve never posted anything like this so Iâ€™ve made a throwaway account but I really donâ€™t know what to do Iâ€™ve got no one else to talk to Iâ€™m hoping I can get some help here.

Iâ€™ve always struggled with pushing people away who I care about and who I think I know deep down care about me, but I just canâ€™t ever seem to believe it.
Iâ€™ve had friends in the past of my own throughout school but Iâ€™ve struggled with my own mental health and ended up subconsciously pushing everyone away, my friends Iâ€™ve had for years Iâ€™ve ended up drifting away to find something else. I canâ€™t really describe the feeling of what Iâ€™m looking for when I do, I just suddenly get the feeling that I donâ€™t fit in, that if I move on Iâ€™ll eventually find the place Iâ€™m happy and I belong, then I end up being miserable over losing the true friends I should have stuck with, isolating myself, so Iâ€™ve always felt alone.

4 years ago I got into a relationship which helped me massively, it got off to a rough start but about a year in I felt a huge improvement in my mental health - Iâ€™d stopped self harming, and I felt like I always had someone to talk to because when I needed him he was there. Things have just been getting better and better and Iâ€™ve been fitting in really well with his new friends and been enjoying spending time with them, I thought I was genuinely happy - or so I thought.

For the past couple of months I started getting that â€˜feelingâ€™ again, like I was restless and kept thinking about what Iâ€™m going to do with my life, Iâ€™m in a transitional period about to start uni and my head has been all over the place. Iâ€™ve been pushing my boyfriend away by being jealous, heâ€™s always been friendly with other girls and deep down I know I can trust him but the voice in the back of my head makes me feel too insecure and we always ended up arguing and I feel terrible about it. Iâ€™ve been acting horrible these past two weeks and selfish because Iâ€™ve been so unhappy for no reason whatsoever and ended up suggesting to my boyfriend I wanted a break and I donâ€™t know why, I think I just wanted to see if I could be happy single, but Iâ€™ve really fucked up.

I almost instantly regretted my decision, he got mad at me and now wants his own space as I know Iâ€™m a massive headfuck and Iâ€™m hurting him and I feel so much guilt over what Iâ€™ve done Iâ€™ve apologised and say Iâ€™ve made a mistake but he doesnâ€™t want to be with me anymore, he says itâ€™s for the best and I just want him to be happy so Iâ€™ve been trying to move on the best I can but the thing is I feel so alone.

I donâ€™t have any other friends but the ones that we share and whenever Iâ€™m feeling low and worthless I could always talk to him, not even about how Iâ€™m feeling just any general conversation with him or anyone lifts my mood, I hate feeling alone. Heâ€™s been staying with the girl who Iâ€™ve been jealous of during the relationship, getting closer to her and has admitted to me that he likes her, which hurts but I want him to be happy. Heâ€™s been ignoring my messages and Iâ€™ve been trying not to bother him but I honestly have no one else in the world that I can just talk to, Ive isolated myself from everyone.

Tonight Iâ€™ve freaked out. Iâ€™ve seen on his snapchat heâ€™s went out drinking with a bunch of our mutual friends and while Iâ€™m happy heâ€™s having a good time I got hit with all this paranoia. No plans to meet up were put in the group chat we still share, neither has any been for the weekend and Iâ€™ve been alone and overthinking which is not good for me. Iâ€™ve been paranoid that him and my friends are planning to cut me off, that theyâ€™ve seen how horrible I was being and theyâ€™ve decided they donâ€™t want me around anymore. I tried to message him just for a chat because I was panicking but heâ€™s ignored my messages, I know I sound crazy right now and worrying over nothing but my biggest fear is being alone.

If I lose these people I have no one, I donâ€™t speak to anyone in my family and I have no other friends outside that I can openly speak to about my mental health without feeling guilty for burdening them. All night Iâ€™ve been panicking about everyone turning against me, plus the fact that Iâ€™ve pushed away and lost my boyfriend that I do really love so Iâ€™m feeling horrible guilt, and I canâ€™t get over the fact that right now when Iâ€™m feeling at my lowest there is no one out there who I can turn to. It was always him I could count on now I feel like I need to give him his space and Iâ€™ve got no way to stop feeling so alone. 

I honestly donâ€™t want to be here anymore, Iâ€™ve got nothing to turn to whatsoever, nothing to distract me or to make me happy at all, I canâ€™t even sleep thereâ€™s so much going on in my head and in all honesty Iâ€™m so worried Iâ€™m going to do something to hurt myself or worse. I feel completely empty like thereâ€™s no one in the world who cares for me and the worst thing about all of this is that itâ€™s completely my fault!!!! Iâ€™ve pushed everyone away because of my fucked up brain and now Iâ€™m left with no one like I deserve and I canâ€™t cope with it, I donâ€™t see any reason to go on, I need someone.

I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m typing this out Iâ€™m guessing itâ€™s too long for anyone to read and itâ€™s a pointless boring story anyway and itâ€™s stupid because Iâ€™ve done it all to myself but I feel like I need to say how I feel on paper because Iâ€™ve got no one else to tell my feelings to.

I dunno if itâ€™s worth mentioning but Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ve fucked up by not taking my medication for my mental health issues for the past month or so, I was sick of taking something that controlled me and I wanted to see the real me and I honestly thought Iâ€™d been happier without them now Iâ€™m not sure if I can trust my own mind, does that make sense? 

Iâ€™m scared, Iâ€™m alone and Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™m going to do something bad, is there anyone out there who can help me??
