It's 4am. Just went out to the place where I decided to hang myself, but pussied out and came back home.On my way back home I kept thinking of how fucked up my life will be and regretting not doing it, but still did not dare to go back to that place again. Fucking pathetic. I expected my parents would have found out I was gone and be worried. But when I was home, the lights were off and nobody noticed any thing wrong. Later, when one of them wake up for bathroom and check my condition, they'll just think I stay up at another night.

Thinking of these makes me want to scream and cry so hard right now. Why should both life and death be so difficult to pursue?
