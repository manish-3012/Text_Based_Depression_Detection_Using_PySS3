Nothing can give me hope anymoreThere is literally nothing that can help me feel better. The only thing keeping me alive is guilt and responsibilities so I can pretty much say there is NOTHING redeemable about life. The most honest people who say that "I've been there but I'm better now" always make a note to say they still struggle and want to die now and then and as far as I can tell, what they really mean is "It gets slightly better but not enough for me to say I have a happy life", and people who say "I've been there and now I'm completely cured I love to live" seem to have wiped from their minds how it really feels like and give ridiculous advice like "mmm drink a lot of water and do yoga to cure your depression :)))))" or even worse, a condescending "if you would just stop feeling sorry for yourself and work hard things will get better!" bc thats totally how depression and anxiety fucking work.

Idk what is supposed to be the point of this post, I just feel like shit and have been feeling as such for 5+ years (I'm 19 now). Life will definitely get worse and more difficult. I'm nowhere near the bottom. If best case scenario is that I will feel even worse when I do reach bottom (kinda inevitable) to then in 20 years be able to tell I'm "a bit better" and never be actually fucking happy then really???? People can't possibly make a point on why I shouldn't kill myself. I've never heard anything that managed to make me feel like "yeah I can probably get through this".

There was no real point to this annoying post. I'm just pissed and hurt.
