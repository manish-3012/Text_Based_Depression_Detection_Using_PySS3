Everyday the sameEveryday i wake up by my sister annoying me, i go into the kitchen and drink a glass of juice 
I send some stupid meme to a friend
I go on my computer
My dad probably calls me to clean something and flips out if i dont come instantly usually insulting me
I go back on my computer 
4 hours later
I barely eat dinner while trying to hide the scars
I go on my computer again until 8 am 

Or 
I wake up 
I go to the kitchen and drink a glass of juice 
I talk to my "friends" about how much i want to kill myself.
I go on my computer 
My dad probably calls me to clean the kitchen or something and when i dont come instantly he takes my computer
I make card towers
4 hours later
dont eat dinner
I get some sneak time on my phone and i ask my "friend" if i should cut myself, he says yes even if he said no i would have anyways

At 2 am i go to the kitchen to cut myself 
I stay awake in bed for 3 hours and then go to sleep
