A Symbolic Thank YouIt seems this war is one I can never win. The best I can hope for is a short respite between battles. I have my small cadre of warriors commanded by Lady Hope and Lord Optimism but they are severely wounded.  
  
The battle is joined. The forces arrayed against me are overwhelming. 
I watch helplessly as my warriors are overwhelmed by the seething hordes of gloom, misery and despair. I am exhausted and have no reserves left. All is lost. All is in ruins.  
  
As I lay broken and spent against the shattered remains of a dream I desperately sound the Horn of Help. As I feared, a troll has arrived. I resign myself to my fate and hang my head in defeat.  
  
"Not so fast! You're not done yet!" cries a newly arrived warrior from the Support Clan. He confronts the troll and deftly deflects the vile creature's attack. More warriors arrive and relentlessly descend upon the enemy they know all too well.  
  
A deafening boom thunders across the battlefield as a wizard from the Moderater Clan materializes and with a wave of her staff a blinding blue lightning bolt vaporizes the troll. 

I smile, a small barely imperceptible smile.  Depression will not take me today.


TL;DR Thanks for being here.
