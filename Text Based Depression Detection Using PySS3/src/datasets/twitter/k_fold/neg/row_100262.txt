Suicidal RamblingI think Iâ€™ve always known I was going to kill myself some day. I mean, barring a car wreck, heart attack, or getting eaten by a bear...something unexpected along those lines. Which I guess is horrible, but really not any more horrible than the fact weâ€™re all going to die some day anyway. Even if my life was amazing, if it *somehow* became this incredible experience, I would still probably kill myself when I inevitably get cancer or some other terminal bug. Itâ€™s just...better to face death on your own terms than to feel yourself die by degrees in a hospital bed (that would likely drive me or the people close to me into poverty to afford anyway). So I guess believing in the right to die makes me more susceptible to suicide anyway, but I stand by it being the moral stance for such things. 
I think I was in early grade school when the idea to kill myself formed into my head. It was an â€œevery now and thenâ€ ideation that popped in my head when I was depressed or down. It became more serious in highschool, when on a number of occasions I outright planned to jump from a window or off a building. And as strong a pull as it had, I wasnâ€™t in any real danger at the time because I know for that type of method I donâ€™t have it in me to overcome that annoying survival instinct. Which is just another failure, as far as Iâ€™m concerned.
I donâ€™t like myself. By every measure that I hold myself to, I am a complete failure. My depression and anxiety are crippling, and medication has yet to help. In fact, at one point it pushed me closer to killing myself than anything else in my life (up to the point in time, this was 8 or 9 years ago). I am seemingly incapable of finishing any project I set my mind to. My anxiety and avoidance damages my ability to responsibly manage my money or my time. Or my life in general. I feel broken and worthless most of the time. Iâ€™m a burden to my friends, and itâ€™s only a matter of time before I either push them away or let them down enough that they cut me from their lives as a toxic influence. 
Iâ€™m a collection of worthless hobbies. Brief obsessions I swing between. I try, but I always hit a wall in the middle of mediocrity in all things and stop improving, regardless of the work I put into them. Though the amount of work is unpredictable since my brain just shuts me down hard at seemingly random intervals. Writing, juggling, video editing, improv, my lets play channel with itâ€™s whopping 30+ subscribers...the result of my work is a reflection of who I am, and thatâ€™s the reflection of a failure. Never good enough. 
If nothing else I need to die to escape the depression. Iâ€™ve been fighting this for over a decade. Rationally, my quality of life is better than it has ever been before, but my episodes are getting more frequent and more severe. I attempted back in 2012. Then I essentially attempted twice in 2017. And countless, *countless* times obsessed over it, running over and over through my head that I need to be dead. Iâ€™ve gone to psychiatrists, therapists. Multiple times and multiple doctors now. Nothing works. Itâ€™s just a never ending cycle. Even when Iâ€™m on the â€œtopâ€ end of it now, I am a mess, just waiting for it to swing around again. Which it always does. Faster each time. Sometimes I barely get enough time to catch my breath before Iâ€™m brought back down again. 
All I am is a sack of broken glass and poison. I need to be buried and forgotten.
