My date with the Suicide Forest.I've actually gone past the area when I was in Japan but I never actually ventured in.

This year there are two movies, The Forest and Sea of Trees. Dormer in the first, McConaughey in the second. 

This has really spoken to me and I can see myself doing this. It's not endorsed by any means of course, but apparently if you veer off the beaten path, it is *understood* and you are more or less left alone. You stay in there and figure things out and if you still want to die there, it's your prerogative.

There's a dignity in the sense that you take your backpack and you hike in there. You climb over the regular path into the forest. You are then in your own hands. The forest rangers regularly go through the forest and if they come upon you, your privacy is respected. 


They know why you're there but they won't drag you out. I see myself in there. I need to face my demons and I think that's the perfect place to find them.
