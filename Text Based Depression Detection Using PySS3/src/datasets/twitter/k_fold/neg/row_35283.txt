Couldn't do it last night, might as well try againLast night I psyched myself up to walk over to the bridge and jump off. I wrote a note on the back of an old Valentine's Day card that simply said "couldn't take it anymore". Got drunk and didn't make it to the bridge. Punched a hole in the wall so I can't have anyone over my place anymore. The note's on my living room floor. Tonight I was invited to a birthday party and the bridge is on the way. I think after I leave I'm going to walk over and do it. I realized that the people who would care all have support systems to help them through their grief so the guilt is gone. I just have to deal with whatever fear I have left and it's over.
