I need to dieIâ€™m so fucking tired of living. I canâ€™t seem to do anything right and Iâ€™m such a shitty person. I wish I didnâ€™t have to live in complete anguish all the time. Iâ€™ve been trying to hang myself with a belt for the last 20 minutes. I donâ€™t want my mom to be sad if I die but I know she will be. I really, really need to die.
