I wish there was a rehab center for suicidal thoughts.There seems to be lots of options for drug addition, alcohol, but not a refuge for those trying to escape self hate. I wish there was a place we go to learn how manage feelings of depression and self loathing  in a wholistic, removed environment... An intermediate place before hospitalization or suicide attempt for folks like me who are too ashamed and too stubborn to seek more traditional avenues of self help...
