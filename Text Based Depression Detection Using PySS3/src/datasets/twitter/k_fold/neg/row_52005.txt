I have Asperger's.  Is life worth living?I'm a 20 year old college student diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and I don't think I'll ever be able to achieve the quality of life that other people have.  I just read in the "most depressing fact you know" thread that over 90 percent of people with Asperger's never get married or have kids and I don't think I'm part of that ten percent.  I only know one person with Asperger's who has a girlfriend and he's brilliant and disciplined.  Everybody else I know with Asperger's is an anti-social shithead, myself included.  I'm awkward, ugly, and I've never met a girl who likes me as more than a friend. (I've had about two or three friends who are girls) 

I've asked out multiple girls, only one said yes and the "date" was a massive sham.  It turned out she had a boyfriend who she never told me about after I paid 40 dollars for dinner and we still hang out because I'm an immense faggot.  Whenever I talk to girls (and guys to a lesser extent) I can tell that they think I'm awkward and repulsive and they feel uncomfortable and would rather be talking to somebody else.  My parents and my therapist tell me I'll be able to find someone but I'm pretty sure my parents are delusional (they genuinely believe I'm a cool, handsome guy who people like) and my therapist will say anything to make me feel better.  My friends tell me "BLARGH JUST BE CONFIDENT" but they're the ones who make fun of me for being weird and awkward so I don't think they have any confidence in me.       

I don't see why I should live the rest of my life if I'll be alone forever.  I don't know if I'll be able to have kids either because my kids will probably just be depressed and retarded like I am.  I don't think I'll have any real success in life, I'm studying psychology because I'm too stupid to study science or engineering.  What should I do with my life?
