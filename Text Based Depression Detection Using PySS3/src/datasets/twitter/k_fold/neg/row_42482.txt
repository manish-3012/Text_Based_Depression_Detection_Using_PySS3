Can't there be a sticky post for just "talking"I don't want my own post and maybe I don't want the pressure of someone responding necessarily, but just to talk here. I feel like I come here post the same stuff, I've been alive now way longer than I wanted and am still here, but this is still a way out for me. I don't know what to respond when someone asks me what's wrong because there is way too much and I don't have the energy to explain. The bottom line is I'm in pain all the time for various reasons. I tried to make something of my life and now have been brought down to nothing and things keep pushing me farther. While I've been told I'm tenacious and a fighter and all this stuff, I feel extremely exhausted and weak. I can't stand up anymore. I just feel done. Honestly there really isn't much to say to me, so I don't know why my purpose is. I just don't know.
