Death sounds nice right about now.1.Iâ€™m just done with life, Everything just goes to shit more and more and more no matter what I do to fight back against it there is never a fucking break itâ€™s just constant shit, So what sometimes Iâ€™m in a decent mood or â€œhappyâ€ but guess what? I still go back to this feeling of feeling like I canâ€™t breathe and like my chest is filled with something I canâ€™t even describe but itâ€™s like a constant scream inside me where I feel like Iâ€™ll explode and I canâ€™t do anything about it, I canâ€™t even cry because Iâ€™m so fucked in the head. 

My friends donâ€™t give a fuck about me, Iâ€™ve fucked up friendships and lost them, I canâ€™t even turn to them about anything anymore so I suffer in silence, I canâ€™t tell my mum bedause she will worry about me, Meds donâ€™t do shit and honestly I donâ€™t even think therapy fucking works itâ€™s just a load of shit where I vent and feel okay for a day then back to feeling fucked, Iâ€™m ugly as fuck and women sure as shit donâ€™t like me or on the off chance they do it somehow always goes wrong and half the time itâ€™s â€œitâ€™s not you itâ€™s meâ€ which tbh seems like a load of shit and reinforces the fact that I am not good enough, I have no ambition or goals and Iâ€™ve tried to find those things but I canâ€™t, any new hobby I try I give up because Iâ€™m not good at it which is dumb but just reinforces me that I wonâ€™t ever be good at anything. 

I honestly wish I had a gun 4 years ago so I could splatter my fucking brains across the floor and have it be done with before it got worse, before I hurt people and before they hurt me. Funny thing is this doesnâ€™t even scratch the surface of all the shit going on and honestly Iâ€™m ready to kill my self but Iâ€™m too much of a coward to do anything, Maybe if I do kill myself my â€œfriendsâ€ and everyone else would see the pain Iâ€™m in and how they couldâ€™ve actually helped instead of acting like assholes.
