How do I find out if going to a center costs in my state?My online friend said it didn't cost when she went to a center(what a I call a mental hospital) in her state. The only way I'll consider going to one again is if it doesn't cost because I won't be anymore of a burden to my family than I am right now, not with how expensive it was to go last time.
