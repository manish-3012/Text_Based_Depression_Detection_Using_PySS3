I don't know what to doI recently left my husband, ran away to another state and am living with some friends right now until I can figure out what I'm doing. I know I'm depressed again. I sleep all the time, I barely eat, and I just don't see the point in anything. My husband was abusive and had been physically abusive in the past, but I couldn't take the mental abuse anymore. Even as I have ran, it sticks with me. I recently developed feelings for someone else, but I fully believe he's just leading me on. We sleep in the same bed, and we've kissed, but I feel like he doesn't really want me, just wants a warm bed on the nights he stays over because unless he is staying over things are awkward and weird between us. 

I can't get out of the mentality that I am now starting over with nothing. I have no money, I'm having to pay rent on an apartment until my lease is over I can't even stay at. I feel like a burden to everyone and I don't want to do this anymore.
