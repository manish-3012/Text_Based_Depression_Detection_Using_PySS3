AarghThis morning my daughter tried to off herself. She took 13 pills. They were only Advil. Sheâ€™s alert and recovering at the hospital. Sheâ€™ll be attending a psych evaluation for a few days. 

Nobody knows whatâ€™s up.  Not us parents, not her siblings, not even her best friend.  We are all grasping at straws. She wonâ€™t talk at all.  Iâ€™m hoping the psych evaluation will help get to the bottom of it. 

As a parent - if anyone here is considering this - please consider those left behind. I canâ€™t imagine my life without her. She was our first adopted child. Literally an answered prayer. Please open up.  Talk.  Get help. Iâ€™m hoping she does.
