Donating your organsIâ€™m not going to do anything rn so no need for the nice messages,etc but Iâ€™ve been trying to research. Does anyone know what the best way is to donate your organs? Arenâ€™t just dead or not dead quite yet organs best when someone needs a transplant? I would think maybe like taking your life inside a hospital might be best? Unless they try to bring you back which would be a huge nope. I would think b l a c k market but Iâ€™d rather help like some kid who has their whole life ahead of them or a parent who would love a few more years with their fam or a cancer patient, etc. Or maybe a country that would do an assisted suicide even if youâ€™re not terminal? Itâ€™s a shame that so many people commit suicide and their organs go to waste...I dk hope thatâ€™s not too morbid or mean considering I feel that way about myself
