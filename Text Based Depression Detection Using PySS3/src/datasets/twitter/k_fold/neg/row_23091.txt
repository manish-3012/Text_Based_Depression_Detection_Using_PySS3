LifeI have been suicidal for a long time and nobody cares about me anymore and it seems like Iâ€™m invisible to people nobody asks me if Iâ€™m okay nobody even has conversations with me anymore I have no true friends I just want to end it all nothing is worth it anymore I canâ€™t even seem to remember the last time I was even actually happy nobody seems to love me and everyone else has moved on with there lives 
And Iâ€™m just stuck in a life of everything that sucks nobody listens to me anymore or understands what I mean nothing is fun anymore 
I lost interest in things and I stopped eating nothing is worth it anymore
