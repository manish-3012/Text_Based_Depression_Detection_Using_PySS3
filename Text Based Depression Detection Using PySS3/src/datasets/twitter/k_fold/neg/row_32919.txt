I don't know what's going on, I'm constantly sadHi. I know it's gonna happen one day, but just thinking about my mom's reaction, it breaks my heart. I just turned 25. I've always been either really sad or really happy. For the past 11 years I've been thinking about killing myself(not constantly), but the last 6 months.. I can't fall asleep. I'm stressed, worried, lost. I moved to US almost 2 years ago and although it's something I've always wanted, I feel lonelier than ever. I used to want to be alone, I used to enjoy my own company. Now I'm completely alone and I feel like I'm going crazy, I can't find peace. I don't want to go back to my country due to my sexuality, but being away from my mom and dogs is killing me. Before you think I'm retarted, my dad passed away 7 years ago so I'm everything my mom has. She's sad about me being here. Also, I'm a pretty attractive girl, with a great sense of humor and I don't mean to sound narcissistic, these are the things people seem to "complement" me on, so making friends wouldn'tbe a problem. I can't find a meaning to my life, nothing seems to satisfy me. I love philosophy and learning how our minds work and I feel like I'm either lazy trying to avoid life (the lack of motivation might be a sign of laziness, however I'm an extremely hardworking person) or I'm really stupid, because I can't find a solution for my "problem" or better said.. I can't spot the problem. I know that once my mom dies, I'll finally be free to do it. Anyone that's feeling how I'm feeling, I'd appreciate any advice or opinion. 
Thank you for reading and sorry for my broken english
