Doing all that I can.Why was I given this life? Is it fair to be given a life of suffering and pain? Mental illnesses are probably one of the worst things that someone could be given in a life. People always say "make the best the of your life" or "do what you can". I feel like I have done what I can with mine. I've been trying to fight against my suicidal thoughts since I was 6 years old. Growing up in a household with no emotional support while being bullied in grade school. No one caring until I attempted to commit suicide. Trying fuck tons of medication. Years of therapy.  Traveling. Becoming fit. Having someone that loves me with all their heart. NOTHING works. I still feel the WANT and the NEED to hurt and kill myself. I just want to be let go and forgotten. Don't bury me just burn my body and let me go. Please I can't handle this anymore. I'm so anxious. I'm so angry. I'm so depressed. I'm everything. I am tired of fighting. So tired. I really fucking am. Everything is just temporary happiness. I want to die but I don't want to hurt anyone. I really don't want anyone to be pained by my death. I want them to be happy that I am finally let go from this hell. I am so tired... please.  Just let me go please. Then I can finally experience happiness. Something other than suicidal thoughts
