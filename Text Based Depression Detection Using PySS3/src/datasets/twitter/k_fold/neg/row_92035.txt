I've been in the meat freezer for too longI feel so numb emotionally. I guess I've skipped through all the stages of grief and set them aside for a rainy day. but if I really think hard about it, it all rushes back like a tidal wave. Forever is forever. Something like that scary in a world made of temporary things. Forever hated. The stars may burn out one day but that hate won't. It will last longer than the last hydrogen atom. thinking about my rapist alot considering it happened a year ago on the dot. I feel dirty. I hate men. I hate men so fucking much. Makes me want to punch one in the face. I hate everyone actually. My abuser and her thugs make it seem like I should be thankful they even talked to me. Like that's some sort of privilege to be in their presence. I've wasted the God's time apparently. Helping isn't giving crappy advice and then splurging at the first interaction with my depression. I must be so privileged to have ever been given a second chance. What a boy like me must've done to offend such a gentle angel ðŸ™„. 

Remember to take the cores out of your apples. Makes them taste better. No one likes seeds in their stomaches.
