I just tied a nooseHey. Iâ€™m 20 years old, a black female. I used to love the holidays. It was my favorite time of year. But when I turned 18 my mom put me out. I started college and moved into a dorm which I live in year round. All my roomates go home for thanksgiving and Christmas but I donâ€™t. I pretend I do  go home so people wonâ€™t judge me for not having a family or an actual home. I feel so depressed man. My brother recently cut me off. And I could go with my dad to thanksgiving but his wife hates me and will verbally abuse me so bad. I was also raped last year and the perp is still walking free after I reported him because there was not enough evidence. I have been having dreams about him for weeks. Itâ€™s killing me. My roomates boyfriend is a creep and always tryâ€™s to make advances at me. I post pictures on instagram and guys DM and I sleep with them hoping for a relationship and then they block me. My psychiatrist doesnâ€™t Fucking help heâ€™s just doping me out on seroquil. I really wanna die. If there was a stable pipe or something in my dorm I would do it now. But I guess I have to wait until night and go outside. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll go through with it. I feel like shit... can someone please help me. No doctors, just someone who actually gives and shit and will listen. Iâ€™m hurting.
