Hi. I recently got a 35% on a testI got a 35% on a test grade and told my mom to let her know before she checks online for my grades. Anyway, after I told her my grade she yelled at me and told me I was worthless and a waste of money. After she left I immediately searched up how to commit suicide because I'm just that depressed. (If I get an F, my iphone will be switched to a flipphone)
