I want to disappearI really hate myself and being alive right now, I just want to stop existing. I feel alone even though i have some family and some friends, it just feels like theyâ€™re not there, if that makes any sense. Iâ€™m never going to amount to anything, i have no hobbies or anything that will matter later in life. Im scared to talk to people about things like this, mostly because theyâ€™ll see me as an edgy teen, or theyll tell me i dont have it too bad. I know i dont have it too bad, but that doesnt suddenly make anything better. I hate feeling like this, and i cant stand it anymore. Its been building up but tonight was just the point where i cant stand myself and everything. I feel so selfish posting things like this or wanting to ask for help.
