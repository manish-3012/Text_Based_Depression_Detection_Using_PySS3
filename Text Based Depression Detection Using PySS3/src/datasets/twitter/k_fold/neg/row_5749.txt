I cannot stand the "I know things are hard now, but chin up, things will get better !" sentiment. For fuck's sake.Things just don't "get better", life circumstances don't just change. You have to make them, and if you can't you're fucked. Lots of people are fucked, with their back against a wall and no way out of dire situations. Either you can cope and use the tools available to change your life, or you can't. If you can't change things, you can choose to suffer or give up. A lot of people who suffer choose to suffer because they have faith that if they are patient and good the universe will reward them. The universe rewards no one, it's an indifferent system. People are only willing to suffer and sacrifice everyday if they meaningfully believe it would lead to a fulfilling, happy outcome. Once it becomes clear that this will not be the case, people become either give up or become delusional.
