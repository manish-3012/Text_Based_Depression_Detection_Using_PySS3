I dont see a future for myselfI cant imagine ever having a future at this point, I cant get a job im just gonna end up homeless again and if that happens ill probably just commit suicide because I cant handle having to sell myself to get money again, there is seriously no way out of this hole im trapped in, medication doesn't help, therapy doesn't help, im fucked.
