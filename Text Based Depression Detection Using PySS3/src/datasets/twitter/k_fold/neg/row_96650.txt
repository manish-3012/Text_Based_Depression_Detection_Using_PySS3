17 M- tired of being hereRecently come off my meds for anxiety and depression and realised how much I was reliant upon them, and I doubt Iâ€™m ever gonna get my head to the place it was say 5 years ago, so Iâ€™m genuinely just considering giving up, I donâ€™t care about anything anymore and I know that Iâ€™m literally just another mouth for my family to feed at this point so may as well save them the trouble
