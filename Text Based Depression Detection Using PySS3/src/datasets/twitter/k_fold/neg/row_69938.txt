Thank you!I was beyond despondent last night... I still haven't eaten in 4 days... WAS amazing... I woke up had nothing to lose... walked in to a place and asked for a job... little known to me she had JUST put the sign up... and took it down after we left the store... i didnt know i had a job until i was handed a schedule... please see there is hope
