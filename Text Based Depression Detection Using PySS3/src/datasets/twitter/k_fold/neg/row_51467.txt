Life is burning me out.I want to kill myself, but I'm too pussy to do it.

I'm burning out. Being held to a standard shorted me out, and since my intelligence burned out like a candle wick, I feel like I want to die.

I'm expected to have good grades, go to a good university, and do all these fabulous things in life as the first born American citizen in my family.

It's hard. My GPA is at a 2.33. 3 college level high school courses I wasn't ready for is fucking me up very easily. I don't talk about topics like suicide to my friends, since why should they worry about me? They have their own troubles, I'm not going to let this compound onto theirs.

I'd like to think this is because of my horrible, cruel personality. I've destroyed friendships, with only so many I was able to salvage. I have a bad self-image of myself. Everytime I mess up with a bad grade, I just think "Huh, if I killed myself I wouldn't have to deal with it", then forget about it on a whim. If I ever mess up with social stuff, then I just let it fuck off, because who wants to be friends with a self-loathing idiot?

I've always dreamed that one day, I'm going to do something valuable with my life, like be a military hero, or save lives. I hate the idea of a 9-to-5 job. I never want to work a 9 to 5 job ever in my life. 

I don't even know man. I've had depressive bouts a good number of times in my 17 years, but I don't think I'll shoot myself in 10 years.
