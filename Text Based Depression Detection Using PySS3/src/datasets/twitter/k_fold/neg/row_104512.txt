Schizophreniaâ€‹ diagnosed friend planning to dieMy best friend was diagnosed schizophrenic on Monday. She remained strong until those last days. Yesterday and today she spoke with her parents (mostly her mother). Since that she is back to "I must die" (said a bit more violently against herself in French...).

I don't know what to do apart saying "There is no use. Please don't do anything.", "Please don't give up, do it for me", "I love you more than anything else, you are not alone..."

I was able to use a promise that we made, that we'll see each other again and alive...

She is also all I have... Without her I would no longer be there. She also convinced me to not kill myself we I had prepared everything to overdose ; but I'm totally unable to convince her back...

If she die I would end up doing the same.

I should visit her at the hospital on this Tuesday and stay the whole day with her. (the hospital is pretty far away from where I live, so it's complicated...)

I don't know what to do to keep her alive...
