I'm getting scared at how much sense killing myself makes right now.It's been getting more and more like that for a few years no, but really intense the last couple months.  When I'm lying in bed, its all I think about.

I feel that everyone in my life would be better off without me.  Sure, they'll hurt at first and ther will be an adjustment period, but  overall.....I cant see how it wont be better for them
