I'm scared.I'm scared.

I'm scared at the way things are going in the country.

I'm scared at how things are going in the world

I'm scared to be a black man in America.

I'm scared that my last damn childhood dream(Japan) is gonna go up in flames(**Literally**)

I'm scared I won't be able to go to Japan **AT ALL**(Again,that place is a place I wanted to go to since I was a little kid..)

I'm scared that the world,**EVERYTHING** is gonna go to shit and Nothing will truly matter anymore..life will then become something not worth living.

And therein lies my motivation for seriously thinking/considering suicide.

It seems better to want out and just "take the express lane out" than having to the see the world/country fall apart.

**I don't want any of this bullshit.**

In fact,I'm even thinking of the time..which isn't this year,but maybe sometime next year(**Maybe**).

I'm...just really leaning towards **Fuck Everything** at this point.
