what do you do when your life isn't sustainable.i have a sleeping disorder that is rarely acknowledged. and so i sleep on average 14 hours a day. i've made it to be 33 and i truly love and enjoy existing. i love learning and laughing and just in general interacting with life and people. i have a wonderful and brilliant son who will soon be 8, and i have an amazing dog that i am so lucky to have. i'm even fortunate enough to have a few amazing, and supportive friends. i just feel like i can't successfully and independently exist (keep a job, pay my rent, buy food). i want to be here, i just don't know how to make it work.
