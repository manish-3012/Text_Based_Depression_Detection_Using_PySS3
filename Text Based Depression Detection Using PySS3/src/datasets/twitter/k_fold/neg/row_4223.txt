Ready to GoI'm 18 years old and I know thats young but I am ready to die...My best friend of 3 years and first love and girlfriend of 5 months who I talked about marrying and who I called my soulmate left me....she is the only person in 18 years who has ever wanted to be with me....I am not attractive in any way I have no job and no car and I feel hopeless....she was my only reason for living and had seriously considered suicide before being with her...but now that she has left me I have nothing to live for anymore...I just need tips on how to kill myself and buying a gun is not an option and painless would be preferable...I have done serious research into the subject and know of things like the exit bag but I dont see that as a viable option either...so if anyone knows of painless fool proof ways that would be really helpful 

P.S. I am not looking to be talked out of it
