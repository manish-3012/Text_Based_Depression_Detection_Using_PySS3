Officially started cutting myselfIâ€™m just inherently unlikeable. Iâ€™ve never had a friend or girlfriend. Among many other issues. I have Aspergerâ€™s syndrome, so Iâ€™m awkward, Iâ€™m shy and have no social skills or conversational skills, so Iâ€™m boring and not interesting.

For reference look at this post I made because I donâ€™t feel like explaining it again.
