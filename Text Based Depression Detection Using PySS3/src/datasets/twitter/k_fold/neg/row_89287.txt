Trapped and desperateI have bipolar 2 so im familiar with the rollercoaster of mood swings. I am on meds, but i feel more suffocated with each passing day..like im trapped in a corner and theres only one way out. The urge to die is so strong and the violence of this feeling scares me. I feel like im going crazy, like im going to do something drastic just to get out from the corner.What do i do now? Someone please help me
