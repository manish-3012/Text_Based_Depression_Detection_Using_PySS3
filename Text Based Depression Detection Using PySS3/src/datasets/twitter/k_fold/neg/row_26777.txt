Weighing my optionsI am 18 years old. For the past 8 years of my life, nearly half of it, I have had mental problems.

From the end of grade school, I've been depressed, anxious, even having periods of delusions and hallucinations. Every day is agony, and every day it's just gotten worse.

I've been to multiple psychiatrists, I've taken many different drugs to try to make me into a normal person. Nothing has worked completely though. I just don't know what to do.

I've tried killing myself once before. Honestly, it wasn't so bad. And again I am contemplating suicide, as it seems nothing else has worked.

Currently, I am a high school dropout. It's not that I am stupid, it's just that I couldn't handle school with my mental problems. I've since been studying solo - I became an autodidact. But that is worth nothing in this society. Without a piece of paper saying that I passed some bullshit tests, I am nothing.

All I do, every day, is waste time on reddit, and program. That's it. I have no substantial human interaction. I have no friends. I live at my parents house, leeching off of their hard earned money.

And what makes it worse is that I am currently seeing a psychiatrist. Without my medication I am a wreck - with it I am just a zombie. In my case, zombie is preferable, but it just costs too much to continue seeing my doctor.

I am putting a burden on everyone I know. I've wasted so much money, thrown away so many opportunities, destroyed my life.

It'll be over quick, I know it well. I know my exact plan, and I know how and when I will execute it. I am sure it will bring great pain on my family, but that will be my final shitty action, before they are free from me.

I just can't take it anymore.

Half of my life, tormented. Is it really logical to continue living? I don't think so. I am ready to die.
