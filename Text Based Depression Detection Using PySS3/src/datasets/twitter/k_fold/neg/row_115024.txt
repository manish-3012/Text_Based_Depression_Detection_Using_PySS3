I want to settle my debts firstI donâ€™t think I need to live past that. Iâ€™m not saying Iâ€™m anymore responsible; Iâ€™ll hurt plenty of my loved ones, but I am also confident they never needed me. You only need yourself. And when Iâ€™m done, Iâ€™ll stack the chairs on the desks, turn off the lights, and lock the door behind me. At least I wonâ€™t be in more debt. Life is funny like that.
