Friend of mine won't stop trying. (Wall of text)A friend of mine has tried committing suicide once before, she failed. She was hospitalized for a month. When she came back, everything seemed ok until she tried once again two weeks later. She tried to o.d. on her meds and slept for two days straight. Her parents called me and told me about the incident and she was hospitalized again. She was transferred to a different location for teens with issues for two weeks then was released.

She was dropped out of school (we're high school seniors) because of her many absences and now just spends time at home. About a week ago, we went to the beach with a group of friends and she was acting strange. She pulled a friend of mine aside for a while and when they came back, friend number 2 told me that friend number 1 had mumbled strange things to herself. She has set another day for another attempt. She said April 20th. Ever since that day, she's been ignoring me.

Since I met her back in my freshman year of high school, she has always talked about how she wants to end her life but hadn't tried anything until this year. As a senior, its really taking a toll on me and our other friends because we constantly worry about her besides having to worry about college and stuff. Her parents are suffering as well. Her mother is confined to a wheelchair and has deteriorating health and her father is always working. They try what they can to make her happy but she is unsatisfied with everything. She talks to her sister and tells her everything but her sister NEVER tells her parents. We don't know what to do and she clearly doesn't give a shit about all those around her that care for her. Any help would be appreciated.
