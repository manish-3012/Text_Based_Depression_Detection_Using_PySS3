Went to the depression subreddit, only want to die more.And not because it's negative. If you post something about how you're struggling all you get is a bunch of me too posts (if you get any replies at all because they're only interested in 'interesting' posts or ones that allow them to talk about themselves). This wouldn't be such a problem on it's own, but then they go and spout out these useless platitudes like "it gets better" and "I love you" and then turn around and spout tough love crap like "Killing yourself is selfish and cowardly" "No one is going to help you but you", etc. And these are the comments that get a bunch of upvotes. Then someone posted a comment that said you can't hope for anyone to help you, we're all alone, which goes against that places damn tagline. Going there and only reinforces how bs life actually is and how it's not worth it.
