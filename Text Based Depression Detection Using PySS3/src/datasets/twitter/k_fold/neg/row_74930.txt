Life is about proving how perfect you are to people who don't even care about youYou go to school and have to show how smart you are in tests, then get a job where you continue to pretend to be perfect. Then you earn money to buy expensive things and you can show how pretty you are so that other people accept you and when you fall none of those people will care. Don't forget to have a lot of hobbies that you don't actually like. It's so stupid
