instead of killing my self I've decided to disappear to a new country and start a new lifehey reddit I really need some help. to make a long story short I am a senior in college ( majoring in finance) and have about $3,000 in my bank account. ive had major depression for the past two years and I just don't enjoy my life. ive thought about killing my self for a while to escape. However I decided it would be better to just run away to a different country. I need advice how should I do this? what country should I go to? ( I have a passport) what are some tips or ideas to pull this off?
