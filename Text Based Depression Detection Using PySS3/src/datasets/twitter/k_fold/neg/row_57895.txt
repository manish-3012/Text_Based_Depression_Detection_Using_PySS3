love exists on earthI wish i had someone to genuinely care for me and love me. Everyone that i ever trusted ended up hurting me in some way. My parents left me when i was born and i keep reminding that to myself when anyone ends up hurting me. If i die soon, at least God doesn't need to be bothered about me asking Him for a sign or a small symbol just to see if anyone cares for me. I reached out to everyone i could and almost no one responded or took me seriously. December is the month i plan on dying. If i find a single hint of someone caring about me, i will stop and try to fix myself. If not, i will die.
