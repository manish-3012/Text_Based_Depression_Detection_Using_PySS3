I just want everyone around me to die so I can as well.Maybe I should just be selfish and kill myself first. If they don't want to live with the pain of my death (I don't understand why anyone would care, but I guess they do anyway), they can do the same. Why should I be the one who puts in all the effort to fit in when I don't even want to be here?
