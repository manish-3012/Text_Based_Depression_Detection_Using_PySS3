Anyone else just alive for their kids?I would absolutely never do anything to myself while they're around. I love them. I'm bettering myself as a person for myself and for them, and that keeps my anguish at bay for the meantime. 


I just want to be dead. I don't want to be alive anymore. I'm sick of existing. I've been tired of it for years. I'm not a quality person and I'll always be horrible at heart. I'll always be unwanted, and I've been told that things would be better without me more than once. 

I just hope any good I have inside myself gets passed onto my children. I hope I never let them see my pain.
