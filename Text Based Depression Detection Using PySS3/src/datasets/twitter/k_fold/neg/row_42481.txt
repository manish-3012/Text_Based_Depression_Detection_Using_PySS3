I dont know why im delayingWell ive a few suspicions, that annoying human trait 'hope',fear,though I thoroughly believe that death is the same as pre birth,before you or I was born,conceived we didn't exist,nothing that happened before that time bothered us at all,all the death,misery and cruelty we inflict upon our fellow beings, we are unaware.I know that if I take these drugs I'm going to "fall asleep" and become nothing,a dreamless sleep being the closest any of us can empathise with,I can't do this much longer
