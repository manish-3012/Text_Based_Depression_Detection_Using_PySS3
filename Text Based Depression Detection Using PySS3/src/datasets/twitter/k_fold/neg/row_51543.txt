Note to selfYou're going to be lonely. Not even the normal "lonely", like the way someone might feel while spending a weekend night by themselves. It'll be  mind numbing, it'll feel suffocating, it'll make you wary and fearful of people, even ones you've liked and loved and have liked and loved you back.

You're going to make mistakes. Some of them will be expensive. Some of them will be embarrassing. Some of them you'll regret deeply. 

You're going to make choices. Some of them willingly. Some of them through inaction. It'll be difficult either way. 

You're going to be strange. Other people will look at you funny. Some will laugh. Some will be worry. Some will avoid you. Some will even hate you. 

And you will live through all of it. Not for hope of a better day, because better days might not come. Not for anyone else, because at times there will be no one else. You will, because you know yourself. There's a truth inside you that's worth keeping, underneath all the smoke and mirrors, the shit, the bitterness, the pain. It's not worth much, but neither is anything else. It's worth keeping.
