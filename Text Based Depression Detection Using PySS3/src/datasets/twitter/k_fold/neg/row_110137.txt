Living in college dorms sucks cuz I donâ€™t have a way out here. Iâ€™m stuck living.Itâ€™s worse than living in a place with the means to kill your self. I used to live with my family and we had plenty of guns and strong medicines. Now I have nothing but my suffering. I donâ€™t even have a way out and thatâ€™s worse than having the option.
