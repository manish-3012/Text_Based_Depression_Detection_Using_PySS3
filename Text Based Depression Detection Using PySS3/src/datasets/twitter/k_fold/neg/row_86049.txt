I'm not going to kill myself, but I don't deserve life.Just want to say first - I'm not actually going to commit suicide. I don't anyone thinking I'm actually in danger and calling the cops or something. I don't want to die, and even if I did, I'm way too scared of death to ever go there. I just feel terrible enough that I think I belong here.

I don't deserve to be alive. People will say that they think everyone does, but I honestly believe that if someone really got to know me, I'd be an exception. Anyone who says otherwise either doesn't know me well enough yet, or is lying, to me, themselves, or both. I haven't done anything monumentally terrible - I've never killed anyone, never destroyed anyone's life, nothing like that. But I'm the kind of person no one wants around. The kind of person who annoys everyone. The kind of person who doesn't fit in society. The kind of person who disgusts you. The kind of person who, no matter how hard they try to change, you can tell that there's just something *wrong* with them.

I have exactly one person who I can say with complete confidence actually cares about me and wants me alive on this earth. I do not deserve him, but I'm eternally thankful to who or whatever decided I should have him in my life. Having that one person makes life worth living sometimes. Maybe that's why I'm still here. But even with that, I sometimes feel like I'm getting infinitely more than a hate-worthy thing like me deserves.

I'm worth nothing. I feel like every time I try, I'm given just a little bit of a reason to hope, only to be reminded that I will never, ever be good, or even good enough. I deserve every terrible thing that anyone has ever said about me.

I hate myself.
