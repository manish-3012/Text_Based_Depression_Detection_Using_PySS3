Do you ever worry that you'll do it on impulse?I don't have much experience with being suicidal. I've self harmed before but I've never tried to take my life but obviously I've had ideation over the years. 

I've got schizophrenia &amp; things are bad right now. My mood is shifting dramatically every couple of hours from mania to depression &amp; self harm. It's been like this for 2 weeks and it's getting worse.

I'm honestly scared that I'm going to get a knife &amp; start stabbing myself. I've already had compulsions the last few nights to jump out my window. I feel so out of control at times that I'm worried I'm going to do something &amp; not realise the full scale of what I'm actually doing!

Does this make any sense? Because when I'm unwell I lose insight &amp; I can end up feeling like some unstoppable force that no harm can come to which is kind of where the jumping out the window thing comes from because I don't imagine injuring myself I actually imagine surviving with no injury as if it was a video game and not real life.
