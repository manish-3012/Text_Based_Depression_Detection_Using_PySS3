Im retarded (70) IQ...?I was diagnosed with retardation that falls somewhere under 70 IQ. Reasons for that were my drawing and the way i behaved as a kid, or didn't behave. When i was with psychiatrist, I just sat there and watched him for an hour thinking why am i there and what he wants to know. He didn't talk to me, looked at drawings and called my mother in. After that she treated me like i was a kid for years. The point is that im not really sure if i am retarded, as i have some signs like not going out (gaming), socially awkward and impulsive. On the other hand, i did some IQ tests and my average score is about 140. 
I was always daydreaming as a kid, but never unaware of my environment or what people are saying. In fact, im so aware, that i can listen to 3 people at the same and write something down not related to them. Also, when i close my eyes, i see one very different ever changing world, where everything is possible. I use it for creation of whatever i want. Am i really retarded? I mean Im 21, still live with my mother, don't have a job, friends and never had a gf. Im thinking of jumping off a cliff or just electrocuting myself, even though after a pause of 2 years, my university starts in 8 days and it just might change my life.
