I can't go on much longer!Hi,

M25.

I have been suffering from extreme social anxiety and panic disorder for the last 5 years.

So many misunderstandings have come from this, and many consider me rude or a psycho. 

That in turn, has cause a severe depression. 

Tried numerous drugs and therapies - nothing helped.

No friends. No GF.

Some recent unfortunate circumstances caused me to lose ALL my saving this spring (50K USD).

This has been a catalyst for intense thoughts of suicide. 

I feel so hopeless and done.
