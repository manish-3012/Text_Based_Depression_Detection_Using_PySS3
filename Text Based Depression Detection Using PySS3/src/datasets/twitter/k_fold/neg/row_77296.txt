What's keeping me aliveFirst time posting so not sure what to do really.  I think I figured out what I feel is keeping me from killing myself.  I'm about $1500 in debt and can't imagine leaving my family with my debts to pay when I kill myself.  I would say I live a pretty good life comparatively to most people, but I can't shake myself of this feeling that I don't want to continue on.  I don't want to be depressed and suicidal, but it's like I can't help it no matter what I try.  Anyway... I think once I pay my debt off and sell most of my stuff I'll be ready to go.  Maybe I just need someone to talk to. I just don't know anymore.
