It just keeps getting harder and harderAt this point I'm really struggling to deal with life. I don't know how to find any self appreciation or any form of love for myself. I really just hate myself, I can't explain why as I do not know, but its real and it's there and it's always there.

I've tried so hard to commit to self fulfilling activities, taking up old hobbies, starting gym, eating healthy, but nothing fills this void I cannot handle.

I'm currently doing therapy once a week with my psychologist, which works for the short term. I'm able to express all the built up thoughts my anxiety loves to plague me with every hour of my life. And releasing them feels good, but it only lasts so long before some other debilitating thought takes over my mind again. It's a constant battle for contentment which I have not been winning for along time.

Suicide is always on my mind, regardless of my sobriety. All I need to do is look in the mirror and the first thing in my mind is kill yourself. Constantly. It doesn't help my ex of 3 years left me a couple months ago, even though during this time I was still experiencing this, but my main priority was I could never do that to her, I love her way too dearly. I wish I could love myself that dearly. She left me for her work friend that I "shouldn't"worry about. Essentially taking my only legitimate will to live from my soul.

I don't blame her, I'm an absolute wreck of a human and she really probably just got fed up with my shit. It's cool. But now the only thing I really have is my family. Who I hardly get along with. My mother is a narc my father is an abusive drunk too arrogant to even admit his alcoholic faults.

Now I have no one, and I'm struggling to get through everyday more and more as they go. Suicide to me seems perfect. Other than the pain left for others, I'm 21 I don't care to live anymore, I don't care to try anymore. I've tried so hard for so long and nothing actually gets better, regardless of my effort to do anything beneficial to my life. I always end up in the same rut.

And then I get nights like this one, where the thought of ending my life is so close to reality and seems so much easier than continuing this struggle.
