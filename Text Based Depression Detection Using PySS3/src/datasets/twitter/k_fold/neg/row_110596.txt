Thinking of and tried dying for years. still trying and failing to find reasons not to die.Im new to this very new. in fact this is my first reddit post ever or post on anything ever actually. Im not good a grammar so please forgive me. ive been suicidally depressed for years and when im not depressed im STILL extremely suicidal. my family wont listen my girlfriend calls me selfish for it and my bestfriend my only friend said she's had enough of it... so i come here to share what i guess is my life story to tell why i want to die so much. i have very very hardcore visual/audio hallucinations and terrible nightmares, like demons ripping my flesh apart or some dark crap like that and worse. my hallucinations are like mist people and shadow people and such. sometimes i'll even wake up to see one standing over my bed smiling at me looking like its ready to devour my very soul. 
when i was born i guess is when it began. my mother was supposed to be baron (and she had me and my brother 4 years younger than me) so until she found out she was pregnant with me (which took awhile) she drank, smoked, smoked pot, did coccaine, etc etc. then when i was a baby my mom and my nanna (grandma) stayed in constant fights or so i was told and eventually when i was around 2 or 3 i remember my mom getting in a bad fight with my nanna and every time i said "i want my nanna" my mother would start beating me with a belt. i remember in perfect detail because i was beaten until i was caked in my own blood. yes. at 2-3 years old. at 5 years old it was court ordered i had to spend certain days with my father. he had a 13yr old daughter my half sister whom alongside her bestfriend would molest me and have me touch them til they came and me being 5 barely (if at all) knew what was going on and thought it was a weird game. as the years went on i quit having to go to my fathers at around 7yrs old but i had to live in a run down apartment and was practically starving for food and beat whenever i said something my mother didnt like but i guess like all parents she does have a caring side but im here to talk about the bad things not the good ones. time went on i started hearing voices in my head and in the distance, i became afraid of the dark, terrified even, i feel like someone or something is always watching me in the dark. my hallucinations only got worse. starting seeing a therapist who took my insurance and got on medication but nothing ive ever done or taken has worked not even a little, even drugs and alcohol hardly work at all even as a numbing agent. i started dating in my mid teens and every girl i dated either ghosted me or we screwed and she ghosted me or she manipulated me as much as she could cheated as much as she could and ghosted me. and i finally started just breaking down and tried poisoning myself, ODing, freezing, burning, cutting, shooting, stabbing, and nothing has worked all attempts have failed. miserably. eventually i met a girl and i fell in love and she loved me back or so she said. we were on and off constantly because of my aggression that i swore to her i would control because i love her and want her in my life and i would do anything for her. then one of the times we're off again she starts dating one of her coworkers who's old enough to be her father because hes twice and a half her age. she then chose to abandon me and then 6 months later after just ditching me she comes back into my life because her grandfather died and she needed support. and since i still loved her i helped. and i poured my heart out to her and she said she just didnt love me anymore and i was okay with that but i wasnt giving up. so a little time passed just a couple months maybe a year and i bring it up again and she says "im not ready for that yet" key word YET she gave me false hope because guess what? while i was trying to be her friend and hoping i could be with her again we screwed whenever she was in the mood and i only find out AFTER he died from blood poisoning that she was still with him the entire time even when we were screwing she was with him and he let her do it because he couldnt get it up anymore. needless to say i felt used and my heart was destroyed and yet the fool in me still loves her and comes running whenever she snaps her fingers. she is my ONLY friend i have no others. i also have a girlfriend now who ive had for a couple years no who i dont love at all and she is unhealthily obsessed with me and has to have everything her way or i get slapped or screamed at or beat on by her ex shes still friends with (they dont screw trust me) and im ok with it because i feel like im such a massive screw up and im so stupid i deserve the punishment its what ive been told all my life. "youre stupid, youre lazy, youre ugly, youre useless, youre a waste of life, you shouldnt have ever been born, you wanna die? fine go ahead and die." that last one was a quote from my mother when i swallowed a bottle lorzapam 2 years ago. i swallowed a bottle went down to the creek (what WAS my safe space) and just fell asleep. woke up a few hours later in a white bed with an IV in my right arm. as time has gone on and more things happen i just feel more like nothing matters at all and that im dying anyway so why not speed up the proccess? i blow blood from my nose i vomitted blood all day one day and i shat blood the next. some days its hard to make fists and some days i can barely walk because the damage in my knees and im only 23 yes all this and much more i HAVN'T spoken about and im only 23 but like that matters. beaten, abused, manipulated constantly even by the people i once loved and that i still do. but recently ive just started feeling hollow and when i look at a knife ill zone out and imagine the different ways i could use it on myself. wrist? juggular? belly? thru the ribs? any way i can think to use it. and even as im typing this i just feel empty. i cant see a therapist or shrink anymore. i cant talk to family about any of it. my girlfriend calls me selfish just for being sad. and my "bestfriend" claims to want to help but gets angry when i mention i feel like killing myself and then yells at me for it. with nowhere else to go and no one else to come to i downloaded the redit app and came here and spilled most of my guts.
