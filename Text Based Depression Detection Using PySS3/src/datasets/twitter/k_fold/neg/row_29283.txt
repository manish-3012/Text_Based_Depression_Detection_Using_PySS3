I've had it...I really have had it with life: I am a 36 year old, severely disabled Multiple Sclerosis patient. I was diagnosed when I was 20 and from a life of sports and athletics, I have truly become a blob. I lost my job (didn't technically lose it, but retirement at age 32 is kind of losing it when your income is reduced to 1/3), I've been a complete loser with women or rather just waited or hoped for "the one," but she never showed up and the ones I was eventually interested in turned me down so flat, oh boy. Hell, I was a virgin until 2 days ago, when finally I said "fuck it" and hired an escort. We went bare and I may have contracted something I don't know; I don't care. Not in any hopes of finding a lover or wife past this stage anyway. After 3 months of increasingly unbearable pain, I went to the ER and had an MRI taken of my back and the doctor said I may have a herniated disc, meaning surgery; meaning "kill me now, please." My sister had surgery on her back for a herniated disc a few years back and I remember how bad of a shape she was in post surgery that she needed 2 people to help her get out of bed to go to the bathroom and yet the hernia returned. I live alone, I have such shit neighbors that I even had to report the faggot shit punk bitch living upstairs to the precinct because he came down to my door, grabbed me by the collar and threatened to "fuck me up." 15 years ago, I would have broken both his arms, rolled him down the stairwell and just to make an example, violated that little fluffer he keeps around as a wife. What have I got to live for?
