Who is still here only for the fact it would hurt family/friends?I was looking at the sub today and it surprised me to see comments such as "if it wasn't for x I'd would be gone". This gets to me and I want to know how many of you feel this way... 

I'm not depressed nor suicidal, maybe a little lonely but that's nothing compared to you guys. Guess I'm over curious, anyway have a good one lads/ladies
