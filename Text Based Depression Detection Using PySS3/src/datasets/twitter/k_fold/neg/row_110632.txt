I want someone to say that it's okayI just want someone to say it's okay to kill myself, I'm desperate.


I'm a worthless maggot that lied alot and now everything is catching back up to me. Everything is falling  apart and I just want to get out of it. I drove to this lake wanting so badly to just swim out and drown myself but I just stod there knee deep in this freezing water. A millions things running around my head, I started to cry thinking about everything. I don't actually want to die but I see no other way. I gave up and started to drive home, speeding with all windows down and no seat belt, hoping something might distract me enough to make me lose control and end up dead.


I managed to get home and I'm drinking as much as I can, my mind won't stop the  torment. I want to reach out to someone but I'm all but alone, if I'm honest I just want someone to say that it's the right choice and that I can go ahead with ending it all. I don't want to feel more guilty I just want to be at peace.

I don't know why I'm posting this but I read this sub alot and finally I'm myself in a situation where I'm desperate enough to kill myself and I don't know what to do.
