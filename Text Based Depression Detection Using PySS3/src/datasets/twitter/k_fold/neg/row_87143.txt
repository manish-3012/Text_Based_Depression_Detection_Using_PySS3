I'm really hopelessMy girlfriend just broke up with me, we've been together for 2 weeks 2 WEEKS!! I've loved her for so long and tried to give her soo much love but I guess it's not enough. She says she still likes me but I highly fucking doubt it. I'm either gonna fall into depression or kill myself, and I'm probably gonna take the latter.
