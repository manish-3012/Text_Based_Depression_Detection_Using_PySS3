21 years through and things will only get worse.Its embarrassing to post in here, sharing my lowest feelings, but who cares? I'm a failure who's got an under graduate degree and no job to show for it. Had the worst time at university. Everyone hates me in all walks of life, from school to friends. I have no passion for anything anymore and I'm just pathetic that's why  everyone's stopped talking to me. I just don't seem to do anything right and I disappoint everyone. I'm also really ugly so that's why I have no friends or relationships. Maybe dating someone more pathetic than me would work, oh wait... that's impossible because I'm as low as it gets. I'm shit at what I do so no point anymore. God I'm useless.
