At the tender age of 8, I planned to kill myself when my dad found out. He didn't react well.When people know that you're going to have an attempt, most would lend a shoulder and try their best to comfort you. But not my relatives, especially my father.

When I reached first grade, my parents enrolled me to an elite school in the city. when I was more isolated. I had no real friends. No one to talk to. My parents were always at work and I was always home alone with a neighbor who watched me over. It was all too much until I snapped. I don't want this post to be too graphic, so let's just say I made myself bleed and when the help saw me, she told my dad. A part of me expected that he'd sympathize but NOOO. He yanked my arm and spanked me with the metal part of his thick leather belt until it broke. He replaced it with a whip until he was tired. 

For an obese man, whipping your kidding for mental unwellness for three hours was 
a lot so he stopped after that. He didn't speak to me for weeks after that. Now everytime he mentions it he's somewhat proud I lasted it and became a stronger person and would laugh it off, but it's never been the same for me. The cuts and bruises he and I made on my body healed, but I'll always remember they were there. I regressed into a shy little child and abandoned my talents for years, and I'm only starting to regain them again after 7 years or so. 


Please please. Idk your kids but don't beat them up when they're lost. Talk to them about it. Send them to therapy. Support them.
