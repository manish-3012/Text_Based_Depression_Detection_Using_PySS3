I don't belong here.I don't feel like I actually belong in this life. In this society. I'm not scared to die. Not anymore. I'm terrified of telling my family the truth. Because I know I'll have to tell them everything. My life is falling apart. I can't feel happiness anymore. All I feel is emptiness, pain, disassociation. I am so scared of telling everyone the truth. Because I know the only thing they'll focus their anger on is the fact that I'm fucking unemployed. Not the fact that I want to kill myself. But because I don't work. I can't work. My anxiety chokes me at every single job I get. Nobody understands... my family thinks anxiety is curable by just "putting yourself out there." And "getting out of your comfort zone." Like its that easy...
