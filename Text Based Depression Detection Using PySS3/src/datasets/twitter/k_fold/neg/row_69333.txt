Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m so fucking sad. All the timeI got into this amazing school. I got everything Iâ€™ve ever wanted. But because Iâ€™m autistic and have severe learning disabilities. Plus I have intense eating disorders I canâ€™t do anything I essentially have no friends my grades are way worse than Iâ€™d like. I just want to leave. Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m so useless nothing would change without me. Matter of fact if i killed myself I could get the school to put more money into suicidal prevention. Making lives better for others.
