OT: I don't want to kill myself, but I need someone to talk to.If anyone could suggest a sub for people that just need to talk their thoughts through with someone, I would appreciate it. 

It's about a girl. Every time I think about her, my chest won't stop burning. I feel like I ate a million jalapenos. I barely know her. There are so many other details, though. 

I know this sounds ridiculous, but it's seriously physically taxing. My chest is in constant pain. I mean, maybe I'm having a legitimate health issue, but it only happens when I think about her. The more I focus on her, the more intense it gets.

The only time it was gone was when I was asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night, and for a few seconds, I felt serene. Then, my brain thought of her again and instantly my chest tensed up. It's burning right now. It hurts so much. I feel so many emotions at once. I can't handle them all.

Someone, please help me.
