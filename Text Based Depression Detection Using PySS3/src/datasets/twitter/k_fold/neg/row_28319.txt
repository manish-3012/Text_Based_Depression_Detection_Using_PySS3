The guilt is overwhelmingSo.... my FWB has a girlfriend. And she knew about me and that he and I were intimate. She didnâ€™t like our friendship but she tolerated it.

I found out she left him and tried to kill herself and is in the hospital. My friend says I have nothing to do with it and that our intimacy wasnâ€™t the cause but I know that she was unhappy about it and although I tried to address it with my friend and encouraged him to talk to her, I never ended things between he and I. 

When he told me she left him he ended things with me but wants something to remember â€œusâ€ by but there is no us and heâ€™s going to go back to her and Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m going to lose everything I share with him, even our friendship. And I feel so gross that heâ€™s happy to end things but plans on one last time, it makes me feel like a toy that can be shelved or smth

While that hurts a bit Iâ€™m more shook up that I could have ignored a nagging sense that something was wrong to the point someone else tried to kill themselves. I feel awful and guilty and dirty. 

Last night wasnâ€™t a bad night but things spiraled down to a point where I felt sick and I couldnâ€™t cry but really wanted to and I ended up hurting myself instead. Iâ€™m worried whatâ€™ll happen once my emotions peak or the situation changes. If I kill myself I HAVE to be thorough this time
