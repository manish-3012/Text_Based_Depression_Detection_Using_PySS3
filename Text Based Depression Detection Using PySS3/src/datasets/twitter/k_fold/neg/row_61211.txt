I cannot bear the thought of working for the rest of my life!I know it sounds lazy, but any job, yes any job, I cannot fathom doing for a long period of time. The thought of being forced to be somewhere and do things makes me deeply uncomfortable. This is part of life and part of surviving, and I recognize that. But that is the part that bothers me. I don't want to have to work to survive! I don't even enjoy life all that much so, why should I even try to survive. Yeah there are plenty of good thingthat I enjoy in my life but these other parts of lide overwhelmi me! I don't know how much more I can take.s
