Sometimes I wonderI look at my life and sometimes things are good. But then I think about the reality, I'm a college drop out who couldn't even finish when it was paid for him in full by the university. I have no real drive or any idea where I'm going in life. I'm working a dead end job with no real means of moving up. My wife constantly asks for a divorce and in reality I'm too scared to let her go because if I do I will have nothing. I don't have a home to go back to, I don't have a car of my own anymore, I don't know what to do with my life. The sad part about it all is that I try my hardest to not fuck it all up but it still happens every time I look back. It's not my first time thinking like this, I contemplate the thought all the time. But then I worry about the burdens I would be leaving on family. The debt, the bills, everything and it makes me feel like such a bigger failure. I know I'm bipolar and this is just a bad low.. but at the same time I wonder about this all the time. Would anyone even miss me?
