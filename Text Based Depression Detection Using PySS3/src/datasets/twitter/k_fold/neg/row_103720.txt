I don't see a futureI've failed at everything, I'm 20m and i've never held a job and no drivers license unlike my friends and now I'm about to fail uni. There's no point for a dumbass failure like me to keep living on this planet cause I'm not contributing shit. My dad would be so happy if i died because i will no longer be a burden.
