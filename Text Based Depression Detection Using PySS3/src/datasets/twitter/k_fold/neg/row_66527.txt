My life is getting fixed...now what?I lost love, lost friends (rather didn't have much of them to begin with), lost my job, had to move back to my parents.
After months of struggle and a suicide attempt later I recently got news that I finally got a job.

I still feel like an unlovable loser, everything I hoped and struggled to have I lost or never reached. I thought I would feel better if I just managed to have a job, I am a person who finds a lot of purpose in work. Yet here I am, 27 and trapped in the past, nothing much to show for my efforts save mental issues. And even if I fix the ruin that my life is, Im still gonna be an observer, an outsider with no meaningful connections. What is the point? 

I feel so alone. And Im tired of fighting alone. I feel so breakable, like a crystal ball polished to invisibility.
