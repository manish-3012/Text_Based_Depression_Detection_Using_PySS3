Just found out my friend offed himself... I'm lost...Just found out about 20 minutes ago that my best friend since childhood decided to take enough Opana's to kill an elephant along with a nice swig of Jim. I'm at a complete loss as to what to do because he showed no signs of being unhappy...

I'm sorry if this isn't the place to post this, but I could really use some advice on how to handle this, because right now, I'm just totally lost... I feel like I did something wrong as a friend and I feel fucking angry that he never said anything. I don't know what to do or say. I can't even think. I'm so lost. I don't know who I should talk to.
