Dark days lately, can't seem to get ahold of myself. I need to talk.Life seems to have gotten upside down. In most cases, people wouldn't think twice about me having depression. I have a decent job, making above minimum wage, with overtime if i want it. I have two beautiful sons. But it doesnt seem like any of that matters when the bills pile up, and assistance gets shut down, and my friends turn from me for the choices I make, blowing them off, because I simply cant be bothered to go outside that day. 

I try and I try to carry on, to ignore the pain, to push it away, but i've never felt so alone. My ex husband says he loves me, but I need God. I've never been religious. We were trying to work things out, but there's another man, and I love him too. But I can't have both, and I can't decide. On top of all this, I'm in a dead end job, i can't go back to school and I can't afford to survive. I know it all sounds trivial, and I shouldn't be complaining, but I can't tell anyone else around me of my ever-increasing thoughts to end my life. Who would miss me? my sons? they'd be the only ones. and i can't leave them behind. But it doesn't stop the thoughts from surfacing. That they'd be better off with their dad, he can find a new wife and they can have a happy, whole family. 

My father left me at 16, my mom and I were never close. My uncle is the only one I have and he has no children and no wife, so he doesn't really understand family issues. 

Someone please talk to me. I can't keep these thoughts in my head. I don't know where to turn or what to do.
