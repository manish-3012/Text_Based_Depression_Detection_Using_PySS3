I'm tired of sufferingI'm fucking tired. I'm going to fucking kill myself and it's the only thing I'm looking forward to. No one gives a fuck. Not on reddit, not in real life. I have notning to live for, and no it won't get any better, it'll just get harder for me. I'm sick of being alive, everything is just hurt and pain

I have no girlfriend, I'm still a virgin, I'm ugly, lesbian, barely scraping by university, i have no future and nothing to look forward to. I'm starting to hate university but it's my only option. I'm physically unfit and weak and can't ever change it because I'm too lazy and know I'll never reach the body I want. 

I have nothing and I will never have anything,  I fucking hate this shit. I can't stand looking in the mirror anymore without wanting to burn my face off, I just want to sleep and never wake up
