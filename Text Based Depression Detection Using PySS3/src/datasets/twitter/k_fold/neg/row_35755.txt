It doesnâ€™t seem worth itI donâ€™t wanna exist like this. Iâ€™m a stranger to my whole family, and they barely even like me. They think everything I do or want is stupid and treat me like some idiot. I hate living. I donâ€™t want to exist like this. Ik this is probably the Zoloft withdrawals talking but I want to die or at least harm myself. I thought I would be able to befriend my sister now that sheâ€™s come home but she doesnâ€™t care. I just want to feel like Iâ€™m part of my own family for once in a lifetime. I hate feeling like the black sheep. Iâ€™m sick of existing like this.
