I just wanna dieI honestly want to die, like I donâ€™t really feel anything emotionally anymore which is what I define as being alive, feeling emotions. I hate myself because of some shit Iâ€™ve done to others in my life and the guilt just constantly eats at me. I just want the guilt to end. And I know that I have friends who I could talk to but the only time others really talk to me are when Iâ€™ve said something first or when thereâ€™s a big event happening, thatâ€™s what hurts me is that Iâ€™m not a big enough priority to talk to by those who would call me their friend.
