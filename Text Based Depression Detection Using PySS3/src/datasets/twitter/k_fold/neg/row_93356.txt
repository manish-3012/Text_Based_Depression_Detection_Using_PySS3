I hate bureaucrats and I'm tired of people who know nothing other than whats on a pageI hate the fact that my entire being, my worth is determined entirely by whats on a checklist by bureaucrats. I'm a person, with dreams and worth and experiences and feelings. I'm more than what is on your checklist. I'm tired of having to fight just to get someone to acknowledge my humanity. 

I'm a person. I'm not a number or a checklist. I hate that I'm not permitted to have any dignity.
