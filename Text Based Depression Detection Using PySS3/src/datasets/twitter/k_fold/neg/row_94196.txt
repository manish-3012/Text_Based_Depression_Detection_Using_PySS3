Iâ€™m not suicidal, but I have an urge to see what its like after deathI always wonder what it would be like to die, to me, sometimes it feels like if I was to try and die  I would become some celestial being who cannot die or something. Other days I am thinking it would be stupid to ever try and die so iâ€™ll just wait until deaths door comes knocking and takes me down to the underworld. I am not scared of death, and I even think it is weird that people are even afraid to die. 

Does anyone else feel this way or am I weird?
