I (18M) feel like I'm going mad.Each day is slow, it goes by so slowly. Unless I'm enjoying it, then it speeds up, but that doesn't happen too much. If I fall asleep, I just seem to wake back up. No dreams, no nothing. And these dam thoughts. I'll be driving and the thought of  "You know, if I hit the truck, I'll probably cause a 10 car pile up and kill myself and others. ". Or I'll be at work and see someone and think "man, torturing them would be pretty fun, I wonder how they scream?". But the worse thoughts are the suicidal one. They just won't go away. In highschool, I tried to commit  suicide on 3 separate occasions. They didn't work and I'm still on this God forsaken Earth. I thought getting out of high school would help, and it did, for a few months. But this October it start declining. I broke up with my (now ex) girlfriend. I feel so alone, yet I'm surrounded by friends. We do so many things together, hell, I'm in 3 DnD campaigns with them and we are going to play some Lazer tag on Saturday, but I feel so alone. I should be in college, but I decided to take a gap year. I haven't applied anywhere and I bet it's too late anyways, looks like I'll never be a professional opera singer. Oh well. It's not like I'll live long enough to be one any ways. The only good news is that I will be going to a Therapist, once I can gather up the courage to call and make an appointment because I'm too scared to, I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that this is long, I've needed to rant for awhile now, and here seemed like a good place.
