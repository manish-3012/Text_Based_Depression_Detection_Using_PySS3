Any one else feel this?I don't usually get any replies on my posts but yeah,

do you guys ever feel like there's no point in doing anything because you're probably just going to end up killing yourself later? Like it's all just meaningless and pointless once we die. I used to have a hobby I enjoyed doing, but now i can't find motivation to keep practising because what's the point in putting in effort when I'm just going to off myself one of these days?
