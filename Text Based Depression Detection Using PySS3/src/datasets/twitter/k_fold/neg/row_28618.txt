Did wrong by her, cant live with losing her.I messed up. I visited with a girl who used to be my friend to drop off a dnd gift (I got one for everyone in my group as a sort of thank you though she left the group a long time ago) and I knew my girlfriend wouldnâ€™t like it if she knew I had met up with her (they had been on bad terms for over a year following an intense argument, partially over alleged feelings the other girl had for me at the time) so I lied. I told my girlfriend I was meeting with a different friend in the spur of the moment to preserve her feelings, and ignored a couple of texts because I didnâ€™t want to explain the situation to her. She found out. Although the other girl is in a committed relationship, I understand how it must look to my girlfriend. She is understandably mad, and I am more than mad at myself. I want to spend my life with this girl, and Iâ€™m over here fucking it up. Sheâ€™s the only thing that cheers me up anymore and I ruined it. I think a breakup is imminent, so I figure Iâ€™ll just finish things on my own terms. 

Iâ€™m not hysterical. Iâ€™m level-headed as I write this. Iâ€™ve prepared notes for my parents and my girlfriend. I think Iâ€™m going to drive out and do it with a razor tomorrow night.

Love you all,
xoxo
