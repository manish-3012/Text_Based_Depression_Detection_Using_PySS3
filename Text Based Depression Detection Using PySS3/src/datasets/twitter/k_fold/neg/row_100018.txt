Does it ever change?I started university about 10 days ago. I was happy, I met some nice people and my schedule gives me plenty of free time. After the wreck that was high school where I ended with a 76% average, no recognition other than "Success while confronting difficulties" due to mental health problems and dropping out of an 11th grade music class; I vowed to actually succeed in university. But, today, I woke up and felt like shit and cried and couldn't help feeling like I always did. So, before I even managed to complete a month of school, I already skipped a day due to feeling depressed.

Sometimes, it feels like this is all I'll ever be. I feel like the stereotypical uncle who promises to get a job but watches pornhub all day and lives in his sister's basement. I'm ambitious when I'm not depressed and I want to succeed in life but what's the point if I'm always going have to put everything on hold because I feel bad? If I have a career, how long until I end up fucking that up too? I can't take it. I don't deserve to feel this way but it's like whenever I try to make my life better, I'm reminded that this is who I'll always be. I'm tired of people telling me to stay strong and to think positive. I've been suicidal since I was 12. I didn't even get my period yet and I wanted to end my life and, you'd think I would know how to handle it by now, but I don't. I just take my covers, go in my closet and cry it all out. It's just a fucking routine and nothing in my life could convince me to stick around so I can always get fucked in the ass by something I don't control. 

I hate my life. I've always hated my life. I hate everything about me - inside and out. I have no qualities that haven't been ravaged by my depression. I have no one I'm close enough to talk to about this. I feel like I'm already dying, so what's the point? It hurts because I really did want to be something but I can't take feeling like I'm two different people: this girl who wants a future and that girl who wants to die. It's confusing and it hurts even more to constantly have my hopes shattered. I hate that I can't ever leave this hell because, with my luck, if I attempt to kill myself, I'll just end up brain damaged or paralyzed. Then I'll be the ultimate fuck up and ruin my parent's lives. 

Only people who have felt this way will understand how complicated it actually is. Robin Williams killed himself, parents kill themselves... So, for people like me, does life actually ever change for the better? I'm just so tired and nobody notices how lifeless I feel.
