Just wanted someone to knowHi. I hope whoever is reading this is having a better time than I am.

I  see a therapist for my major depression but can't afford to join university clubs etc as a graduate. I graduated in July but barely have any friends.  I had to cut out some toxic people and as a result lost some mutual friends too. Some of the connections were lost because of my own flakiness.

I barely have three close friends in Brisbane.  And my family here doesn't talk to me. I can't keep doing this; I am so lonely and sad. When I  call the suicide call back service they just tell me to do what my therapist has advised or spend time discussing my accent etc when conversations are timed at thirty minutes. If I don't go to workI can go an entire day without talking to someone. One of my close friends is leaving for a vacation and the others are pretty busy too.

Today after some chores I am planning to harm myself, not kill  myself if the self harm helps. I know loneliness is  a stupid reason but I don't see worth in my existence if it is of no help to others.
