Just lost my job.So a week after getting my job and thinking everything is ok, I got informed that i was being let go. My boss told me that they got an email saying that hours were to be cut and since i was the newest one there that I was being cut. But not the guy that was hired at the same time as me. I smell bs. So I'm half way into a fifth of whiskey and thinking more and more of just ending this bs.
