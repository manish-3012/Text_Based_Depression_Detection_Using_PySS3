I'm at an all time low... I need help, I'm considering suicideEveryone, I need help, I'm at the lowest point in my life right now, it seems all my friends hate me now. One of my closest friends recently just blocked me on what seems to be every social platform since I played a joke on him and he said he would tell my parents and not believe me. I talked to my parents about this and they offered support, but it's not helping. This person along with another have been making up lies about me and called me an "attention whore" because they think I'm faking my depression when I'm crying for help. They have physically hurt me as well. My mother has been sexist to me, she always asks me questions that could result in me being punished which aren't true, but not my sister. My mother made up I have stored porn on my phone and PC, which I don't, and told my father. My mother has thought and told people that I'm going to become a murderer when I am older. I just feel as if I can't take this anymore. I want to just be gone and have all my problems solved, I don't feel as if anyone would miss me, not my family, friends, etc. I just need some help, please...
