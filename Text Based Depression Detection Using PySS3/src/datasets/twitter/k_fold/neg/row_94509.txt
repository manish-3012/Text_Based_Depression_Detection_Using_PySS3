Spiraling againNot sure what to do, but suicidal ideation is upon me once again. Iâ€™ve been through antidepressants, not currently on them. The person who prescribed me them would give me short brief therapy sessions, although the appointments werenâ€™t as regular and it wasnâ€™t labeled as such (it was really just a refill check in).

I grew up popular, but under the hood Iâ€™ve felt rejected my whole life. When I was a kid, my parents relationship and divorce was extremely messy, my dad had a temper and constantly escalated loud fights in the house with my mom, always threatening to leave her and break the family apart until she had enough and did it herself. Because of his anger (weâ€™re on good terms), I confided in my mom since I was extremely young. Iâ€™d tell her at the age of 6 that if anything happens to her Iâ€™d find a way to kill myself. My dad picked up on this, and since the age of 6 heâ€™s guilted me, directly claiming to me that I donâ€™t love him, which may be where Iâ€™ve adopted some of my harmful patterns from. I struggled to leave for school each day, as my thoughts were consumed by what may be happening to my mom. She was the only rock that made me feel comfortable. It was unbearable separation anxiety.

I was lucky to be put into a friend group who was popular throughout school. From that, I had the privilege of attracting the attention of several amazing women, and even in these juvenile relationships I emphasized loyalty and commitment, something that always came back to bite me. I always ended up rejected, even if it was after initial acceptance. I managed to carry a few relationships to a decent length, but always it became the case that I was a burden, placing my well-being in another personsâ€™ hands. I entered college feeling like I wouldnâ€™t ever find someone to love me (cliche for that age, I know). I spent some really lonely years with myself, distanced myself from so many of the people who, in some cases, revered me in younger years (for no reason other than I offered up my empty house for parties during those late high school and early college years). They knew something had changed about me, and what changed was that I no longer believed that offering a empty duplex I was left alone in due to divorced parents + my mom seeing someone new would lead to me being loved. 

I finally met someone I fell in love with. It was at the perfect time, and we met online (but in the same city of course) because I had closed myself off socially by this point. Weâ€™ve off and on been together for years, occasionally having to break apart because I am the way I am. Sheâ€™s my best friend, one of the only people I can confide in, and sheâ€™s felt trapped by my uncontrollable tendency to place my well-being in someone elseâ€™s hands. When sheâ€™s gone, I donâ€™t eat, I donâ€™t sleep. The last time this happened, I barely held onto my job. And now itâ€™s happening again, and itâ€™s worse because sheâ€™s tired of the pattern. Sheâ€™s sick of feeling trapped. Itâ€™s so difficult because weâ€™ve been so in love and best friends to every degree, and itâ€™s going to waste because Iâ€™m a suicidal maniac when sheâ€™s away. We had talked about working towards having a healthy enough relationship where we could have a family. When we met, she had basically no relationship experience, and she never wondered about what else was out there. It made me feel so special and we did everything together. Now, she doesnâ€™t even know if she actually thinks of me as her best friend, or just someone sheâ€™s carrying through life. Itâ€™s pathetic what Iâ€™ve become, but I canâ€™t see any way to go back. When I think about it, Iâ€™ve been this way since I was 5. Add it to my lifelong list of rejection, I donâ€™t know how much longer I can take feeling unlovable. Iâ€™ve never left anyone, people only leave me. I have a life worth of examples to show. My separation anxiety with my mom never really went away, itâ€™s just that when I met this girl (my best friend) she made me feel like when my mom goes, it would be the hardest thing in the world, but that weâ€™d get me through it together. And now that sheâ€™s gone once again, my same 6-year-old kid with separation anxiety thoughts are back again. Itâ€™s exhausting, Iâ€™ve never once believed I can live without them
