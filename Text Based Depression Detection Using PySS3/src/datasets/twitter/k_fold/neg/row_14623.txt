I've lost the one person who meant everything to me. I can't feel anything anymore.Over the last two weeks, I've felt like the most pointless existence in the world. My best friend, who I trusted and cared about, who saw me at my most void and vulnerable times, who helped me through that, has been brushing me off and making it abundantly clear he doesn't want my company and/or friendship. At first it hit me really hard and then for the few days that followed, it fell off my shoulder like it was nothing big. That week I barely felt anything at all. 

Tonight I had the chance to fix whatever happened with my friend and I up, but I missed it. My friend is in a band, and in the past I've gone to every show and gig they've done. My friend loved it when I supported him. They had one on tonight, but I found out about it too late and it clashed with a work shift, therefore I couldn't go. 

I feel like I've let my friend down. I wanted so badly to go because I love supporting him. I want him to know that I still value his presence in my life even if he doesn't do the same. I feel like maybe he thinks I'm also uninterested in salvaging the friendship because I didn't go. 

His band has a gig next week, and I plan to go to that. But I'm scared about what I'll say to him tomorrow, and at the same time, a part of me just does not care and wants me to feel nothing and move on. 

Why is this my life? Why can't I keep the one person who meant the world to me close by? Why do I drive everyone away? I want to die and get this all done with.
