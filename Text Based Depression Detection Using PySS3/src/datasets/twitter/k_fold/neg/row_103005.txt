I hate myself because I'm so jealous of everyoneI'm aware I have depression so some of these thoughts may not make any sense, but I just want to describe how I feel and I feel; angry, disappointed, ashamed, and you know if I told my therapist or doctors how I feel their immediate response would be 'oh it's just your depression' but then when their are reasons underlying why I feel this way it can't just simply be symptoms of 'chemical imbalances'. I wouldn't want to die if my brain was fucked and everything around me was fine but it seems my brain is fucked and everything is fucked. 

I've just been feeling really down these last few hours, just because I saw pictures of people my age doing internships, jobs, you know those group pictures of 30-100 teens dappered up in suits and ties, making something of themselves, being part of a community. I avoid social media because of these things because I always feel ashamed when I see what's going on in other people's lives and there's literally nothing going on in mine.

I'm not sure what's holding me back from being like these people, joining ansummer internship would be good for me, maybe I'd make friends and not feel worthless but I feel to worthless to even join. I don't know how to describe this, but a different example would be I never joined a sport because I felt like it was too late like I don't have enough experience or things would go wrong  and now looking back doing tennis or whatever in 8thgrade or 9thgrade, 10th grade, or even this year probably wouldn't have been to late. Next year is definitely late though, it'd be my last year and I don't what I'd do after it's all oveI just don't know how to take the initiative because of shame. Going into an interview they'd probably how are your grades (2.6 gpa), what have you done for your community (nothing), how would people describe you (quiet and uncomfortable), can we have a phone number of a friend other than family (I don't have any), these questions or concerns they'd probably raise I wouldn't have an answer too. Worst thing that could happen is they say no and I'm on my way to go so where else but logic and emotions don't work together for me, they are in their own separate realms

I just feel so detached from society and it's my own doing
that's the end of my unfinished rant I can't go on anymore but I'm still going to post, shit posting on a suicide forum
