Medication for thoughtsHello. Iâ€™ve been having really bad intrusive suicidal thoughts even on my good days. Iâ€™ll be driving and my brain will just tell me that I should end it all. I used to be very actively suicidal but right now Iâ€™m in a good place. Regardless, the thoughts are there, intrusive, and ruining my days. And the thoughts are making suicide sound like itâ€™s an option for me, which in my brain means Iâ€™m leaning more towards taking my own life than not. This is probably a stupid question but I think itâ€™s worth asking. Is there any medication that anyoneâ€™s tried to make this shit stop? I mean, if that was the case, this reddit probably wouldnâ€™t exist. Ideally there would be some sort of easy fix pill. Is there anything that, in your experience, elevated suicidal ideation?
