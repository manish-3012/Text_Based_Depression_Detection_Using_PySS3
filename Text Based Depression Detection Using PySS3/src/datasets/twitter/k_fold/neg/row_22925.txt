Out of optionsI really don't know what to do. I've been like this once before years ago (i was 21 at the time)  and the only reason I'm alive today was looking forward to a family. Unfortunately this doesn't seem like a possibility anymore. You see I've been cheated on A LOT, in the last couple relationships I've had. I never really recovered. Each time took a little more of my trust in women. Now this trust issue has completely destroyed the relationship I was in till about two weeks ago. She's left because I'm to safe basically, I'm not exciting enough. I don't take risks. And now she wants to leave, travel the world, sleep around, and apparently become a camgirl. I've been to multiple counselors. Many have said my panic attacks that happen on a daily basis may never go away. They treat the symptoms instead of the cause. My dream of settling down, having a family, doing the job I love, all seem to impossible to even bother. Every day I sink further and further. I still live with my ex, and we still get along. All this makes it even worse. And I can't go to her for help. The last thing I want is for her to stay out of petty. I've already written my note. Idk how i will do this but I feel it is the only way to end the cycle of these panic attacks, they are 100% debilitating. I haven't touched the things I love to do in almost a year. Please, I don't want to die. What am I missing? How do I fix this? I feel like I could just snap and off myself any minute at this point.
Thank you for taking the time to read this.
