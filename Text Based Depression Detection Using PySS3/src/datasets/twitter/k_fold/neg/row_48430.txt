I'm an adult child with no hope. I can't live with myself any longer.I am 21F and I have never had a job, canâ€™t drive, and still live at home with my parents. I have some university done (online), but I am working on trying to get the last two years done also online. For the past 7 years, I have been at home online schooling off and on. I have had no friends the whole time and have not been around people my own age or really any people for the whole time. I have seen 10+ therapists and of course none of them tell me I am bad for what I am doing (or rather not doing), and my family fails to see how much of a failure and loser I am. I ask my mom over and over why she cannot see how immature and spoiled I am at almost 22, but she refuses to acknowledge that there is anything wrong with me yet she is also cold and distant to me. I don't want to see extended family because of how embarrassed I am of myself and my parents are confused as to why I feel embarrassed! I just feel stuck, but I know that is a mere excuse. But I also feel very mentally slow, like I am almost certainly stupid or mentally disabled. The only thing really stopping me from killing myself is the fear that I will do it wrong, end up in a coma, and then be even more of a burden. Every time I confront my parents, especially my mom, she tries to justify my behavior. She herself acts very entitled and sees very little flaws in herself. I donâ€™t know how or if I can get out of this. I donâ€™t know what to do. 

I posted this on another sub and some people said that I am just the typical adult child, and they're right. I can't live with the shame and I feel that I cannot change it, and I don't really want to because in my mind it's too late. I have violent thoughts that most people would find disturbing,  I throw screaming tantrums, I  take pleasure in imagining people I hate suffer and die, I'm forever anhedonic.

I'm sorry.
