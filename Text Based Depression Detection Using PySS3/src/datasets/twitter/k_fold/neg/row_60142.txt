Struggling to decide what to do.Iâ€™m a 24 year old woman who has suffered with various mental illnesses since a very young age. Iâ€™ve been abused and neglected as a child, which led to my developing borderline personality disorder, major depression, cptsd with panic attacks, bulimia, a compulsive skin picking disorder and a self harm addiction.

My current situation is complicated but to summarize I had to leave my job last fall due to a suicide attempt. After leaving the hospital I sought outpatient treatment but had to put that aside because my fiancÃ©â€™s agoraphobia advanced to the point where he can no longer leave the apartment for any reason at all. As a result neither of us is employed, and Iâ€™m working with the state and SSI to hopefully receive benefits to help us while we are both struggling mentally . I am afraid of coming off as a lazy free-loader but I genuinely am unable go function as a normal adult should.

Weâ€™re under threat of eviction and our electric being turned off. There are multiple elements to the situation that are making receiving public assistance nearly impossible for us. Iâ€™m losing my sense of hope and any desire to be alive I once had seems gone. I am afraid that I will hurt myself, but I have too many responsibilities right now to leave everything to go to the hospital. Iâ€™m not sure what to do, all I know is Iâ€™m trapped between having to stay strong and handle things for us or going away to try to get better.
