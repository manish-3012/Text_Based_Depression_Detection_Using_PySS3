I feel dead inside.[17, junior, MTF transgender, deep south]

I'm not sure what to do. I feel jealous of my peers, who can actually be comfortable in their own bodies. I don't know if I could ever trust them should I choose to come out (which I'd need to do to get better). Would they still approve of me if I was honest about who I am? I'm at the top of my class, so to them my life is perfect.

I hide my sadness under off color humor, and I can't stand it anymore. Nature screwed me over. God screwed me over. I shouldn't have been born this way. I'll never pass, even if I did get on hormones soon.

I can't come out at home. My siblings and parents routinely make insulting jokes about transgender people. I don't want to be a freak to them. Right now I'm the golden child. If I were to come out I'd lose that.

Every afternoon, I rest on my bed just trying to get the courage to decide if I can do it. I can't look in the mirror some days. My *face* isn't mine. My *body* isn't mine. And I can't fix it. 

I look around, and know that I'm probably going to be alone. I don't see any redeeming factors in myself. I'll never be able to be complete.

I've started getting enraged at the environmentalists. The nature worshippers. I can't process how anyone could love the nature that has cursed me. The nature that has killed me. But I want to understand. 

If you read through that, thanks. It means a lot. I'm going to go to bed after posting this. Tomorrow, I'll put on my mask and go to school. And I'll envy my classmates, who are proper. Who haven't been screwed over by nature, by god. And I'll probably sink deeper.  At least it was nice to get this off of my chest, to let someone see this.
