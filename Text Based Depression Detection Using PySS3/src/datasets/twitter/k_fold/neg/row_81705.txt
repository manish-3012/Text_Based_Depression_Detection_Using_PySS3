All I want is for everyone to let me die alreadySeriously, I canâ€™t stand living anymore. Iâ€™m weak and I canâ€™t do it, why do I have to justify myself any further?

I know suicide is selfish and everyone ALWAYS says that but that info doesnâ€™t even mean anything. It just makes me feel bad for being â€œselfishâ€ which makes me more suicidal. I can slowly drift away from everyone if I want to and thatâ€™s actually fine as long as I seem like Iâ€™m okay. Itâ€™s okay to be a loner.

BUT if I just off myself suddenly itâ€™s a big deal. No one actually cares unless youâ€™re dead. No one actually cares and then they mourn when you die or whatever. But they didnâ€™t fucking mourn or even fucking help me when I was alive so what the HELL do you want me to do. If Iâ€™m depressed then no one cares. But if I kill myself suddenly everyone is going to care. 

Even if I seek help (dw am going to a psychiatrist) or let my feelings out people are just going to think Iâ€™m annoying. So I keep it in and then kill myself and then suddenly itâ€™s not okay?

People just say that suicide is selfish but the question is do they even try to help the people around them who are suicidal? Because if they donâ€™t, then they are the ones who are selfish, right?

All I know is Iâ€™m annoying everyone by being like this. I donâ€™t actually make a difference to anyoneâ€™s life but when Iâ€™m missing thereâ€™s a difference apparently. 
And itâ€™s because we all need each other, but thatâ€™s not really true. We just need each otherâ€™s company. Thatâ€™s it. Like i can just get replaced and boom problem solved. 

The amount of friends Iâ€™ve drifted from is insane. They donâ€™t care about it.. They are functioning without me. But if Iâ€™m not on this earth there is NO difference because they were not talking to me anyway. They can function without me. Itâ€™s not hard.

People only care because death is â€œtragic.â€ Let let me die, seriously.
