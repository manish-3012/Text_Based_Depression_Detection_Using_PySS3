I don't want to be an "attempt"Just read an article with the statistics for suicide attempts vs. completed suicides (1 in 30 apparently). Holy fuck. That's why I always fail to go through with it, the idea of what would happen to me and my body if I didn't succeed. Not good.

Of course there are ways to make absolutely sure that you'll die, but those are often pretty brutal and traumatic for other people.

I really don't want to be a "survivor".
