By the end of next week I hope to be goneI can't function as a person and I have no future. In the past I've come so close but backed out, but this time will be different. I'll either die of the overdose or from a destroyed liver. Either way will do, I just want out. I can't do this anymore. Goodbye and thank you all for your past help.
