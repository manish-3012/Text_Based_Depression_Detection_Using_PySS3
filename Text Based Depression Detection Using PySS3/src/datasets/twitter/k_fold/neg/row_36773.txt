I'm not sure what to do at this point.I keep falling back into the same patterns of addiction, depression and all the shit that comes with it,  the one thing that keeps me from going completely psycho is music, I guess that's how I've made it through one and a half semesters in college somehow and work. It's been losing its luster though I suppose. It was one of the only things I had left. I had a guy I was chatting with here from this sub, I'm pretty sure he took his life like I was planning to do, it was sobering in a way I guess. Realizing just how fragile life really can be and how quick it can be gone, not a day goes by where I don't blame myself for it. He was making plans to move to FL to help a friend out with a restaurant. He originally wanted to move to Hawaii but his friend took presidence and I didn't get a message from him since late last year I've more or less given up on the possibility of hearing back from him. I dunno it's just all I can do to barely make it through the day and then stay up til 4 because everything haunts me, then get 4 hours of sleep waking up at 8 nearly every day. I've tried everything from sleeping pills to completely cutting caffeine out nothing works, it's just really starting to weight down on me more and more and more. Maybe this is a goodbye or maybe a hello to someone who needs help and advice more than I do, I can't tell.
