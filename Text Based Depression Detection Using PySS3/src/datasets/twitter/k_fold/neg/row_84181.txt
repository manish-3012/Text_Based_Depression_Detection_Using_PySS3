Iâ€™m giving up and Iâ€™m scared2017 was nothing but miserable for me. Ever since may Iâ€™ve struggled with suicidal thoughts and it doesnâ€™t help that Iâ€™ve lost many people close to me this year...my cousin, my bestest friend, and even my grandfather nearly died this year. Iâ€™m so scared. I feel like the only thing thatâ€™s keeping me alive is my girlfriend but I donâ€™t know how long I can stay strong for her. I thought the new year would be better and that Iâ€™d finally be over it all...but Iâ€™m not...and itâ€™s worse.
