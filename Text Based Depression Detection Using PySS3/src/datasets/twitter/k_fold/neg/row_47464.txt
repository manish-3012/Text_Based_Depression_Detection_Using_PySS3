Not doing so wellJust found out my boyfriend has been cheating on me. And just fighting with me so he can leave to be with someone else while I just sit in this apartment all day all night. Just me and our 8 month old son. I freaking nurse exclusively. And just found out today. Motherâ€™s Day. Fuckkk.    I have been bashing my head against the wall for 2 years. Now Iâ€™m 2 weeks late on rent. With no job no babysitter no car.  I donâ€™t even know where to begin right now. Iâ€™ve been so mentally beat down the past two years.  I donâ€™t have a single person in this world to carry a conversation with right now. I donâ€™t want to die.  But omg I just want to die right now. He literally left us on monthersday.   Iâ€™ve been clean from drugs for 2 years solid. I donâ€™t cheat or have secrets. I cut his hair and clip his nails.  Why did this happen to me. I want to die
