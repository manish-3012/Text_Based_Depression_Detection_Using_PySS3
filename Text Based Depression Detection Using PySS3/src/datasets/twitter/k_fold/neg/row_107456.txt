im young but it doesnâ€™t matteri am 15 (m) and i absolutely hate myself. i wake up every morning feeling like pure shit and itâ€™s every single day.  i donâ€™t know when this started but itâ€™s been a while , i just hate everything about me , im not that good at anything and im dumb too, i probably wonâ€™t get anywhere in life and itâ€™s hard to realize that because i really want to be someone or do something great but itâ€™s too late. i also hate how i look , i have a good amount of acne and discolorations on my face which make me really insecure but no one seems to understand. i tried talking to my parents about it but they just technically say to man up because thatâ€™s only how girls are supposed to feel which i mean i guess i agree but wow it just makes me feel super insecure. school isnâ€™t so great either, the kids there are always mean and try to one up you on everything for some reason so most of the time i am just alone, i have a few friends but they donâ€™t really care about me. my life in general sucks so much that it hurts me physically , it hurts my heart. my family kinda cares about me. im sorry i just really needed to get out how im feeling right now. thank you if you read all of it.
