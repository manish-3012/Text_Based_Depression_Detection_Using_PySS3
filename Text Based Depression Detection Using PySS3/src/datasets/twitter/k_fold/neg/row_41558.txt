I've lost everything.I was on top of the world for most people my age. Making nearly six figures a year, putting five in my 401k for several years. I had nearly 100k saved up.

Heroin became my vice, and eventually my undoing. I went to treatment and all the recovery shit. As therapeutic as it was, it was all for naught. After fighting to get my family back I had them back after a year.

Things wouldn't last long, because a few months later the past kept coming up over and over. My significant other and three children decided they cannot handle having me in their life because of the memories. They left me, those that were my world.

While I had them back, I had lost my job towards the end. The plant closed down, so I had a fraction of my income due to unemployment. I was fortunate enough to get it, and the money was more than enough to get by. It, unfortunately, has just ran out as they left. Or rather, I left.

You see I was kicked out by my family for the above mentioned reasons at the same time. So I am now homeless, jobless, moneyless, and without a family.

I've lost everything, par a buddy that has a couch I can crash on. I have lost everything, at first because of myself, and then because my significant other milking the rest from me. I closed out my savings and 401 to help her get by during my treatment.

I am now here left with nothing. Nothing to my name,  nobody that loves me, no purpose. The only thing I have remaining is my sobriety and I feel that slipping. I wish I was dead, and I'm trying to figure out the cleanest way to do it, as I've run out of support. My life needs to end. I can no longer afford daily luxuries, and am trying to move across the county to some of my family. I really don't think I can make it.

Thanks for reading my pathetic story.
