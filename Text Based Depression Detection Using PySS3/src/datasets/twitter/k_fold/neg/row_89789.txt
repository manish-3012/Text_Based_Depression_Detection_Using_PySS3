Why do I constantly have these thoughts playing out in my head?Why do I always have thoughts of people criticizing me because of things in the past and making me really angry? I get extremely angry because of thoughts playing out in my head of people criticizing me and talking down to me and me getting really angry at them and I'm not gonna be able to take it anymore. I want to die so I can get rid of all these people who have hurt me emotionally.
