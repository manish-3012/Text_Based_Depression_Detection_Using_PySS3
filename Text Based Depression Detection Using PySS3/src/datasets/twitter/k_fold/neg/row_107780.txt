Suicildal after ending a toxic relationshipFacts:
-I was called a cripple by my exâ€™s parents for being diabetic
-my ex abandoned me when I needed help more than 5 times and I forgave him
-my ex cheated on me and I forgave him
-my ex told me several times heâ€™s not crazy over me and I forgave him

However, it scarred me. I ended things because I didnâ€™t want to stay next to people who think Iâ€™m worthless. He didnâ€™t even bother to fight for me.

And all these experiences have lowered my self esteem so much that I canâ€™t feel good about anything about myself. I used to be happy and cheerful and make everyone laugh, now I canâ€™t even remember what drove me to be that way. I feel like a failure no matter how simple the task is that Iâ€™m doing. 

Iâ€™m planning on ending my life in the following weekend
