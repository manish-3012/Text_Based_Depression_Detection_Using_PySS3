A little story    Hey. Iâ€™m not trying to get pity or anything like that. Iâ€™ve already made my decision and chose what I want to do in the next week or 2. I just wanna see if I can make anyone else feel maybe just a little bit better about themselves. 

    Basically when I was a kid I was extremely enthusiastic and loved life much like any other kid I guess. Shit took a drastic change after I got in like 1st or 2nd grade. I was bigger than a lot of the kids. My dad was an amazing cook and I was always eating. I was bullied every. Single. Day. About my weight and how I looked. The funny thing is...the people bullying me were my friends. I hung out with them outside of school and shit like that. Every single moment I was with them they were making fun of me and shit. I was their verbal punching bag. They all had pretty bad family problems. (Didnâ€™t know that till I was a bit older.) Anyways, that went on for a pretty long time. All of elementary school, actually. It never really got to me though. Yeah, it hurt but I just always thought of it as a joke because idk. I wasnâ€™t really a person who took shit to heart back then. I genuinely loved life. So going into middle school...I made new friends. I was always the funny one people went to when they were feeling down, etc. After that, I started making fun of myself to make other people laugh. I became extremely popular throughout my town or whatever. I was attractive, funny, and had a lot of friends. The thing is...I tried so hard to make other people happy. I never EVER thought about myself now that I think of it. My â€œbest friendsâ€ continued to make fun of me...how I looked, how I ate, literally every possible aspect of my life. It was mostly only one of them, the other 2 I could actually call my best friends. Idk. Back to the point. On to high school. Freshman year, I started to think about myself and thought â€œwhat do I want? I started being rude as fuck to everyone. Teachers, my â€œfriendsâ€...anyone who said shit about me or pissed me off I guess. Thatâ€™s basically when I realized I was depressed as fuck from all this shit Iâ€™ve been putting up with since fucking elementary school. I also have OCD. I remember having symptoms since I can even remember. So Iâ€™ve been dealing with that too. Anyways...I made even more friends, and lost all the old ones. I was a jock, played football...shit like that. After I stopped taking peopleâ€™s shit I started getting into drugs, fighting, and doing anything illegal I could possibly think of. Anyways, Onto about sophomore/junior year I dropped out. I hated school &amp; everything about it. I had a job or whatever (still work there today) and I was fine with my decision because I honestly fucking hated school. (At the time) and couldnâ€™t give a fuck about anyone there. I stopped talking to literally everyone except for probably 1 person. Thatâ€™s when the depression, anxiety, and ocd took over my life. I hated everything. I hated my life. All I would do was sit in bed, watch Netflix, listen to music, and go to work. Literally. Every fucking day. I never saw my family, (except my parents and siblings...) never went out, never did shit. I was basically rotting in my bed. After my family saw the shit I was going through I was hospitalized twice in a psych hospital and went to therapy, got on medication, and everything was still the same. The only times I got up was to go to mcdonaldâ€™s, smoke, or go to the bathroom or whatever. Like I was talking about earlier...I was a big kid. I had a lot of extra weight but at this point I was a stick. Idk how, Probably just my metabolism. Anyways fast forward to now. Itâ€™s still the same. Never got my ged. Still have the same fast food job. Iâ€™m 21...I dropped out when I was 16. 5 years of the same shit. When I was a kid I had so many dreams...I wanted to be so many things. I always talked to my friends in middle school about going to college, graduating, and how our lives would be after school. Itâ€™s crazy to think I would end up here. If you wanna know how severe/fucked up my OCD is, look at my other post. I canâ€™t even bear talking about that shit again. My life is shit. Thereâ€™s nothing ANYONE can say to make me feel better about myself. Thereâ€™s nothing ANYONE can say to make me wanna live. Iâ€™m the definition of a trashy ass mother fucker with no life and thereâ€™s nothing anyone can say to change my mind. Shit...if anyoneâ€™s even reading this theyâ€™re probably thinking â€œwhy hasnâ€™t he killed himself yetâ€ i donâ€™t even fucking know. This will probably be my last post. I donâ€™t deserve happiness. I donâ€™t deserve anything tbh. Whenever i think of myself doing something fun or something good for myself i cringe. Whenever i eat i hate myself, because i feel like someone else more deserving could be eating that instead of fucking ME. I literally lose 5-10 pounds a month. (If you wanna know why, again, go to my recent OCD related post. As Iâ€™m sitting here Iâ€™m actually planning when Iâ€™m going to â€œcatch the busâ€. Iâ€™ve planned this about a thousand times but never really thought of when i was going to do it. Iâ€™m sure now. If this post made anyone else feel better...well Iâ€™m actually glad. I hope someone read this and was like â€œdamn my life actually isnâ€™t that badâ€. Or something like that. Well, thatâ€™s really it. Bye everyone.
