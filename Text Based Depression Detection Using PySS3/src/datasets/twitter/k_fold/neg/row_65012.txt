I'm a loser and a creep.Note: I'm a bit drunk, so you might have to guess at what I mean if I mistype something.

I hate myself and I have for years. I have no friends and most of the time I'm too afraid to even talk to people. I make physical contact with another human only a few times per year. I have no pets. I doubt anyone would really notice if I just disappeared forever.

I can't even trust myself when it comes to who I try to make a part of my life. I run away from positive people, but abusive people are the only ones my gut feels like are the right. If I step back and look, I can see all the ways I fuck up my own life, but if I trust the way I feel, I end up in a horrible situation.

I have so much love to give, but I always misplace it. I can't even find myself hating a villian, but I find myself aso easy to a resent.

Sorry if this is rambly, I'm weeping and I'm incoherent.

I just wish I had someone to hold me, someone to make me feel not so alone. I haven't been hugged in years. The only people that have touched my flesh in years are medical professionals.

Everyone I've ever truly loved and trusted has abandoned me. Some of them have even told me they ever regret talking to me.

I just want to die. I'm a waste of resources. Although I seem like I have so much potential, I'm so self destructive that I only end up destroying the things I care about the most. I'm the kind of person that could do so much good, if I wasn't so broken.

Fuck me.
