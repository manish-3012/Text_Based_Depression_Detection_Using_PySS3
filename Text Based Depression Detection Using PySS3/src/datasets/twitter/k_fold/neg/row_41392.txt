I have devloped an weird habit, i carry boxcutter in my pocket 24/7! Doing it for past 2 weeks.I have developed a weird habit of carrying box cutter in my pocket. Yesterday, while sleeping my brother noticed  boxcutter in my pocket. 
I even Carry it inside washrooms, while studying!
I am a dumb guy who is going to appear for law entrance in 13 days. I know even if I put millions of hours I won't get into a top law school. I scored 60/150 on mocks despite working for 5 months due to my stupid brain. For every failed mock I cut myself 3 times. I am torturing myself and  stupid brain. I deserve it! 
I would go into a top law school by cracking this upcoming exam or just die! There is no second option, no more motivation of trying something diffrent! It's over!  
If I can't crack this exams by getting 120 plus I will  be a failure in future. Box cutter will automatically do the the thing by going deeply in my throat. It's my last option. It's a test of my life my exeistence. If I don't score well it will tell me two things
1. For me, hard work doesn't matter, it's a propoganda by high IQ people to appear normal. Some people just lack intellect to do anything. they are idiots.
2. I should kill myself to avoid the reality of being poor, miserable in the future. 
Get into a top law school or box cutter to my throat! Nothing can change that!
No amount of advice can change me. I am tired of failing in everything, it's the last time I will fail. I will just die! Hahaha!
   If I don't get into a top law school, then I am hopeless idiot who can't die and is doomed to be a failure. No amount of hardwork can help me!
Only a boxcutter can! Fuck my life and my parents whom I inherited stupid genes from!
