Thinking about TuesdayMy birthday and also a night where most of my family will be preoccupied and asleep early. Maybe make them think Iâ€™m gone for the night and do it. Itâ€™ll be a huge relief, Iâ€™ve been thinking about it for so long it only feels right. I hope I donâ€™t fail. I donâ€™t want the â€œdonâ€™t do thisâ€, speech Iâ€™ve been a member for a while, I know the drill. Iâ€™m thankful but itâ€™s worthless , im a brick wall. Iâ€™ve done the â€œspeechâ€ to myself a million times. Iâ€™m in all honesty exhausted. Thank yâ€™all for listening.
