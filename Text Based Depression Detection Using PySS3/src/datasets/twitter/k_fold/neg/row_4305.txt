Iâ€™m on the verge.Iâ€™m 20, female and I donâ€™t care for anything. The reason being how spiteful and aggressive I have become  towards anyone. I used to be a shy, well educated kid with friends well basically a normal life then I just started getting disappointed over and over to where I am now. I hate being touched, hate being around people and I will lash at anyone that tries to annoy me. 
This sadness that was dwelling inside me has turned into anger and I canâ€™t stand it. My parents constantly compare me to my sis how sheâ€™s always studying and having good grades and I have nothing to brag about. Very mediocre grades, no hobbies, Iâ€™ve been called beautiful several times but thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s all I have, looks.. what a mess. At this point Iâ€™m not even mad about it anymore I just laugh to myself and ignore it but Iâ€™m absolutely sick of everything.
I donâ€™t care about anything, friendships, relationships, school, etc. My dog died, he was my only friend that didnâ€™t mock me or insult me and now I have nothing again. I donâ€™t care if I hurt or destroy my family. I want to be selfish. I wasnâ€™t meant to be born cause clearly the world needs capable, functioning, contributing human beings and I am not one of them therefore Iâ€™m not needed. I hate everything so much if I had a rope in front of me right now Iâ€™ll happily end myself ASAP. fuck this
