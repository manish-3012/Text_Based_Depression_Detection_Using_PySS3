This is my first time reaching out. Help!I donâ€™t know how it will happen, but if something does not change soon, it will happen.  I have put up with people for far too long.  I was accused today of making a disparaging remark towards hiring someone.  I would never say anything like that.  I felt angry that the question would even be asked of me.  My client barely talks to me, only if no one else is around.  He is always talking to my boss.  They are like two peas in a pod.  No matter what I do, it is never good enough for anyone at work.  It is always go do this; go do that.  He never does anything!  My boss  is either talking with our client about non-work related items or doing personal things on the computer. A co-worker and I have run the account before, and we did a phenomenal job.  We were even recognized by our upper management.
I have been placed through numerous hoops and hurdles lately.  I was placed on a performance improvement plan that I did not deserve.  I complied with every aspect of the requirements to get off of the plan.  There were supposed to be weekly meetings with my boss to discuss my performance improvement.  This was not completed.  I had to ask himwhat the status was, and he would always say that we would talk about it later.  We never did.  I did not get off of the plan until late January, when it should have been early December.
I have applied for new jobs inside and outside of my current company for months, but nothing has ever come of it.
I am mentally broken.  I have been taken advantage of at work by numerous people.  I have been lied to, lied about, and thrown under the bus too many times.  
My wife has been there every step of the way.  She has been my supporter through the whole thing, even when I tried to push her away so she would not have to be with the wreck that I am.
My mind, my body, and my spirit are all tired.  I do not enjoy doing anything anymore.
