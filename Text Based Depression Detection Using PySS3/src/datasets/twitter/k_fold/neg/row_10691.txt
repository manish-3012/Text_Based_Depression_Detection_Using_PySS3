gone before 2021I used to feel important, useful and needed and now I feel like everyone has found another way to get the validation I was giving them. I donâ€™t feel important or needed by anyone. I donâ€™t know who I am without these people, Iâ€™m nothing just by myself. I have a feeling 2021 will be filled with losses the way 2020 was and Iâ€™ve been barely holding on now, I donâ€™t know if I can take anymore losses. Itâ€™s going to hit me too hard. I just want to die already.
