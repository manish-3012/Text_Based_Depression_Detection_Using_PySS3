Itâ€™s getting too much.Iâ€™ve been fighting with my husband. My in-laws hate me. Thereâ€™s so much family drama. I am not the best mama to my kids. If Iâ€™m not doing laundry or household, I spend my days in bed. I donâ€™t even cook and I barely eat.  
I know Iâ€™m severely depressed but right now I wonder if I should check myself at the hospital. Spend some time at the psych ward far from anything and anyone. I need a break from real life, itâ€™s getting too much. I started cutting again and I want to stop before my bad thoughts take me too far.
