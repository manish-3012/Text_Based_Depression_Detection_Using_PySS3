I havenâ€™t had anyone to talk to for years, just thought Iâ€™d vent a little for the first time in forever.I guess the title is a bit misleading; in literal terms, I have tons of people to talk to. I have a therapist, a fianceÃ©, parents, a sister, friends...but no one can do anything to help. Even if I were to talk to them, it wouldnâ€™t mean a thing because vent doesnâ€™t make me feel better at this point. All it does is scare them, and I donâ€™t want to put them through that.

Iâ€™ve been lying to everyone for so long. I keep acting like Iâ€™m getting better so I donâ€™t disappoint or scare anyone. I donâ€™t know how to drop the act. I donâ€™t want to go back to the hospital. It wonâ€™t help.

I used to self harm badly, and only stopped so they wouldnâ€™t know how I actually feel. I used to have a severe eating disorder that to this day no one knows happened. I used to have a â€˜depressedâ€™ Instagram account with over 3k subscribers where I would post sick photos of my weight loss and self harm. I lost a lot of friends when it got deleted.

I vent in a bloody notebook no oneâ€™s seen, and in Tumblr drafts Iâ€™ll never post. Itâ€™s so lonely when I know no one will reply and that itâ€™s really just my own fault.

I canâ€™t get a job. My anxiety is so bad itâ€™s hard to even put in applications, and when I do, I can never bring myself to make a follow up call. I have Touretteâ€™s, and Iâ€™m convinced no one will hire me because theyâ€™re off-putting. I always wanted to go study abroad in Japan and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be able to because Iâ€™m transgender and canâ€™t go off my hormones.

Iâ€™ve never told anyone that I hear things. That Iâ€™m paranoid Iâ€™m being watched. I lie and say Iâ€™m taking my meds because no matter how hard I try, I canâ€™t remember to take them every day, and all anyone ever tells me is to â€œset phone remindersâ€ or leave them where youâ€™ll see themâ€. That doesnâ€™t help. They just look disappointed when I say it doesnâ€™t.

Thereâ€™s nothing here for me. 

I only stay because of my fianceÃ© and my best friend, but when Iâ€™m away from them, it hurts so much. I donâ€™t want to force them to be with me all the time, thatâ€™s not right, but when Iâ€™m alone, it feels like the universe is so much bigger than Iâ€™ll ever be.

If I had the supplies to suffocate myself with gas I probably would. I donâ€™t want a dramatic death, I just want to go peacefully, to wherever is next. Anywhere has to be better than this place that works so hard to tell me that who I am as a person is wrong, that Iâ€™m worthless if I canâ€™t properly contribute to society.

Advice doesnâ€™t help me anymore, and I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m looking for, which is why Iâ€™ve avoided saying anything. I donâ€™t want to use anyone as a punching bag. Itâ€™s been done to me and that sucks.

I guess itâ€™s comforting seeing so many people here that feel the way I do.

I wish I had gone through with it before, before I got to know my fianceÃ©. 

I wish I could take them with me and we could go somewhere nicer.
