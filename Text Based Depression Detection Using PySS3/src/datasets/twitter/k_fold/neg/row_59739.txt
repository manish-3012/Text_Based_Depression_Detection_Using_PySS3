I'm going to kill myself on my birthdayJuly 26, 2019. If things don't turn around for me, and I suspect they won't, I'm going to hang myself with my Calvin Klein belt by tightening it to the point where I can no longer breathe. I think this is a reasonable timeframe to give myself opportunities to self-improve and if I can't, then I think it's reasonable to end it after 11 years of suffering.
