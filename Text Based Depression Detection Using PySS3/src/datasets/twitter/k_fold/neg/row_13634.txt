Was recently diagnosed as a diabeticI was diagnosed as a diabetic on 10/10/2018 on my dad's birthday, and ever since then i have been falling deeper and deeper into a well of depression and I feel like i might genuinely kill myself. I mainly think this because i just feel hopeless and useless, I feel like i am a burden to my family and friends. I can't go out and enjoy myself with them, i can't do anything without having the thought of me possibly going into some kind of diabetic shock or hyperglycemia, i haven't stopped crying each night since then. I'm too afraid to share this part of my thoughts with anyone in my life because i don't want them to worry even more about me, I'm already waste of space anyway..
