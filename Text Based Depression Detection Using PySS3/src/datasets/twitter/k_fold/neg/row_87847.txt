Don't know if I can keep being aliveThere isn't  anything particularly bad in my life. My dad is a narcissists, I'm  19F and unsure of what I want to study. None of that matters anymore I just want to stop being  alive. I wish I could discuss it with someone  but everyone  will just say not to but I feel SO tired. I'm  not even sick of myself just tired of being alive and the pills are not helping at all.
