Missed Rent Today they are calling for rent and I felt so sick to myself lying to saying the payment will be in by the end of today... It wont be until friday :/ i hope .Â  I missed my phone payment, credit card, car...Im trying to hard to get a job. Im so desperate Ill take anything.Â  I will scrub floors or even watch kids.Â  I tried talking to my husband about webcam "modeling" but he just states "you're mine you can't do that". How are we supposed to come up with quick money? Hes stubborn.Â  He doesn't like shopping at aldi, distains walmart because of the "people".Â  He has these social boundaries that he won't even try to save money. In fact he wants me to come up with how to save with how we are currently living and not be in the red.Â  Ive begged him to continue looking for a better paying job...but it isnt until we are at the point of borrowing money from his/mine parents is when he actually tries.Â  I hate this so much.Â  I hate that I am too sad and depressed to function.Â  I hate that I have no job for so long.Â  I hate struggling.Â  I hate lying.Â  I hate all of this.Â  Our kids are so innocent they don't deserve this. I just think this is good if I just do it so they can have a home at least.  I
