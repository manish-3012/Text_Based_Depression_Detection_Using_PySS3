I want to give upI'm a burden to literally everyone in my life. Everyone would be better off without me. 

My mental health is fucked. It always has been. It's so fucking tiring struggling through every single day and making progress little by little just to fucking break down again. 

I'm so disappointed in myself. I'm ashamed. I hate myself. I wish I wasn't here to witness how much of a fuck up I am and see everyone around me either trying to help me at their detriment or hating me. 

Last time I almost killed myself was 6 years ago, and I didn't because I lived alone and my cat needed me. 

Tonight I know my cat lives with me and my boyfriend, and both of them probably prefer each others company to mine. 

No one needs me. No one's life is improved by me being in it. 

After 6 years I have self harmed tonight. I want to end it. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm such a shitty person I'm not worth it.
