I can't live with the shame (TW: child abuse, sexual assault)Stuff has started coming back from my childhood and I realised I am a rapist. When I was 7 I told my sister to go down on me, I told her to do it one more time when she said she didn't like it. I didn't know what the fuck I was doing, I knew nothing about sex or things like that. I'm also female and autistic, I didn't know how wrong it was but I felt extremely guilty afterwards. My sister was about 4/5 she's 17 now, I'm hoping she's forgotten and it doesn't affect her. I don't think I can live with all this shame it's a disgusting thing to do, it makes me feel physically sick and I don't know how to move past it.
