I'm a cowardI am nothing to no one, but I am clever and resourceful. I've wanted to end my life for years. I've driven to the place I want to die on multiple occasion, with my gun ready to go. But I've never had the balls to actually do it. I thought I had it figured out. "All I need to do is practice" I thought. The idea was to go home and and put the gun in my mouth while it was unloaded, and just practice pulling the trigger. I feel like this will build muscle memory so that I could do it almost reflexively when the time came. 

Sometimes I feel hope, and I think that I can fix myself. Other times I know that there is no hope, and that I am a fool for thinking otherwise. This week has been full of days like the latter. Today was a new low. I usually have no problem maintaining a persona that will keep people from suspecting what my mental state actually is, but today I found myself almost breaking down into tears at work. I realized during my walk out of the building today that the best part of my day had ended. I hate my job. The only thing worse than working, is being at home. I was full of dread thinking about going home to sit in the dark and cry until I go to bed and repeat the cycle tomorrow. 

Whenever, I feel myself being overwhelmed, I try to compartmentalize my feelings by coming up with some sort of plan of action. I am in no sort of mental place right now to believe that there is hope. So there will be no positive planning today. However, I am absolutely in the right state of mind to renew my commitment to end it all. So that was the plan today. Go home and practice my trigger pulls. I went home, smoked a cigarette, hated myself for doing it, and then grabbed the gun. I sat on my bed, with the barrel in my mouth, and tried to make myself pull the trigger. Even with the gun unloaded, I still couldn't do it. I don't want to die. I want to be okay. But that is impossible. I don't know how much worse things will have to get before I can accept that.
