Started having deeply suicidal thoughts after doing really poorly on an exam todaySome background information, I've been in college for a few years, for the first few years I was studying computer science but it was too difficult and I hated it. I was extremely depressed and occasionally suicidal. I decided to switch to business, where I've been happier for a a few months but still under a lot of stress and depressed. 

But today I had an exam in a statistics class that I'm pretty sure I did poorly on (probably got a D or an F) and now I just feel terrible. I studied hard and knew the material (and even talked to the professor about the exam afterwords and even she agreed that I know the material), but I just suck at problem solving and dealing with things in a timely manner. I know it's just one exam but I feel like it's emblematic of a much larger problem that I've known about for years now. When I'm spending 60-80 hours a week on studying and still performing below par there's a problem. I have trouble learning things, I have trouble understanding complex problems, and I have trouble getting anything done within a time limit. I feel like I'll never be able to get a job that allows me to support myself, because I don't and will never have skills that are valuable enough to an employer. I also feel like I might never even graduate, which is embarrassing considering my parents are paying for college.  No matter how many tutors or office hours I go to nothing will ever fix this problem. I just have to wonder what the point is if I'll never be able to support myself financially even with all of the advantages I have in life.
