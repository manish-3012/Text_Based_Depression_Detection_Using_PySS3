I hate how iâ€™m going to ruin my family when i do itI have no reason to fight anymore, i wake up and just try to distract myself everyday from my life and itâ€™s killing me. My mom has cancer and is crippled, my sister is seriously depressed and my dad is the only good person in my life. I know iâ€™m going to live a bad life. work at a job i hate, not making any friends because i suck at socializing, iâ€™ll never find someone to love me because i hate myself. i try to improve myself but all it takes is one bad day and iâ€™m back to square one.

Iâ€™m going to do it, probably before 2020 is over. im tired of losing an un-winnable battle, im tired of waking up everyday to my life. itâ€™s so sad because i see so much potential in myself if i try but... i just donâ€™t see the point. everything is so hard, i honestly just give up. iâ€™m killing myself because im too lazy to fix my life, and honestly i get relief thinking that. i hate that this will destroy my family, but im tired of existing for them. i hope theyâ€™ll forgive me, but everyday since i was 15 has been pain. im so alone and will be alone for the rest of my life. im sorry.
