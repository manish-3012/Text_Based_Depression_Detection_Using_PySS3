This sub saved me so many times, thank you guys and Iâ€™m so sorry for failingThis time thereâ€™s not notes or goodbyes, I told to the couple of friends I have how much I loved them and thanked them saying I was doing well. 
After months trying to fight this Iâ€™m going to kill myself, itâ€™s too much. 
This is the last place left to say goodbye, thanks to everyone who ever had time for me to vent and stopped me, Reddit been my companion for a long time and you guys gave me hope that thereâ€™s good people around, if you are as bad as me, think and talk a lot even if itâ€™s only here on Reddit, it might give you another day in the world. Anyway I wish the best to all of you. 
With love,
