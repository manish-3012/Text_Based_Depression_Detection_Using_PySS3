i'm turning into my parentsI'm suicidal because I look at my life, the choices I've made, the neuroses that made those choices feel unavoidable, the opportunities I've messed up and I am deeply ashamed and embarrassed. I am ridiculously self destructive and I see myself doing the wrong things, but I don't stop. I think about my parents who throughout my life made choices that confused the fuck out of me, and they never owned up to it, always stood firm in their shit. Never wanting to admit when they had clearly fucked up. I feel like I'm there. I continue to mess things up, and I don't stop. Chaos is all I know, and it feels so safe here. The other day I was feeling numb and I thought to myself that I actually like being on the verge of homelessness/scared out of my mind/depressed because it usually makes me feel something; happiness and security feel like an illusion; they're crazy unstable. What's scary is that typing that out, I know it's true. But that doesn't mean I'm better off the way I am, right?
