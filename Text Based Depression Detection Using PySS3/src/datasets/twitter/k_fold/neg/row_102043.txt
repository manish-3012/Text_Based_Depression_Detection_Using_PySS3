I think it's time to end jtI have literally nothing to live for my life is 99 percent shit with 0 good. 

I'm balding like fucking crazy and my hair was the only reason I had anything. I had literally 0 but I at least banged 2-3 hot chicks in high school. On top of that I'm fat as fuck and covered in stretch marks even though I starve myself non stop. My parents are poor like I mean the poorest of the poor like people deep in the Congo of Africa should be sending me money. 

My whole house is a 400 year old piece of shit so full of mold and mildew I literally can't even go upstairs because when the sun beats on my windows all I smell is a musty burning plastic smell so strong I can't even breathe properly. This is causing my body to fail and I'm already disabled beyond belief (I get headaches every single day, always sick to my stomach like literally every day I have to vomit, I have 0 energy like the bags under my eyes are so big and black that should be raping someone in a prison shower. 

All I want to do is fuckijg die. Every single day I fantasize about buying a shotgun and just ending it. And why shouldn't I? I have no friends the people I talk to bully me and treat me like shit. I live in a rural area which is worse fate than being in a concentration camp. I literally haven't talked to a girl in years and I'm just getting fatter and balder.
