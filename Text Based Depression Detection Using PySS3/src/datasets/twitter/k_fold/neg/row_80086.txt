i am not safe but i have no money if i survivei've been to countless mental facilities after either reporting that im not safe or doing a suicide attempt. it costs money. im struggling and i cant do any of this shit anymore. im so stressed out and i can't. i have enough money to get a place but none to truly afford it. i cant afford those medical facilities. i am not safe at all -- i have a plan. im just gonna sleep on it.

please dont even persuade me to call the ambulance and that "it's worth it" because im still in medical debt after last time. still. and it's been a year.
