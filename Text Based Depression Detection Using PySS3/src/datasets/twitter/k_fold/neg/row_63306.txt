Why should i stay alive if nothing is fun anymore and ill never find loveNobody has had a good answer for this, so far, just to change yourself or get on antidepressants. idk, i find those answers mute to the point. Because if im the problem and i need to change, then im killing myself just the same, at least one of those ways i dont have to maintain it. Sure some people will be sad, but everyone will move on. Ill be nothing just the same. Who cares, just let me die.
