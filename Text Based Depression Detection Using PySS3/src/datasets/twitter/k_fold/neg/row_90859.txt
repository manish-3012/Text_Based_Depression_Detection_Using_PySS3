I feel like I'm losing myself.I have never thought of myself as a depressed, angry, or suicidal person and it's difficult for me to understand how I've gotten to this point. I really enjoyed my life all the way up to the end of high school. I played sports, I got good grades, I enjoyed drawing and writing and thought I was pretty good at both. High school came to an end and while I had enjoyed my time swimming and playing water polo, I was not good enough to earn a scholarship. The partial scholarships I got based on my grades combined with money I'd saved up was nowhere near enough to pay for any of the schools I wanted to go to, so I had to rely on my parents.

They had told me several times that they would not pay for any college that was not a Christian college. Years ago, this didn't bother me and I thought nothing of it. As I got closer to graduating high school, I felt like limits were being placed on my future and was a bit disappointed by the colleges I had to choose from. I wanted to remain in the state but there weren't many great options for me. I tried to make excuses for why I didn't want to go without betraying the fact that I no longer believe in God. The truth was that I wanted to do what every kid on his way to college wants to do. I wanted to meet new and exciting people, choose a college where I can learn about things I care about, and do my share of drinking and partying on the side. A Christian Liberal Arts college seemed to offer the opposite of what I wanted.

I'm in my second year here and I'm ready to give up. It's a small school and almost everyone I've encountered is very conservative and uptight. It was clear to me early on that I had a difficult choice in front of me. I could betray my personal beliefs and values by pretending to be religious and conservative and therefore fit in or I could hold to what I believe and be shunned. On the first day, we had to sign a form saying we acknowledged that homosexual activity was wrong and that we would not participate in any. I guess I could've just said nothing but the fact that everyone else simply signed it with no complaints upset me. I got into an argument with basically the entire room. For a long time afterward, my section mates avoided me while occasionally attacking my views or questioning my sexuality. I didn't participate in any of the section's social events. Over time I've kind of retreated. I don't feel like I can have a reasonable, intelligent conversation with anyone I know.

We attend mandatory church services several times a week and must take mandatory religious studies classes. It feels more like church than school. I feel like I've betrayed myself on my essays and tests. I go on and on about God's love because I feel like it's what I need to make a grade even when I think it's crap. Somehow I feel as though I'm running out of bullshit. I can barely scrape enough adoring words together for an essay anymore.

I've become so scared of being myself that I feel like I'm someone else now. I changed the way I talk because even moderate swearing seems to offend people. My sense of humor is not appreciated or approved of and has all but disappeared. I'm taking classes for writing and art but the strict parameters they place on me are causing me to lose my passion for them. I hardly talk, I hardly go anywhere, I hardly do anything. I walk the same path everyday to class and to my dorm to listen to lectures on things I can't care about or don't believe in. The amount of work I have to do feels overwhelming when I have no interest in it. 

To others, I'm that guy who won't sing during chapel or the guy who doesn't want to lead the class in prayer at the beginning and people seem to keep their distance. I feel like the people around me aren't interesting, or reasonable. They don't seem like people I want to be friends with. At the same time I feel that even if I knew interesting, open-minded, funny people, I'm not worth being friends with. I feel like everything that made me has melted away when placed at odds with my environment. I don't have strong feelings or strong relationships anymore. I love almost no one and nothing and don't feel that I am deeply loved by anyone. To my family, it seems it is more important that I fit the mold of what a member of my family should be like than it is for me to be who I want to be. I don't know what that is anymore. 

I'm so afraid of the future. Every time I see my dad he asks me what my career plans are and I never have an answer. He gets more and more upset by this. I got into an argument with my parents about religion. My mom cried and my dad stopped speaking to me for a while. I don't know how to feel about it. I don't know whether they love me or some version of me that they've been striving to create and is now collapsing. I don't want to disappoint anyone but I don't want to live my life for their approval.

I can't sleep at night. I can barely stay awake during the day. The food here isn't good and I hardly eat apart from the occasional bowl of cereal. Eating feels like a chore. Just something I have to do every now and then. My limbs ache for no apparent reason. I feel like I'm somewhere else and my body is vacant, just doing what it's told day after day for no reason. I feel very alone. I'm not creative like I used to be. I don't think there's anything to distinguish me from anyone else. 

In a way I feel like I'm already dead. I don't look forward to anything except with a sense of dread. I just have no motivation to live life and I'm beginning to feel like it wouldn't be so different if I were dead. I want to be happy like I used to be, but I can't remember why I used to be. I can't shake the feeling that this is a realization. This might just be the way it is and I hadn't realized it until now. My grades are slipping. I'm sleeping through my classes. I might lose my scholarship and fail everyone and then I can't imagine a future for myself. I find myself wishing I didn't have to face it.
