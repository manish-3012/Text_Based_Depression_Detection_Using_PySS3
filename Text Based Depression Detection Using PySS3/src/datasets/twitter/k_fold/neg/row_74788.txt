My wife cheated and now I hate my life. It's not worth living.My wife cheated. She doesn't love me, and quite frankly, I don't think she cares about me at all really. At least it feels that way. She may destroy our lives and our small children's lives. And my life just doesn't feel worth living anymore. Everything I fought for and worked for is destroyed. I am alone and unloved.
