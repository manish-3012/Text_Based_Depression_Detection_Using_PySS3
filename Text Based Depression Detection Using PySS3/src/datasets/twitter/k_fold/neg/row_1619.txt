Reckoning for a While NowI've about now been coming to think that there's something wrong with this world, or maybe its me that's got the issue. Life doesn't have the same kick, that old feeling where everyday felt like magic. It's been a day on loop for centuries now. I'm trapped in these hours again and again, and the seasons change and showers fall and droughts come about and there I am still watching with blank mind. I am lost in time it seems. 

I don't know how to get out. I think there's no way. I live my life and try my damndest and there I am back where I started. There was sense it all meant something at some time or another, and that in the future I'd win the day and it'd be clear that I was made all behovely for this world. 

Instead, tomorrow will be like yesterday and people will talk to me in their dull loops and it'll be like sitting before an awful movie. All the sundry parts don't add up to anything, it's all just noise in sequence, static trying to speak to me, the garbled crunches holding nothing in them but randomness. 

I am at the end of my rope, not because I'm in great pain or suffering great sickness, but because hope seems so silly about now. This life is but breathing and passing away into whatever comes next, though I think the jury has made clear that the sentence that comes with the conviction is not for my profit.
