I have a date picked out.I have a date, a place, and a plan. It feels like the only life goal I'm going to actually accomplish. I figured it couldn't hurt to post on here and see if anyone can convince me that killing myself is a bad idea. Just don't use the "it will get better" or "what about your family/friends" I'll be dead so I won't have to deal with their pain. And I have been living long enough to see my life will just continue to get worse. I'm not a gambler so I don't like dealing with what ifs and maybes. 

So hit me with your best shot. Let's see if anyone can prove to me that living is worth it. Feel free to ask questions, I'll answer what I feel like.
