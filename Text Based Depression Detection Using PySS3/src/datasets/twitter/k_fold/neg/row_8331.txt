living was a mistake. 15(F)"I too used to believe that the world would be a better place if I hadnâ€™t been born. I was hated merely for the fact that I existed, and I died for the happiness of many people. But there was one thing I wished for with all my heartâ€¦ If Iâ€™m ever given a second chance in life, I want to live for only myself. That is my sincere wish." - Ymir

I should have committed so long ago
I shouldn't have told myself that it would get better, because it didn't
It only got worse
Therapy made it so much worse
My meds aren't working either
People always tell me I'm too young to be depressed
How school is no reason at all to be depressed
How I have it so much easier than everyone else, that I shouldn't be ungrateful
And I get that, I try my best not to be ungrateful and count my blessings
Everything feels so cold and worthless
So frustratingly bleak and suffocating
I genuinely do want to die
I'm sick of being here, I'm sick of living
All there is is insufferable suffering
