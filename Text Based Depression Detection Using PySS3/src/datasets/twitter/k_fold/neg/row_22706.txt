Serious! Should I tell my parents that I have depression? (probably NSFW)It's my first time making a post like this so if I did something wrong, please let me know so I fix it or delete this whole thing. Anyway... I've had depression since 2nd grade and now I'm in college. I sought help a few days ago but I'm scared to tell my parents - my dad would dismiss me and my mom would get scared to death. But I can't go to my psychologist if I  can't pay..and if I don't go ill only get worse..I'm already on some kind of light pills. Should I tell them? Is it worth it?
