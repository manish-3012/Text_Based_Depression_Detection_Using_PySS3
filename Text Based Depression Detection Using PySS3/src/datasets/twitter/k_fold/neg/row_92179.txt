Want to end it allI really want to die, but I dont want to kill myself. Sometimes I wish that I would get into an accident that would kill me or that I would somehow become a victim of a shooting in which I would be dead. That way my family won't feel guilty for my own suicide. The truth is I'm tired of being a burden on my family, they don't see it that way but honestly I'm just a leech who isn't doing anything to better myself. In fact all I am doing is making things worse for myself
