Suicide is permanent, your problems aren't.I know it may feel that life isn't going to get better, believe me, for the last 2 years my parents constant fights and divorce and my mom treating me like scum for being right about everything. its still going on, it will likely finally end within 6-12 more months. maybe more, maybe less. better to hit the pause button for 3 years instead of breaking the controller and never playing again. you only get 1 life, live it.
