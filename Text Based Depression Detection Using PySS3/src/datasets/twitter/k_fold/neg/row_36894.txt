Please help mei feel like there is somethig controllig me every night, something that wants me to kill myself and hurt myself and its not me but i canâ€™t stop it. i dont see things or hear voices i just get this unstoppable uncontrollable urge and every night it gets harder to fight it. how much longer can i fight it? but its only at night. i am super happy during the day but by 9 or 10 pm this happens and i seriously cannot keep my mind off dying. i dont want to kill myself but i feel like i have to. whats wrong with me god
