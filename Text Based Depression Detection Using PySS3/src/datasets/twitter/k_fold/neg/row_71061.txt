Well, I decided to do itI don't know if you guys can convince me not to. You have before, but now I'm sure. I have a mental block on thinking about the future. All I know is I'm going to not think anymore. I'm gonna die. 

I'm fucking tired of being called a girl. My parents won't let me transition, and without school I just get misgendered. I can't stand my parents. I think they may be emotionally abusive. I have my brains set to not think about my boyfriend, the only person who actually cares about me. 

I guess I have friends. I don't know why, my personalities shit, but I have friends. I can't really talk to them tho. We're not close enough to actually talk. I doubt most of them would shed tears if I die. They'd probably just deal with it and get on with their lives. 

The longer I wait to transition the worse I'm going to get. I can't stand this ghost of being a girl. In my future I won't be able to move past it. People won't be able to look me up in a job without knowing I'm a moronic tranny girl. I want to die. I'm going to, on April 14th. No more.
