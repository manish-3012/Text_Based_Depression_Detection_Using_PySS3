Suicide seems like the only option.To start, I'm a 20 year old heroin, meth, benzo addict. It all started about 2.5 years ago when my father passed of a heart attack. From that point on, I fucked everything up. I've been to 3 rehabs in the cours of my addiction. For the past five months I've been living in a sober living house. A few hours ago, I got caught relapsing and I've since been kicked out. I believe my mother and stepmom are finally done supporting me in any way, and that's something I can't handle. All I can think of now is how easy it would be just to overdose. It would solve everything, and my family/friends wouldn't be burdened with me anymore. Fuck this.
