If I listen to Mariah Carey this Christmas I promise I will end it.Ok, I already hate the holidays, alone, poor and ugly
But I hate most of all is fucking listening to Mariah Carey every year as an auditory reminder of my mysery.
From now on if I hear All I want for Christmas is you or Santa Claus is coming to town I will go home and down my whole Stash of meds with vodka, don't care about dying from liver failure at this point.
