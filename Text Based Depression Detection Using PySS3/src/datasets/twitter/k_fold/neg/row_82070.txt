Failed medical student, probably wonâ€™t live to see next monthI donâ€™t know why I even bother posting here, as if itâ€™ll help me. My story is I wasted the last 6 years of my life trying to go into medicine. I went to university out of high school, got a bachelors in bio, and am now in medical school, and am about to fail out after returning from medical leave. I feel like Iâ€™ve wasted 6 years of my life and several thousand dollars and will soon have nothing to show for it. Iâ€™m only 22 years old and already my life has dead ended. I canâ€™t get any good job with just a bachelors in bio, and no good job prospects once I fail out. I sacrificed my health and social life as well so Iâ€™ll be fat, have no friends, several thousand in debt, and no life direction or hope left in about a week. The only reason I hesitate to die is cuz Iâ€™m a fucking coward and because Iâ€™d be leaving my parents with the debt
