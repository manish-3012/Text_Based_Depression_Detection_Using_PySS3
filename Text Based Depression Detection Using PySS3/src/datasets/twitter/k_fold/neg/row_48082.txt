The final strawI can't take it anymore. I'm not ready, but the longer i wait, the more pain that comes. I'm 15, and the world seems better off without me. The only person I would feel bad about leaving behind is my mother. She has a terrible life. I can't take it. 

All everyone does is make me feel selfish and stupid. Maybe you don't want to lose me, okay. I understand. But when all you do is tell me things like,"you'll be leaving a lot of people behind in misery" or that I'll somehow cause a chain reaction, makes me feel selfish.

I'm 5'5 and 80lbs, which is not healthy for me, but i just feel so fat. My knees are just flab, and my stomach is just so big, and my arms are huge. I just, i can't. 

All you do is make me feel bad.

I hate it.

I don't want to go anywhere, can't you understand that? I don't want to leave my house. Ever. I like it indoors. 

But when youre trying to "help" and give up on me two minutes later, is freaking hard on me. DON'T TRY TO HELP, IF YOU WONT PUT ANY EFFORT INTO IT.

I just want to die. That's all i want. You don't even talk to me anymore. Did all your friends just leave you? Why now? What do you want from me? You just decide, "oh, let's talk again after two years"

THINGS DON'T ALWAYS WORK THE WAY YOU WANT IT. Do you think if they did, that i would still be thinking about this?

I don't want to let down people yet, but if i have to wait till June to do it, fine.

Just know, never did i do any of this for attention. If you ever really loved me, you wouldn't have left, "best friend".
