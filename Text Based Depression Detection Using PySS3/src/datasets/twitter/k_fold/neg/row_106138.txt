Canâ€™t wait to go back to work :))))Iâ€™m actually eager to go back to work, if not just so I can get into a fight with one or more of my coworkers and/or have an emotional breakdown and then take a blade (I won't say what kind) to my arm. I know itâ€™s not going to really kill me, but I just need people to know that Iâ€™m NOT â€œhappy all the time.â€ I want to be the one to hurt more, to have horrible things happen to. Nobody else gets to die before me. 

I'd explain further, but honestly I've finally realized that nobody cares and nobody *should* care. It's not about me; it should've never been about me, but I was too stupid and lonely to realize otherwise until everyone turned their back on me.
