people say it's emotionalI think i'm supposed to feel something about planning my own death but there's nothing but emptiness anymore. i don't even know if i can cry anymore. people say not to choose a permanent solution to a temporary problem or whatever fuckin bullshit but the problem persists. i've been depressed and suicidal for years. mental illness stole my teenage years and my parents aren't supportive and sure i'll  "eventually" have the money to move out and find a better support system that's not transphobic \(towards me as a non\-binary person\) but that could be years. and even then, there's no certainty that it'll be better than things are now. i've thought this through, it's not exactly impulsive if it's been something i've been planning for years, is it? haha seriously though what should i do
