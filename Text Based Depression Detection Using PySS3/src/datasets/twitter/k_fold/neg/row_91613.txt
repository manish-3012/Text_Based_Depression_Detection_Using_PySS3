I just feel like giving upMy life just feels like itâ€™s going nowhere. I feel like Iâ€™m trying so hard but itâ€™s just not getting me anywhere, I donâ€™t know maybe Iâ€™m being stupid (I mean it is half three in the morning). Iâ€™ve got no job with no hope of getting one either because of no education, I dropped out of high school because of my really bad anxiety and depression. I have no friends because of this too. Soon Iâ€™m only going to have two family members left because the rest are moving away and Iâ€™m too depressed to keep a relationship up and running over the phone.Cutting myself doesnâ€™t really seem to do the trick anymore. 
Like I said I just donâ€™t really know what else there is to do. Any advice?
