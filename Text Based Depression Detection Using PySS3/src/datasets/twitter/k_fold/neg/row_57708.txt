I'm going to end it tonight.~~This isn't my first time posting here, but it will be my last.~~

~~I first attempted over a year ago, spent six months in psych wards and then was released to a group home when I promised to give further treatment a chance.  I then started seeing a therapist twice a week and going to a trans support group.~~

~~I feel I've complied with my end of the bargain.  Therapy as before hasn't been useful and I long since ceased attending the support group, as I seem to be in a different place than the people there.  I've been in transition six years already living most of that full time.  I've given up already and I have not been able to muster any continued enthusiasm for existence.~~

~~I struggle daily trying to justify this continued suffering and I've grown sick of everyone's fucking little delusions to get through life.  I cannot help but feel if anyone else understood this particular misery as I do they would feel the same and to deny them of this release is inhumane.~~

~~I bought razer blades.  Efforts to cut in the past have resulted in nothing more than chickenshit chickenscratches so I think I will do what I can to get drunk before execution, and then take a shower and slit my wrists so I can exit this world as I entered it, wet and naked.~~

~~I must end this misery.  Fuck anyone who says "it gets better".~~
