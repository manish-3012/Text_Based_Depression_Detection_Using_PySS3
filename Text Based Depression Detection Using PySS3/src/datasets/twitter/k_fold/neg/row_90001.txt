1 point for the dark sideSo again i fell into the reasons why i should do it. My partner n i have taken good steps recovering from my affair BUT it kills me more n more when she brings it up and how she will never trust me n how i will lie again. Ive explained it until im blue in the face how i fell into the affair which was the fact i had many unaddressed issues that built upon eachother but unfortunately i gave her reasons to feel like that n its me who really put us here. I try not to let those demons sneak in but those little fuckers always find away to remind of why im just a burden good for nothing piece of shit. I already struggle to find a purpose to be here so everytime i see her so hurt n voice how she feels i just want to do it. Maybe im being selfish but how can i convince myself otherwise? Im a cheating liar but i tried not to let my wrong choices get the best of me but it does. The only thing holding me back is that i dont want to hurt her yet again but also i already did the worse so i think she will be better and happier
