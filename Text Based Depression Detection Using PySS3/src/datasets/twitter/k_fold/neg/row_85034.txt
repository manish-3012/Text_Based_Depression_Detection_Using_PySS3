I think I am gonna do it, I think it's time :)So, me I am a guy 20, alphabet soup of mental health \[Autism, Bipolar, ADHD, Social Anxiety\] I was afraid of taking my life for a long time because I don't like to leave a mess and I hate the thought of my body decomposing but at this point I don't care. For a couple reasons.

1.  As soon as I die I will know the answer of what lies after death, I am not religious so I expect nothing and so I expect since my consciousness will end time will literally fast forward until universe death theoretically speaking since my consciousness will not be there to "observe" anything

2.  I am lonely, and nobody likes me, my mom doesn't understand me, my dad left me when I was young, I have only 1 good friend online, practically none irl besides the ones who'll say hey or something once every 6 months. No SO, I've paid hookers good investment was enjoyable and at least someone liked me for a time.

3. I can't imagine working/slaving away till I die I mean I can but my mind JUST INST STABLE I FLOP INTO FUCKING DEPRESSION TOO DAMN QUICK. I can't man I FUCKNIG CANT I just cant do this I am losing my mind im fucking insane fuck everyone who brought me here.
