Not sure of much anymore.Sorry for the long vent.
I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing here. I haven't been doing great, my Prozac seems to just be doing little to nothing. And I just upped the does maybe about 2 or so months ago. Late at night I just get so fucking lonely I dont have any real friends. I have 'friends' maybe 2 from high school but they are off at college to busy to talk or care. I have more online 'friends' that real life physical friends. But Idk it doesnt feel the same talking to them as it does a real physical person. You cant hug internet friends not when you live in Chicago and they live in Miami or Texas. I'm stuck here alone. And doesnt feel any better that I idiotically fell for one of my friends but I dont want to try anything in risk of losing them. Even if I did put together some stuff for them on valentines day they said it was nice. Just nice... Yeah thats 'nice'. It was a heartache moment. But I'm just here man I have no happiness I cant enjoy Overwatch the way I used to. I cant enjoy playing guitar the way I used to. Its pointless to be here. And lately there have been shootings on my block early in the morning and late afternoon. I'm honestly hoping I get shot on the way home or to school or to/from work. I just want someone to kill me because I'm too much a pussy to do it myself. I've always been weak.
