Can't shake the feeling that I'm incapable of working like a normal personI was a really happy kid. I don't know what happened but in sophomore year of high school I just suddenly wanted to die and couldn't do any of my work. Now I'm 23 and the depression basically never stopped. I've spent the last 4 years going to a pretty bad community college part-time, usually without even having a job but still not doing well in my classes. I found out today that I managed to fail 2 classes this semester. I don't know what I'm doing. I've spent all this time trying to get an engineering degree and I absolutely hate all the classes. I know I have other options in life but I'm just so exhausted.

It's like when we were kids and my big brother would say "Why are easy things hard for you?" I know he was young and just joking but he said stuff like that all the time and I may have internalized it.

I want to get out of the way: yes I'm on meds (4 pills every day) and yes I see a therapist who is good. Although over the years I've been put on seemingly every available medication and I don't feel like any of them have ever really done anything. My previous prescriber said I was her most complicated client.

I feel so alone. I can't comfortably open up with my family and I don't have any friends any more. All my high school friends have careers and real lives. I've tried reaching out to them but I'm so embarrassed of myself it ruins every interaction.

I actually made a post on this subreddit a few years ago and all I got was some dumbass telling me to get a GED after I already said I was in college. It would mean a lot to get a reply from someone who actually read the post.
