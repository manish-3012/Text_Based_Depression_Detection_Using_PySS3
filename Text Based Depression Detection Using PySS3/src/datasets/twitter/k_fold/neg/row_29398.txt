I donâ€™t care about anything anymore because I see myself dead soon.My name is Brian. Iâ€™m 16 years old, Iâ€™m a junior in High School, I work a part time job, and I make music in my past time (since i was 11). I never talk to anyone, and Iâ€™m very alone. I donâ€™t think I have any real friends. I donâ€™t have a girlfriend because my confidence is low, and at this point I find myself scared of girls or anything sexual. 

Iâ€™ve been really upset since about 7th grade. Everyday, for the past 3 years (give or take) my existence has been nothing but mental and emotional pain that I endure. The feeling of my chest wanting to explode is something Iâ€™ve grown use to. I honestly havenâ€™t had a day where I was truly happy in years. The feeling of constant emptiness and uselessness has overcome my state of mind as I believe these things to be true about my character. The scars that have been presented on my arms and legs are not a cry for help, but they are a non-recommended method I use to cope with the frequent unknown panic attacks I have. I would rather unleash it all and take on the physical pain, than deal with the mental pain anymore. I feel bad for existing. I think I annoy others when I try to communicate. 

Many people tell me that I should look forward to things in life because of my talents both in school and in music, but at this point I just donâ€™t care anymore. Iâ€™m tired of living and the thought of me growing up with a career with a different life of my own isnâ€™t pleasing to me. I just want to die and end everything. 

I donâ€™t know if I suffer from depression or not because Iâ€™ve never been diagnosed with it. I was in therapy for awhile but that never helped. Nothing felt genuine, and I hate myself too much to care. Many people have it much worse than me so in all reality Iâ€™m just a little bitch whose upset over nothing. 

My goal is to die before I graduate high school. I wanted to shoot myself originally, but I donâ€™t gave access to weapons. Overdose is fine with me though.
