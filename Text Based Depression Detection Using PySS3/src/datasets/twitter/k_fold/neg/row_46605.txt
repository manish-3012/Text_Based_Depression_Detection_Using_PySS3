Please help meI don't know what to do. Nothing I ever do seems to work or make anybody happy. I just take up space and fuck everything up. School, art, music, my diabetes, friends anything and I fuck it up. I feel like shit and I don't want to anymore. Everyone makes me feel so alone and worthless that I don't need to be around. I'm scared. I'm scared about my future. I don't want to leave the only person who cares about me behind but somedays I hurt so bad I just want to end it. I try as hard as I can but it's never good enough. Nobody ever thinks I've done well, or they think I don't care. Not even my parents seem  to think Im good at anything. It's day after day endless and I'm sick of it. Please, I'm begging you, whoever is reading this, help me.
