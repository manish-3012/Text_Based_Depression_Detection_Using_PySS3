I'm drinking myself to death and it is causing my family to be upsetThe reason I drink is to self medicate because I saw my friend pass away in a car accident when I was 19. We were both stupid and I challenged him to a race using our parents cars. Basically, he understeered into a tree. I have tried therapy but it didn't work for me. I was also diagnosed with PTSD and depression. I stopped taking my prescription because it didn't work for me. I feel that I have blood on my hands because I was the one who made him do it. 

My parents and grandfather came to me and told me that they were worried about my drinking problem. I sometimes drink a bottle of Vodka a day. I just want to drink myself to death because I'm too scared of killing myself. My granddad tried to relate to the situation by telling me about the things he was in Vietnam. I walked out because I was upset about everything. I now think that I was out of order and I would do anything to apologise. But at the same time, I feel that they shouldn't have bought my grandfather along because he is getting Parkinsons disease so I don't want him to worry about me as well.
