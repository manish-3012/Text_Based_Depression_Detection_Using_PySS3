Tonight might be the night I follow through on something for oncePromises have always been something I've sucked I keeping, and suicide is no exception. I'd be rich if I had a nickel for every time I said I'd kill myself and never actually went through with it. I've never had the motivation to try really, or I've been too scared. The one time I did try my dog stopped me. But she's dead now, so hopefully there will be no hurtles this time.
