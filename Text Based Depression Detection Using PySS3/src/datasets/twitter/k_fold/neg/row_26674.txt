I can't take anymore, I'm going to kill myself tonightDecided it would be a bad idea to post this on my main. I see and hear things constantly, I can't work or focus on my college work. I had my first shift today and had to finish early because I was convinced I was going to die at work (just a warehouse, nothing especially dangerous or frightening.) I fall in love with a new woman every month and they never love me back, and nobody ever will. The only girlfriends and boyfriends I've had either were physically abusive or left me early on. I drink about once or twice a week, always a very excessive amount and sometimes drinking enough to actually kill me. Unfortunately, I haven't died yet. Nobody cares about me, not a single person wants me alive.
