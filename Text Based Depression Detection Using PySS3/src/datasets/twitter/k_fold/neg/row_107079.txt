In danger of failing medical school. Feel like there is no way out other than suicideSo this is a place I never thought I would be in. I am 23 years old, and am currently a medical student who was recently on track to be finishing up my second year, when I recently failed an important set of exams that is threatening to make me fail the whole semester. If I fail, I may be given the option to repeat, but I am not sure if I have it in me after this sort of setback to ever recover. I have watched my other classmates surpass me in every way imaginable and it is absolutely soul crushing to be so close to finishing my second year (which is the last year of classroom activity) yet still being on the verge of not being able to pull it off. I feel like I need a miracle to pass the final exams and the stress is slowly driving me insane. If by some chance I do pull it off and pass this semester, I still need to get through a very rigorous standardized exam which statistics do not predict I will perform well on. This could make it unlikely that I will ever be able to get a job if I ever make it to graduation. My parents (who are physicians themselves) have paid of out pocket to send me here (and to college as well) and if I can't pass, I am not sure I can live with the shame of having cost them so much, yet failed to give them any return on their investment. I feel like a failure in so many ways and like suicide is the only way out of this mess I am in. The only thing stopping me at this point is a fear of going to hell after I do it. But to be honest, the last couple of weeks have made become so depressed and nihilistic, that I am starting to question whether any of my beliefs can be true. My hands feel like they are totally tied and I am quickly succumbing all my negative thoughts. I have been eating little lately, struggle to get out of bed, and honestly just find myself counting down the hours each day until I go to sleep at night because I feel like it is the only reprieve I get from the nightmare that has become my existence. I really just wish I could go to sleep and never wake up again. I hate my life and am so ashamed of everything I have become lately, but cannot even talk to anyone about it thanks to our societal standards that all but essentially prevent men from taking about this sort of despair. I am sitting in my room anxiously trying to study, and avoid the urge to put a bullet in my head. I am so scared, yet feel like I have too much pride to tell anything anyone about it. I have to pretend like everything is okay, even though I screaming inside. I would truthfully rather be dying from cancer, or just perish some sort of accident because I feel like that would be a much more dignified way to go out as opposed to taking my own life. I am only scratching the surface with this post, but if anyone has any advice on how to get out of this mess and/or if suicide is really something that is advisable here, that would be greatly appreciated in this very dark moment in my life.
