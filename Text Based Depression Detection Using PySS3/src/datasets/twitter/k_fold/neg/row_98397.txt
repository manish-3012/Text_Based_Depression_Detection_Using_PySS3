I don't see another way outEvery day I'm just digging a bigger hole. I'm trying every treatment I can get my hands on and it just gets worse - medication, counseling, CBT, mindfulness, being honest, faking it, exercise, journalling, courses, yoga, 'worry time', alcohol, self-harm, and much more over the years. 

It feels like I'm fated to be this and there's no way to improve towards anything because there's no foundation to build on. For instance, there's nothing I can even possibly aspire to. I don't understand what "improve" can be because I'm just disconnected. I have no friends or support and no more energy. Fundamentally horrible person too. Feels like I'm just waiting for a good opportunity to die now, annoyingly none really seem plausible. I'm not completely sure why I'm writing this, just some semblance of company maybe, another thing to tick off the 'I've tried everything' list.
