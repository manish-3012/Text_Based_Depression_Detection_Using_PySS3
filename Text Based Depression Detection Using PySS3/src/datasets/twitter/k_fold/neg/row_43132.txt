Iâ€™m so mad.I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I havenâ€™t for a very very long time. But I know that if I do anything, my mom will not make it. Sheâ€™ll drink herself to death, or outright kill herself. 

Why do I have to go through all of this pain so that she has a good life? When Iâ€™m dying inside every day. I donâ€™t know what else to do. I donâ€™t know how to keep hanging on.
