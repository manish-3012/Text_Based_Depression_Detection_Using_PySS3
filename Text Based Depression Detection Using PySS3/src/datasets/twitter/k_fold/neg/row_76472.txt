I'm 20 years and I cannot do anithing well in my life.Apologies for bad English, my main language is spanish
That's it. Since December I have the need to just suicide, almost did 2 times, one from a bridge and one with a cutter.
The feeling of disappointing my mother with killing myself is what made me through here.

I cannot do anithing well, playing videogames, study, maintain friends, jobs, I cannot even listen to anyone bcs my adhd just makes me distract from them.

I think my friends are with me bcs I pity them.

I cannot even maintain a job that is replacing items with others...
