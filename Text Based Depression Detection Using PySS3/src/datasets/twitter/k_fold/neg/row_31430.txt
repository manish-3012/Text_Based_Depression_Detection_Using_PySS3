â€œit could be worseâ€iâ€™m so fucking tired of being told â€œit could be worseâ€ so? itâ€™s really fucking bad right now, is that not enough? why are you invalidating my hurt? why are you belittling it because i could be in even more shit? itâ€™s never made sense to me. i donâ€™t understand that logic.
