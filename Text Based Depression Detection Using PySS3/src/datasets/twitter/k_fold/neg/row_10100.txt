My only friend is the rope, hanging on my door.I guess it's the end. I've been quiet for a few weeks trying to fight the demons inside of me, but I just cannot seem to go any further. I have no pills that I could overdose from, so my only friend is the rope. Thank you for those who I was able to talk to. Hope you keep on fighting and I surely hope you can win.
