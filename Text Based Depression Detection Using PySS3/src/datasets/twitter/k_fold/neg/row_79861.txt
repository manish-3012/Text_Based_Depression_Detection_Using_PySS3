When you know you'll never be good enough for anything, it's time to die.After several months of unemployment, I found a job.

Today, i've realized I'm not good enough to get past the entry level of my career.  

Tomorrow, i'm quitting my job and killing myself. 

I have nothing in life to live for except a career, and i'm too stupid to get past the first level of It.  I have ABSOLUTELY nothing to look forward to in my life, and it's time to end this atrocity. I'm sick of being an unmitigated failure, and yes, I will be more successful as a corpse.
