The End.One year ago, I was on top of the world. I beat depression. I found my self worth, and I found a metric TON of confidence. I gained charisma, and it seemed like everything new I tried, I loved. Everyone I met, seemed to click with me. Started dating my best friend, and breezed through college apps. I did well in school and I was happy. That is the best way to put it. However, the break up only months after killed me. A lack of closure sucked up any confidence and self worth I had. I lost my momentum. Grades slipped, depression was back and stronger. It felt like I was drowning. From the breakup onwards, I missed my now ex. I want her in my life again. Not romantically, but as a friend. I miss that bond.  Some may say that I'm being delusional, and want that relationship. That is just not true. I want that bond, that friendship. That's all I ask. We've had rough times before, but we worked through it before. However unlikely it is this time, I still want to reconcile. The burning desire and feeling of emptiness has drained me and exhausted me, nearly 1 year after the breakup. I'm broken. I've tried to reconcile, but it just has not worked. And my life has gotten worse. In the summer, I called the suicide hotline, only to have my issues and state of mind downplayed and regarded as a "fact of life". I started therapy and it helped, but my therapist is now on maternity leave. I hated my 4 year college so I transferred to a local community college. I watch all my friends in new places make new friends and do new things, while I'm left behind. I'm forgotten. How is my ex?  She's in her dream country, living life. I have no doubt she's experiencing the same high I once felt. Every nerve of my body is SCREAMING, my life is spiraling out of control. Broken HONESTLY is the best way to phrase it. Triggers from the breakup still exist, and I'm still extremely sensitive to things, like a pathetic human. So here I type, a shattered once human, with enough memories for 2 life times, and enough pain for 10. I would give anything to go back 1 year. B, if you SOMEHOW read this, and think you know who this is, PLEASE message me. To anyone else, I'm begging for help, please message me, talk to me, anything to console me. I fear I'm at my breaking point. I do want to live, and I hope suicide is not in the cards, but sometimes a nice, long, deep rest seems ever so inviting given the restless fight I've endured. Thank you for reading through all this, and I hope you never have to go through the same emotions I have.
