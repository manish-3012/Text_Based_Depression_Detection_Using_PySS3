I don't know what to do.. broke someone's heart and its killing me.Long story short, i was dating this girl for 3 months really liked eachother she was great! But she is 20 im 25 we moved in together too quick and i think it ruined our relationship. I met this other girl who is my age and has her life together even in graduate school and we just met at an event and just hit it off. i should have just broken up with my ex but she found out about me talking to this other girl before i got around to breaking up with her. I did NOT cheat on her though. im just worried that im getting later in life and ive always dated girls with problems at home, their dad is not around, in jail, or just a dick. and these girls just drop out of college and i just somehow attract broken girls and i fall for it everytime. But this last girl I fell hard for but i couold feel it becoming toxic. how do i feel this bad about ending a 3 month relationship when my last one i ended after 2 years and felt nothing. I feel like a scumbag for what i did but i need to move on with my life. it just shouldnt have happened the way it did. I cant get her crying out of my head its killing me. idk what i feel idk if its me being afraid to be alone, me feeling bad for her or what it is. i just dont know what direction im going in life and idk what happening to me lately. money is tight, im having relationship problems i just cant handle this. all i do is hurt people even when i dont try to it always seems to happen. i hurt people who care about me and push people away trying o get further in life and idk if its good or bad. im lost..
