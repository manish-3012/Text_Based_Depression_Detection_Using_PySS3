My dreams are dead and I'm not even 20, so why bother?I'm in a really dark place right now. I've been thinking of suicide for years but right now I'm staring at a knife and I don't see any reason not to go ahead and do it. The thought of ending it actually makes me happy. I have no friends or family, no one would even miss me. I'm scared I've never been this close before. Will some one keep me company? please?
