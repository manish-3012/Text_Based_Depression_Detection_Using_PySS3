I canâ€™t tell anyone the real reason Iâ€™m suicidal.I was recently put in a psych ward for the suicidal because I was stupidly dropping major hints that I planned to kill my self in hopes that I could ask for help without destroying my pride.

When I was put in there, my family blamed it on Prozac, seeing as one of its side effects is suicidal thoughts.

Iâ€™ve talked to therapist after therapist and I told them all the same thing.

But I havenâ€™t told anyone why I really wanted to kill myself. Not even my closest friends.

The real reason I wanted to die was because of a girl.

I know it sounds stupid, but hear me out.

I had known this girl for years, and have had a HUGE crush on her from the second I was introduced to her.

Many years went by, she had moved back and forth a few times.

When she came back this time, I confessed my feelings for her. She said the feelings were mutual, but she wasnâ€™t ready for a relationship yet, seeing as she had just gotten out of a bad relationship. I made sure to let her know that I understood, and planned to respect that.

About a month goes by and she is very flirty with me. Touching me, writing me little notes, making fun of eachother, sending me hearts, etc.

However, just when I think Iâ€™m getting somewhere, she gets back together with her ex.

They were all over eachother. Their social mediaâ€™s filled with posts about eachother, and going on and on about eachother. The works.

Now not only was I fucked sideways in this situation, but she still keeps me just close enough so that these feelings canâ€™t go away. And she still does all the flirty things she did when she was single.

She is the only girl Iâ€™ve ever had feelings this strong for. I canâ€™t help but love her.

But after a month and a half of this, It didnâ€™t sting as bad, it just made me very depressed and sick.

I was starting to get over my suicidal feelings. The psych ward really helped me realize a lot. 

However, all of those feelings rushed back after we hung out.

We grabbed a pizza, watched a movie, made eachother laugh, and went for a walk in the autumn leaves.

She looked absolutely amazing. She made me happy. The entire time I was with her, I didnâ€™t have a single worry. Nothing else mattered. It felt like I was in heaven.

It was then I realized how much I actually love her. 

She told me she loved me, but it felt so hollow, as if it barely meant anything to her. I just felt so empty knowing how disposable I am.

We talk often, and she says she considers me her best friend. I obviously play along, but she means far more to me than any friend ever has.

We talk almost every day, we hangout at least once a week, and she still acts as flirty as she used to, but I know itâ€™ll never go anywhere.

Itâ€™s sad to say, but I put all my eggs in one basket, and somebody stole it.

I know I sound really pathetic, but thatâ€™s why I lied to everyone. Iâ€™m ashamed that she is the reason I wanted to end my life.

Donâ€™t get it wrong, I have a life outside of her. I have friends and family and hobbies and things to be proud of, but it feels like none of that matters without her.

Iâ€™m truly a piece of shit, but I guess thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m saying this to strangers on the internet.
