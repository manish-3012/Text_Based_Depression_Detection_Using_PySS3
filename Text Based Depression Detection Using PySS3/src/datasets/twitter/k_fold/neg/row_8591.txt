I can't believe I was naive enough to think that things could get betterI'm starting to realize that it's not possible. This pandemic is only going to get worse and worse. I won't ever get to work in the career field I want. I won't be able to make music again. I will always be alone. For the rest of my life, all I can do is repeat the exact same day over and over again. My future is filled with nothing but misery and loneliness.
