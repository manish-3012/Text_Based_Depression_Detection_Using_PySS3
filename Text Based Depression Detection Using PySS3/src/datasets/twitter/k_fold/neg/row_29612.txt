A sobering realityI nearly killed myself today. I spent two hours trying to man up and hang myself, I even wrote a note to my family. I couldn't do it.

My life feels strange. For almost a year now life just hasn't been worth living. Some days I'll be energetic and happy, others I'll think about ways to kill myself. I'm only a second year university student, but my life feels... empty. I have no real friends, never even been close to a girl and have piss poor grades. Whats the point, reddit? I'll never amount to anything, so why even try?
