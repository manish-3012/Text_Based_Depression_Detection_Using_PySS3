should i kill myself or no?Alright listen, so first of all I'm 14 years old, and you may think that I am like most kids my age who are "depressed" because their "gf dumped them". No. This case that I am about to write here is more serious. I live in a shithole country named Bosnia and Herzegovina. Most of the country is literally broken and the government is corrupt. No one really wants to live here (similar to North Korea). Anyways, I go to a small school and I am 9th grade currently. From the 1st grade till now, I have been stacking straight A's in my report cards and never had anything worse than that. This is the major reason everyone in my class hates me, they are jealous, but they sometimes tend to use me. For example, they mock me but I still decide to help them whenever they ask me to help. That's because I am nice, i was born that way. I have only 1 true friend from my school, but that still doesn't make me happy. The teachers praise me a lot but a few days ago i fucked up a bit for doing something dodgy, and now the teachers don't want to look at me and they are most likely going to call my parents. THEY CAN DO EVERYTHING BUT THAT. My parents are like a more strict version of Stalin, they always take away my stuff, i usually act normally, have awesome grades, but they still fill my head with sentences like "you will have F's and D's in high school" and "You're worthless." I stopped training basketball because of a dumb ass coach who keeps cussing God, breaks rules and insults us 24/7. My parents are like asian parents. VERY STRICT. I have an older sister who is about 20, she lives alone and she is going to become a nurse soon. She was literally the same as me when she was 14 and she didn't have any problems like me. Everyone keeps hating me, mocking me and talking shit about my back. THIS IS ONLY A FRACTION OF the shit that i have experienced. now the question is,
SHOULD I OR SHOULD I NOT KILL MYSSLF?
Thanks afterwards.
