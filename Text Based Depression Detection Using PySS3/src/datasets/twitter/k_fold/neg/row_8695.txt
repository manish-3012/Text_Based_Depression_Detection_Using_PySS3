SuffocatingIt is funny how after they have fucked you up so much mentally and physically. The next day they put a smile on their faces and pretend nothing has ever happened. Repressing my feelings and holding it in order to play my part in this whole charade they call â€˜ happy family â€˜ is fucking sickening. I donâ€™t want to play anymore. Maybe it would be better to just end it once and for all.
