running out of optionslost my job today. let go for 'poor performance', because i am a broken failure of a human being. it does not matter that this poor performance comes partially from a medical condition and chronic pain.  

my significant other is getting tired of all the shit that gets thrown my way, most of it self made. he's constantly stressed and has panic attacks because of me. he's at work right now. he can't come home. 

it's my fault. i ruin everything in my life. i feel so guilty for letting him in. i should have known better, should have pushed him away. he'd be so much better off. 

the world is so full of pain. everywhere i look there are awful people doing awful things to others. i am constantly sad and anxious and i feel like i am drowning.  i want to get help, to try and be better, but i can't afford it. and now i have no health insurance, so the little help i do have from antidepressants and painkillers  is going to go bye bye. my state didn't fund medicaid expansion so that's a non option. my lawyer won't call me back about the car accident that left me with this chronic pain. probably decided i am not worth it. 

i am so tired. i just want to stop feeling. i want to stop existing. i wish i could just get up the courage to do it.
