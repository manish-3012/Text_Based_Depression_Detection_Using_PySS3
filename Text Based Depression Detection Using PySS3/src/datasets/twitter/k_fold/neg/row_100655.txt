I'm done being hurtFuck you. I hate you for making me fall for you. I hate how you made me believe your lies and excuses for why you'd blow me off when we'd make plans. You did it again this morning. We were supposed to have breakfast, and I was going to cook for you, but you didn't even have the decency to tell me that you wouldn't be here. It's all right though, you never did when you'd blow me off to begin with, so I didn't expect a text. To be honest, I didn't really expect you to show up anyway, but you actually not showing up is still a blow.

But regardless, I let you in, and you hurt me. You made me trust you, after everything I've been through, and then you broke me. Fuck you. I went through being raped, but you made me feel safe. I told you how much you meant to me, but you seemed indifferent. I stopped drinking for you, but you didn't even seem to notice. You acted like that was easy for me, but it wasn't, you insensitive bastard. Fuck you!

I'm done trusting people. I'm going to end my life tonight so I can't ever be hurt again. I was only hanging on because I thought you'd given me something to live for. But then you just faded away, like I knew you would. Fuck you for making me love you. Fuck you for making me hate you. Fuck you.
