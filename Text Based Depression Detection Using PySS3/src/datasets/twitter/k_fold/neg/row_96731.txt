Tired of the Lack of Options and Understanding of Mental IllnessI finally worked up the courage back in August to get into my school's counseling services. It's helped me a lot to have someone to talk to and feel less alone. I found out a few weeks ago that I can only have ten sessions and then I'll have to see someone else outside of the school until the spring semester. I'm heartbroken because I'm just so exhausted. I don't know if I can afford to see someone outside of the school (school counseling is free) and I just don't want to open up to someone else and have to go through it all again to reach the point I'm at now.   


I'm just so tired and feel absolutely hopeless. I feel like I've barely even scratched the surface and it's taken all I have to get here and now I might end up being alone again. I'm so tired of my life and I'm tired of how inflexible society is for people like us. I feel no hope for the future. I'm so tired of trying.
