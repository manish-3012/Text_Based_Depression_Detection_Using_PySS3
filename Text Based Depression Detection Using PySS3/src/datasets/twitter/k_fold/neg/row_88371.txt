Introverted. Lost hope in making real friends. Iâ€™m going to end up milking myself.Iâ€™ve nevrr been good at making friends. Itâ€™s a three year process for me with lots of anxiety. Then it usually turns out that they are toxic and I have to leave. I just had to cut out the last two people in my life. My own sister and my bets friend of ten years. I only have my boyfriend left maybe and my dog. Ive been stuck in my room for two months. Iâ€™ve lost hope. Everyone Iâ€™ve ever gotten close to has abused me, taken advantage of me, or been extremely rude and toxic. Except maybe three friends throughout my whole childhood. I honestly canâ€™t take it anymore. I canâ€™t wait another three years but Iâ€™m too scared to get hurt again. I also donâ€™t have the social skills to meet people and Iâ€™m too socially anxious. I just want it to end.
