Troubled WatersI'm currently at work on break, looking for bridges in the area to jump off from.
I was recently spoken to at work about my lack of care for this job. I apologized, cried, but I never spoke of why.
My life's been going downhill for a while. I'm losing the best relationship I've had because they don't understand what's going on with me, and they don't seem to care when I mention how I feel. I gained so much weight that I don't even feel like a person anymore. 
I tried to kill myself in February by drowning, but I survived. Last week, I almost did, but thought better of it after talking to a crisis counselor. 
Today's different than those other days, though. I can't explain it, but I know today's the day I'm going to die.
