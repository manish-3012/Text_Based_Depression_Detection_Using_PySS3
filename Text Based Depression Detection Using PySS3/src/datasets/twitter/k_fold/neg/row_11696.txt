I just wish I had never existed in the first placeIt's times like these I'm not too afraid of the void and the end of my consciousness. I don't know why I'm still here. Because there's no immediate way to end my life quickly?  
  
I'm just so exhausted and the pain does not stop. It stopped for a little while and then it came back and I don't know why?  
  
I just want to feel loved. Is that so much to ask? I just want to have sex with someone who loves me too. Why is this such a hard and difficult thing that everybody else can have?   
  
I just want to not have to worry about money. But it keeps piling up. I can't keep up with my health and getting better and healing if I'm always worried about money.  
  
It seems I just don't have the two things people need to liveâ€”love and money. I just want to be free from needing and wanting these things.   
  
Please, I'm in so much pain.
