breaking up with my girlfriend and comitting suicide tonightLet me start by saying my thoughts are my own fault and honestly I put myself in this situation at 16 I started edating a girl and I'm dumb enough to lie so I always thought I was gonna grow and told her I'm 5'10 and I am actually 5'5 and now I'm 17 and turning 18 in a couple of weeks and still 5'5 turns out I'm not growing and she constantly talks about dudes that hit on her and her friends how they're short what is gross I guess height is a huge preference for her I don't judge but anyways in 5 weeks she was supposed to be coming over, so in that time I looked into surgeries like limb lengthening but I don't have that kinda money and then I thought about heel implants. But id have to go to a foreign country for those and tonight when we call I'm getting her to cancel her plans I'm breaking up with her not gonna even give her a good reason she deserved better than me to begin with and then I'm killing myself. My height has always been a huge insecurity thanks to it being the joke in my friend group and something that has made me depressed didn't expect it to end my relationship anyway I typed out messages ready to send to each family member and friend after I break up with her and end the call I'm going to the woods near me to hang myself that way my house doesn't feel like a horrible place to be for my family.

sorry if it was hard to read I can't really focus right now.

My family won't be shocked by my death as they all already worry about me and think I'm gonna kill myself as I've had plenty of therapists and nothing changed me.
