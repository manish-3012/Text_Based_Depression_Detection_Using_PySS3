Nowâ€™s my time!I was spiraling so hard before the COVID quarantine and I felt like the pressure and stress was literally going to kill me. I was afraid and suffocating on it. I was perpetually scared to let down the people who counted on me to be at work. In isolation Iâ€™ve find the lack of not being expected to be somewhere every single day to be calming. And now I feel like this is my chance to take control of my life and end it in a moment of total peace. Itâ€™s relaxing and Iâ€™m so comforted by global isolation that I feel like I would miss the chance to die in the best possible way. I have the chance of a lifetime to choose my perfect end and Iâ€™m happy for the first time in a long time  for this opportunity.
