I'm pretty sure I want to die.I don't think I can live with myself any more. I'm a continual disappointment to myself and others. Over the past few days i've been calculating the necessary amount of cyanide solution that I use at work that I'd need to drink to kill myself. It would be ridiculously easy to do, and the only thing holding me back is my cowardice. 

I know that those around me would be better off with me dead, as I know my the student loans my mom took out for me would be wiped out and she could certainly use the money seeing as she's facing bankruptcy. My fiancee left me a few months ago, and I broke some girl's heart on the rebound. My job is shitty, I've got few prospects, and I hate what I do. I feel like I've wasted my entire life and maybe the best thing to do would be to end it. 

I can't seek professional help, as I work in a classified facility, and that shit is enough to revoke my clearance and get me fired, putting me into an even worse position than I already am.  I really, really just would like to die peacefully right now.
