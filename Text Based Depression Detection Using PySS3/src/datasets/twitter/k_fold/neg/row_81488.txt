I don't want to come back from thisjI think my boyfriend and I are breaking up.  We've been together for 2 1/2 years, and I really, really thought he was my soulmate, my one.  He thought so too.  He even was talking, last week, about two years from now giving me his car when he gets a new one, and we JUST re-signed a lease for a whole year where we live, and now he's telling me he doesn't want to be with me long-term.

I don't understand what went wrong.  I can move back to my mom's place, but I have no idea why this is happening.  I don't know when everything changed.  And i feel like the road ahead will kill me.  I'm hoping it does.  I don't want to live through all the hurt and pain this is going to take.
