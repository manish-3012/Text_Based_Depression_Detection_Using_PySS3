Fake Suicide Attempt. Help?No one takes me seriously, no one believes that I need help.
Granted, I haven't spoken to a professional, but the only one I have access to is my high-school guidance counselor, who I've known for years and considers me far too "bubbly, successful and happy" to ever be depressed. 
I've told friends, trusted adults, and constantly run into the "it's just a phase" reaction. I WANT TO KILL MYSELF. I think it about it all day, every day; the only reason I haven't yet is because of my brother. I've lost my appetite, and almost 20 pounds. I don't sleep much, and when I do, it's at irregular intervals. I've lost my passion for all the things I used to love (acting, ice-hockey, playing six instruments, etc.). I'm in a position (junior year, 15 years old) where I should be getting excited about college and my future, but I've set graduation as my dead-line: if I don't get help by then, I'm just going to check out early.

I need help, but no one takes me seriously so I can't get it. I want to die, can't stop thinking about it, but can't die because my brother needs me here: how can I make it look like I tried to kill myself, but failed? I'm assuming the easiest way is to make it look like a drug overdose. What can I take lots of that won't actually kill me? What's the limit? I'm 5'2" and I weigh about 110 lbs. 

Help me, reddit.
