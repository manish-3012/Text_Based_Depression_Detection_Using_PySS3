Already have plans of doing it, Just waiting for the perfect time.I'm about to end it all, but I need some help. I'm thinking of drug overdose as my way but idk if it has risks of failing so let me know. Also I keep changing my mind whenever I'm about to do it but not this time, I'm just too tired of my family, I don't have time, not even a single second to rest.
