Got into a heated argument with the only friend I have left who supports me. I think my disease destroyed our friendship forever.  He's always trying to push his strict religious view on me and make me pray. He will insist my situation will not change until I start having faith in God and pray 5 times a day. Other than that, he is very supportive and has been a great friend. However, because we don't see eye to eye on this, it is destroying our friendship. Im visiting him for the first time in years (was not able to get out of bed for a few years) and we have been arguing more than ever. The fact that we are both bipolar, and not being treated properly for it, makes things worse though. He is also support my stay with him financially since I have no money or job, so If I dont conform to his religious beliefs I can get punished in certain ways. he is an AMAZING friend though, and very good person.


**This is my response to him, he went to sleep, so I will post in here, in case I forget:**


**He did sick things to me and my family, I fucking hate him. I hate what I see when I look in the mirror. I hate that he is a part of me. I feel disgusting and impure, I will not have kids and I will suggest to my siblings to do the same to stop his sickness from spreading. He has destroyed everyone and everything in his path and he feeds off of the people who are closest to him and it makes him more powerful and confident.**


    
   I hate my genetics because of him, even the bodytype I have which I acquired from his side of the family. When I look in the mirror, I hate myself. He has sucked the life out of me. I am fucked up. I don't know who I am anymore but I know I am not like other humans. I feel like an alien on my own planet. I get defensive when I get criticized because I was a helpless child and he permanently damaged my character and who I was supposed to become. 


   Every bad decision I made in life is directly related to him, and it effects the rest of my family, and I hate that, they are going through enough as is. I hate being blamed for them because he created this disease inside of me and he should take responsibility for it. I am permanently damaged because of him and I can't change that..... 


   This disease is what caused me to make all these bad decisions in my life and he created it. He permanently damaged my mom and all of my siblings as well in different ways and drove them apart from each other. I hate myself for hurting those closest to me. Being the first and oldest son I got the bottom of the barrel, I was hit the hardest by his sickness.


He sucked the life out of all of this and absorbed it. I did not ask for any of this nor agree to it. I did not ask to be here. I do not want to be here right now.


God, if you are real, Why? 

**I hope I can try to salvage my relationship with my only friend who still supports me**



**Things have been continually getting worse for the past year, and every day is the worst day of my life. I think I just lost my only friend. I don't want to kill myself, I just want to be cured, but I think I am incurable and death may be the only way out (if things keep getting worse)?**
