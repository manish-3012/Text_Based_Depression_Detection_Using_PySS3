I feel annoyed when I hear the term "Mentally Ill"I just feel like to say someone is mentally ill somehow blames them for it asif it's them thats broken and they have no reason to be depressed etc other than the disease whereas most of the time the diseases arise due to something thats's very much real, I don't know if anyone agrees but I'd like to hear your thoughts
