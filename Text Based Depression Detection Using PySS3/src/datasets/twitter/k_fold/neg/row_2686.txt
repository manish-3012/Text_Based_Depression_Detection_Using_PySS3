i am lost and aloneeverything in my life is without value
i am 16 years old
my a level exams are in a month and a half
i need to get straight as, i will only get bs
i am suffering from severe mental health problems
i dont want to see my doctor because the thoughts i have meean i will be sectioned and my entire life will go away
god isnt listening i used to turn to my faith when i was most in need but i find no hope there
my friends love me but theres nothing they can do, theyre all kids themselves i am too far gone
my mum is severely mentally ill and has been for 14 years, she blames me
i blame myself
she told me when i was eight

i have tried seven times in the last 2 years, thrre has always been something to stop me, a message from a friend or fate making me throw up fuck knows how much of pills. there is nothing. nothing gives me any hope or happiness of any kind, i am completely done.

i have nothing to offer to the world and the world has nothing to offer to me
