I feel like I don't deserve/was never supposed to be alive.The fact that I have such a big ego that I am not appreciative of the amazing things I have in my life and keep getting stuck on an endless loop of wanting to leave it all makes me want to kill myself even more. Why can't I just be normal and not have suicidal thoughts when there are literally people in the world with nothing and they still appreciate everything. 

I am 24 year old with a secure job as a teacher and happily engaged to the love of my life. And yet I still let things that happened decades ago overwhelm me and make me feel small and anxious. It's like I'm obsessed with reliving these events as a form of self-harm and I don't know why. I could just make a radical change in my life and get a new job or go travelling or something but I know that my thoughts will follow me everywhere I go for the rest of my life which is depressing AF.
