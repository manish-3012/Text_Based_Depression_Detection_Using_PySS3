Having a rough time after brother's death and having numerous suicidal thoughts lately.Two years ago this November would be the anniversary of my older brother's death. It was completely unexpected and I watched it happen right before my eyes. He had two kids that I was close to, especially his son and I hardly get to see him because my sister in law started dating someone 2 weeks after he died. This also turned out to be one of my brothers friends, and it turns out he is a real dirtbag. She is pretty much under his spell and my sister in law hardly let's my parents and I see the kids anymore.

I think I'm on the brink of doing something stupid like offing myself recently.  I know it's stupid and my brother wouldn't want it, but everyday I live and that fucktard my sister in law is dating lives, but my brother doesn't is just too much to handle. I woke up a couple weeks ago to finding a bunch of suicide notes I blackout drunkenly written to my family and close friends. When I drink, I drink til I blackout. I need help, and reddit is probably a poor choice to find it, but whatever. If someone has some insight please share.
