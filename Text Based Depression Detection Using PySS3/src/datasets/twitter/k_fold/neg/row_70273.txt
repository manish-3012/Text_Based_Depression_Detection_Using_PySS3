I had an abortion less than two weeks ago and had unprotected sex last night, one night standI feel like my behavior has been really out of control recently, I have been treating my body and myself like a piece of shit. 

My ex dumped me a year ago after telling me he had fucked someone else. Since then I've had a lot of unprotected sex. With six different men, mostly one or two night stands. I think it's just wanting to be close to someone. 

So I got pregnant by a man that I really liked. I had the abortion and knew I wasn't supposed to have sex for at least two weeks to try to prevent an infection. I got extremely drunk last night and even though I didn't want to have sex it happened. I didn't tell him no and I suppose that's because I did want it on some level - just to be close to someone I guess. Neither of us had a condom and he pulled out.

And then today when I looked like absolute shit I ran into my ex for the first time in ages. I feel like that was the straw that broke the camel's back. I just feel so distressed and like I can't cope with the feeling. I'm having suicidal thoughts now. 

I have a long history of depression but it hasn't been this bad for about a year. I feel so out of control and ashamed of myself.
