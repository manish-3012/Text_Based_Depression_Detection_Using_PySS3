What should I do if i think my friend in a different country might commit suicide!I live in the US and my friend lives in Ecuador and she said goodbye forever and i asked her to please not hurt herself. What should I do? Would i be liable for it? I have asked her not to and tried to help. She said that i cannot report her to the police because i do not know her real name or address. I just don't want to be liable.
