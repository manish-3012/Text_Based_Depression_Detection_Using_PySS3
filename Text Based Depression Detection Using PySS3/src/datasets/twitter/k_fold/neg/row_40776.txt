Checking inThe last few weeks have been really bad for me. I have a long history of severe anxiety, panic attacks, and depression. It has impacted my performance at work in both past and present situations. I am fearful and ashamed of how this makes me look to coworkers. My work is in the social services / education field and it was always really meaningful to me. Because of similar situations in the past sometimes I would quit this work and go take a job in another field (service, retail) so to feel like I have failed at the work that was meaningful to me iin public ways is horrifying to me. Please don't suggest therapy to me I have been seeing a wonderful shrink for three years, he's my only support system and he cannot be there twenty four seven. I have spent a huge portion of time in hotlines. I called the other day in the middle of a panic attack, I was audibly upset. The woman sounded nervous and agitated because I was upset. Within two minutes she started asking me about medication and suggesting websites to me, instead of just listening. I hung up. I have already given notice at my job, during a calmer moment (I know it's not good for me to stay) and I thought I would have two months to finish some projects and say goodbye to my students. Other problems though have escalated there and I'm a crumpled panic attack mess every day. It's taking a toll. I feel ashamed and weak. I need a place to check in but I do not want to upset others.
