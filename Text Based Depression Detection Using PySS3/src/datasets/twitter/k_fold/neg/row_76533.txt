I hate myself so much.I get told to kill myself on Reddit daily. My parents tell me to kill myself once a month at least. I don't have any friends and my fiancÃ© is all I had to keep me sane.

I'm going to tie a belt around my neck and stand up on a chair. And then I'm going to call my parents until they answer and I'll kick the chair out from under me.

See ya, Reddit.
