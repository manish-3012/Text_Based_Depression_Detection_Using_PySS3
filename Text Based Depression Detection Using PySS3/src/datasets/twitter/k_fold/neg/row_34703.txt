A dead kid I dont know has helped me more than all of my friends combinedLast year, my friends boyfriend killed himself. Hes the reason I didnt do it last year, he the reason Im not gonna do it now. None of my "friends" care, despite me saying how sad I am. No one in my family even notices. The only reason Im not dead is because someone else killed themselves, and I dont wanna die too close to his death date.
