My mother is having suicidal thoughts and this is making me so sad that I have them tooMy mother and father split up almost 10 years ago and currently she lives with my brother but he does not give a shit about her. Last week we had one of our worst fights and we did not talk until then. Today she came to tell me that she should have died in 2011 and that life does not pay any more.

I'm 20 and I'm having to deal with the fact that my mother wants to kill herself constantly, alone. On the other hand I have to deal with my father who is also a difficult person to deal with, and I am also going through several phases of life, all at the same time, and so I do not have the energy to dedicate my mother. Since I'm not living with my mother, it's hard to follow her to know how determined she is to commit.

I have had strong suicidal thoughts and today I can deal fairly well with them, but my fear is that if anything happens to my mother, I do not know if I could handle my suicidal thoughts well. And the more time passes, the more my mother loses her reason to live and falls to suicide. Please, help me, I do not know what else to do. It's like I'm in a loop and can not do what it takes to get my mother out of it and it makes me sadder. We had a talk today, and tomorrow morning I'll schedule a session with a psychologist as soon as possible for her. What else can I do to get these thoughts out of her head?
