my best friend has expressed her interest in suicide to me and i have encouraged her to get professional help but she takes her mental health as a joke. i donâ€™t know what to do.my best friend of 10 years confides in me about a lot of her problems... and mid year she started expressing her interest in suicide to me.
of course i let her vent to me all the time,
however i started to get extremely worried when she told me she started harming and i noticed scars. i encouraged and still encourage her to seek professional help but she denies she needs it,  and just turns it all into a joke. for example, iâ€™ll be explaining the importance of mental well-being and sheâ€™ll either change the subject completely or just laugh at it. she wonâ€™t take anyone seriously and i have no idea what to do.
