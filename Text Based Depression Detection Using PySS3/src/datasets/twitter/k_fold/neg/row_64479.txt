Questions..So i'm getting kind of scared of myself.. I don't want to bore anybody with reasons about why i want to end it all.. But for a few years i'm considering to kill myself, the thing that stopped me until this very moment are the questions like "what would person X,Y  think about me when it's over?", " what if i fail?" and such.. Till this day those questions prevented the attempts, but now i just don't care.

Can somebody please explain why i don't care anymore? is it a phase or what? Thank you.
