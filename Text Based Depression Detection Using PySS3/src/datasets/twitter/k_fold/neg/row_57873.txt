quarantine has been hardMy dad killed himself last year. I stupidly decided to stay in school that term and failed all my classes. in fall i thought i was better and tried school again. i failed all my classes. this year i thought i could change things. that iâ€™d see how my classes went and give up if i failed again. i had straight aâ€™s until spring break. i thought i was really changing. then this whole quarantine happened and i couldnt handle the stress. my internet doesnt work at home so i had to use my phone connection for everything but the reception is also bad. i didnt really have any other options so i ended up missing much of my class and homework. every time i got motivated enough i couldnt get anything done because of the internet. i eventually just gave up. now i failed all my classes again and i dont think i can keep going. is my life going to fall apart every time something goes slightly wrong? i cant keep living like this, and my life doesnt make me happy anymore. i feel like ive already given up and im just biding my time until my dadâ€™s gun is released to me
