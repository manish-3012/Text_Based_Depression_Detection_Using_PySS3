I'm not sure I can do this any longerI've been thinking about ending my life for over a month now. Everyone tells me to hold on things will get easier but they haven't they just keep getting harder and harder I may not even have a place to live in a few weeks and my ridiculous anxiety hasn't helped me at all. I'm not sure what I have left all my goals have been cut short. I've got no social life my parents are over my depression and anxiety coming and going I just don't know I feel like taking my life is my only option.
