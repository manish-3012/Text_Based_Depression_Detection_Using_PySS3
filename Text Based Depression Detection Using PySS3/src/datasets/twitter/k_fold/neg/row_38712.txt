Ghosted by a girl who I thought loved meA few months ago I was in the darkest part of my life, I found myself browsing this sub for hours with people who shared my pain. Many of you lovely people helped me through the pain, and I can't thank you enough. Not too long after I met a girl who I really liked and it gave me hope. We got along great and eventually she confessed that she really liked me too... I have never heard that from someone before and it made me want to be alive so I could pursue this feeling. We ended up having our first date and we both had a lovely day. Afterwards we both agreed that a relationship would be too much so we decided to put it on hold for a bit while we get through this year of university... We kept checking up on each other every couple of days to make sure we're alright and I was happy with that.

Today I messaged her asking if she was alright... She didn't respond. Instead, she blocked me off all social media without any explanation. I felt all the happiness decaying from all the times we'd talk about music, Zelda, films and each other. She was even aware that I tried to commit suicide a few weeks before I met her, I can't believe she would do this to me.

You were the loveliest person I've ever met and I can't fathom why someone as special as you would do this to someone you care about...
