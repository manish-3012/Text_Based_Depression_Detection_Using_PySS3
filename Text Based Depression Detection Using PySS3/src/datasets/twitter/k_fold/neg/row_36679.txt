If I canâ€™t kill myself, what do I do?This sounds stupid, but what are alternatives to Suicide. I really really want to kill myself, but I understand I canâ€™t because of my dog, my parents, and finals coming up. Is there anything that can get a feeling like Suicide without literal death? Does anyone else have this crazy desire to die but feel socially obligated to stay just to make another person feel better about themselves? Besides coloring or other coping mechanisms, or self harm, are there other options?
