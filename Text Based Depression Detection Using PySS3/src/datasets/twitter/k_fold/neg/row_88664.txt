Any suggestions? Disappointed gay loser seeks escape from crippling depression and fearIâ€™m new to reddit. If this post attracts any attention, Iâ€™m sure it will come from trolls. I'm not a sympathetic person. I've had a lot of advantages in life. I'm sure this post makes me sound like a privileged asshole. But Iâ€™m still desperate for reasons to live. Will you please give me reasons to believe itâ€™s worth it?

**My situation:**

\-27 year old under-employed lawyer who has been applying to jobs for over a year; passed two notoriously difficult bar exams; applies to a dozen new jobs a week, and despite many interviews, Iâ€™ve landed no offers.

\-After living happily and independently for much of the past decade, Iâ€™ve spent the last year living in my childhood bedroom, sharing the house with my retired parents-- quiet, cold people who canâ€™t hide their disappointment. I borrow my mom's car on the days I work. 

\-Even with two jobs, I make less per month than I owe on my student loans and health insurance, and my savings are down 75% since I lost my job last spring.

\-My boyfriend dumped me two weeks ago; I met him when I was a law student and he was applying to law schools; I wrote his application essays and encouraged him to stick to his plan in moments of great doubt; he wound up going to the same law school I attended, where he is thriving in a way I never did; a few days before he dumped me, he got a very prestigious job offer that I could never have dreamed of landing, and he got it using a fictional essay I wrote for him; Iâ€™m bitter and angry about the timing; I feel used and discarded; we were long distance for most of the relationship-- not a great dynamic despite many visits-- but he was my closest friend, and to lose him now, as I face the deepest, most discouraging stretch of my life is debilitating to say the least. I want him back, terribly, but whenever weâ€™ve spoken, heâ€™s lukewarm and ambiguous. I donâ€™t know if wanting him stems purely from love or from a longing for stability. 

\-Iâ€™ve lost touch with all my friends, who either live on the opposite side of the country, or far from the place where we grew up (and where Iâ€™ve had to relocate to live at home); they either donâ€™t know my situation or are shocked by it. Those who know never cease to remind me of how much potential I have, yet here I am, in my parentsâ€™ unheated dining room, sending out a desperate plea for help on an anonymous internet forum.

\-Sometimes I'm social, but I always hide my gloom. In those moments-- usually dinners or parties-- I'll pack away my problems and play the part of the confident, goofy friend; I listen to people's problems; I try to be helpful and encouraging; one person recently told me I was the life of her party; other people tell me how funny I am or how their partners privately really like me even if they don't have the courage to tell me; it feels good hearing this at least until I remember what they've encountered is me playing a role. I don't feel like the person they think I am. Not at all. 

\-The world is in free fall. Bigots and liars run the government; the natural world no longer follows reliable patterns; justice isnâ€™t rewarded even on the rare occasion that it appears; half the time I talk to another person, they just want to sell me something; everything comes in plastic wrap and looks the same; cars are ugly; clothes are ugly; restaurants sell little portions of greasy crap, which they expect us to share with everyone else at the table; I donâ€™t understand how popular music or dance works; I stayed up the other night to watch the Oscars and predicted every big win, though I thought few of them were deserved; the stock market is rallying endlessly and I have no way of capitalizing on any of it. For a few hours a day, I just stare at my phone, my jaw dropped at the ways our time sucks. People my age will work harder for less rewards in a crumbling world where the culture is thoughtless and the population is understandably but regrettably selfish.  

\-I would have offed myself a long time ago, but I feel trapped by the people who love me. My parents donâ€™t show it, but I know theyâ€™re worried. My grandma, who always had such hope for me, now canâ€™t look me in the eye. She says she prays for me. Sometimes sheâ€™ll come over and give me fifty dollars in cash like Iâ€™m a kid on my birthday. But Iâ€™m not a kid anymore. I canâ€™t live feeling like thatâ€™s all I am. I feel like Iâ€™ve exhausted my effort to turn around my life. I donâ€™t know what else to do. I canâ€™t afford to move out of here given my salary and debts. I try to develop new skills and network but none of it has paid any returns. 

\-I fantasize about buying a ticket to Paris and maxing out my credit cards on hotels and food; when my credit runs out, Iâ€™ll jump headfirst into the river and hope Iâ€™m unconscious when I drown. In a sense, thatâ€™s already how I feel. Unconscious and drowning.  (Sorry for the melodrama.)

**What would you do? How would you take the arc of a life like mine and bend it up again? I'm all out of ideas and I'm desperate for yours.**
