Sometimes I think I am on the brink of insanitySometimes I think I am on the brink of insanity. Yes, I got my ADHD diagnosis so I know that it really isn't my fault, but no, the neurotypical people around me don't understand.

I have been feeling extremely miserable and struggling with some assignments at college. I think I have asked my peers for homework help too many times and some are deliberately shunning me.

I sometimes think that ADHD is a fucking joke where people see you as crying wolf all the time due to the fucking nature of this disorder. I've only been diagnosed within two months and my parents shamed me into thinking that I have not been trying hard enough. They never see the aspects where I am slowly improving and it seems like they are expecting some miracle where I will suddenly become perfect.

To them, it is always my fucking fault. My country doesn't have cognitive behavioral therapy so I have been seeking help from a therapist at my uni. I didn't really click with her. On the suggestion of my psychiatrist, I asked for a therapist change. Only one person is in charge of the administration there and she ignored. When I told my parents this, it is my fucking fault again.

My parents really distrust my psychiatrist and think that she lied about how the public healthcare system does not accept ADHD patients and now I don't know if I can trust my doc as well. My parents also think that I am deliberately lying about my problems so that she feels sorry for me.

I feel like my very existence is a fucking joke and because of this I can never be happy. ADHD is a fucking joke and people see us as crying wolf. I feel like I am on the brink of insanity and there have been numerous moments where I empathise with spree killers as I can understand why they went insane. I won't do that myself (guns are illegal here) but I can feel the pain of forever being seen as not good enough and as an outsider.
