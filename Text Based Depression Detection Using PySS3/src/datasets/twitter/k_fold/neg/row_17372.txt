Done4 years ago I was in a car accident that left me with a lot of brain trauma and mental suffering. My best friend and the only person I feel like I could call that abandoned me immediately after. I moved away after a year of solitude to be with basically a stranger in hopes for any kind of love/happiness, and he cheated on me and blamed me for everything. I can't drive because of panic, can't even hold down a job (or even get hired now) and feel so stuck. I've been with my bf (ex's friend) for 2 years and rely on him to get by at all, but I wish he would just leave me so I could kill myself. I'm exhausted from feeling so suicidal every single day, but being too worthless to even go through with it even after all these years.
