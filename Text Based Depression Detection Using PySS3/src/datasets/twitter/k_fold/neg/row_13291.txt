Please help meI canâ€™t live anymore, my family doesnâ€™t love me and I donâ€™t have any close friends. My parents are always mean to me and donâ€™t care about my emotions. Theyâ€™ve known about my suicidal thoughts but make fun of me for it. they thinking Iâ€™m trying to make them lose money when I ask to find a therapist. Iâ€™m 15F. So I cant do anything about it. Everyday is torture because Iâ€™m so lonely and so unloved. Iâ€™m scared to do it but its my only choice. Please help me try to commit. Iâ€™m not sure how Iâ€™d like to do it...if anyone can help me find an easy way Iâ€™ll be extremely thankful.
