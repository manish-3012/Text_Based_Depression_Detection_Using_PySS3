Been sleeping a lot lately. Don't want to wake up.I've been sleeping like 16-20 hours a day lately because I literally have no reason to be awake. I can barely bring myself to do basic tasks and nothing brings me any joy whatsoever, nothing makes me feel relaxed or happy. I don't even have the energy to make shit on my computer anymore. Why bother, no one cares what I make anyway. I don't have anything to look forward to. I always feel like I'm about to pass out from exhaustion, or cry, or both. This is long, sorry.


My life is pretty boring and empty, and I'm going stir crazy from lack of a social life. I have no job because I'm waiting on documents and I have a pretty complicated medical condition. Even though I desperately want a job, I have to wait. Everyone else is hanging out with their friends and going to college and I'm sitting around alone and miserable stuck inside all day. No friends I can hang out with on a regular basis to gush about video games and horror with. I don't have anybody with the same interests as me. I can't even turn to fandom because nobody gives a shit about the characters I like, and I've looked it up.


People are just rude to me whenever I bring up my interests or ignore them all together. Maybe they tolerate them, but that's not very enjoyable. I want to be friends with someone passionate about the same things as me. I have people I get along with sometimes, sure, but I feel like an alien talking to them. There's no connection, it's just me making funny jokes. Hanging out with people feels like a chore because I don't click with anyone. Not that I have anyone to hang out with anymore, having moved last year and the only acquaintances I've met being unable to go anywhere due to strict parents.


Over all, I've felt depressed like this since I was a child and have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and PTSD. I've been through some horrible shit in my short 18.9 years and yet I still feel like a weak bastard for being sad about it. Don't have any clue where I'm going in life. Literally what is the point of waking up anymore? Oh no I might miss sitting around on my ass all day because there's nothing else to do! Fuck this. I'm almost 19 and I'm already a worthless loser. I have absolutely nothing of value to offer this world.


It's not that I want to die, really. I love and value life, but the passage of time, and consequently, death, freaks me out. Time is moving by so fucking fast while I'm sitting here alone and depressed. I want to enjoy life the best I can. The problem is, I can't. I can't fight anymore. I'm getting worse and worse every year and now that I'm an adult, I feel even more helpless.
