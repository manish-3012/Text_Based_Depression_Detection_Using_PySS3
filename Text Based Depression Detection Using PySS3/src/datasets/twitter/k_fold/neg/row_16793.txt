Everyday. I think about it.Every day I think about the end. Usually suicide, sometimes acts of great violence against myself. I'm never sure whether I have an impulse or urge. Or whether it's idle fantasy. But the thoughts are there. Every day.

I live my life as many do, wearing different masks. Not many would guess at my underlying turmoil and torment. All the significant persons in my life see me as a person of intelligence, humour, kindness and dependability.

If only they knew what lied beneath. My complete and utter hatred I keep for myself. And the contempt that I have for all others. Every human being, exacts a price on you. All love is conditional. And when you no longer meet conditions....

I hate the game I was forced to play by birth. My biological parents for whatever reason, passed me off as soon as I was born. I am an unwanted person. In all the years I have lived, the constant I have had is disappointment. Eternal and ever lasting.

I came to the conclusion, some many years ago, that I am not special. Neither desired nor required. My ending of life bears no real impact on this world. Pain is only temporary. I will be a memory for a short while. Then I will fade from consciousness. Forgotten.

I sincerely wish, that I could find a safe and dignified way to completely stop being. Just pass away quietly. And allowed to be forgotten. A line put through my name and dismissed as a failed person.

But wishes aren't real. One has to evoke change on their own initiative. And so I embark on a journey, to discover the courage I need to commit to my final act.

I hope that courage finds me soon....
