Howdy. I should be up for the next few hours, so feel free to message me.Edit: A loved one of mine just returned from the hospital. I'm going to go check on them and then go to bed. It has been wonderful talking to all of you and I'll be back tomorrow.

Take care, everyone.

Howdy.

I've been around here for a while (mostly at night) commenting and decided to see how effective these types of posts are. 

To give you a bit of insight, I'm a male with Serotonin deficiency, Dyslexia, ADHD, and Insomnia. Throughout most of my life,  I was bullied. I was dragged across barbed wire, had a gun held up to me, and I just felt like dirt.

Like a lot of you, I wanted to die. I was suicidal for 9 years and had 5 attempts. I know how much it hurts to feel worthless, alone, and abused. I know how much mistakes can hurt, too. I want to help you through it. Why?

Because I genuinely care about each and every one of you. I really do.
