Suicidal Paradox? Anyone else?Iâ€™m morbidly suicidal, hopeless and have no desire to live in the future. I feel no guilt about this (anymore) and have no concerns for the people Iâ€™d leave behind-Iâ€™m an unwanted burden and it crushes my soul (I am concerned about my dog, though.) I wonâ€™t even bother with a note.
SO, why is it I feel such compassion for others who share their stories and instinctively donâ€™t want them to do it? I understand feeling that way before I was in the depths, but here I am, working up the courage to kill myself, yet deeply affected by others who want to die. Please let me go- but you hold on.
