i think the only reason i want to kill myself and all my sadness is over my crushthats the only thing i can see, i havent even asked her out or anything im just to socially awkwared to talk to her and multiple other things. maybe im sub concsiously fucked due to bad family situations but i dont think. a few months ago my stepdad punched my mom into a wall i think then she stabbed him in the hand, my mom had to go to the police station for a couple hours and i was just alone, a family friend came after a few hours to get dinner but everything just felt so weird, anyway my stepdad got a intervention order and we had to stay at a friends house, the drive there felt weird and i wasnt scared just a little angry. i dont know man i mean ive got something to live for getting a new pc soon but my crush holy shit i feel so fucking bad man i feel like such a creep man ive fucking hugged my pillow thinking about her i nearly fucking cried everyday i think about her and all i want is a fucking hug but she barely knows me, the only fucking reason my brain got this attachment is because she was the first girl that was ever nice to me which sounds like some niceguys shit, how do i get over her?
