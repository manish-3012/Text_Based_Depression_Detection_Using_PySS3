21st BirthdayWelp, turning 21 in a little less than 2 weeks. Iâ€™ve told myself since my early teenage years that if things werenâ€™t better by then that I would pull the plug. I had numerous instances where I came close, where I thought my mind was made up. 

The girl I fell in love with was the only one who could understand and help me, yet I had to walk away from her because she could not return my feelings. It was simply too hard to keep her around, despite the fact that we were mutually best friends. Now here I sit, no friends, no support system, living in literal agony.

Iâ€™m bi polar and have terrible anxiety. I can hardly speak aloud in class without coming to the edge of a panic attack. I scream in my car when Iâ€™m alone on the freeway. Thereâ€™s so much built up agony and I have no way to resolve any of my issues. I take medicine, I see a psychiatrist and a therapist. None of this has changed the fact that I hate myself and have nothing to fill my heart. 

Iâ€™ve been in love, but have never been loved. Not on a romantic level. Iâ€™m unable to discuss these things with my family as Iâ€™m ridiculed for â€œbeing selfishâ€. Itâ€™s hard, I want to kill myself but my dad is already dying as it is. He has 2 years at the most and to take my own life while heâ€™s on the brink would only make matters worse.
Iâ€™m just so sick of being guilted out of it. Nobody understands the pain. Life is hell. I wish to end it, I just need to push through the guilt and worry about my own pain.
