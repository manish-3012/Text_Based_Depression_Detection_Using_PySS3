I just don't want it to hurtIm done. 

Im hopeless. I'm ruined. I'm nothing. 

Not existing is what I want. It will never get better. I need to die. I jus't don't want it to hurt. Maybe the short lasting excruciating pain of dying is worth no pain ever again. Idk. Im scared to do it though. 

Theres also never a good time to do it. It's always going to be terrible. Today is fathers day, so I won't do it today. But then its family visiting and holidays coming up etc. Theres never a good time. Id always ruin something. 

I have to figure out a way though. The carbon monoxide car method seems the best. That way I fall asleep and it seems painless. I don't want to slit my wrists or hang myself. 

My life's over at the ripe old age of 23.
