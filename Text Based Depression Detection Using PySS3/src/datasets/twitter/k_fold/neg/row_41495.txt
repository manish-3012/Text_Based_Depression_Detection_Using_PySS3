I can't take it anymoreI'm done. I'm just done. I've tried and tried and tried and tried but nothing changes. Just the same pain everyday of being forced to do schoolwork by law that already makes me want to blow my brains out.  


I'm too much of a pussy to even cut myself deeper than a scratch, let alone kill myself, I'm not even brave enough to end this miserable cycle. It has no other solution. I have tried everything. Nothing helps. The only thing that would give me true happiness would be a way out of this god-awful miserable existence that does nothing but bring me pain every goddamn day.  


Just make it stop, make it stop... I can't deal with this anymore. I'm done. I don't even do school shit anymore, I'm just lying to my mom and not doing any work. I don't care. It's a magnet school, and I'm supposedly "gifted" and it should "come easy to me". I don't care anymore. ADD doesn't fucking help either. Just adds to the misery.  


I give up. I'm basically just waiting for death. Nothing ever helps, it doesn't make this world change its ways. If I'm being forced to do life the way most people are, then I'm never going to get better. I fucking can't anymore.
