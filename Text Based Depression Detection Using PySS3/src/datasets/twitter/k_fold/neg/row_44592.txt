iv had this mindset for 7 years, and now things are piling up again.I recently quit my job due to extreme pain in my foot, I was off sick for my last few shifts and my doctor is being difficult regarding giving a sick note.

The company I used to work for owe me so much money (Â£500+) and it is really difficult recovering it.

My life is not mine, if is for my parents to control, I live in "their house" so their rules. There is 0 peace. I cannot ever get any peace because they talk loud all the time, and when I tell them to talk at normal level I get the response "shut up its my house" "get your own house". I can't afford a house, my family is very controlling and cult like. I cant get my own house but this pressure is pushing me to the edge. Last time I told my family I wanted to kill myself they beat me then told other people (what stopped me was my brother in law killed him self around that time (for unknown reasons) and it shocked/scared me).

Its not my life and I cannot handle this mental stress anymore. Things have only gotten worse over the last few months. Im slightly spiraling into debt with my current loans (I can pay them back, but the interest over time adds up :/).

I get 0 peace. I want peace, not hearing my parents chat shit about other people all the time, just quiet peace. I don;t know how i can get this.
