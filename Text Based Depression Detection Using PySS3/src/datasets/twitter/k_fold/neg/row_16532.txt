I just want to die.I'm not worth anything. I don't add anything to this world. I'm just fucking trash. I just want to rest. I don't want this fucking voice screaming in my head. 

I don't know where to go. I think I have friends but they hate me in my mind. I think I have family but they wish I was burning in hell right now.

I lost the love of my life and she hates me. I don't know why, but that's what my fucking mind is telling me. 

I can't speak to anyone because they think I'm trash and something to discarded. At least, that's what my mind is screaming at me. They want me to disappear so I can't annoy anyone anymore.

Everything and everyone would be better, if I never existed.

I'm nothing but filth. I'm worth nothing. I wish I could just rest and go to sleep. I'm so tired. I can never rest. I don't know what I am anymore.
