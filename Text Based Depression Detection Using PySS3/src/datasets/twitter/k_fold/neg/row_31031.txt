On the vergeBeing in the military, itâ€™s a normal thing for people you know to die overseas or commit suicide. A very good soldier killed himself earlier this week and I feel like I canâ€™t handle losing any more brothers. They just all keep dying and leaving their wifes and children behind and I sit here and wonder why Iâ€™m spared. I want it to be me instead of them and I canâ€™t deal with knowing that such outstanding people have passed away instead of me due to feeling inadequate. I was supposed to call my family tonight and talk to them but I canâ€™t bring myself to do it. I might just do it without saying goodbye to anyone
