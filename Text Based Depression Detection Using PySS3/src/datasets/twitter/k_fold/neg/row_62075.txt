I Hate How Often I Have To Tell My Friend's That Their Lives Matter...Why do I do it? I care about them. They think I don't know what it's like. My mother has abused me for my entire life.  I've run out of things to tell them. I don't know what to do anymore.  They've asked me so many times if they can just die. I hate it so much...
