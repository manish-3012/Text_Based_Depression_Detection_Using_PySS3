Abuse in mental hospitals?How common is abuse in mental hospitals? I hear orderlies drug you until you're barely conscious, then beat you for hours on end. Then the "doctors" do everything they can to hold you hostage there for eternity. How common is this? If these places only exist to abuse then I will just kill myself, this isn't worth it anymore.
