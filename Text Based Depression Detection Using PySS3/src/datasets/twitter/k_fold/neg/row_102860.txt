My girlfriend is emotionally hurtful. I confronted her about it and she became suicidal.Throw-away here. My girlfriend and I speak online throughout the week and meet on the weekends. We are both in school.

So for the past nine months of our one-year relationship my girlfriend has been on and off emotionally abusive. She's honestly the sweetest girl I've ever met but by god when she gets triggered by something small she goes all out and calls me the meanest things, cuts off all forms of contact, etc. Usually she would come back and apologize but slowly it has shifted to her putting all blame on me. I have tried telling to myself that it will get better constantly but it never does. Today after I tried to tell her online to get stress management help, she insisted that she doesn't and after I told her how much the emotional abuse hurts me, she said we should just end our relationship and I told her I was possibly planning on doing the same. She then begins going on a suicidal rant and telling me that if I don't take her back she will honest to god kill herself, and that she cant live without me. I have defused the situation and we are planning on meeting soon. I have an entire life ahead of me and I really  care about her. I want to end the relationship as it is taking a toll on me and get her help. What the fuck do I do, reddit?

I'd also like to find a way to do this without my parents being informed about any of this. Like if I call the suicide hotline I don't want to have to come and be interviewed and such. Should I tell her mom? I have her number.

Please help. I would prefer professional advice.
