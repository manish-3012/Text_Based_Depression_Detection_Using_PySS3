NumbnessI'm not sure what to think or do anymore. I'm not suicidal, I'm just looking for answers. I just feel numb. I tried reaching out to some faith and it only made me feel like an idiot for believing in such things. I could never explain all my thoughts in detail but I'm so lost. Lost in my conscience. I've locked myself into my own mind and it has gotten to the point where I just feel numb. I'm not a psycho or sociopath since I feel guilt, and remorse, but it seems like it's the only thing occupying my mind right now. I've hurt so many people in my life.. I just feel like I'm on autopilot now. My mind is so scattered and I'm just lost... I feel.. So strange now. So numb.. I don't know what to do or think. Can someone explain this to me? Something. Anything.. I just... dont know. I don't know anything anymore. I need some type of guidance. Something.
