Belt around my neckCurrently I have a belt around my neck and Iâ€™m not sure I want to tighten it just yet, but I feel like thereâ€™s no alternative to ending it right now. I canâ€™t keep living in misery and isolation anymore, especially when I also feel like I have no future. Schools starting in a day and I have no motivation to even show up, but I donâ€™t wanna keep disappointing my parents.  I have only one friend who probably hates me now, and I stupidly let my emotions revolve around her, which I keep doing with other people. With my lack of social skills and prospects, Iâ€™m bound to not make very far in life. Idk why Iâ€™m rambling on about nothing like anyone can do anything to help
