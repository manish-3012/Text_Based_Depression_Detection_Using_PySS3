Life being garbage justifies suicideIâ€™m tired of these retards telling me that it gets better or that thereâ€™s so much to live for. No motherfucker you couldnâ€™t be more wrong. Lonely Socially awkward outcast that canâ€™t even say a single sentence to another human being isnâ€™t a life worth living. Working and earning money is pointless because life is still empty and shitty. Itâ€™s always going to be garbage. I fucking hate existence. I canâ€™t even imagine a realistic life that would be worth it. It wonâ€™t get better and life will always be garbage. Ending it is my destiny.
