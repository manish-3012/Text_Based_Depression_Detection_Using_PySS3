I can't get it out of my headI'm talking with people who I believe to be my friends right now, and they have no idea how I currently feel. I've been depressed for a couple of years now, and yesterday, it hit hard. I got everything ready, and am prepared to do the deed on Tuesday (following the three-day rule). In the past, talking about my feelings to my family or friends have either driven them away, or led to insults. Nothing in my life is going as I want it to, and no matter how hard I try, the people I surround myself with never seem to find interest in our conversations. I don't know if posting here will help, but I just really needed to get this off my chest.
