Do I tell my therapist I want to kill myselfI already told her about my suicide ideation but promised not to do anything. However in two weeks I can kill myself by hanging. I am set to do it but there is an annoying voice telling me that its selfish and I need more help. But she will tell my parents as I am under the age and I dont want to cause a fuss. I think it probably would be better if I just do it and go.
