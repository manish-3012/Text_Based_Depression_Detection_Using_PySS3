I made the mistake of having hopeI tried, fucking goddammit. I took a chance and had hope and it all blew up in my face.
I'm now trapped and I'm crumbling. 
I'm sitting here sobbing like the fucking pathetic loser I am. 
I swear, I don't know what I want. 
I have no dreams, I just... I don't even fucking know. 
All I ever wanted is to have a purpose and here I am- 25 and nothing to show for it. 
I'm so tired, I just want to sleep for a long time. 
I don't even know why I'm writing this, there are more worthy people to care for.
