I changed my mindI posted earlier about ending it tonight. Iâ€™m the mom with 3 boys who wrote letters to everyone she loved. I wanted to say that Iâ€™m good. I have bipolar disorder and Iâ€™m in the process of transitioning meds and drs. I reached out to my boyfriend and he came over. He is understanding, kind, and loving. He was devastated but, he was at the appointment when they explained all the risks of switching meds. Thank you so much to everyone who commented and sent me chats. You are kind and wonderful people. I didnâ€™t know that so many strangers could be so wonderful to a stranger. You all helped me more than you know. Much love and respect to you all. â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
