Constantly tornNot a day goes by that I don't contemplate either packing all my shit in a truck and driving to somewhere across the country or just ending it now. I can't keep doing this. I've fucked up so much in 20 years there is no going back. I regret everything and nothing will ever change. Useless. I'm as worthless as everyone thinks I am.
