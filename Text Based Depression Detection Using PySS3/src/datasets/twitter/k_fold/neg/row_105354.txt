All I really want is too dieIf my parents died, so there wasn't someone an officer had to goto too say "sorry sir/ma'am but we need you to identify the body" i would be as soon as I could. I have the noose, just sitting in my car. I know where I'm going to do it, I know what I did wrong with tying it off last time. I spend most of my days imagining going to the spot, stepping out if my car onto the curb, walking under the bridge and through the trees to my death spot. It was so hard to do but now I know more or less the strength required to walk off that plank. I know where in myself I have to reach to walk forward with that rope around my neck. 

I'm not so stupid to say that in that half second of free fall, I will regret it. But every day I'm just filled with the stupidly numbing horrible depression. I regret most of my life, it makes sense I would regret the moments before death. But fuck fuck fuck I just want it to be over. 

I can't stop myself from doing stupid shit, its like I don't have a choice, I just see forward and I don't see paths. Just this one solitary line to the end
