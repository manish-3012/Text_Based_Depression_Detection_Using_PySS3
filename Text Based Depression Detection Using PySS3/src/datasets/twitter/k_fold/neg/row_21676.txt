I promised my husband that I wouldnâ€™t TRY to kill myself. After having surgery Monday night for my first pregnancy (ectopic) in 32 years after 3 years of trying I can honestly say that Iâ€™m on my fifth drink with pain killers and am not â€œtryingâ€ but it might just work anyway.It makes me feel a bit like an asshole but I also just donâ€™t care anymore. If nothing else maybe Iâ€™ll at least get some decent sleep.
