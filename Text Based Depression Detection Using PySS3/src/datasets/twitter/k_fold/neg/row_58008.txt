nobody was there for me when I was dying almost 3 yrs ago.all I keep thinking about is how I want to be loved for once in my life by someone other than my family and my family has their own issues and I can't see my life getting any better at all, every time i try to get better something gets in my way and I just want to hang myself to show everybody that ever met me that THEY are the reason, my only way of coping is by listening to music about suicide to make my feelings somewhat valid but nobody understands me and nobody gives a fuck at all about how I'm doing inside, nobody ever showed me love in the way that I wanted and now that I'm 24 everybody around me is just like "grow up, be a man" bullshit I would rather deprive everybody of my existence because they won't remember me when i'm gone. All I want to do is make them remember me somehow.

to preface this I also had a near death experience from a medical condition at 21 where I was in a short vegetative state and woke up in the hospital with nobody by my side to help me, that's what triggered all the hate for everybody because it made me truly see that when you die, you die alone and every so often I truly wish I let myself die that December instead of waking up.
