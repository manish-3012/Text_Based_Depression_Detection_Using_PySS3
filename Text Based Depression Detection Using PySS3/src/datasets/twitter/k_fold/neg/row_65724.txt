It doesn't seem to mean anything anymoreNothing I do these days feels like it matters. I have no one to share anything with. My days are spent alone and I wonder why I even bother getting up. I keep trying and I keep doing it but there is only so long I can chase the light at the end of the tunnel before my legs get tired. And they are getting very tired. I suppose if I do end it no one will mourn me as no one has noticed me all my life. But maybe, for just a little while they will know that I existed
