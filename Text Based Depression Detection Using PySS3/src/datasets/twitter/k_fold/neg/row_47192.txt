Why I'm inspired to be a Suicide Watcher.This was my friend [Erin](http://i.imgur.com/oUqff.jpg) who took her own life in 2004.  Her ashes were spread off the coast of Boston into the Atlantic.  We purchased an English Oak in her memory.  In the 6 years since her death this site has been one of solitude and reflection. We think about how precious life is and how fortunate we are to have loved one's in good times and in bad. Erin will always have a special place in our hearts and well be forever missed. 

I was inspired by [lylli88](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gnw0z/tomorrow_is_the_worst_day_of_the_year_for_me_and/) who posted a picture of her friend to help those that may be finding it tough to hang on.
