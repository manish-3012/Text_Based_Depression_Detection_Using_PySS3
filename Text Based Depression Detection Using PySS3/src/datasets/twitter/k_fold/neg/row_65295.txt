Too tired to thinkI feel dead. Nothing worth living for. No desire to live. Been stripped of my humanity. I'm just existing like one of those funky looking creatures floating aimlessly in the vast quiet blackness of the ocean depths. But it's so loud. I can't shut it out. I'm tormented daily by the noise of memories and the pounding of my heart and the meaninglessness of days. 

Help others? Just to be ripped apart, chewed up and spat out.

Every morning, every night. Every time my mind isn't distracted. 

Will my loved ones be okay?

I want it to be on my birthday because I was never meant to be born.
