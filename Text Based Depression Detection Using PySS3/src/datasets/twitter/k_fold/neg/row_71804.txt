Iâ€™m so tiredIâ€™m just so tired of battling... I feel like just when I have broken out of this destructive place, som how I manage to slip and each time I fall further and getting out is that much harder. Itâ€™s amazing how quickly my head can lead me back to suicide. I sat in my car in front of my house for 20 minutes this morning thinking how easy it would be to just pull my car into the garage and just go to sleep... but I know it would destroy my daughters... they just wouldnâ€™t understand that itâ€™s not their fault... Iâ€™m just broken.
