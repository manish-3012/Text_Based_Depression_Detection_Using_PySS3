I really triedI tried everything. I got a job, started a study programme and I work out regularly and eat healthy. I got over 80% of my anxiety and everything (except of love) is working out right now. 

But I still feel pain I almost cannot handle. And yes, it's physical pain like a broken leg just in my fucking head and its much worse than an injury. I tried it all really. I went to therapy, medication, everything. I still relapse regularly. 

I cannot do this. I hope I have enough energy to buy a rope tomorrow. I wont even write a suicide note cause I dont feel like it. I'm so fucked up...
