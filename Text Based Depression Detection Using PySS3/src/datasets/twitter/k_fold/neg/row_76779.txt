Seriously tired of this. Tired of being treated like shit every day. Tired of being harassed by my family, and at school. I have nothing to live for. By the way, thanks for the help on my earlier post 'Please help me'. But now, not even anyone can help me get over my depression. Ive fallen too deep for even the longest rope to save me.
