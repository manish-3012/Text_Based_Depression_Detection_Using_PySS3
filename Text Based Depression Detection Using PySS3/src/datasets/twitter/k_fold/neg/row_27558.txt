Iâ€™m ready to go. I donâ€™t want anyone to worry. I just want a chance to say goodbye.Thereâ€™s nothing drastic going on. Iâ€™ve been unemployed for more than a year. A man who sexually assaulted me has been spreading rumors that make it impossible to get a new job in my industry, and Iâ€™m too old to learn a new trade. My friends are nice, but have their own problems to deal with, and donâ€™t like to be associated with a victim. There is nothing to look forward to. 

I donâ€™t want anyone to be concerned, but I keep thinking about how nice it could be to get a goodbye party. I want to say thank you for the good times before I go. But I also know that if I mention that I want to leave this life, my friends will immediately stop talking to me.
