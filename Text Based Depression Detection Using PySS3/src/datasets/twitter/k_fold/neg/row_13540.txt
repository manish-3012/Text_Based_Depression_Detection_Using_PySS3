I am so tired of being myself..I hate waking up each morning knowing that I am still the person I went to bed as. I hate everything about myself and I don't know what to do anymore. I get so frustrated with everything and everyone. Every time I try to change something I just think of how I will always be me, no matter what I do. It's like this huge circle of hate and I only know one way out.
