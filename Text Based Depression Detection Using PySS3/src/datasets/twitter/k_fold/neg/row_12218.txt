I am so beyond exhaustedI am so beyond exhausted. I just want an end to this. To be happy. To the love of my life, i am so sorry i never found you. I hope we meet in our next life. I love you. To my clients, i am sorry i failed you. I wanted to make you happy. To help you find a better life but nobody was there for me.
