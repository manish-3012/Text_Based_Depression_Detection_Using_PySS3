Iâ€™m not sure if anyone will read thisThats okay. I donâ€™t expect anyone to reply or anything because I know itâ€™s heavy. I just feel like I need to write some stuff, I donâ€™t want to bother any of my friends or family or upset them. My dog died a few months ago and I thought I was okay at first but itâ€™s been hitting me hard these days. I donâ€™t really want to be here anymore or see the point anymore. I feel like Iâ€™ve done all I can with my life and the rest is just going to be more pain. Iâ€™m suffering alot now from an illness that Iâ€™ll eventually need a lung transplant for but I donâ€™t see the point in taking the chance of life from someone who would appreciate it more than me. I just donâ€™t want to be in pain anymore and my dog was the only thing that kept me going because I knew that he needed me. I just feel so empty now and Iâ€™m not the same anymore. I worry mostly for my friends, because I know that my family has trained a long time for this possibility. But my friends havenâ€™t. I feel like becoming close to people was a very irresponsible thing for me to do because these people told me they need me and that they would not be okay. It breaks my soul because I just have this feeling that nothing can really change my mind. It can help me postpone it for a little more but I just feel like if I donâ€™t go on my own terms then I will prolonge this and I donâ€™t want my family of friends to watch me suffer physically or get worse but I also donâ€™t want to traumatize them or cause them to blame themselves and live with that if I end my life. I feel like leaving/distancing myself from all of them but that also hurts them so much and Iâ€™m just so stuck right now. I donâ€™t know what to do... thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this.
