I've no clue what to write hereI've had severe depression my whole life that went undiagnosed until about 3 years ago and I have incredibly invasive thoughts pretty much 24/7. I've got no one since I left for school, I'm about to be kicked out of university for fucking up my grades so bad and I know my parents will be nothing but even more dissapointed for wasting their money I used to be the smart one in my family but I wasted my potential I'm not creative. I just feel like I haven't ever been living my life for myself but for other people just from my own pressure. I've ran through a lot of different meds and therapists and nothing is working. I don't think I've had genuine human interaction in about a year? There are times that I feel like I'm not mentally ill enough but I know that rationally that's not true. It's like there are two halves to me that are always fighting and the defeatist self hatred part of me wins always. It's like I can't do anything right, no matter how hard the task is it's always my fault in my head. Probably worst of all the girl who showed me that I do infact have feelings that aren't just self hatred and emptiness left me and I still love her. I apologize for the disjointedness of this it's just stream of consciousness. I just feel like I've got nothing to offer at this point even though I'm as young as I am.
