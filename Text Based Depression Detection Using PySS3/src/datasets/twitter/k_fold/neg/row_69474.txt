The first year of my new lifeProbably should have made a throwaway for this but screw it, I'm all about being an open-book so here goes;

So it's been a year since I escaped my hometown. A dreadfully boring, imprisoning place. You know the kind, not small enough to be quaint, not big enough to be engaging. There's the running joke that nobody really leaves, some just get away for a short while. I promised myself If I ever got out I'd live the life I want, that everything would be **better**. 
I tried to make due. A couple of years ago I decided to improve my situation the best I could - how I could -  instead of wallowing in it.
It worked! I started therapy, exercising, quit the job I hated, I was content most of the time. Still pretty hopeless, but given my situation and that place, it was to be expected.

Then randomly a friend propositioned me for a road trip, go visit his brother up north. I had recently ended a seasonal job and had a small savings built up and although normally I would say no, for all of the same small reasons I always did, I remembered my "Yes Man" mantra and figured why not? Better than being in my room all day until I found some other crappy job that cemented me in poverty again.

Surprisingly everything went my way! I found a shitty job, bought a shitty vehicle and stayed with them for awhile. Then I lucked my way into my current job. I went from food stamps and Obamacare to Lower Middle Class. Suddenly a two-week trip with a couple of changes of clothes turned into a permanent move. 

I got out of my comfort zone, tried dating for the first time ever. Although nothing really ever came of it, I realized I could kinda human like everybody else! Then by happenstance I met someone and for a little while it felt like what I saw others had. I was happy and could actually imagine a future for myself.

Of course in reality, it was an awful situation to get into and ended poorly (A few terrifying posts about it are in my comment history for those interested enough to laugh at my insecurity and naivete) but I've found my peace with it and am able to look back at the experience and appreciate the happy memories and how it made me grow as a person.

So *here I am*. A year in my new home. I got what I always wanted - **Freedom**. From poverty, my family, that black hole of a town. Yet I can't escape myself. Sure, I've gotten much better at pretending to be human but I'm still a watcher at heart. I still get depressed regularly, I'd still rather be dead. At least now that I live alone I can cry and pass out drunk on the livingroom floor instead of holed away in my room, trying to be as quiet as possible so my family wouldn't hear. 

I forced myself to go to the bar last night, thought I should celebrate my anniversary. Took me three hours to work up the nerve to leave my apartment and face the crowd. I'd be lying if the  decent possibility of running into my "ex" and her new beau didn't start the anxiety hamster-wheel spinning. Even though I honestly just hope she's finally happy and in a stable place. Still, even just the potential of THAT awkward small talk is paralyzing.

I went though. Place was packed. Opened my tab, grabbed my drink and took a seat in the middle of the whole mess. Force myself to be where I'm most uncomfortable. Can't teach an old dog new tricks though, didn't talk to a single person the whole night. Just sat with my beer and watched, listened. Like I always do. The happy faces, finally free on a Saturday night. The ones who've had a little too much. The pick-up artists moving from one rejection to another. Oh yes all of the signs were there. *Leaned-in whispers and the accidental touches.* Hell I even got a few furtive glances and half-smiles; An invitation I'd never accept.   

Of course I understand the irony of it - to chuckle and think myself better than the damn game, even though I just don't have the balls to play it.
12:30 hits and I decide I've had enough. Figure this counts as at least an instance of "socializing" for the weekend and I'm at least smart enough to leave before the cops start to cruise the block.

That's it. My year is up and I'm still the watcher I've always been. Only now I have no more excuses. Though now I just accept who I am. I don't see myself as a failure for being alone. It's just who I always was, who I will be I suppose. It's not a bad life *per se*, but damn if there was just a point to it. It's not even sadness anymore - I mean I understand when the depression kicks in that my thoughts are being hijacked into thinking I'm sad - but when I'm "normal" It's just apathy. I think of the future and I don't see it. There's no daydream, just black emptiness. I know I'll end it someday, when I run out of excuses. When I'm too tired and I need to rest. Goddamn it, I feel so fucking tired **now**. Don't worry Redditors, it won't be today. I told myself I'd get out and see Civil War. Was supposed to go to the 10 o'clock showing and I'm about 5 hours late but I told myself I'd leave this apartment and I'll make myself do it at some point.

So I sit here in front of my keyboard, hiding for now. Maybe this was the wrong sub to post my shitty writing but screw it.  I've got my cold beer and if you've got yours let's metaphorically clink glasses. Here's to another year. Cheers.
