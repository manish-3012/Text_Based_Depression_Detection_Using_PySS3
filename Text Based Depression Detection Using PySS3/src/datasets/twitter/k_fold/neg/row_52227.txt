I might be making my first attempt in the next few daysThe idea of dying has become a constant, lingering thought in the back of my head. Every day I realize more clearly the reasons why I hate myself in so many ways, and the possible scenarios of my future seem more clouded, uncertain and hopeless. I don't have motivation for any dream that could carry me forward in life, I see myself as a failure and every day is a reminder of how worthless I am. Everything I do, how I act with the people around me and the simple things I fail to do from a complete lack of motivation and energy are reasons why I'm so sure I absolutely hate myself. I can't even let go of the mistakes I made so many years ago. Stupid, childish things too. Not even important in the larger scheme of things.

I've decided I can't go on living like this. I'm becoming a poisoned parasite in my family. I can see how my attitude and the things I say are making my family worried sick; I don't know what to say or think. I can only conclude that living like this is unfair to not only me but those around me. Think about it. An individual that can't function properly, I should just fucking summon the courage to kill myself and do it.

This brings me to my point: I've never actually attempted suicide. I've thought about it in great detail, read so much about many different methods and analyzed possible action courses. Anyway, I have to do something. This can't go on like this. I can't live a miserable life and make other people miserable; I just don't think it's right and I don't want to let that happen. I can't live a live of fantasizing death and never actually moving forward with it.
