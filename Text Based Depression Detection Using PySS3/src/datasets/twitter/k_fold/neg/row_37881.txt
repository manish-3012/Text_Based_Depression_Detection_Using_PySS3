Why do I get caught every time I try to commit suicide?I swear mt inability to lie has caused so many attempts to be failed and I am so sick and tired of it. It probably doesn't help that I have so many therapists (individual, group, family, case manager) and doctors (psychiatrist and person who administers an invasive therapy). I just keep draining money in this and not getting better. Anyone else feels a bit regretful getting help because it just complicates things more ?
