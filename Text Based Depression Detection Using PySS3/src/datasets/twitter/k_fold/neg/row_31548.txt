It doesnâ€™t seem like it will be better soon enoughMaybe in time but not soon enough. I have places to turn but my only friend who would understand is depressed and always upset from her recent breakup. I need my boyfriend right now. I need anyone. Iâ€™ve felt so hopeless these past few days that I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m strong enough to wait it out. At least tonight I will live. Tomorrow is different.
