scaredIâ€™m so unhappy all the time and no matter what I do to fix it I just end up being anxious and depressed all over again because thatâ€™s just how life is. I hate being like this and I know that it isnâ€™t going to get any better or less anxiety inducing the older I get. My stomach is covered in bruises from punching myself in the gut to distract myself from my self hatred. I keep fantasizing about distancing myself from my family and friends so they forget about me so I can kill myself without anyone caring or being sad. I want to have a future but I canâ€™t see myself ever having one. I know i should see a therapist or get medicated but I donâ€™t want to let my family down by wasting money. Iâ€™m too stupid to just pick myself up and stop being so pathetic 

Iâ€™m really scared and I donâ€™t know if I actually want to die or not but I really donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do.
