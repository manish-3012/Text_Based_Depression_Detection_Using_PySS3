A lieI've felt like I heard a quote about how a lie starts as a small fire and gradually grows larger and larger until it just burns uncontrollably.

This is my life now.  My life, for the most part, is a lie.  I sometimes feel like I have forsaken my grandparents... especially my grandma who once said she had so much faith in the world because of people like me.

If only they knew the lie I put on each day...that I'm okay and that I'm some sort of perfect human being...and now much this lie burns me that I'm sure they'd take back what they say about me.

I kept telling myself to get clean, get off from the things I've been doing to myself but I just can't seem to stop.  Now it's gotten to the point where sooner or later the truth will surface and I'm not sure how the people around me can take it.

I feel lost.  I feel reborn in a sense...I know what I have to do to change but I think it's a bit too late for that already.  Maybe, just maybe I can change my life and live a fulfilling one.  But I also think maybe the lies will catch up to me and I am destined to die broken anyway.
