eating disorder and abusive dad. iâ€™ve never been this hopelessmy dad has severe anxiety and depression and most probably some sort of antisocial personality disorder. the stress of dealing with him has made my eating disorder so much worse and he desperately wants me out of the house. he calls the cops on me multiple times a week for not eating or binge eating. last night i slept in the emergency room after being handcuffed by police for self harming and was almost taken to a group home but my parents negotiated to take me home. today my dad threatened to call cps today because i said i want to drop out of college. iâ€™m so scared and so hopeless and my only coping mechanisms are causes for him to further abuse me.
