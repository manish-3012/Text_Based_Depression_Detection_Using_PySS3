Only thing stopping me is likely failure of an attemptI very much want to end it. Fucked up my final year of college, have no prospects or opportunities, am in terrible health and completely isolated from my friends. I've come to see ending it all as a pretty viable logical option in the face of all this. I would feel some guilt for my mother, but ultimately I feel it's the right choice for me. Only thing I'm worried about is my attempt will fail and that'll just add  on to all my problems. I wish I could be 100% certain that I'll successfully go through with it.
