20 years old and Iâ€™ve decided to end my life.I know that most people think that a 20 year old has their whole life to look forward to, and for most 20 year olds, thatâ€™s true. However, that is not the case for me. 

Iâ€™m extremely alone and Iâ€™m hoping at least one person out there will take the time to read all of this. If you do, thank you, it means a lot to me.


Iâ€™ll start off by saying that one of the greatest sources of pain and stress in my life is the fact that I was home schooled my entire life. I hated it, and still do. I actually still have to get my GED, which would be easy, but itâ€™s pointless now.

Iâ€™ve also never had a job before and when youâ€™re 20 years old with no work experience nobody wants to hire you, so I canâ€™t really do much to improve my current situation.

I also have no drivers license and nobody who really is willing to teach me.

Iâ€™m a nice person, but incredibly lonely. I have no friends (literally none) and Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend. 

My life is the same thing everyday, except some days are worse than others, but no days are good. 

Iâ€™ve decided that if there is no reason to live, than I wonâ€™t carry on anymore. 

I wanted so badly to live, I wanted only basic things out of life but couldnâ€™t get them. I have so many dreams about what Iâ€™d like to do but no way of doing them and everyday my hopes and dreams fade more and more into nothingness. 


If you read this, thank you. I know it wasnâ€™t that long but most people donâ€™t give my thoughts and feelings the time of day.  I hope whoever reads this has an amazing life and nothing but good things come to you. Take every opportunity and cherish the small privileges you have.
