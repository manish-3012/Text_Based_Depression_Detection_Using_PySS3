im completely alone... my husband called me a selfish c*** because of my narcissitic parents who are visiting. and I dont think I can handle anything anymoreMy N parents cause me to feel suicidal. They dont have to say anything, just their presence makes me feel like I dont have any control.

My only outlet of reliefe was taken away today and I called my husband to fix it and he called me a selfish c*** just like my parents and that he doesn't know why he is with me.

I feel so alone and wish I was dead right now. I want to walk out the door and just dissapear - but I dont have a way of disapearing! I wish I was really just dead because i haveno control of life and no body who accepts me
