Off the medication again.Today marks the 14th day I've been off my medication. A whole two weeks. I can't believe it's been so long. I can't even remember why I went off of them. Most likely the fact that I felt "fine". The idea that I was acting silly, that things were fine and I didn't need them. I was wrong. I've been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and major depression with psychotic features. For those of you that don't understand what I mean by "psychotic features", that's fine. Let me explain. Psychotic features is experienced by those that go through psychosis, meaning they see/hear things that aren't really there. In my case, I see fleeting images of people standing behind me, in mirrors, doorways, halls, anywhere that would throw you off guard. I've been off my medication for so long, that I couldn't honestly tell you where exactly it is. That's the scary part. Knowing that I don't have access to what makes everything better, and knowing that I can't go get my medication early because that would just mean admitting to my parents that I fucked up, that something is more wrong than it normally is. Now, I'm not living with my parents, I live with some roommates in a town an hour away from home so I can study athletic management in university. It's not like I can just go to them and say, "Hey, wanna help me find my meds?" It's more complicated than that. It always is. The embarrassment of having LIED to your parents that you've been taking your medication for two weeks, when in reality you have no idea where it is. The fact that now people are beginning to follow... "follow", you around your own home, and you have to act like nothing is wrong in front of the people you live with. And you have to convince yourself that there's nothing wrong, when you know for a fact that it isn't right at this very moment. I'm at a loss for what to do. I know what I have to do, I just don't know if I have the strength to do it. My psychotic features give me paranoia that people are out to get me. So I think others are actively trying to do me harm. I don't even trust myself. I know I would never self-harm, or anything of the sort (Whether it be out of cowardice, or something else, I'm still thankful for it) but I don't know what I would do in a situation where I've lost it. It's happened to me a few times, where I've just  completely lost track of who I am, what I'm doing, where I am, that sort of thing. It is extremely rare, but that's still what scares me, and it only happens when I'm off the medication. I just don't know. This in itself, typing out all this, is as difficult as it gets. I don't know how people will react to what I've written, or what I've done, or anything. In all fairness, I only JUST found this subreddit, and just began typing what I was thinking. If I'm not posting in the right place, then I'm not posting in the right place. Sue me, I have more concerning things on my mind right now. 

Edit: I spent last night looking for my meds, and found them. They don't kick in until a few days, but I feel a bit better already.
