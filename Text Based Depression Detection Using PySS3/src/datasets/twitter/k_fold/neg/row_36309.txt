Medicinal IntrospectionI got told that there are medicinal qualities in the corridor of introspection, yet the more I think about it, the worse it becomes. 

I have tried getting help. I spoke about it when i was in hospital for two weeks,  and the nurse told me, and i quote, "You're a liar. You're an attention seeking liar who wants to disable himself and just wants people pandering over him". 

When the medications, therapists, doctors and nurses dont make you feel better, you begin to feel hopeless. Where do I go from here? When there's literally no help left available to me, but im not better? I simply don't understand what i can do besides commit suicide.

I have been suicidal for a long time, probably 8 or 9 years now, i finally reached for help over the past year only to find myself failed by a fucked up system. I need help. I need someone to help me because im at a loss. My only option left is to kill myself. It's all I have left.

Either i get some kind of a miracle, or i suppose my last post will be my good bye.
