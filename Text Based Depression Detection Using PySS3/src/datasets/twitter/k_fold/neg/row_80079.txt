I've been having suicidal thoughts for more than five years. My girlfriend left me a few weeks ago and I think this is pretty much it.I don't really know what to say. My depression started almost six years ago, when my dad passed. I saw him pulled out of the water by EMS and his whole body purple. My brother was still at the store where he called 911 being talked to by EMS. I covered my moms eyes when he was pulled out, so I was the only one who saw it.

Ever since then, it's like I've had to clutter my life with noise in order to forget about the depression. Sex, drugs, music, driving, a combination, something. anything to get away from the silence. I astronomically hate silence. I start to panic and get mighty anxious if I'm alone and it's quiet. 

A few years after he passed, I found someone who shared my darkness. She was the love of my life, the only one who truly understands where i am. She was essentially a permanent noise, something that let me channel the darkness into something tolerable. I put all my faith into her.

And a week ago, she left me. Leaving is one thing, i understand people have problems. But she just left. The only reason she gave was that she's not in love with me anymore. She doesn't care to talk to me, check up on me, whatever. It's like she wants nothing to do with me.

How do you move forward from that? When someone you spent almost 5 years with just leaves without a thought of you like a candy bar you bought while drunk on the weekend. 

Speaking of drunk, I'm drunk almost all the time. I'm drunk at work, drunk at home, drunk at the mall, drunk wherever. And I'm completely sober right now. It's when I'm sober that I feel like I don't want anything to do with this world.

I've spent the past few days researching different suicide methods, and I really think that in the next few weeks I'm going to go ahead with one of them. To be honest, I don't even know why I'm really writing this.
