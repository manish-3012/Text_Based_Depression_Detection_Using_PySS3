I feel emptyI don't really know what to say. I need to talk to someone but I don't want to scare my family. 

I've been depressed off and on my whole life. It's been worse lately. Every time I get down I get worse. I've been thinking about actual methods of suicide, and even did actual research tonight. 

I was raped by my ex-boyfriend a few months after we broke up. I used to go to therapy, my therapist explained that I'm experiencing double trauma: not just from the actual event but also the ultimate betrayal. I was getting better for a long time but I'm struggling again. He just graduated, he's a doctor now. Aren't bad things supposed to happen to bad people? I keep waiting for his life to get worse but I hear how good it is from other people. "He really turned his life around after you broke up with him, he's grown up a lot." 

It fucked up college for me. I'm about to graduate, but I'm doing really poorly in my classes. I'm barely squeaking by in my classes. I have days I can't get out of bed. 

My current boyfriend of 3 years wants to get married. This is the man of my dreams, so kind and loving. I bounce violently between looking at wedding pictures on Pinterest and thinking that I can't handle being alive for one more second. 

I don't want to die, but I want to stop suffering. I don't know what to do. I need help, I'm drowning. Please someone help me
