I will be ending my life tonightI've tried real hard to get over these hurdles, i've tried to be a better person and have a clear head when things get me down. I can't look on the brightside of things because there is no bright side. Everything goes to shit quicker than it gets better. Every little thing goes wrong and it eats me up more and more. I dont see much reason to survive anymore. If i'm so depressed, and i've tried so hard to be happy or be better than i am right now. I dont see why i should have to suffer. Because i should WANT to live because one day it may be worth it? So i dont pass the pain to someone else? fuck them, what has anyone, including my parents ever done for me? My parents were abusive and didnt give a shit about me until i started making money. They've used me for so much and they dont care for me. I don't have friends, i dont have anyone. Why should i care if i pass the pain off? Its all so hard. I don't see the point in living life so alone and so miserable. I'm just fucking miserable. I want to die so i will make it happen. I dont want to be alive anymore, i hate everyone in my life and i dont care if i hurt them, they all hurt me.
