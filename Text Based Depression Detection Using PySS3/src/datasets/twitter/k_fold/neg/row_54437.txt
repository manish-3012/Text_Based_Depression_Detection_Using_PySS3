Have to get out some stuff, suicidal issuesBeen dealing with wanting to kill myself for a while. It has been more prominent in the last two years. But it has always been a desire since I was a kid. I have cut myself. I feel I am not adequate as a person. I have some reasons why (which are also reasons why I want to kill myself). I want to get these things out.

-Because I was a very shy and pussy of a person, I let my friends dump my one friend in elementary school. She was basically a loner for a while after that. I did apologize to her as an adult and even though everything is better and we are friends, I still feel horrible.

-Cheated on my ex, with 4-6 different people (I have a really hard time remembering the number because I am actively trying to forget). It's a lot to explain so I can basically save it for /r/confessions. I have apologized to him about and told him everything. My current boyfriend also knows but accepts me. 

-I have social anxiety, mostly when it comes to jobs. I very much want a job like cleaning but weirdly enough it is very hard to get, so I am starting a semi-social job this weekend and am worried

-I have a law issue to deal with...basically lawyers are telling me I need to give a certain company a somewhat large sum of money (that I most definitely do not have)

-I hate my mother so much, with so much severity, although she has never really wronged me. I know many daughters hate their mother but it is the type of hate the penetrates my very being. Will become relevant in a minute.

-I think my father tried to kiss me when I was a child but I am not positive

-I have so many secrets. When I read reddit posts about "bad things you have done" and stuff, I feel like the stuff I have done is way worse and embarrassing....I also feel like I think differently than most people, almost in an anti-social personality disorder type of way. Like I have to constantly remind myself or check with myself if my "real feelings" match the answers of others (if they are socially or morally appropriate), and often they do not.

I have cut myself a few times, not necessarily to kill myself, but to hurt myself to punish myself. Also getting 'close' to killing myself gives me excitement because I am almost living the fantasy of dying.  

Cut myself because, AKA notable times cutting myself that I remember having a specific causal event:

-mad at myself for getting kissed by a guy who was really drunk. It is so hard to explain but if you want to know the whole story I can tell it.

-So upset and pissed about the law issue, that is, owing a large sum of money to a corporation for something arguably not illegal but possibly illegal. I have very little money

-My mother truly and thoroughly irritating me so deeply I cut myself

Even though I have done everything I can to fix the mistakes of the past, I feel extremely guilty all of the time and inadequate. I know this is a really long post but I am a very detailed person, I can't help it. There is so much I am probably leaving out as well. I should also mention I have generalized anxiety disorder (and depression is a symptom). Anything else you want to know about me let me know...I am a very honest and AMA type of person. If you want to respond or help me please feel free to comment.
