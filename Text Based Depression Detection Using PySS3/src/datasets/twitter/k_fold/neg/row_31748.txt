How do things get betterFor those who have had these feeling and now feel better, what changed?

Did the reasons that you want to kill yourself become resolved, (by your own doing, or they resolved themselves) , 
 
or does how you feel about said problems eventually change and you just cope better about them. 

I want to kill myself for a number of reasons.  I've worked to better myself and try and solve some problems over the past year and I've failed at it all. I really just hate myself and there's no hope for me to try anything else. Im only here still because of how it would affect family and friends. Overtime though you tend to care less about that. I have 11 letters written to friends and family, and I'm ready to go. As more time goes by, I keep looking back and thinking how long I've felt like this. And that next month might be better but it never is. I don't know what to do anymore, I honestly feel that I have these thoughts for a reason and that I need to die or something
