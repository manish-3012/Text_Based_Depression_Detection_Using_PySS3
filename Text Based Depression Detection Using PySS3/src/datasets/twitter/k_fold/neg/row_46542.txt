Today will be my last day on earthToday will be the last day of my existence...
The last time I close my eyes
My last silence
I've been looking for a long time for a solution to this nuisance...
It now seems obvious to me
No more monotony, 
Today I'm not wearing my shirt and tie...
I'm not going to go to work, I'm not going to give a damn.
Goodbye cruel world
It's already too late for me, I can't go back, the rope is already tightening my neck more than a leap towards deliverance, you won't be able to stop me.
So at least please if you look to the sky next time think of me...
