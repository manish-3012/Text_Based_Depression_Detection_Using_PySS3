I almost feel like my worries are too pathetic to post on here, but I still think about suicide regularly.I wasn't abused or bullied or ignored during childhood or the victim of any particularly traumatizing event. 

Objectively, I should be fine. I have a degree in marketing and an MBA, my social circle is kinda small but I have some friends and I'm in a healthy relationship.

On the other hand, I have been trying for the last decade more or less to figure out what to do with my life and made very little progress. 

Growing up, I never saw myself having a job. I can't really explain it, but I always felt that if I didn't have my freedom and carve a path for myself, I was basically a failure and unworthy of self-respect. I wanted to be an inventor, game developer, artist, musician, filmmaker, author...anything that would allow me to be somebody.

I thought I'd found a way to get there when I discovered direct marketing and set out to teach myself enough to start a small agency and become a consultant. My laziness and anxiety killed that plan and I ended up drifting from one plan to the next, none really appealing to me.

Since I can't sustain myself otherwise, I'm pretty much forced to take a job, which I know is an objectively reasonable decision, but it still feels like giving up to me. I suspect that a part of me wants to make up for my lonely teenage years by being much more successful now, but I still don't know how to deal with that aspect of myself.

I don't know who to talk to and what to say that doesn't make me sound like an entitled millennial bummed about not making it to the top. 

I just feel like the paths in life that I can take don't interest me and those that do interest me, I don't have the discipline or resilience to pursue. I've thought this issue through for so long with so little progress that just ending it sounds strangely appealing. At least then the constant worrying would stop.
