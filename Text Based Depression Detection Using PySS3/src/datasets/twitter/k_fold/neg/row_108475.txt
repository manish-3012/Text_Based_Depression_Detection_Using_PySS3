I only survived because of a penny flip. Should I have survived? Is this survivalism? Intro post, 1/xI was in my teenage years. I was studying hard to get into pre-veterinary school because I wanted access to drugs that could kill me, and I wanted the intelligent headspace that would make lethal poison bubble through my veins and race against time in my arteries. I was also scrolling through LJ entries from strangers promising that we lost souls would find ourselves. I stopped breaking up the pills with a mortar and pestle and licked the potentially-lethal bitter white dust from my fingers. Calmness would soon follow.

Comprising, since my main drug is hard to find even on the dark web, I almost took a fatal combination of (prescription med) plus (prescription med) at night in the woods outside the suburbs. My parents wouldn't have cared. I later found out about internet pharmacies, and I started out with some VERY strong, inebriating medications just in order to sleep.

More importantly, I want to hear from you. I only have an undergrad degree in psychology due to my own interests and traits and habits. I do other things: I read and comprehend, I hike, I do photography, I do field sketches, I cook, I share food with neighbours. The self-medication helped me immensely to live, but I don't know if I really do want to live. If that makes sense?
