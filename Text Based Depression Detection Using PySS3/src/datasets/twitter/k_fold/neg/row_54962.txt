Just ventingI'm no writer and I'm not very good with grammar, so i apologize if this is a trainwreck to read. The past few months I have started drinking myself to sleep 7 days a week, each night with a gun ready to go if I ever am capable. Many nights I try but can never squeeze the trigger beyond the breaking point. Iv become so numb to the pain and the thought of suicide im not even sure whats keeping me from doing it. I dont shed a tear, my heart doesnt race, my mind wonders in the moment reliving memories but I'm calm and collected. I tried going to a doctor a while ago, idk maybe 6 months ago. I told her I'm depressed but not suicidal because i dont want to ruin my life if I dont end my life. I have a good job and am very successful for my age. Since I seemed so nonchalant, i guess, she didnt beleive I was actully depressed and made sure to tell me. First visit she prescribed me the bare minimum of whatever it was and I took it for a month and naturally no change. So when i went back she told me i need to try get off them already and again doubted I was actually depressed. I was so upset with her i gave up trying to seek help which was a monumental step for me. I really thought I was going to get help and experience happiness, to have a drive to pick up hobbies, meet new people, start dating. But here i am, plastered sitting beside empty bottles and a loaded gun.
