Think I might finally do itIâ€™ve heard all the cliche stuff a billion times. The stuff about it being selfish or whatever. Honestly, Iâ€™m perfectly fine with being selfish. I donâ€™t care if I hurt my friends and family. I donâ€™t care if tomorrow is better. I really donâ€™t want to see this through. Iâ€™m going to go to sleep and when I wake up, Iâ€™m going to flip a coin. Whatever the coin says, Iâ€™ll do it. It probably seems silly to put your whole life into a coin flip but when youâ€™ve got nothing to lose you tend to do stuff like that. I guess I just needed to vent.
