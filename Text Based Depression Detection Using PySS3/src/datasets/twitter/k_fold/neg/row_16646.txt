I'm a fucked human being and I don't deserve to be here anymore.Threw my life 270 degrees to get out of something I didn't want to. Have everything now, a beautiful house, a lovely fiancee and a good job. Now my health is playing parts one me. Cannot do anything that use to make me happy. I just wanna drink and take painkillers. I Think this is it. I see how much the world is fucked up, how much I want to achieve things, but everything is holding against me. The more I am alive, the more I feel that I'm only hurting people being here. I want to die and I'm ready for it. I'm 40 YO, I had a great day, but nobody cares anymore about my pain. I should let them go.
