Hey guys. Feeling pretty trapped.I don't know what to do. I'm scared. Nothing is panning out. What should I do? The only solution that comes to mind right now is killing myself. I woke up sick, physically sick. In my stomach. And my fiancÃ¨ has said some stuff that has made me scared for our relationship. But I can't concentrate on it properly because my stomach hurts too bad. I haven't eaten anything today. It's very late now. And I'm still waiting for a confirmation from this job I applied for and should've recieved confirmation last week, or the week before. And I'm scared because this job is one of the only ways I can see my fiancÃ¨ and not do a job I hate. I want to die. I feel so trapped guys.
