So close yet so far with school and work. Don't see any solution.I work and work to pay off my tuition and graduate from graduate. Now that I'm about a month away from graduation I have 350 dollars keeping me from graduating and risking being dropped out from my last class in less then two weeks if I don't pay. All my money goes to utility, rent and tuition. Finding extra work is difficult. I even tried to raise money by selling my time doing work for others but no one took up the offer. I don't want free cash but rather money I earned. I just don't know what I can to do any more when I can't even take care of myself or pay for my basic need. I wish I had someone to support me and not just deal with this burden all alone.
