Tip that helps me... maybe it can help you?So I struggle with thoughts of suicide often and have made plans to carry this out on many occasions. I struggle with bipolar type 2 (the depressive type)

One thing that helps me almost each time is to make small goals. I will tell myself things like: I have to write letters to every person I care about and then can do it tomorrow,  I canâ€™t kill myself until I reach a small milestone with weight loss (or anything youâ€™ve pursued or wanted to change in the past), that I canâ€™t kill myself until Iâ€™ve cleared out my closet for charity, or found someone who will take care of my dogs. 

Basically these small goals give me a momentary reason to wait even if itâ€™s just until the next day. I know suicidal thoughts can linger for more than just a day (so in those times I set a goal that might take a week to complete) but I do find this to help. Sometimes i just need enough of a goal to make it through an hour, a day, a week because sometimes this can Help postpone it until the feeling may have a chance to pass even when I think at the time there is no possible way for it to pass. 

This may or may not help some of you. But it helps me and I thought Iâ€™d share.
