I can't take the loneliness anymore and I can't take being stuck in one spot anymore.This is ridiculous, why am I still alive? Nothing changes. I apply for jobs, they all decline me, I look for relationships, I get ignored. Can I have ONE fucking thing that makes me feel like my life is going forward? Like anything? I'm tired of being broke, I'm tired of being lonely and I'm tired of feeling like I can't accomplish shit.

inb4 "Exercise" A: I walk probably a mile a day B: I can't do much more than that because of a heart condition. Besides, exercise never made me feel like I accomplished anything. Just made me tired and sore and thus more miserable.

I just want something to go right. I don't want to sit on my ass and wait for people to allow me to advance my life. Now I see why people end up robbing banks and shit. Would be easier to just rob a place, take the money and go where I want to go than trying to climb this bullshit job ladder where not even fast food places wanna hire you.

Please, do tell me why life is worth living again?
