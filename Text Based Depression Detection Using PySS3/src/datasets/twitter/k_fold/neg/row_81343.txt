Do you guys have a prospect of the future, or do you just expect to continue in this gear of pain?I have been thinking about my mental illness, and I do not know if I will improve or if I will lead a reasonable life. I always remember the Virginia Wolf note where she says she was unsuccessful in fight against her mental illness and that there is no way back. There's no future.  Just the prospect of continuing in the gears. and she did what she did.
