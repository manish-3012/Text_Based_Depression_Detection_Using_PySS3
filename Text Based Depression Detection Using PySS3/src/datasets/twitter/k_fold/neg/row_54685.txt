please help. i think i sexually assaulted someone.i was 15 at the time. and my old friend who used to live in my town was visiting for the summer. we were flirting and im pretty sure she was into me, but she had told me that she didn't want anything and that she wasn't looking for a summer fling or anything like that. anyway, one day she was at my house and we were watching tv and i started messing around and like hitting her in the gut kind of tickling her.

anyway, we ended up on the ground kind of wrestling around and i ended up on top of her and was holding down her arms and then i tried to kiss her multiple times as she tried to avoid it by moving her head back and forth. she said stop multiple times and eventually i kind of let go and she ran away. im not sure if my memory is correct at one point her shirt somehow got pulled up.  i chased after her still kind of thinking that we were having fun playing a game. i realize now how wrong i was. 

for the rest of the summer we still hung out and like flirted and such (probably me just making a bad situation worse actually) she didn't bring it up at all and i didn't think anything of it. i realize now that she probably felt extremely violated and that i fucked up. i feel terrible. i feel like i should die. i would never do anything like this again. but that's not what matters. because i did do it. 

i texted her today and expressed my apologies to her. saying how terrible i felt and how much i regretted what i did. she said "thanks" and then blocked me. i can't help but want to die because i feel as though i hurt her. she is an amazing person and friend and didn't deserve to go through that. i don't know what to do.  i didn't do this with any malicious intent. but that's what makes it even worse. i fucked up so much.
