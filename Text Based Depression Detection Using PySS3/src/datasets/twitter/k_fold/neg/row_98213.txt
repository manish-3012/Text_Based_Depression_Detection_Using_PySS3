Why am I so dumb?I forget everything. I accidentally hurt people. I lose all my stuff. I can't do anything right,everything I create or do is mediocre at best. This sounds probably like I'm exagerating,but it has come to the point where I question myself if I'm worth the oxygen I breathe or if I'm just wasting it with my stupidity. I wish I would be smarter. I wish I could be someone else. I don't want to continue making people embarrassed to be with me or being embarrassed to be my parent or something like that. It's making me tired. Tired of myself and of life. Please, are there any ways to become a better and smarter person... Because if not, I don't know if I will survive this.
