It was easier to hold on when my life was worse.Iâ€™ve always had reasons to be sad, reasons to feel like shit, reasons to want to die. I grew up poor and bullied at school. My dad was emotionally and physically abusive till I was in my late teens. I was addicted to drugs and sofa surfing until I was 20.


Now I have a management job that I didnâ€™t even have to interview for because they just promoted me without question. I donâ€™t drink or do drugs (except the occasional beer at special events or joint if itâ€™s offered.) I have a flat that feels like home that I share with two of my best friends. My relationship with my mum and sister is the best itâ€™s ever been. I have nothing to be sad about.


Except I want to die. People used to tell me it gets better and it sure as hell does but I still feel like killing myself. It was easier when I was just waiting for a situation to be over, but now I just feel like I am waiting for my life to be over. Why hold on when this is as good as it gets?
