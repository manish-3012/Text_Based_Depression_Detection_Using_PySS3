What happens when you make every bad decisionI am a 19 year old male with diagnosed social phobia, depression, 'high IQ' and undiagnosed PTSD and derealization/depersonalisation.

I live completely socially isolated in an apartment. I haven't interacted with another human in about 11 months.

I am also a criminal. I found ways to pay rent and all other essentials plus everything I want basically. I also found a way to fake prescriptions. (I have morals, I make money through very big companies, who don't even realise I'm stealing from them.)

I also got raided a few months ago and will 99% face prison time soon.

I wanted to give you guys the story of my life, but that's way too much writing to do.

I am also a poly addict. I take 70 mg diazepam and 1500 mg pregabalin daily just to stay far enough away from the edge which is suicide. I am only happy when I get heroin or meth in the mail.

I am also very sad and lonely and don't see a way out.
I won't live to witness my own court date. The anxiety is too strong.

My last days consist of laying in bed, dreaming it all away, looking through photo albums from times when my dad was still alive and my mum still talked to me or loved me.

I live in Germany, it's getting late here. I hope I will be able to sleep and dream of a reality in which everything is better. :)

Thanks for reading. Fuck, I am so lonely.
