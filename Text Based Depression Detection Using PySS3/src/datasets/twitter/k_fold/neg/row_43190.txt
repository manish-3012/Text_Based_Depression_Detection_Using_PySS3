Feeling so betrayed and lowIâ€™ve been betrayed my whole life out of jealousy. Iâ€™m the most considerate person and people love to walk all over me. I donâ€™t want to be in such a cruel world, I didnâ€™t sign up for this. Iâ€™m so bummed I wish I could end this all! One family member that loves me holds me back and the unknown of whatâ€™s on the other side. I just really want out so bad right now
