Thank you, Reddit.I want to take a moment and say thank you to the mods and people on this sub. I've posted a few times here, about how grim it all seems and you guys have responded, encouraged outlets that can help and more. I appreciate it, I do. Thank you, everyone here. 

I'm battered, bloody and bruised, I've been clawing at the walls of this hole for so long that I forgot why.  

None of that is the point of this post, however. I really am, sincerely thankful to those of you who have taken the time to listen. I wont be back but I want the people here to know that they helped, they helped a lot when I needed it.

Goodbye Guys. Take care.
