Another night of these scary thoughts.It's getting harder not to follow through with what I am thinking about. I've been suicidal for a while, but the past 3 months, it's gotten significantly worse. I've talked to people, told them I am very depressed... I don't think they realize how much. I don't think even my husband knows how much at risk I am. I take sleep aids, and I keep thinking about taking all of them. I don't currently have a plan. That's when you're considered high risk I guess, right? I just know I don't feel like I am going anywhere in life. I feel like I am standing in one place, and everyone is moving fast, in a blur around me. The flashbacks to the abuse are getting worse, and I don't know how to sweep it under the rug anymore. Even though I guess I'm functioning enough to fly under the radar, I am so depressed that I don't even recognize myself anymore. I feel bad, because I know people personally that have it worse. I feel like I don't have much of a reason to feel so hopeless, but I do. I don't know if it ever gets better... I see subs here full of so many people going through what I am, and maybe it should offer comfort to know I am not alone, but it doesn't. It just makes me believe no one ever really gets better, and that the world is filled with so much more misery than I thought. It makes me want to not be in it even more. I just feel like there is no point to it anymore, and the world would not lose anything if I weren't in it. The logical, reasonable part of my brain tells me that I have people in my life that would be upset, but (and as bad as this sounds) sometimes, like tonight, I just do not care. It's hard to focus on the needs of other people when you're drowning. Right now I don't know if I will ever resurface, and I don't think I really want to.
