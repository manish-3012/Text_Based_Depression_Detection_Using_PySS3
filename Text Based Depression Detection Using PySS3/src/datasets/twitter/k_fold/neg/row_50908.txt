Why go on?I don't see what is so selfish about taking your own life... people will hurt for a bit, but the same people expect us to continue on so that they don't feel pain, even though I've felt pain everyday, and it eventually evolved back into apathy. It's selfish to force me to move forward.
I'm not sure what is worse, depression or apathy. Sometimes, it's nice to feel pain, at least that is something; othertimes, it makes everything awful. I can't figure out my feelings, I can't figure out other people's feelings, I can't figure out humans, I can't figure out Earth.
I always feel guilty, there are so many people on this planet who have it way worse than I do, but I can't see past my own struggles. There are friends who have died who would kill to be in my boots, just to live another day, and here I am biding my time until I can pass out of existence; feeling sorry for myself.
There isn't one thing neccarsily that drove me to this. I've had issues trusting people since I first started dating, almost everyone fucked me over. But, that's not a reason to leave this planet, though it's certainly a force multiplier. I can't figure out why I feel this way, I'm fundamentally flawed. I push away everyone who loves me, and I don't know why. I had a girl who loved me, and I did everything in my power to screw it up. That's my life, and I can't help it.
Pills and talking have helped temporarily, now there is absolutely nothing. I don't feel a thing.
I believe our one goal is to pass on our genetics, something that my ancestors have accomplished for over 200,000 years. I wanted nothing more than to have a child, but it'd be selfish to pass on my genetics, so it's best this ends with me. I don't believe in a god, I'll pass on and hopefully be returned to the flora and fauna. 

If I have any reason to continue, let me know. But, you most likely wont save me.
