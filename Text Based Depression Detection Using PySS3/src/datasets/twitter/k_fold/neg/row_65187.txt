I canâ€™t handle this political bullshit anymoreI feel like the world is closing in on me. Everyone is so misguided by politics that they begin to hate other people for the simple reason that they have a different political leaning. Everyone is throwing tantrums over nothing and Im sick of it.

I want out of this political dogshit. I want to live my life without other people yelling in my ear about why Iâ€™m wrong or Iâ€™m terrible because of my political standing. I seriously canâ€™t win. If I vote one way, Iâ€™m a horrible person. If I vote the other, I still lose. If I donâ€™t vote, Iâ€™m still a horrible person.

I canâ€™t handle this shit anymore. I want out of this dogshit political food fight. I feel like the world is against me no matter what I do. And I seriously canâ€™t take it. Itâ€™s so depressing, to know that people will hate you and despise you and want you dead because of your political leaning. 

I just want to be able to breathe for five minutes. For fucks sake, five minutes.
