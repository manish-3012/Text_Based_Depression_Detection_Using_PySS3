I am ready.I have been having 'thoughts' for a while, but that's all they were, just thoughts. They would pop into my head when I wasn't thinking, like a person whispering in my ear who I could only hear at the dead of night. Then they got louder. They were persistent, they wouldn't stop. I couldn't stop thinking about it, but I was still scared of the thoughts.

Now, it is different. These thoughts feel like my own. They don't bring me suffering or confusion, they bring me happiness and clarity. It is like I have finally figured out something. Sure, I still have doubts that this is the right decision. Sometimes when I am talking to a friend or eating a really good meal, I remember life can be good but it isn't enough. I mean it isn't a decision I can regret. I feel like I have lived long enough. I have waited three days to see if my mind changed, but it only got more ingrained in my head. This is the right move, I am ready to die.
