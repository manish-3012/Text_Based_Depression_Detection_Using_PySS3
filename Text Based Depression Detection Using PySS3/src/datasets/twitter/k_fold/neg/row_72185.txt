How can i help my friend?One of my best friend of all my life is very suicidal. I think shes been for a long time, but recently shes making it more obvious, and i think shes asking for help. 
She has cuts on her arms and legs and she gets drunk almost everyday and says horrible things about wanting me and all of her friends to kill ourselves with her. She has also been bullimic for almost a year now. 

What can i do?
