Never thought it would come to thisIâ€™ve always been in the background. Iâ€™ve always felt replaceable or like I didnâ€™t matter. I just donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I have always had subtle suicidal thoughts but Iâ€™ve hit an all time low. These past few months have been the worst of my life and I want it to end. I have never before felt so broken so empty so depressed.I went from swearing to never touch a drug in my life to what might be addiction at this point. When Iâ€™m sober I feel like there is no point in living and Iâ€™m wasting mine and everyone elseâ€™s time while Iâ€™m still here. When Iâ€™m high/drunk or whatever I feel numbed of the pain for a little amount of time but it doesnâ€™t last long. I still end up going to bed sad and wishing I wonâ€™t wake up the next day. I have tried to stop but I feel like I need it to keep going and I donâ€™t know what else to do. The only thing that has always helped me is music and now that my favorite artist is dead it makes me want to die even more as well. Music helps and I used to love video games but I feel like if all Iâ€™m living for is an altered state of mind or music/video games then Iâ€™m living for no good reason at all. Recently Iâ€™ve had too many serious thoughts of killing myself to think Iâ€™m making the wrong decision. No one cares now but itâ€™s funny just like with every other suicide or death no one ends up caring until your gone and itâ€™s too late. 

Havenâ€™t ever posted on reddit before but I donâ€™t know what else to do at this point so thanks for listening to anyone who read this.
