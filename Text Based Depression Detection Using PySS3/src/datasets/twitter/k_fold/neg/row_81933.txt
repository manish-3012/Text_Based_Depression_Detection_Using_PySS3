Admitting you're suicidalHi all, if you've ever told a therapist you're suicidal I would really appreciate it if you would read this\~

To quickly sum up my situation: I'm at university (woo exam time!) and my depression + suicidal thoughts seriously mess up my day-to-day studying (I.e. Don't do any studying.) I attempted suicide in March and was admitted into a hospital. When I got back to uni I had regular sessions with the mental health team on campus.

So, my question is, what happens if you admit to a therapist you have frequent suicidal thoughts? 

A week or so ago I was prepared to commit suicide and was gonna call the mental health team (just to chat to someone), but then decided against it as I didn't want them throwing me into a psych ward for a few days or putting me back on suicide watch. Can I speak about suicide casually without having to deal with the annoyance of being constantly checked up on? They know about my depression but I'm worried what will happen if I admit I'm still suicidal.

P.s. I understand why suicide watch is a thing, but from previous experience, I hate it and want to avoid it at all costs
