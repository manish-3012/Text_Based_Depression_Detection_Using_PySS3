Why do I hate myself?I'm only 15 and I absolutely despise the person I'm becoming. I have insomnia that comes in waves, and every time it starts coming back, I get a minor bout of sadness, but this time everything I do makes me hate myself. The way I look, the way I act, everything about me. I struggled with this before and got out, but I don't know if I can make it this time.
