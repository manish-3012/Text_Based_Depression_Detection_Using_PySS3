am i selfish for not telling them?i wonâ€™t make it to the next decade. i will die this month and i know i will because i canâ€™t take it anymore. i keep making plans with my friends for next year and i can only think about how selfish i am, making plans with them like i donâ€™t know that my death is coming sooner than they all expect. it hurts to know that they have no clue iâ€™m lying. but itâ€™s for the best. theyâ€™ll be better without me
