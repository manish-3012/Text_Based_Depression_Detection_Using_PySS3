My life sucks and I want it overI actually don't hate living, I just hate being me. If I reincarnate into a person who has friends, loving family, and a future, I would be okay with living.

But I don't. The person I am doesn't have any of these things. I can't imagine what it would be like to wake up and get to talk to people, to go downstairs and be able to smile at someone, to look forward to a new day. I haven't ever had that feeling. I've been an outcast since I was a child and people still treat me like today and I'm so fucking TIRED of it. I'm tired of being the person everyone ignores, the person everyone talks over, the person no one cares about. It's fucking awful. 

I'm so tired of it.
