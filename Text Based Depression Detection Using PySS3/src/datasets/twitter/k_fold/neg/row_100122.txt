Friend will never understand and I donâ€™t have the energy to try explainingMy only friend just told me that my depression is caused by my environment and that if I move itâ€™ll get better. They told me Iâ€™m probably depressed because my hormones are all wrong. They told me suicide is stupid. 

Then they said they donâ€™t understand why I donâ€™t talk to them about it. 

All I want to do is push them away now.

I should of just kept pretending everything is alright.
