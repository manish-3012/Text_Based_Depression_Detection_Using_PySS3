I am an awful human beingI feel so guilty because I had sex a week ago. What if the person I did it with had Covid and they didn't know yet? What if I have Covid? What if I spread it to my grandparents? I would literally be responsible for their deaths. I feel like shit. I have fantasies of suicide but I can't really act on them. My anxiety has made it impossible for me to keep up a normal human relationship. Maybe it's time to start the downward spiral? There's no way I will ever feel like a functioning human being so I might as well give up? Give myself a year or so before I end it all? idk I just am tired of this shit.
