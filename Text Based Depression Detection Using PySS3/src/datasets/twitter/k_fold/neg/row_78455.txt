Why am I not good enough?I donâ€™t get it. You tell me I need to work on myself for things to work, I do and itâ€™s not enough. You lie to me for a year about your employment, your enrollment in school, why you have your criminal record and yet Iâ€™m not enough. I ask you not to talk to others about our relationship and you do. You say thereâ€™s nothing between you and her and yet not even 2 hours after I tell you Iâ€™ve hurt myself youâ€™re with her, watching a movie. I tried helping you get back in your feet and Iâ€™m still not good enough. What will it take for me to be accepted by someone and loved by someone, not walked all over and made to feel worthless? I feel like they should have forcefully made me stay at the hospital last night, because I feel worse than ever now and I just want the pain to end.
