I just don't know how much longer I can go onI am 26 years old and I have been struggling with depression since I was 11. I am unemployed and can't find a job due to my disability but I was denied disability benefits. I have very bad anxiety. On Friday I had a panic attack at Walmart because there were too many people there.  I don't think I'll ever get better and I can't live like this much longer.
