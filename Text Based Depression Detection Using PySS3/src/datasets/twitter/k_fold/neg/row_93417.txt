What saved me4 months ago my life collpsed. I lost my money , my girl, chance of going to college this year, my friends and went back to living with my parents in Venezuela. 

This made me extremely suicidal and depressed . i posted many times in this sub. I was gonna kill myself. But i started going to therapy and taking antidepressives. Some days are hard still but i m here and im not killing myself . my advice is wait. Wait out the storm. It will pass. You will go to hell but it will pass. Go to therapy SLEEP, take your pills. Talk to people make friends. LIVE and the storm will eventually pass. If anybody needs support im here
