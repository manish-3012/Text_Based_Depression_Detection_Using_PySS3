I've been begging for help.I've been in a seriously dark place, and I have been here before but was able to get professional help and now I can't. I have dropped some serious hints as a cry for help but nobody is listening to me. I'm giving it until the end of this month to see if anything gets better spiritually, financially, mentally, physically and/or emotionally.... any one of those... ANY OF THEM... and if it doesn't and nobody hears me then this is it. this month is my last shot. I can't do it anymore. (27F)
