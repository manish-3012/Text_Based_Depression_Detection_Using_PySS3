so lonely, no one cares and I'm too scared to tell people in real life.I just want someone to help me 

no one cares about me-- not here, not irl, nothing. I want to tell people what's happening but I'm just so scared. I already know how I'm ending it, hopefully I'll do it tonight. I'm getting all my ideas for my notes, I just need to write them. I have the supplies to end it, I just need to get up the courage 

well no,it's not that I'm scared. it's that I just can't bring myself to do anything anymore. I'm a burden to my family and I've hurt so many people. there's no use for me around, all I do is hurt others and myself. I've been mentally preparing myself the past few days. everyone has been complaining to me about how their life sucks from little things, they come to me because I try to hard to be happy and chipper. I don't let anyone in. I can't let anyone in. 

I don't want people to see me like this. if me hurting causes other people to hurt, then I can't let them in- ever. my self image has been destroying me, my thoughts polute my mind and I can't think clearly anymore, I just can't do this anymore. I don't deserve to be here. god I can't wait until I'm home today to do it. I hope I do it today, I haven't been doing my work because I know it'll be over soon, but since I'm falling behind better end it now before I get in even more trouble and have people make me feel even more useless.
