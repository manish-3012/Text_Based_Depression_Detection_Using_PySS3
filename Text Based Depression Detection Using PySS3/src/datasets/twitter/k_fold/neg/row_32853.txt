Just didn't jump off a bridge, but not because i didn't want to die.But because it would be messy. I'm posting from a throwaway account at my college.I'm a 23 year old semi overweight male. My life is just a culimation of mistakes after mistakes which i continue to make. While driving today I pulled over on the Driscol bridge, got out of my car briefly and considered jumping. The one and only thing from stopping me from doing it in a bloody, messy, attention grabbing way is that i know my mother couldn't handle it. I've tried therapy, I've tried medications, I've tried illcit drugs, I'm currently on 30mg of lexapro daily as well as 75mg of lamictal. I smoke pot daily, and the only time i feel normal is when I'm tripping on magic mushrooms, I have only felt truly happy during the two times in the past four months that i have tripped. I can never feel that way normally. I pop perscribed pills(ambien, xanax, opiates of all types) just to get through the day. My girlfriend of 4 years cheated on me for an entire year while i fed her and paid her rent while she aquired a masters degree, at which point she flew to alaska(from boston) to fuck this guy repeatedly. At this point i was forced to move out of my apartment to make way for her and her new boyfriend. Also, My grandmother died I was very close to her as a small child, but after she got ill(lung cancer) i couldn't  handle it and never visited her except in her final comatose days, I am an atheist, i do not beleive in magic, ghosts, or the supernatural, or god, for that matter and in this way I feel as if the energy I contain in my body would be better off as fertilizer._x000D_

TL;DR, Depressed, tried everything, thinking about just walking into the forest somewhere and starving to death. I would need to make sure my body was never found._x000D_
