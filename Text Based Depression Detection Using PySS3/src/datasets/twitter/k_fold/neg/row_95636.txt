Im brokenIm a broken man struggling with depression and drug abuse. My story is long and complicated but its almost entirely my fault. I put myself into these positions and I deserve the garbage thrown into my life. I want to redeem myself and fix my mistakes but all I can think about is ending it all. In the end im an addict running from my problems and suicide seems to be the solution that is always there.
