I canâ€™t do it anymore.My anxiety gets worse day by day.  I feel like a black cloud circles around me and I can never get out.  I just cry and cry and canâ€™t do anything about it.  Talked to doctors and therapists.  Iâ€™m on anti anxiety and anti depressants but they donâ€™t help.  Iâ€™m too scared to eat or sleep as I fear I will get sick.  And no matter how many times I say itâ€™s irrational and stupid I canâ€™t get the thoughts out of my head.  I know I canâ€™t kill my self id never be able to do it but fuck I canâ€™t say I want to live much longer like this.  Itâ€™s only a recent thing too.  I have the most irrational fears over the dumbest stuff and itâ€™s taken over my life.  I feel like I canâ€™t do it anymore.  I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s ok to post here if Iâ€™m not planning on taking my own life but someone to talk to would be nice.
