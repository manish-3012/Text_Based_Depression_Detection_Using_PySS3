Nobody cares about my existenceI'm so lonely. I have been for a long time. That's not even the worst part. My crippling OCD ruins each and every single day and drives me crazy. I can't be a normal person because of it and it drives everyone away. Well, That and my shitty personality. I'm a fucking piece of trash and I just want to end it all. I don't know what to do. I just want it to stop :(
