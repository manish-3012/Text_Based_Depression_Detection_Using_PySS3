Suicide prevention month is mostly a joke (raising awareness and teaching people how to handle sducidal people is good tho)Bitches be posting selfies and writing long af paragraphs in the caption for suicide prevention month

â€œtHiS feEling iS temPorarY, i gOt bEttEr sO cAn yOuâ€ well my happiness is also temporary, do you know how many sources of happiness has been taken away from me after months of woking on getting better? It fucking hurts. 

Also, that second line just makes me feel more shit â€œwhy cant i get betterâ€ â€œwhy am i like thisâ€ â€œwhy cant i be normalâ€
