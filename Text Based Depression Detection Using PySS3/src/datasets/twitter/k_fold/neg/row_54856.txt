Advice?I've been feeling depressed for a while now (4~ years) with the suicidal thoughts coming on hard for the past 6 months or so, but I feel guilty for being like this. I've got a lot of things going for me (one of the top universities in the world, loving family, good work experience) but I just can't seem to keep myself in there.

For a long time I've been telling myself that "it'll be better at University" but it isn't, it's worse. Now, I feel even worse about having such social anxiety that I can't leave my staircase without 6~ units of alcohol. I'm incredibly boring, have a face only a mother could love and pretty much a loner.

I actually feel disgusted posting this, it's such a teenage angst bawww especially compared to people who real problems, and I recognise this but I still feel like, hmm.. I don't have much of a point in carrying on. Even if I do graduate and so on, what for? Sure I enjoy doing these things but it doesn't seem to outweigh this crushing feeling I have. I'd really like to just stop living, not actually kill myself and destroy the lives of others.

Can anyone lend a hand?
