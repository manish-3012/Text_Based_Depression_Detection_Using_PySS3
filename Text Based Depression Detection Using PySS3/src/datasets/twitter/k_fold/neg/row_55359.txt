What do I do nowI'm not in a good place right now. I moved up to a new town recently, and the renovation of my new place is taking an unbearably long time. I know nobody here and I have no fucking idea how to make friends. I have very very very few people I could even consider that, and most of them are online. Terrible social anxiety plus being a boring person will do that to a person. Not only am I uninteresting and awkward, my interests are either unusual or obscure. 

I'm pretty much stuck in a pretty remote town with not much money for fun stuff, no access to a computer I can distract myself with gaming on, and I know no one and I don't know how to begin knowing people. Hell, earlier I felt so atrocious I caught myself staring at a wall socket for about 15 minutes. I was basically doing things in a stupor for hours, borderline catatonic. This has been happening for a couple of days now.

So what the fuck do I do guys? If I continue on this way I'll likely at least try to commit suicide within a week or 2. Is there anything I can do to distract myself that doesn't require much money or any at all? Is there fucking anything I can do to prevent having a mental breakdown and killing myself?
