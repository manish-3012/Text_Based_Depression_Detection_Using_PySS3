Other people are the only thing keeping me aliveI just want to die so much but then my parents would have to bury their child, and my siblings who look up to me and rely on me would lose me, and my roommates wouldnâ€™t be able to afford our house and my job would have to replace me and my SO would be devastated.

But Iâ€™m really fucking struggling. I wrote a note the other day...I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever use it but the thought of being alive for the next 60 years is unbearable and idk how much more I can take.

Just venting. No one has to respond I just need to tell someone because I donâ€™t want to scare my loved ones or have one of them call 911 or something.
