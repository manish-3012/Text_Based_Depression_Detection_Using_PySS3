If it weren't for my younger siblings, I would have killed myself by nowGrowing up the oldest of 10 kids, I was a 3rd parent. I took care of my younger siblings. Most of them love me.

I had a very abnormal childhood. I didnt have any friends, but I focused on my education. I graduated HS with a 3.4 gpa, and 27 ACT. I couldnt afford college, so I went into community college.

These past 3 years have been terrible. My dad has been in trouble with the law multiple times. My stepdad kept me away from my younger siblings for 6 months becuase im a "Bad influence". I lost 2 jobs, my car died on me, causing me to drop out of Community College, I became an addict, I was homeless for almost 3 months.

On the night of my high school graduation, If I would have known this is were I would be in life, I wouldve killed myself. Its just getting to be too much.

My dad JUST moved into a new apartment 4 months ago, and we are already being evicted becuase he didnt pay rent for 2 months. Even though I paid my fair share!!

I love my younger siblings way too much to kill myself, but things are getting to be too much. My hair is starting to fall out of my head, and my suicidal thoughts are now something I experience on a daily basis. I just dont know what to do...
