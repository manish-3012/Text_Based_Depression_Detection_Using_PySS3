Does anyone need to talk?If you have something that you need to get off your chest I am willing to listen.  I have access to a Team speak server and will talk if you want.  I am by no means an expert on suicide, but have struggled with PTSD and depression for years.  Please don't hurt yourselves tonight.

Just thought I would offer.
