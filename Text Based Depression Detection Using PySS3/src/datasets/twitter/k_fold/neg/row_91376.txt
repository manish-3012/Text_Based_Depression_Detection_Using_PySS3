FmlI can't get better on my own. The people in my life think being suicidal is a choice or they just don't understand. The hospital will just hold me until I stop actively trying to kill myself and then send me home with thousands of dollars in debt, if they let me stay in the first place. What the fuck am I supposed to do? It's hopeless, it's like my life is designed to make me want to kill myself. I can't see a future for myself. I can't see myself living through this week. But I'm too fucking stupid to come up with a plan that works and doesn't involve permanently scarring my family. No matter what I do, I'm screwed. It's just not fair.
