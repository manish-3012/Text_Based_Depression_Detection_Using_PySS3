Unemployed and losing moneyI canâ€™t do this anymore. Every day itâ€™s something else that adds onto the stress, but I donâ€™t want to abandon my family. My mom suggested I go on welfare, but every time I think about it my heart just starts racing and I feel like I canâ€™t claim money that I havenâ€™t earned. I did apply, but then the woman said I needed a doctors note which took a month to get an appointment for. Now my case is closed. How am I supposed to get a job? The only way I could get hired is if I was the only choice, and thatâ€™s never the case. Then my phone bill and gym membership (which I donâ€™t use) are taking more and more away from me every day. Last time I checked my account balance I had -$200. I feel like I have fucked myself over beyond fixing. I got an email today saying that they are going to send my debt to a collection agency if I donâ€™t pay it off, but there is no way to do that. Why am I here? Why was I forced into a life that I hate so much? I hate to think about what it will do to my family, but I canâ€™t keep being such a useless leach to them. I donâ€™t want them to be sad, but I just hate my life so much. My heart never stops racing and I am so conflicted all the time. I just want to be done with everything and everyone. I just want to be gone.
