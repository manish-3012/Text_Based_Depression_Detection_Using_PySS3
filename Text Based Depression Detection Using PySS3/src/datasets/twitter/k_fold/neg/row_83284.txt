i cleaned my room today.i cleaned out parts of my room today. got rid of a bunch of clothes. i doubt anyone noticed, but iâ€™m scared. this is one of the signs. giving away or getting rid of possessions. iâ€™ve always been depressed, but lately it feels like itâ€™s me against a cold, ugly, uncaring world.
