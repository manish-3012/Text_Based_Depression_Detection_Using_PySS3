Everyone hates and makes fun of me and I want to die.Everyone talks shit about me behind my back. Out of my friend group only like one person doesn't make fun of me behind my back. It is impossible for me to cut the toxic people out of my life (Still in school). I hate myself. I have severe anexity and suicidal thoughts. I have tried everything. Tried going to the gym, now i'm ripped and suicidal. Tried venting through music, didn't help. Tried talking to people about it, nobody believed me because I am a sarcastic person. Tried talking to therapists, just made me poorer. Tried getting hobbies, just ended up feeling more guilty for not getting out of bed in the morning. Tried socialising, realised I fucking hate people and I'm a misanthrope. Nothing helps. I can't change the things that make people hate me or make fun of me. My problems are unchangeable or can't be undone. The only reason I am still alive is because I don't want to make my family members suicidal too by killing myself.
