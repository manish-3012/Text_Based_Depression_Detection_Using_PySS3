I can't take myself or the reason we all are here!I can't do this anymore. I'm terrified of myself and I'm so scared that       I'm causing problems and that I'm the reason my family keeps hurting. I won't say what is happening, but all I can say that there's a blade in my hand and that its dangerously close to helping me more than anyone's words can.
