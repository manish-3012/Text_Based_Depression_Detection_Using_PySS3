What's the point in living if you're a hideously ugly creature? [18/M]I kind of feel unworthy of any interaction with human beings, so I feel a bit guilty about posting here. But anyway, I'll give you my circumstances and maybe you can tell me if there's any reason for me to continue living.

I'm an 18yo guy.

Virgin.
Never kissed a girl.
Haven't talked to a girl my own age since I was 12.
No friends whatsoever.
Living in absolute isolation.
Failed to enter med school.
Genuinely repulsively ugly facial features.
Disproportionate body, though luckily, I'm 6'1".

Unlike many people, I don't have a morphed view of myself. I'm not seeing something that isn't there. I know I live this miserable life because I am so grotesque. I truly believe that I am actually a sub-human.

I think I'm essentially a helpless case and anyway, I don't think I'm worthy of help.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't think my problems are rectifiable. I did contemplate using steroids and undergoing serious plastic surgery, but I really don't think it would make much difference to my overall appearance.

The feeling when you really like someone, but you know that they would never like you back, that's just the worst feeling in the world. I really can't deal with the prospect of being alone forever. 

So, I see suicide as the only resolution to my problems.
