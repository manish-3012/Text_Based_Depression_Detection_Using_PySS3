Are plans of suicide that I wish to attempt but purposely fail so I can still live suicidal?I know when I'm in my right mind that I don't really want to die, but when my mind wanders I find it recently goes to ways I would attempt it. It's like I want to attempt to kill myself but purposely fail. I don't see the point in anything anymore but I can't hurt other people by being shellfish like that. Besides, I'd be too scared. I'm depressed. I have a therapist but my parents don't want me to go on medication. I don't want to think these things but I'm fascinated. Is this bad?
