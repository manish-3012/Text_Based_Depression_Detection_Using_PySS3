Sincere words for whoever needs to hear them.Today I lost a friend. Which is almost 6 months since I had lost another friend. One shot himself and one overdosed. These were people that I shared many laughs with, these were people I had the pleasure of working with, these were people who I cared about very much. You always look back and regret not doing more. Maybe I could've said something or done something to change whatever pain they were going through? I keep running it through my head. I'll never know. We live in strange times and we are all struggling to cope. That doesn't make the feeling of being alone any less real. These feelings are valid and it's OK to feel them but know that you aren't alone. I myself have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I couldn't tell you what keeps me going. Perhaps it's just waiting to see how the world turns out. Who knows? Maybe things will be worth it. To those of you who need to hear it, there is love for you, you do matter, and the world can be a pain filled place full of uncertainty. But still... You matter, and even if we've never met I have love for you. Your pain is my pain for we are all in this together.
