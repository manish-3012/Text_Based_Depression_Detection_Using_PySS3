I know how to do it nowOne failed past attempt. Constant envisionings of how it will go. Next time I'm confident.

1. Will quickly drink close to 1 liter of whiskey (numb pain and inhibitions);
2. Will partially fill bath with water and sit in it;
3. Wrap belt around something then yank at it with mouth;
4. Blindfold eyes;
5. Wield carpet knife, and slice wrists deeply open;
6. Bleed out into bathtub. 
7. Fin. 

I'll prepare notes whilst sober, reminding me not to contact anyone once I'm drunk. The flat/apartment will be empty. If the carpet knife doesn't work I may break a glass or bottle and use that. 
All's well I'll have completed this before Friday 13th.
