Can hand sanitizer k*ll you?Iâ€™m not going to be a hypocrite, if your here reading this now, chances are your not doing well, but I guess I find comfort in someone feeling the same as me.

Can you ingest hand sanitizer to end it? And possibly how much and for how long will you need to take it to work? 

I know itâ€™s a desperate choice but itâ€™s literally the only things I have in bulk that people in my house wonâ€™t notice go missing like prescription drugs from a previous attempt.

Whatever it is or wherever it is your going, I hope you find your place there soon.
