From then until nowI almost died 6 years ago. Doesnâ€™t matter how I did it. ER Doctor said he thought I might be DOA from the look of me when they carried me in. That always freaked me out. So much that I never wanted to do it again. 

Well, of course I wanted to. But anytime I felt like doing it, I pictured myself back then. Scared me enough not to.

But lately I have been thinking about it a lot. I think about what has transpired between then and now. And... I donâ€™t care. I wish I died back then.
