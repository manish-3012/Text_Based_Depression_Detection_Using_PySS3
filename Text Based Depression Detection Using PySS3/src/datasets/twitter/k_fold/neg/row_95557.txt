Idk what's wrong with meI hate life so much. I'm not even that bad off. I have a place to live. I have ok parents. I dont have any real friends at all. I have my ex boyfriend who uses me for sex but were good friends otherwise. I feel worthless. I feel like a failure. I wish I tried in school. I have fucking HATED every single job I've ever had. Every job has made me suicidally depressed. I just got a new one and thought it would be ok but 5 days in and I want to fucking kill myself. I'm so tired of trying. It would break my dads heart if I killed myself and that's why I wont do it. He found his best friend when he committed suicide. I just want to die so badly though like really bad. If life is going to be this shitty forever I just want to end it now. I miss being a teenager and having friends and having fun. Life after 18 has just been absolute hell. I wish I had someone to talk to who isnt a stranger who knows me and knows what I've been through. I cant talk to my dad about this because he would freak right out. It's just not fair how much I hate living. I see other women my age having so much fun. I just want to slit my wrists and die.
