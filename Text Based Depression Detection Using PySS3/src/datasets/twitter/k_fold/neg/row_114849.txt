I'm about to kill myself or my dadAs the title says I'm so fucking close to either killing myself or my dad. He's always treating me like shit and more like I'm just something he can whatever the fuck he wants with just because he gave birth to me. He micromanages my life and doesn't give two flying fucks what I think/want/feel. As long as he gets his way then he's happy. If i try to reason with him at all it's like I'm the fucking worst ever and i just killed his best friend or some shit. He knows quite well that I have severe depression and that I've attempted suicide well over 20 times but he doesn't give a shit. Funny thing is is that he is the reason I want to die. I've even cut myself down to the fat on my arm and he just blames it on me wanting attention or some shit. He never owns up to the fact that he's a piece of shit. Now despite being as bad as some of the worst scum ever to live he does still provide physically for me when he can afford it. But the problem is is that he regularly can't afford it and then stresses out and takes it out on me. Because of this I've attempted suicide about 26ish times to no avail (obviously). For the most part I've been able to handle by cutting or drugs (I'm a bit of a chemist and make my own) but that doesn't really work anymore. I've tried therapy and pills but they don't do shit anymore either.
So now for my big issue and the whole reason I'm going to fucking lose my mind. I'm 17 and I'll be 18 in about 2 weeks so I'll be legally allowed to move out and he can't do shit about it; However I have no money, no job, no education to get said job (still in high school), my grades are so shit i can't go to university or college, I have no personality, I'am a fucking asshole to everyone without trying, and I have no "legal" skills. So my dad is making me either go to university or get s job. But my grades are shit so uni is out of the question and even if they were decent and I got accepted I have no money to pay for it. And as for getting a job, I have no personality because I spend all of my time in my room so no ones going to want to hire me. My dad has said that if I don't do either then he's going to kick me out. But I have nowhere to go so I'd be homeless with no money. I'd be fucked and honestly better off dead at that point so instead of having to go through that I'd rather just kill myself. My only other option (not really an option, just me losing my FUCKING MIND at my dad) is killing my dad and then killing myself.
FYI there are people who give a shit about me (grandparents) but they can't afford to look after me until I can afford to live on my own.

TL;DR My dads gunna kick me out and I have nowhere to go, I'm gunna lose my mind and commit a murder-suicide, wtf do I fucking do.

EDIT: Thanks for the amount of responses and attempts to help but this was more or less just a rant. And btw I live in NL Canada so Iâ€™m in the middle of butt fuck nowhere so thereâ€™s not a lot of services here and those that are here donâ€™t apply to me.
