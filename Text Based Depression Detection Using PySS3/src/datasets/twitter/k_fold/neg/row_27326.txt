I hate this life and Iâ€™m numbThe bad things that would usually hurt donâ€™t anymore.I canâ€™t hurt Iâ€™m already broken.Ive chased happiness all my life and I never seem to grasp it. Iâ€™m turning 23 next month and I wouldnâ€™t care if I saw it.My biggest fear with suicide is if there are consequences in the afterlife, I just want there to be nothing at all.I want kill myself so bad but thereâ€™s always a little something inside telling me to keep going but idk if I can.
