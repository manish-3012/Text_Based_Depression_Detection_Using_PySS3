Off my chestI plan on committing suicide soon. Iâ€™ve  premeditated it, bought everything I need for it. I feel relief more than sadness.
I just wanted to get this off my chest so I donâ€™t burden myself with guilt. I donâ€™t have anyone who will miss me, but I feel like Iâ€™m failing myself. I know itâ€™s ok though.
