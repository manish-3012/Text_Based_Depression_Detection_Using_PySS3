i'm a danger to myselfi was looking at the self help books in the psychology section of a bookstore and i accidentally triggered the hell out of myself and remembered more details about my trauma and i've been dissociating ever since. i want to die. i didn't want to know these new details and now i'm going to analyze every inch of them and it'll tear me apart i just want to forget. i'll stop thinking when i'm dead
