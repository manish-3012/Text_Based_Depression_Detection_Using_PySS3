I need advice, helpI'm trying not to break down.
My emotionally abusive ex-boyfriend is trying to talk to my friend. I don't know what he'll do to her. I am the reason since he is trying to reach out to me, because I didn't respond to him.
I don't want my friend to get stressed or hurt, she hates his ass.

I figured if I ruin my reputation to him he would stop all of this. I want to say I cheated to him, even if I didn't, or maybe say I kissed another guy while I was drunk. 
That way he would immediately cut me off.

But I am worried about consequences. I might get hit. Also, he probably will gossip all my secrets. He also knows my address. Also, he is in the military right now. What if he misbehaves? I need you guy's advice.

Pros are he would stop the bullshit to me and my friend immediately.

Also, just confronting all the bullshit he said when we were together would make him mad. Admitting I hate him would make him mad, but he will try to talk me out, so saying that I cheated seems to be the best option right now.

I would rather be hit once and get gossiped, cut off than him keep trying all the ways to reach out to me.
