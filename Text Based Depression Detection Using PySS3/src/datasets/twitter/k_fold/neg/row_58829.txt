i want to kill myself.iâ€™m 25 year old girl and iâ€™m closer than iâ€™ve ever been before. everyday the thought just gets easier and more normalized. i donâ€™t see a purpose on this earth. society sucks. i donâ€™t feel like a have a place anywhere, a family or friend to call my own. iâ€™ve been battling long enough and i am tired. so iâ€™m here asking what stopped you from killing yourself and why shouldnâ€™t i?
