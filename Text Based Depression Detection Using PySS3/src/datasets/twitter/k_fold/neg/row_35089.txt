My brother killed himself and I want to be with himTwo days ago.
We both struggled with depression. He much longer than I.
I was doing better. Healthier,  happier.

Now all of my lonely depressive feelings have come back. And I want to take one of his guns.
I wont. I think I want to still live.

I miss you Abbie.
