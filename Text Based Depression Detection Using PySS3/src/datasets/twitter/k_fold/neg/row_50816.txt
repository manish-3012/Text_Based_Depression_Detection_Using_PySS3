If death waits for no one, why should one have to wait for death?I get this feeling that i just don't care anymore about winning or losing in life.  After all we are born into this losing battle.  

But it's that how I feel or is it just the last shreds of sanity screaming out?  I have been drug free now for over a month with the exception of election night alcohol binge.  I thought being sober for that long would restore some sort of balance but somehow I am less stable than I can remember ever being.
