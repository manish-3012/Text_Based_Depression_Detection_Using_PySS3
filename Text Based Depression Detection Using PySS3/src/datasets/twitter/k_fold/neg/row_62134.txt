The love of my life left and I am at my point.I'm not sure what to say, I've never been good with these sorts of things, but I am at a loss as to what to do. One of my best friends, who I was deeply in love with, took her own life. I don't know what to do with my life anymore.

We at one point had a relationship, but for reasons I understood at the time, she decided we needed time apart. In the interim we remains extremely close and talked to each other every day. I always had feelings for her, but I wanted her to be happy on her own terms. She started dating again and I stayed by her and helped her through a lot of the things she went through. We both battled the same demons, we both thought about suicide at some point, but we always promised Wed never leave the other behind. She had been with someone recently who tested her like a bootycall. Made all sorts of promises he never intended to keep, and once she was in the thick of it basically broke her heart. It was devastating to hear her in it, and I did everything I thought I could to see her through.

On the last night I spoke to her she said she loved me, that she was never disappointed in me and that I. Was the only guy she ever trusted. I wanted to tell her so bad all the things I wanted to say, but in the back of my mind I knew it wasn't what she wanted to hear, or needed to right, now. She asked me to call her in the morning and that's when I awoke to my nightmare.

It's been two months since she took her own life. I haven't been able to much much else aside from work and cry. She was the only person who made me want to be better, try to be better. Now it all seems so trivial. Pointless. I had never met anyone before her that lit a fire in me I thought could never be extinguished. I can't believe I was wrong. She mean the world to me, I'd have done anything for her if she'd have asked. 

I can't do this.i can't keep going on when the best part of me is no longer here.
