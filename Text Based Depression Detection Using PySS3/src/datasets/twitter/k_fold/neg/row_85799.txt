I think I will but its scary.Moms about to get a gun for protection and show me how to use it, but now that I have the chance I'm starting to get scared. I dont wanna burden anyone anymore, after a personal inncendent years ago I mental can love anyone anymore. Its like my brain is trying to hold me down, I cant make friends, my family means almost nothing to me and no matter how hard I try, making relationships/bonds like I used to as a child is impossible. Well, bye.
