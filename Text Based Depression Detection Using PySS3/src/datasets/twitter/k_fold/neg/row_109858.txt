I have been this way my whole lifeI have been alone for 2 years. Iâ€™ve tried randomly to reach out. I have honestly never expected anyone to say something that would change my mind, and yet hope someone will.  I have the next week alone and it seems like the best opportunity. I canâ€™t feel anything, no empathy, no anger, nothing.
