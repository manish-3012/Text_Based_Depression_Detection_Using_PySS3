Just confused and alienatedI keep trying to talk to my family. Everything I say just get rebuffed.
The only person I really have to talk to is my dad and he drowns himself in booze every time we're even in a condition to talk. 

I'm getting close to the end of my rope. 
I'm thinking of just walking down the highway and leaving them behind, but that would probably not end in anything but me in a jail cell for falling asleep on the side of the highway.

I've begged since I entered university to have a regular predictable budget so I can try and get myself off the ground, but I can't get it. 
My mother works with children of very young ages and it feels like she's trying to keep me perpetually as one of these kids. 

Since I began I've had to beg for all the money I've needed, which has made me feel incredibly guilty.
I've tried to tell her that begging humiliates me, but she seems to not comprehend.

I really just want someone to talk to I guess, and I've got no one. 
Relationship of 6 years won't even talk to me.
