Thinking about going now. Not sure because i'm a coward, but I know i should.it's right downstairs. oblivion's comforting and terrifying all at once. but i'm probably too cowardly/weak to do it now. guess i'll have to do it soon though. who knows. maybe drinking will lower my inhibitions enough. who knows.

EDIT: little bit intoxicated right now. only sivenish drinks in less than two hours.

i gotta work up spine and do it soon.
