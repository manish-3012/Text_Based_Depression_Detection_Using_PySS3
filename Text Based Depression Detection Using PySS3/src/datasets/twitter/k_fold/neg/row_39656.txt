22k in debt and just defaultedMore and more just keep piling on. Unable to find a job, not being able to pay my loans. Mental health hanging by strings and I'm just mentally ready to go somewhere quiet and end it all. I never understood why people take their own lives cause of money. But being in the position now it is bright as day why they do it and I'm about to join them. I had a few reasons not to do it but now those reasons are gone and I'm just waiting for the last straw to be added to the pile. I feel relieved when I think about everything ending. Relief knowing im no longer a disappointment to everyone. Knowing my end is around the corner is the only joy I have had in the past few years.
