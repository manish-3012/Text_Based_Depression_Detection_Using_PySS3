bad night n whyim really struggling tonight. i feel like im unworthy of love and nobody cares about me. the people i value the most only speak to me when its most convient for them. i am in a 3 ppl friend group n both my friends have borderline. one barely speaks to me n the other i feel is only friends with me to be controlling. i tried setting a boundary with her and she told me that i was wrong for having a problem with it and began telling me i never listen to her. before i talked to her i was having a good day and i told her that and idk she got really mad at me. they have a tendancy to tell me who i am and who im not n i already struggle with having a sense of self due to being raised by a narcissist. i feel like everyone just wants to fuck with my head. i feel lile everyome watches me like im some sort of goldfish n they feel nothing

i feel like living is such an inconvience and im always uncomfortable all the time just by existing in a human body. i want to cease my existence n i always have a plan available. 

anyway, i keep justifying and proving to myself that nobody cares abt me and im completely insignificant to my friends and family, im not special or loved by anyone and its hitting me real hard tonight. im trying to fight these thoughts and feeling by reminding myself that at least my dog loves me n the proof of that is shes sleeping next to me.
