Life is drainingIt feels like 100% of my energy is being used to keep myself from killing myself, and I don't have any energy left to do enjoy things.

I haven't been to any of my classes or my job in a week. I've been telling everyone that I've been sick.

Staying alive is so fucking hard. it's even harder knowing that all I'm doing is trying to avoid death.
