Iâ€™m probably just faking my suicidal ideationIf I was really suicidal, Iâ€™d do it. I wouldnâ€™t call the hotline. I wouldnâ€™t ask my friends for advice. I wouldnâ€™t be posting about it here on Reddit. If I was, Iâ€™d have done it by now. Iâ€™m just an insult. There are people out there who are actually suicidal, and here I am thinking about my death but not doing anything to carry it out.
Iâ€™m sorry.
