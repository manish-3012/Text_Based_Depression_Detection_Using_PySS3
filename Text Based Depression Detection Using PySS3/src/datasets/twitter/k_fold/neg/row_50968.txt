Really cannot do this anymoreI can't do this, I don't want to eat, I can't move, I just want to die. I am so disgusting and worthless I don't even deserve a life. I have nothing to contribute to anyone, I am just one useless speck out of 7 billion other people who can give more to society than I can. I'm just a drain. I really wish someone would kill me, I don't even have the energy to do it myself. I look like a corpse, I'm revolting, I can hear screaming in my head and I frequently say to myself 'just let me die'.
I really don't want to do this anymore, why can't I just stop existing.
