It happened again...So I missed work entirely last Friday because I just didn't want to get out of bed all day.  I didn't even call it in, which is a really bad idea, by the way.  But I smoothed that over by telling him "something came up" and I didn't think to call him.  Not justifying my actions last week, of course, but still...

Then, today, I woke up as usual and started getting ready, and then...again, I decided not to go in, but this time I did call it in as being ill--I *did* feel a bit sick to my stomach this morning, though, but not enough to miss work...

I like my job, I really do; it's way better than my old one, and after ten weeks unemployment, it's practically perfect.  Great company with a friendly competitive atmosphere (we earn five dollars in cash for each successful sale, in addition to our hourly rate of nine dollars an hour.)

So, why have I missed work twice in seven days?  I can't justify it as just depression, can I?  I'm on medication and it seems effective, since I'm in a *much* better place mentally and emotionally than ever before in my life.

Not sure why I posted this here.  I need to discuss this with my actual therapist, but I didn't tell her about missing Friday either.  Just feeling kind of down...
