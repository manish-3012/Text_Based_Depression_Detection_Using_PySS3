I dont want to, it just doesn't seem likely ill make it.Autistic, in a lot of physiological pain. Suffering alot from loneliness. My wife and I are no longer together. Im sick. Im sad. Im hurt. Every time my heart beats a little too hard or too much it feels like the blood is barely being pushed through my veins and especially in my major arteries. I have no fluid. Im constantly fearing death. Im terrified and sincerely dead silent, alone. This is not okay for me. Ive always been able to effectively grab on and hold on to a comfort person or item if its less intense than what im currently feeling. This intensity has me gasping for air on my back and begging alternately to die quick as I collapse in on myself or when they ask me to do it in response to a rapists mass grace of over 180 people.
