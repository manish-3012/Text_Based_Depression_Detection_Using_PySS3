Is there a flaw in my logic?A common deterrent from suicide is that itâ€™s â€œselfish to leave your loved ones behindâ€ and things of the like. I understand. However, at what point does it become acceptable to look out for yourself? Im so fucking tired of dragging myself on in my shitty day to day existence when I have nothing to live for or look forward to. I donâ€™t want to live for the sake of others. **Is it not selfish to force someone to live just for your own happiness at the cost of theirs?** The burden is too much. Im not a father nor am I a husband. Objectively speaking: No one NEEDS me, they just really really want me around. **When people get cancer and die, the go-to quote is â€œAtleast they arenâ€™t suffering anymore.â€ So why is it wrong to want the same thing for myself? To be free from this torture.** I cant take this shit anymore.
