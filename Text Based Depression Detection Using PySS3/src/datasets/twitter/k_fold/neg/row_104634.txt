I donâ€™t want to become one of those alive older people still strugglingI always see other people who still have social anxiety, depression into their 30s 40s etc. A lot of them say they regret not killing themselves younger before they suffered more. Iâ€™m about to hit my 20s I havenâ€™t been happy since 8th grade. I canâ€™t improve my life everytime I go through anything new I have a freakout. Eg tried to go through a job interview had a mental breakdown and made the employer guy stressed. This has happened 3 different times and I felt ashamed of my behaviour but I couldnâ€™t control myself in the moment
