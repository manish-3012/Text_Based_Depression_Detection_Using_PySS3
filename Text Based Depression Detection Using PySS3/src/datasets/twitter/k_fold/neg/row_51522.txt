can't shake the thoughts latelyNever been properly diagnosed with depression, but I'm pretty sure I've got it. Been thinking a lot lately about killing myself and it doesn't really scare me. I just want to be normal. I can't hold down a job, I wake up for a shift and I just can't force myself to go. Idk if it's depression or if I'm just a lazy piece of shit who needs to grow up. Probably the latter. Idk, I just think it would be better for most people if I wasn't around. I'm not sure what to do. I let the love of my life go and now I'm not sure if I regret it or not, but I know for a fact I'm not dealing with it. Just ignoring it until it swallows me whole at night when I'm too weak to fight it. 

I told my friends the other day that I'd been having thoughts and they took it well. Thanked me for not doing it. Told me they're there if I need them. But now I feel like a nuisance. I don't want to bother them with my petty bullshit. And it doesn't feel like they really care tbh. Not one of them has asked how I'm doing in days despite knowing the last few days have been shit. 

I should see a doctor probably. But I'm afraid of being told I'm faking it, or I'm just lazy, or I'm wrong. I just want to fucking die.
