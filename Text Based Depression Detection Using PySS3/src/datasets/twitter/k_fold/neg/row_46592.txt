annoyedI know weâ€™re not allowed to advocate for un-aliving ourselves/others but the amount of â€œpeople will miss youâ€ â€œit gets betterâ€ shit is garbage. Most of not all the adults (20+) who have posted here have more than likely reached out multiple times and are at their wits end. That shit is so condescending. I have been to 5 different therapists I have been the wards I have done inpatient and outpatient. I have had the odd day or so where I didnâ€™t immediately wake up thinking of killing my sled. But guess what I still struggle daily with my depression. 

Do you people who donâ€™t suffer with cptsd/depression/ptsd/trauma in general not get how utterly cruel and selfish you sound when you call suicidal people selfish? I am exhausted from carrying this pain for 19 years. You think I donâ€™t want to be here to watch my little cousins who are like brothers to me grow up? You are guilting and manipulating people so you arenâ€™t affected. Boohoo.
