I'm lost in limboThis episode is a fucking weird one.

I mean I thought I was almost better and clear of the depression. But nah nothing that used to work is working anymore.


It's like i'm stuck in limbo, I kinda know what I need to do, yet I have no motivation whatsoever. I'm stuck, it makes me feel so fucking worthless. 


I don't know how I can get out of this place, the only way I can think of getting out is by killing myself.

Like i'm tired of fighting it's getting harder and harder to hide the real me.


My relationships with my parents is crumbling, I can hardly speak to them anymore. I can hardly speak to anyone anymore. 


I need something that will help me out of limbo something that will save me. If not I think the only option would be suicide.


I'm at the crossroads and I don't know how to get through them I just need something and i dont know what that something is:):
