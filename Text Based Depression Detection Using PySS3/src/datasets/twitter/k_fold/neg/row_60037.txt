I should be killed. I am from an upper middle class professional class background and I failed.I am about to fallout of the middle class. At least if I end up poor I will not feel bad anymore. I have struggled in life despite being born into such privilege. I feel so guilty about that. 

I am an awful person. I wish someone else had been born into my privilege. 

They say that since upper middle class people don't have fear of poverty and experience of that they don't succeed as much as their parents. The thing about that is that is that the fear of poverty does nothing positive for me. 

No matter what I still want to die. I sill find it difficult to do my work/focus on anything. I have been this way most of my life. 

I should be killed and my life privileges should be transferred to someone else.
