When things are good I have suicidal ideation or am too angry to notice, but now EVERYTHING has gone wrong.I'm Canadian and my country's leader set up an emergency fund for a bunch of people until we get our jobs back. I watch everyone else get it, but mine never came in. I just dont get money I get. I've been cut off of suboxone even though I was stable and drug free, and I was taken off benzos, which ends in psychosis, violent outbursts at people who are "out to get me".

I've been a drain on my family financially and emotionally.

Everyone tells suicidal people that it's all in their head, but I have the bank statements and familial drama based around my drug use (because who actually believes someone when they say they quit heroin). I could list out other ways in which I hurt the people I love, but we'd be here all day.

So here I am. Dopesick, selling possessions just to fucking eat, hurting everyone around me and too lazy to help myself in any way on account of my normal baseline depression and shit attitude, let alone this mess. So why bother sitting around feeling pain, emotionally and now physically (withdrawal hurts, a lot). Why?

Just for the shot of beating this thing when I hit forty, working a minimum wage job because I cant hold down jobs/classes? Just for a SHOT at that? Just for a SHOT at a life I dont wanna live? What am I not seeing here?
