bad thoughtsfound out that one of my antidepressants starts to mess things up around 4 grams, and the box holds 9 grams in total. it won't give instant death, mostly seizures.

not going to take any amount beyond the prescription but it's one of those 'so close, yet so far' moments

anyone in the same boat?
