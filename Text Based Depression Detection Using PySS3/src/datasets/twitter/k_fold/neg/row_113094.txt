Triggered by a fucking movieI donâ€™t know where to put this. I saw Us last night and it has this character and her clone and thatâ€™s what itâ€™s like living with my other. 

Like Iâ€™m being chased and she wants to kill me but itâ€™s always and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve been in a dissociative state for most of the day. 

I just donâ€™t know what to do. I feel like Iâ€™m dying already and canâ€™t think clearly. And all of these suicides in the news and I just donâ€™t know anymore. I canâ€™t tell my friends
