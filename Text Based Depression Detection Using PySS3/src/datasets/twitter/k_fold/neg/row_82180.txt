What happens if I were to kill myself in a foreign land?Hello. 16 yr old male here. I tried to look this up before leaving for Ireland, but was only met with bible quotes and the dreaded â€œthink about your loved ones.â€ Iâ€™m staying with my aunt and uncle, so Iâ€™m not sure what that would change. I live in America. 

Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m asking this in the right place. If questions arenâ€™t allowed on this sub, please point me in the right direction so I can get a proper answer. Thank you for your time.
