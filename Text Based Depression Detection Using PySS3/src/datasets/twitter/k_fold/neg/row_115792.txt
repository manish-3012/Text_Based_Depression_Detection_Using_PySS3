Belt around my throat.As i write this i am already set to go. I have a belt wedged in the top of my door, &amp; im ready to go. ill never be good enough. im 19. my parents dont understand my mother doesnt care. my father doesnt see it &amp; my girlfriend... she thinks im joking. im sorry im putting this on reddit. but my last words deserve to be somewhere that thousands of people can see them. Bc if youre fighting depression i want you to keep fighting. dont give up like i have. i am just a kid, but i have nothing left to see. My heart is hollow &amp; my skin no longer gets excited. my brain doesnt even like me. i have 4 different realities. the one i want, the one i hate, the one i vaguely remember- where i was, &amp; the one where im at now. I am 19, &amp; in love. But im also 19, &amp; giving up. Someone find the love of my life &amp; let her know im sorry for all that i have done. Her names Hailey. Shes beautiful, blue eyes, nose pierced on the right side. Someone tell her i loved her please.
