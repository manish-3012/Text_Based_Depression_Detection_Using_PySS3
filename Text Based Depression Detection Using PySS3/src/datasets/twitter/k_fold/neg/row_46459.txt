Gosh man why....Iâ€™m a 25 yr old male. Fit active, good job, own my own house. Well guys I royally screwed up, my hypochondriac self dug myself a big rut. Never have been this way or at least this bad until beginning of march. Iâ€™m so mad and angry and disappointed in myself. 
I started loosing a bunch of weight, and feeling like crap and doctors donâ€™t really have a explanation.  Have had all my blood ran, saw a neurologist for ra, lupus, ms. Cause I have been having all the same symptoms for the past 5 months. Which really worried me, and obviously made everything a lot worse. 

I probably ended up in the er 6 times in the past 3 months and and had 2 chest X-rays and 3 ct scans, and all kinds of blood work done for what.... nothing.. all because I was sooooo worried and wrapped up that I had some sort of disease and manifested symptoms of severe stress and anxiety and it obviously a mental illness I wasnâ€™t very aware off until now. I suffer from some extreme ocd which goes hand in hand with my anxiety. I donâ€™t wish this upon my worst enemy. Just needed to vent. 


To add I wasnâ€™t aware of the radiation I was exposed to either which now freaks me out big time.. Iâ€™m just ready to give up sometimes. This really does suck big time.. thanks yâ€™all.
