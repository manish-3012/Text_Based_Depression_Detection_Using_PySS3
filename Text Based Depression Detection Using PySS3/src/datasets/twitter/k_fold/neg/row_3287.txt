Giving myself a deadlineHi. I've been going through those posts today, and decided to write my own.

This weekend my girlfriend and I broke up, because I was a selfish and impulsive bastard, and really ended up thinking that she is better off without me now. During those last days, she unleashed doubt over how much truth my love for her carried, for if one truly wants to stay with a loved one, one should also want to improve and heal. She also told me lots of things in anger, including that I should disappear.  I don't know, things just seem hopeless for me right now, I don't see much light in the future and I repeat to myself that she's better off without me. 

I called her "my harmony". How boring can music be without harmony, right? Thus I've decided to set a deadline for my melody, a fade out set to end on November 5th. We'll see if I change my mind, but I already scheduled to transfer half my investments to her and my brother.
