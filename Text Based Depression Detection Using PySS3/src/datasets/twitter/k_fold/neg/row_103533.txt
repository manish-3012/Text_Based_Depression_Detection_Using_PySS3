donâ€™t have to read, just a rant dwI like my way of looking at life, is it intelligent and it has proven to me successful in continuing with as little pain as possible, ofc i do not mind pain as you learn so much from it, nearly everything worth doing from comes continuing through the shit but the other night I prayed to God to kill me and i am not religious, i just believe that there has to be something more, so i was praying to whatever that was and i was very scared to wake up dead, even though thatâ€™s what i asked for yet today for the first time ever I really just felt it. Really Really felt it, that agony. donâ€™t even know what iâ€™m saying, just, you know that feeling? that real feeling of â€œjust fucking take me.â€ yeah.. anyway. thanks for reading this if you did lol. needed to put it somewhere.
