15 and suicidalI've been thinking about this for years now, nothing in my life makes me happy. I have almost no friends, my family hates me, I hate them.  My only friend, lets call him ali. Ali is my only friend in school.  I like him but he's always putting me down. Like how In 9th grade I never made the soccer team and I got bullied by him for months. I made the team in 10th grade but he stil says I suck.  The soccer team hates me because I scored an own goal once. I just cant stop being depressed, people keep telling me to smile but I just CANT.
