My friend is suicidal and I don't know what to do.I really have no idea where to ask this so please tell me if theres a more qualified subreddit.

I have a friend who is going through some pretty rough crap. Her parents are drug addicts and alcoholics and haven't talked to her in three months. She's living with her aunt currently and her aunt keeps telling her how she'll just turn out like them.

So today she goes around telling quite a lot of people how she tried to overdose on adderall (she takes it for ADHD) She told me she took four pills Saturday and was throwing up all day. Then she tells me about how she's planning on doing it this Saturday. The hardest thing is she told my friends and I if we tell an adult she will kill herself right there and then.

I don't know what to do. If I don't do anything (anything being telling an adult to get help) she might do it, but if I do tell an adult she might kill herself. Some people thing she's doing for attention because a) she's done this before b) why would you tell literally everyone "I'm such a failure I can't even kill myself right" c) if she really did want to kill herself why didn't she take the whole bottle etc etc I personally don't believe these thing, but at this point if hope its the truth.

So what do I do? Do I just comfort her and hope its enough? Do I tell an adult and potentially cause her death?
