I keep wrecking my surroundings no matter how hard i try.I'm just walking trouble. I'm so full of shit, disorders and traumas, i can't get a single person to like me. Everytime i get a new one they end up crumbling under the weight of my problems and leaving me to rot, but they're the only ones i can vent to. I have a therapist but i wanna talk about illegal shit i have done in the past, but i can't they would send me to the mental hospital or jail. Never again. 
So here i am trying to look for people here. I have nothing else that keeps me alive besides two people that still care about me, but each day i'm on the verge of losing them and they have to go throught a roller coaster of emotions in my company.  I dont know how much longer i can hold without trying to kill myself again.
