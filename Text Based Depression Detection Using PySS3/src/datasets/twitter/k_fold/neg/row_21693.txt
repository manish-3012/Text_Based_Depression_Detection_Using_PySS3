Is a zopiclone overdose an easy way out? I'm so unsure on what I'm doing right now. I'm safe..I have about 30 or so 7.5mg zopiclone. Thing is, I'm not even sure I want to die. I'm just tired of the 4 years or so of trauma I've endured, mostly from mental health professionals and misdiagnosis. I'm tired of the stigma, I can't forget the past. I wish I could. My sister phoned me as she's worried I'm going to end up dead at some point at this rate. I overdosed on two boxes of diazepam, went to hospital, had to be observed 24hrs and was fine medically. They didn't really treat me for it. I was gutted to not have been comatose, enough to forget my traumas. Idk I'm just so tired.
