I cant stop thinking about it...Idk if this is the right place for me to post and idk where to start...

Ive been feeling useless for the past month. I keep questioning myself about my own existence. I feel lazy, useless, no motivation whatsoever, tired, indifferent, negative, overwhelmed, and etc. I know its a selfish thing to do but ive been trying to feel better about myself by reading other people's posts and comparing myself to others. Ive fucked up and made couple huge mistakes recently and i just dont feel motivated to do anything. I recently graduated from college with a decent grade...never had depression or anything. I used to be a very outgoing person with many friends. I was always happy and optimistic. But i think its only because i faked myself to be that way. And now im here doing nothing with my life wasting my life away...

Also, ive been doing research on committing a suicide painlessly and found out that jumping off a building is the quickest and the least painful way to do it. People say you most likely pass out during the fall and i think i can bare with that. I know im selfish for doing this (yes, i have family and friends who care about me) but i just dont care about anything anymore. I dont even know if i can get a job or be successful in life.

What is the true meaning of life? Why should I even care about it if Im ready to just be done with this world. Im an atheist and i believe that theres nothing after death. So why should i be scared of death? Im in my late 20's and i really dont see any point of trying...
