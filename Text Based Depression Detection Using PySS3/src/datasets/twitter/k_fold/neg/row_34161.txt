For the first time in my life someone predicted I was feeling suicidal.I was leaving a friend of mineâ€™s house, and he sensed something was wrong. He told me to come back inside and chill. Which we did. 

I still insisted on leaving but before I did, he asked me if I was â€˜planning somethingâ€™. I said no. Which he saw straight through. Then he said... â€œDonâ€™t lie to meâ€. Damn. Damn man. Those words really woke me up in that moment. 

They were so powerful, I legit ceased any thought of acting it out entirely.so grateful.
