So EmptyI made an alt, not that the only person in my life that knows my regular account gives a fuck to look at it. I've just had a long and frank conversation with my I guess ex GF.. on and off for the better part of a decade. She feels we have no future together. She's felt that way a long time. She doesn't trust me because I wanted to get close to her. I called it getting close. She maintains that I'm clingy and I crush boundaries. She put up some.. creative.. boundaries too and I constantly seem to run afoul of them. The thing is, she can't enumerate them until I've trounced all over them. I've been trying so hard. Fuck. I let my friend die of cancer so I could look after her when she decided to quit eating. I should've been there for him, but I was busy nursing her through her melancholy. Not even a thanks, no understanding for my viewpoint.. just, nothing. Now I feel empty too. Like, why suffer more. You're laboring under a delusion. I've been carrying this 9mm round in my pocket for 18 months now. I told her I threw it away, but I may still have need of it. I don't always think about using it, but lately it seems the only remedy for my pain. My mind is in agony, my body slowly failing. My heart, busted into little pieces. I've tried until there was nothing left to give. She took some of what I offered and threw the rest into the trash. I wish she'd have tried. Or at least been more up front that she was just going to let me wear myself out trying. Now, the temptation to step out back and blow the top of my head off just seems.. like the last option. Like I've ground myself down, sequestered myself from other friends just trying to have something with her, and she let me think what i wanted. I hate feeling stupid. And that's about all I feel anymore. So fuck, maybe this 9x19 parabellum will clear my mind. I hate to leave such a mess on the porch, but she'll have her space.
