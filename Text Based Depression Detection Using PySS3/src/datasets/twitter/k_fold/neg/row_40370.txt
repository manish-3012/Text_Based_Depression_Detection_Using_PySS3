Really hoping for a vaccine/cure soon to start my bucket list and end it allCanâ€™t come soon enough.  
Reason: way too much pain, therapy and meds help but the past is way too strong.  
Past:  6 years of bullying while in an abusive household (narcissistic father). My â€œnon abuseâ€ time were from school to home and vice versa.  
Due to narcissistic father I sought narcissistic partners as it was the only love I knew (not anymore), Iâ€™m convinced Iâ€™m ugly and fat (eating disorder and body dysmorphia).  
At almost 30 Iâ€™m unable to understand what a relationship of any kind should be like so I feel like a failure in my personal life.  
At work even though numbers show Iâ€™m productive Iâ€™m called the opposite.  
Also got a deep vein thrombosis since Monday. So yay...   
So yes, canâ€™t come soon enough.
