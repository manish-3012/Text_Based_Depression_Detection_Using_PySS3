I don't feel anything anymore.I have struggled with depression for years, it has ruined my life and taken everything I had ever dreamed about or cared about away from me. It had recently gotten better and then worse again, with it being really bad last week. I scheduled an appointment with a therapist today for next Thursday, I was trying to get better. But about an hour ago I just got the feeling of fuck this all. It's not a sad feeling either, just kind of empty and angry. I don't wanna go to my shitty job tomorrow, I don't wanna have awkward conversations with my crush at work who already has a BF anyway. I don't want to spend another weekend alone doing nothing. I don't want to spend another night cuddling with my pillow wishing it was a human being. I don't want to be lonely and friendless anymore, I don't want to be depressed, and most of all I don't want to be alive anymore. Nothing is going to get better, this is all pointless and I'm pretty much done with it. Fuck life.
