Reddit, it's my birthday today.It's my 16th birthday. Which I guess is pretty big. For every single one of my friends, I've planned parties so they could enjoy it. But today, none of them did anything for me. I feel so invisible and forgotten. 

I feel like I've entered a shit storm. 

I fucked up a major exam. I am currently having a series of exams as well. I broke up recently. My parents are in a rough patch.

And worst of all, I feel another episode coming back. I'm Bipolar. I'm not sure if I feel like dying right now. But I am so afraid those thoughts will come back again. 

Please help. I just kinda need someone to talk to.
