I want to end it with all my heart but others hold me back.I can't live with myself anymore. It's clear my life wont be bearable when im an adult because im fucked in school and can't hold a promise to save my life. Everythings a joke to me and I don't even care anymore. And every time I think of ending it, my parents pop into my mind as well as my siblings, other relatives and friends and enemies. The list is endless but I stay alive for their sake and I wish they didn't care about me so I wouldn't be tied to this world
