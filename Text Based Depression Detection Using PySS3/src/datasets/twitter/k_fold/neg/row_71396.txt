Emptiness and LonelinessLately Iâ€™ve found it harder to do things I donâ€™t want to do, and any small inconvenience is a nightmare. Iâ€™ve always struggled with depression, suicidal thoughts and intent has been an issue on a few occasions but Iâ€™ve never felt this new kind of emptiness before. Iâ€™m not really interested in living but as long as it isnâ€™t something I have to work hard it then I donâ€™t mind, but when I have to go out of my way to do things that I donâ€™t like or donâ€™t want to, I find myself really questioning if itâ€™s even worth going through or just ending my life all together. Living has almost become an inconvenience itself. The only thing that really keeping me going is my favorite video games series, i know how dumb or pathetic that might sound but itâ€™s only the only thing that honestly brings me peace anymore. Iâ€™m also slightly clinging to the hope that Iâ€™ll get involved with someone romantically, but Iâ€™m 20 and finally went on my first date recently and it was a bust :/ I just donâ€™t see myself making that kind of connection with a stranger, and no one that Iâ€™m interested in ever seems interested in me. Most of the time people only want me for my looks, but I want someone I can talk to, not just someone who has a pretty face and wants to mess around. And although I know itâ€™s unfair to expect one person to come in and change my life, putting that big of a responsibility on them without them knowing, I donâ€™t expect them to fix everything. I hope that theyâ€™ll help me with my first steps towards a healthy mental state just by giving me someone in my life, and then I can start the journey with the motivation Iâ€™ve been lacking.

Idk if saying any of this will really help me but itâ€™s been burdening me down a lot lately and I feel if I donâ€™t seek help soon I might reach to point where itâ€™s too late. Thank you for taking time to read this, I appreciate your kind heart and wish you well. &lt;3
