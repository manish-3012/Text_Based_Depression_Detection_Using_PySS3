I'm going to kill myselfThanks to encouragement from u/iqtaanqalunaaurat and the wonderful r/ShitRedditSays community, I now have a plan to kill myself, since I know it will be so well received. I know I should kill myself because I'm white, because I'm Republican, because I'm male. I know you want me to kill myself because I've seen the things you say. I'm white. I'm male, I'm a Republican.

 I'm going to use a 9mm handgun, even though a shotgun has a higher success rate, aiming at the temple, in order to end my own life. Did you know that, of the people who've survived attempted suicide with a firearm, the majority of them were using handguns, while only 5% were using shotguns? Why a gun? Despite what movies and television shows would have us believe, overdosing on prescription medication only has a lethality rate of around 12%. 12%!, that's nowhere near good enough. An "exit bag" holds around 23%, while ODing on illegal drugs pulls up at around 50%. Of course, each of these carry a certain amount of pain with them as well. A shotgun to the head has over a 99% success rate, and only ranks around a 5/100 in terms of "agony". I don't have access to a shotgun, so I'm going with the next best thing. 

I've already been through the mental health system, they came to my door the day I planned to end it. I got to ride in the back of a cop car and everything. They put me in an institution, they kept me for three days. I know they cannot help me, that they will not help me, because I am a conservative and deserve to die. They said I was schizophrenic. I've stopped taking my medication because a Republican white male like me doesn't deserve it. I don't deserve therapy, I don't deserve anything but death. Pay the people who have to clean up my gray matter a bonus for me. I took the time, I hurried up, the choice was mine. I'm done with that, time to go, no more to come. I voted for Donald Trump, He is the Tetragrammaton. May He bathe the world in nuclear fire, Amen.
