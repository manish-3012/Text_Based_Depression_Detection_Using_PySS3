My best friend in the world is starting to scare me...I was in the lunch room yesterday (I'm a junior in high school) and my best friend came up to sit down and he tells me that he's going through a phase in his life where he doesn't really know what to do anymore and he's begun to question what to live for; that he's geniunely scared about his future because he doesn't know if he has one. Can anyone please tell me if I'm just overreacting because I'm just really really scared shitless.
