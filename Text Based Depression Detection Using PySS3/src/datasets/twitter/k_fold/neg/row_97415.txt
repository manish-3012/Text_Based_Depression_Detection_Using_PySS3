im sad. what's new, scooby doo?hi. 19 year old gal here. I've been depressed for about... I'd say solidly since I was thirteen, but maybe before that. and I think the times coming up where I'm going to STORM my 5'0 ass down to hell after letting myself take that step off the bridge. 

heres why

1) (this ones the most important one, so might aswell buckle up) the fact that I'm useless. I cant do anything without being brought to some sort of bullshit anxiety attack that I should be able to get over. For example, the phone. I should be able to call someone I've never called before on a phone, right? Nah. Apparently not, because I'm a little bitch. I can't call anyone. I cant talk to anyone new. I can't drive anywhere. This is all a big deal to me because in order to get out of my shitty job, I'm going to have to call someone eventually. Assuming I'd ever actually make it to college, that is, because boy howdy we already know how my work ethic rolls. Then theres the problem of driving- fuck, I cant fucking drive anywhere new. Why? Because I'm afraid of fucking up. I'd rather sit on my ass on my computer all day in a circle that doesnt do anything beneficial to me than actually drive. I get nervous. And it's stupid, considering the fact that literally anyone else can get over this fear. No!!! Not me (: and that's just one fucking thing. Because I can't drive anywhere, I think that's why no one wants to hang out with me. I cant clean my car I cant run errands I cant do anything. I'm quite literally useless. I know how to do nothing on my own and that doesnt make me useful to society in any way, shape, or form.. I feel like I have a lot more to say about this but I can't think of what. Just the way that I'm not beneficial. I can't even do anything for myself. Half the days I don't even shower.

2) I'm annoying. This is another big one because I'm so, so, so fucking sick ot myself and I know why I do the things that I do. I like to blame it on my undiagnosed ADHD(TM). I'm just needy for attention and desperate and I just can't shut my fucking mouth. So many times I want to shut my fucking mouth but I CAN'T. No one cares about what I'm saying!!!!!!! Literally NO ONE you think I'd get the fucking message by now that I'm not funny, I'm not good at anything, I'm just so disgustingly average that people pretend they're listening to music on their earbuds so they don't have to fucking talk to me. I try to look in from an outside perspective if that makes sense, what other people must be thinking like when I'm in the room, and it's repulsive. I'm repulsive. It's why nobody fucking likes me. I just want to fucking kill myself already this is all ridiculous. I need to learn to shut up I need to learn to sit still I need to learn that if I'm going to push people away from me that if they dont come back, that's on me. I'm doing this all to myself. 

So now it's time to think. Think nobody actually fucking likes me and I'll always be the second, third, fourth choice no matter WHAT I do. No matter what I do! I can't think of a single person where I come first. I just want to be important to someone but I'm not and I'm such a bitch about it and I just want to kill myself. I think the dream is to go to New York city one last time for a weekend, maybe in may or April, go to central park, pet a dog, get a room on a really high floor, turn on some jazz (I love PMJ- scott bradlees post modern jukebox) then fucking kill myself. Itd be a room with a view and everything I want the same room as last time, I think the one in Midtown looking over the east river. And in April, it's not around anyones birthday.

 I dont want to do it this way I've been praying to God to kill me in a car accident or with some sort of medical mishap but nothings happened. I dont want people to think that there was something they couldve done to stop it I dont want people to feel shittier than they have to over this. Because humans are fucking dumb like that. They form bonds with people and then they act like it's the biggest tragedy when you're gone but they were never there for you in the first place. The amount of times I've reached out for help is fucking ridiculous, and while yeah, I'd love a nice hot plate of therapy, no ones doing anything about it. Should they? It's not their responsibility. I just want some help getting there because I cant fucking do it all on my own. I've started openly saying I'm depressed. I've started openly saying I'm suicidal. It's a miracle how many people just say "meh." I'm not that important,, and like, it hurts but you have to realize everyone is their own main character. Their number one importance is themselves. And if you dont benefit them, they're not going to care about you. Thats the thing that sucks about death, it's not sadness because the person you lost isnt going to reach their full potential- it's because YOU arent going to get to make memories with them anymore. YOU won't be able to spend time with them, they made you laugh or did xyz with you but YOU dont get that anymore. I think it's a self centered thing. People are going to remember the one time I walked into the door and say "hah, miss that, wish that could happen again so sad :(((((" maybe it wouldve happened again if you cared to spend time with me.

 Whatever the case is its really getting to the point where I dont care anymore. And I keep on saying that I don't care but clearly I do because I havent fucking done it yet. I'm scared to kill myself. I mean, itll suck. Of fucking course it will. Itll hurt. It's scary. You dont know what comes next. And a part of me wants to try to see if this gets better. I have some positives. My dogs are really nice. The fat chubby bastard and my little girl german shepherds, they mean the world to me. But they're going to pass away some day. Then what? Will my life have gotten worse by then? Will it be better? 

I'm not just scared of that losing that. I'm scared of who will find me. I'm scared of what will happen if I fuck it up. I'm not scared of what comes next. The thing is that whatevers going to come next, its going to happen eventually. And it might be better than what's happening now.

I think I'm taking a step back and I'm looking at my life for the last year. Computers, work, computer, work. I wait for my one online friend to reply. I roleplay with strangers (AKA write pretending to be Tony Stark. I know. I'm a fucking loser.) I go to work. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. And I don't have the motivation to go out and do anything. 

I've been making strides to try and change this by adding college into the mix. I havent even gotten my transcripts yet. I need to look at this cycle and tell myself if itll change. I could be emo and say I dony think it will, because I dont. I dont think I'm going to date anyone, I dont think I'm going to get new friendsz, I dont think life is going to get better. I'm 19, I know, I have a lot ahead of me, but I dont want to deal with that all if this is all it's going to be. 
My parents hate me. No, this isn't teenage fueled angst- my dad hasnt talked to me in a month despite me desperately reaching out to him, and my mother and step father argue with me daily. like. I've gotten a bookshelf thrown on me by one of them and they didnt care. Getting called a cunt on the daily. Useless, worthless, move out, move out, move out or they're going to kick me out! And it's not that they're strapped for money. Bro, they're RICH! They own a business. I dont see a lick of that money and I work full time, but I live when them. I get yelled at for leaving my room- like, instantly insulted if I try to talk. 
I'd put in the receipts but uh. Too much effort to screenshot six essays worth of me begging my mom to love me. 

I dont know. I dont know a lot of things. I just know I'm tired of being alone. I'm tired of people always wanting me out. Fuck, man, if you want me out, trust me! I'm trying to go. I'm trying my very hardest to get the courage up to throw myself off that bridge. I'm trying my very hardest to pray to God, Jesus, Allah, anyone I can get my hands on to strike me down where I stand. I'm fucking trying. I don't care if suicide is selfish, I'm sad. Every day I'm sad. Every day, I realize that nobody likes me, I'm touch starved, and I'm disgustingly alone. I sit in my room surrounded by my trash with no one there to love me. I annoy everyone. My online friends and in real life friends (which are... a whopping four people). I really am the definition of useless. Even the positive things I try to rope in about myself are paired with negatives. I'm not good, I'm not talented, I'm not a puzzle piece that properly fits in with the rest of the jigsaw.

I've already started making steps to make it easier if I do grow a nice pair of metaphorical balls- I've taken down all my posters. Cleaned my room up. All my Spider-Man posters. God, I fucking love Spiderman, but I don't have the energy to read anymore of the comics. Not anymore. Fun fact; I bought a five hundred dollar Spider-Man custom made suit to wear to comic con. No one will go with me. I won't go alone. I wore it to Salem on Halloween. That was decent. Halloween is my favorite day. 

 I have things I like, I have things I want, but my issue is I dont want to do them alone. I want someone here with me. I want to share it with someone. It's never going to happen. I'm never going to get anything because then I realize the real truths about myself, I realize the things I'm trying to change but I cant fix about my body and my personality and I cant get rid of them. I'm disgusting. I'd look prettier in a ceramic pot on someones bookshelf. Not that I'm an ugly girl- my face is easy on the eyes I think. Blonde hair, blue eyes, 129 pounds. I'm not the worst in the world. But I have issues with my body that I'm not confident with that stem from hygienic neglect as my mother wouldnt take me to the doctors and wouldnt buy me things like deodorant etc etc. My mom would feel better if I was gone. Sure, shed cry, I think she'd turn it into a pity her fest. I dont really think she likes me all that much. Everything I do to her is an inconvience. It could either be because she doesnt like me, which makes me sad. Or it could because I just suck that bad.

I think I just need to do it. I need to grow a pair. I've already made the decision that if I get kicked out, I am without a doubt going to kill myself. I'm going to jump off a bridge. I want it to be my last cry for help. The thing is I do want help. I can't on my own, I cant. My anxiety won't let me. I've been begging my mom for help, begging my dad for help, my coworkers, I've admitted to everyone I need help. I don't want to feel sad. If I could get my shit together, if I could get on the road to moving to NYC and starting a life and learning to deal with people touching me and getting closer to me maybe, MAYBE it'd be worth it. But the more I call out for help, the more I realize people do not care. And the more I realize people do not care, the people who SHOULD care, I get closer to the conclusion that it's not worth it. I'm disgustingly dependent. 

It's so hard to put a life into words. Theres so much more that's hurting me that I'm quickly running out of energy to type. I want to put more words in to show I'm serious about wanting to die, wanting to stop hurting, wanting to stop being sad, but I can't. I've poured a lot of energy into this. I'm not killing myself in the winter. I want to feel the sun one more time before I go. I want to lay out in Central Park one more time. I want to see the city. Maybe a trip around Boston, too. Once I get those off my bucket list I'm out. 

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
