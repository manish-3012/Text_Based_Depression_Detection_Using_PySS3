i cant go on like thisWell i think thats what they call "the straw that broke the camel's back"
I think for all my life i have been sad, my very first memories are about not understanding "why" living in general.
Always i hoped and   heared that there is more. Coping with love and distractions. Thinking about suicide often, mostly abstract at least till now.      
28 now, very self centred about my looks, my knowledge, my job.   
Tumbled from one unsuccsessful relationship, without ever knowing a woman, to another.
   
In March after another failed attempt i have met the cutest, loving ,caring, beautifulest, romantic woman ever.   
For once i was able to feel in competent, reasoned together with her that her marrige to be would not be for her. She wanted to travel and see the world and found little in comon - tough i must say that i took severe steps to make sure that i am not the asshat telling her to break up. she was already "fleeing" the situation much like i on vacation it at least felt like it was her choice to break up and she took those steps days later on her one.   

On vacation i have sweet talked to her in french, asked her to marry me after 2-4 hours of companionship, on the first day.
The next day of our two days spending in amsterdam, no drugs involved, we connected futher on a spiritual or mental level.   
Invited her to Switzerland where i worked, one moth later. Even payed for her flight tickets and all the expenses.   
She came and by that time her marrige to be was 100% over.
  I sweared to convert to "jehovas witness", her religion and that is where maybe you the reader maybe see the trivle, the stupidness of my love. And i really wanted to convert, she was such a great joyful human being.   
   
Obviously i was cautious  afterall if youre raised catholic in centrel europe you are careful about jw. But i really wanted to try, wanted to marry her and convert.   
Nevermind.
Must have done something bad, something wrong or maybe no fault at all - it doesnt really matter.   
We had a great time but my believe, or my teachings of sience and my reluctance where the nail in my coffin.
15 days later she broke up with me, maybe because i spoke out against the elders, maybe because my nihilism or atheism shining trough. I prayed for it to work but its hard to believe, should have just acted my part. I was stupid. 
     
I am just so unbelievable, so very very very unbelievable sad that i did not try harder   
On our Second Day in Amterstdam, when she layed her head at my shoulder to rest: I was so sad   
I knew, i knew i would never be this happy again.
Ive tried alot, meeting girls, distracting from girls, spiritual guidance, diversions, educating, focusing on my job, you name it.    
This very moment was the best of my life   
Shes married now to her ex-fiance, bite me in the ass.   
  
And i cant stop dreaming about her, it haunts me, it frightens me to my marrows because i wake up at 4am and think about her. This night i had some strange dream about her and her husband in bed, it was weird and disgusting for me - the whole day was a mess. Today all coping failed so i have been smoking zigaretts like there is no tomorrow and drinking.   
   
I cant go on like this.   
Travelled to Ukraine on my own, just to see her. From her last messages she has i am not sure if she will even meet me and my hopes of getting her back are zero on a rational level. Yet i still want her, need her. So much.   

I wont kill myself right away, but my life is absolutly empty and dull.   
For the first Time in a long instead of my usual thoughts like "it would be better" or "end of the suffering" i find myself thinking about ways and methodes.   
Some of them are very egoistical. It shames me but i would like to do it just infront of her, that seems like the best way. Been thinking about that alot and well aware how dreadful that would be to her. Not a loving thing to do.
