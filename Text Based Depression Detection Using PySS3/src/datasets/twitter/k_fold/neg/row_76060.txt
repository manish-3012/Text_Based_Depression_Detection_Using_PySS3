Any helpful words?I've really been feeling down lately, and I really don't know what to do to get myself out of this hole. I am not suicidal, far from it, I just feel really down. I really donâ€™t have any confidence in what I do. I feel ugly every day, socially awkward, even though I have lots of friends. I just feel like my social status is so low that nobody is really my friend and that every views me as awkward. 

I make sure I shower every day, stay in shape and make sure I do good in school. I have a 3.9 GPA and work out every other day, so I am in very good shape. I am the best in my province at Taekwondo, and very good at skiing and biking. 

The biggest issue I think I have is that I donâ€™t feel like I should feel this way. I feel like I should be above feeling like this since I am very accomplished, but I still canâ€™t get myself out of this hole.

Do you have any reassuring words reddit?
