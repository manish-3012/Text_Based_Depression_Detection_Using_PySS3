What now... can't trust the health system... can't trust myself... is it worth it?Recently diagnosed with Bipolar... or not?  I saw a psychiatrist who is supposed to be helping me along the way and monitoring my medication; however, he instead stated that his opinion was that I do not have bipolar and I should stop taking my meds.  I don't know how to feel about anything.  I don't know anything.  I finally accepted that the reason for all my mistakes/emotions/mental state was the bipolar and I thought the meds and a better changed lifestyle would help everything.  But having this other professional telling me not to take the meds it puts me right back at square one.  If it isn't bipolar, then I guess that just makes me a fucked up burden on everyone.   An 11 month wait into a program for help, counsellor doesn't know, first psychiatrist thinks I am bipolar, second doesn't.  How do you move forward when everything seems to be falling apart?
