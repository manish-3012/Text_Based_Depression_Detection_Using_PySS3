Potentially did some damage with an attempt?I tried to hang myself last night and again this morning.  I was trying a short drop suspension. I wasnâ€™t blacking out at all, but noticed my speech got slurred and I had a some nerve pain my neck.  A headache and stomach ache too.

I donâ€™t want to sit there and gasp for air, but am thinking about just finishing the job.
