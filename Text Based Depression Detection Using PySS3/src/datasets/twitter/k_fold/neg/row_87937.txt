I feel like everything would be easier for everyone if I just ended it notIâ€™ve been suspended for 2 semesters at my college due to grades and on the same day I found out my girlfriend and I broke up and it just feels like everything is going wrong. It seems like everything would be easier for everyone else if I were just not around anymore. Nobody would care. My parents are mad and disappointed with me. My mom just yelled and screamed at me. I feel like a worthless little turd that should just end it
