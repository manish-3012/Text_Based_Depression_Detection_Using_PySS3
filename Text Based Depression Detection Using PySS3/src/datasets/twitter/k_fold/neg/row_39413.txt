Just removing the common denominatorI have typed and re typed this message into here before so many times and I never hit post. It doesnâ€™t matter I swear no one would probably notice if I was gone. I should of died three and half years ago and instead I just ruined my body, I lost both my legs. I have no family to turn to, the majority of people in my life look up to me. I just donâ€™t understand why this has to be so fucking hard. In the last fifteen years my homes burned down, I found my mother dead,  Iâ€™ve lost on average almost three friends a year in that time who have passed, Iâ€™ve lost my legs, I am hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Iâ€™ve been denied disability five times. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even fucking typing this up Iâ€™ve done this before nothing comes of it. Iâ€™m not some god damn child either Iâ€™m thirty two years old and I just donâ€™t have any idea what to do any more. I canâ€™t deal with these flashbacks and all of this I have no one to lean on or a saftey net. Fuck it
