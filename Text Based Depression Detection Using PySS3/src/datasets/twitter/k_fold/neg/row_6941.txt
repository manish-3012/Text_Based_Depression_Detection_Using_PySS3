Therapist mad at me due to my almost suicide attemptWas seconds away from attempting suicide when I was stopped and brought to the hospital. Before I was admitted I emailed my T to let them know. I emailed once I was released to let them know I would be able make my next appt.

When I had my next session, they were quite angry at me. They are always super patient with me but they were really blunt this time around. Ex. I kept on   burrying my face into my hands and they said, "sit up"

They were also talking about how hard hearing the news of my death would have been on my friends and them. 

They were giving me a no bs attitude. 

I honestly think the anger from them was just what I needed to snap into the reality of the situation and I found it quite heartwarming that they cared so much to have this kind of reaction...

BuT...
Im worries that this anger is going to remain present in my future sessions.. and I dont think I could handle that 

Im also worried I ruined this relationship like they'll never trust me again or they're going to act cold towards me in order to protect their own feelings.

I guess my question is..
Is this a normal reaction to get from you therapist? Do you they could have some countertransference ?

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? How did you move past this?
