No FutureIt feels like there is no future for me.  I go to college.  I graduate college. I get a job I hate and work for the rest of my life. I'm not even sure what I want anymore.  I don't really want to die I just want the world to make sense. I don't want to live.  I have no talents or social skills to get me anywhere.  I feel like it will always be hard to wake up every morning.  Everyone is just telling me to wait, that you find yourself somewhere. 

I've never had this much trouble so early in school. Usually I can get by until later in the year but this year it seems impossible.  I don't even know why I do it.  It seems pointless. 

I don't really know.  Maybe I'm thinking too hard about what I can't control.
