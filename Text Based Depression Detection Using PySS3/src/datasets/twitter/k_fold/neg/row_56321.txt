I'm so alone in this worldI feel like all my friends aren't really friends. My "best friend" just started dating the girl who I liked even though she lied to me about the reasons she wouldn't date me. All my other "friends" are mere acquaintances who I barely connect with. I feel like I've lose all my friends and I have no chance of making anything of my life since I slacked off the first 2 years of high school. I've tried killing myself by cutting down my arm but the knife was so dull and I'm only posting this since I drank a little to forget all the thoughts racing through my brain.
