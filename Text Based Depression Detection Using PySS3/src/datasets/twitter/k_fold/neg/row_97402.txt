Suicide and Emotional BlackmailA close friend of mine has been extremely suicidal over the past few months and I have been trying to do everything I can to help her and be there for her which has been hard for me but I want to do it because I care about her and always want her to be my friend. After telling her that I was going on a first date with a guy she told me that she loved me in a romantic way and wanted me to give her a chance and "try" to fall in love with her too. She wants me to stop seeing this guy for a while just to give her time to get over me and for her therapy and medications to start to work, but she has made threats to me saying that if I see him again she will kill herself and it will be my fault. I don't ever want my friend to die and her life is more important to me than a date but I don't know how long she will want me to stop dating and I don't know that even if I do stop and she gets better that it won't just happen again next time I decide to go on a date. It feels like emotional blackmail and she keeps pushing me to make the decision and choose between her and him and she says that the fact I can't make a decision shows that I don't care about her at all. It feels like I have put my life on hold over the past year of trying to help her and it has affected my own mental health a great deal. I know that her life in more important than a date (chicks before dicks and all that) but having a dating life is important to me and my future. 

I just don;t know what to do. If I give in now and stop dating it could just show her that I'll be a pushover to anything she says and that she can keep manipulating me. How far should you go to protect someone else's life if it means negatively affecting your own? How much of your own life should you sacrifice for someone else's? I can't seem to find the line between what I need to do for her mental health and what I need for mine.
