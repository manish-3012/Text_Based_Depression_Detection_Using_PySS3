I feel like the guilt is gonna eat me up and make me kill myself.I talked about it with some friends, but I need a bigger outlet, here is what happened. This was around a few months ago, but I've been thinking about a lot recently.

I am diagnosed with, depression, psychosis, and aspergers.

While I was at the doctor's office, I was playing on a video game, while this girl came in with her mother, but this girl had autism, and she was around 30 years old,  she saw me playing my game and sat next to me watching me play it, not saying anything. She liked video games as well, her mom was talking to my own mom about her daughter, she said she never had friends and that she was often bullied at school. She just wanted a friend, she just wanted someone to have memories with, she just wanted something she never had before. And what did my stupid piece of useless shit do? I ignored her, I ignored her while she was watching me play my game, I ignored her when she told me bye in the saddest voice I ever heard. Her mom also said she was gonna get sent to foster care, because her mom couldn't take care of her anymore. I never seen her again after that, all these thoughts rushed through my head, what if she killed herself because I didn't wanna be her friend? What if she's being abused in a foster home? What if she's dead? All because of my idiotic stupidity, someone could potentially be dead because of me. 

And my mom told she doesn't know what happened to her, I just don't wanna live my entire life wondering if someone could potentially be dead because of me, and also living slowly being eaten by my own guilt.

I don't know if I can do it anymore, I don't know if I can do it anymore.
