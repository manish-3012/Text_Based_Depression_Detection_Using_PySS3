Itâ€™s only getting worse- how do I try to make myself better for a few months before the time comes?My entire life has come to be the nightmare it is now, from the beginning. There was no good time. It is everything that has come to get me to where I am now. At the moment, I donâ€™t feel like myself. I am someone other. The thoughts in my mind I can get lost in, but that wonâ€™t do. 

My reality as it is, who I am, I canâ€™t get myself to do anything I want to (which btw are just a few shitty things, one of which is something Iâ€™m doing because Iâ€™ve been fucked in the past and now I am trying to catch up, itâ€™s such a basic thing. Iâ€™m so behind in education) because I canâ€™t do anything thinking of myself as myself, because I hate my past, I hate all my memories being associated with me, I hate physically existing in my body as myself. 

My brain is going to shit. It freezes. I literally do not matter to anybody but some of my family. Another thing is because I usually do not really think of things personally relating to me, but everything in general, it intensifies my unstableness with my personal issues. 

I am so desperately lonely. I think having someone would honestly make most of this all better. But no. My entire life, has been trying to play somebody elseâ€™s game, trying to play society. I donâ€™t like it, and I refuse to do it anymore. I feel like Iâ€™m actually going to do it, it only gets worse, exponentially worse. 

The more things I realise, the more things that happen, the more things things that I have had admiration for get stripped bare and torn apart, the more I see how awful this is. I canâ€™t do it. I want to try out of myself, but in myself, but being able to do things outwardly. 

Iâ€™ll give it a few months. But Iâ€™m scared I wonâ€™t even be able to try in these few months. Fuck I just donâ€™t know
