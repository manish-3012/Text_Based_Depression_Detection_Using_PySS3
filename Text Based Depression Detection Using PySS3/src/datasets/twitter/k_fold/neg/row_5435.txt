I'm too depressed to do anything at allabout: I have had a major depression for 1 year now.

I can't take a shower, do my projects, do homework, or go to school anymore. It's so difficult. Nothing in life is enjoyable anymore. I can't find joy in anything ever, I used to like sewing, drawing, painting, listening to music, watching anime, but now the more I do any of these, the more I'll have things to lose. Also, I see them as sickening and pointless now. All I do now is binge on food and sleep.

In the mid-stages of my depression I used music as a way of relief or a distraction from my depression, but it seems like my depression keeps building up in the background, once I remember my depression, it strikes double hard. I'm so depressed and I think of suicide everyday, how good of an idea is to give a person on the verge of shooting their brains out projects and homeworks and expect them to get done when they can't even keep themselves alive and sane?
How do I get shit done?

P,S Don't give me the "talk to someone from your friends or family about your problems" I can't do that because no one agrees with me and no one will accept who I am or what I believe in, if I do so they will probably disown me or kill me. My family and friends are super traditional and religious and I can't do shit in my life. I'm in a very oppressed state, (and I'm a minority.)
