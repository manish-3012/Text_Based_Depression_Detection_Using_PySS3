Getting HelpSo feeling beyond depressed and hopeless. Feeling like everything was crashing down on top of me. This past week couldn't have gone any better. I'm being forced into getting help. Though I'm extremely anxious about being put into a hospital. It feels good to know I have the potential to be helped. Rather then giving up, and gashing my wrists tomorrow. I will be looking forward to be given an opportunity I never thought I would be able to receive. Now, Of course recovery is a roller coaster ride, and there is no certainty I will be getting 100% better. There is hope for it. Day by day my depression gets worse, and my want to stick a knife through my Wrists and drag it up my arm continues. I'm able to hold out for help to see what happens, and I must say its like the best feeling. Knowing I have a want to live. A want to get better. It makes living *almost* worth it. It will be a bumpy ride, but with a bit of support I think I'm finally going to come to acceptance with my depression and finally be able to cope. Whether it be with Medication or coping skills. I'll still be able to deal with everything much better.
So to all those feeling depressed. Hopeless. Numb. Worthless. Hurt. Betrayed. Seek help. It is possible. And completely worth looking for. Because having life is beautiful. And will only but get better as things continue.
