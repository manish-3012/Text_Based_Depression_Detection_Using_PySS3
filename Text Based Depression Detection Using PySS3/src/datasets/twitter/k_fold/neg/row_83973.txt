FuckI woke up 2 days ago. One of my girlfriends friends had found me. Can't even die right. I would like to think maybe people cared, but I just got out of the hospital and the only contact I've had with people besides my doctors/nurses was a single text from my mom asking if I was ok. And that was a day and a half ago. My girlfriend never came to see me, neither did my parents. I'm not  going to do the intensive therapy shit. I just wanted to let the people who reached out to my last comment know that I really appreciate their support. It meant a lot to me, especially since nobody else genuinely cared. Going to be honest, this isn't how I imagined dying but I'm not complaining. I just wish it had happened on the first try. Thank you again for the support. I love Reddit. To all the good people, don't change while I'm gone.
