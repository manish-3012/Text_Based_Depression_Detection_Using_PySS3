If I wasnâ€™t under the age to be able to own firearms, I would kill myself right now with one.No way Iâ€™m making it another year. Iâ€™m so distant on the inside but amazing at hiding pain for my outside shell. Loneliness. I have friends but that wonâ€™t stop me. I have family but that wonâ€™t stop me. There are not any reasons to continue living. People always say the reasons you shouldnâ€™t die. Big fuck you.
