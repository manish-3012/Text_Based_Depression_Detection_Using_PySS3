I know I have people who love me but I feel so lonelyI have amazing friends who are always there for me and mean the world to me. I have family that cares about me. But I feel so lonely. 


Maybe because I haven't been in a relationship in 5 years. I am asexual but not aromantic. Nobody will ever love me in that way again. 


I've got to stop myself from intentionally distancing from people so my death won't have much of an impact. 


I took 700mg of advil, definitely not enough to kill me ordo anything, but I want a mixture of drugs that will kill me for good. I'm tired of being a burden and I'm tired of being alive. 

They'll be sad for a bit but they'll move on. Their lives will be better without me. 


I can't even write well anymore, that was just rambling.
