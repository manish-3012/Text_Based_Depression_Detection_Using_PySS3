I just feel like I'm losing myselfI don't what I'm capable of doing. I know I'm losing myself because I'm no longer scared of dying. I don't care who I leave behind. I just don't care anymore. I thought I just didn't want to feel pain but honestly I don't want to feel anything. I don't want to try. I don't want temporary happiness. I want to kill myself.
