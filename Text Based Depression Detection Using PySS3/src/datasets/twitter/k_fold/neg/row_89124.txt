lonely, very ugly, just die is besti think i dont have a reason to live, i feel very lonely and very ugly. there are so many fake - selfish people, I m diabetic with several complications which are pain 24/7, wounds, low blood pressure, fades, nerve damage, frozen shoulder, vertigo, numbness, fragile and getting worse, its not reversible. im in my 40s but i feel very old and unlucky.  the only reason why I dont or I cant kill myself is my 3 years old dog, his unconditional love. i really want to die when my dog dies. i dont have a job since 2018. i dont have hobby, i dont have friends....
