I actually did it...when I'm done typing this message, I will swallow the cyanide next to me that I obtained. When I do, I'll click submit and you guys can read this. I will not be responding to any messages as I will be very dead. I am so happy that I found the solution to my problems. Don't think the cliche 'Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.' Life is temporary and it is cruel. That is all I can say. I don't want to rant about my issues. Goodbye.
