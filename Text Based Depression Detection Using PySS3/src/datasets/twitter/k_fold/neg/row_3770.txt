Numb to the idea of death  It's not that I am actively looking for a way to kill myself. I don't have a plan like I used to. I thought I was doing better because of it. I'm not. I'm not getting any better and it's been years. Years of never ending pain. I don't even know if it's pain. I'm just not ok. 

  I am so numb to the idea of dying that I don't even think about when things are dangerous anymore. I don't seek out death but if it comes to me that would be fine. I drive a really small and old car that doesn't have a lot of safety features. One good hit to my driver's side door and it would be over. Sometimes I try to stay in the blind spot of semi trucks hoping they merge and hit me. I dream about getting in horrible car accidents and they aren't bad dreams.

   I can't tell anyone. Everyone in my life thinks I'm doing great. My life is objectively better now, so why aren't I?
