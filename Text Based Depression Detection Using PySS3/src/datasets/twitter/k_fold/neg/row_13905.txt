A student committed suicide at my school.I feel guilty for thinking this way but, I just do. He hung himself after school Friday, I did not know him since he was from a deficient grade. but when I heard of it my first thought was, "well at least I won't be the one to breaks the school therapist's accomplishment of never losing a student for all 15 years of her working there."  I have never felt so low before and did not even know the kid. I feel so alone and don't care about anything, my parents don't understand me and I just don't want to anymore. maybe I will follow behind him soon.
