"Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise." ~ Victor Hugo**My interpretation**: My interpretation: Just as the sun rises again every morning to cast its light and warmth back into the world, so shall our times of darkness and despair pass. All because you cannot see the light right now, it does not mean that it is gone for good. Hold on a little longer and have faith!
