Ending it in five days.19 year old with ulcerative colitis and no reason to live. Current treatment isnâ€™t working. My doctor suggested biologics, but my mother said it would be too much of an inconvenience to take me to the hospital every six weeks for infusions. She convinced him to let me continue my current medication for a few more weeks. He said if the inflammation doesnâ€™t improve within four weeks, my only option is biologics. My mother said if the inflammation doesnâ€™t improve in four weeks, I will have to discontinue treatment.

Iâ€™ve been self-harming since I was in elementary school, and it has gotten really bad recently. I tried overdosing at 16 but failed and was sent to a hospital, where I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. After I was discharged, my parents didnâ€™t allow me to continue receiving psychiatric treatment because they feared it would interfere with my school work. My depression is exacerbated by the steroids I take for my ulcerative colitis.

I canâ€™t reach out to hotlines. The last time I tried, the police were sent to my house and I got in a lot of trouble. I donâ€™t have a driverâ€™s license, and my parents wonâ€™t let me get a job to make money. Iâ€™m in constant pain. Iâ€™m ugly and useless so Iâ€™ve never had friends or a boyfriend. Iâ€™ve been trying to keep myself alive because I was hoping things would get better in college. Iâ€™m hearing from my dream school in five days. If I donâ€™t get in, I am killing myself.
