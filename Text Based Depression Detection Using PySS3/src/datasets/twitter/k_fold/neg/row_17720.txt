I wish we would hate each other with my parents.They are fucking holding me back. I just want to erase myself from this planet, but I kinda love my parents and I am their only child. Just the fact they would completely broke is enough to keep me from suicide. We don't talk much though cuz they work hard and when they are home I usually just sit in my room anyway.  


I'm 18 years old and all I've ever experienced is loneliness and hate by other people. I'm a 5'3 midget, always been the shortest in school so I got bullied quite a few times. The chances to get a girlfriend with my non-existant self-confidence and severe social anxiety is absolute zero. I have always found everyone weird and cringe so I never really tried to made friends, doesn't matter what age I was. Of course now I realise that I am the cringe one here. Every fucking day I just get home from school and I do nothing. I spend all my money on weed, just so time passes quicker.   


I used to cry a lot, but nowadays it's very rare. Although I want to cry, I always feel better when I do. I tried to talk to a psychologist but honestly I don't want to share things with a stranger.   


I made peace with being alone, but I can't with boredom and anxiety/depression. I have no goals at all, I don't have the motivation to study, because I don't care about all that high school bullshit that I will forget later on anyway. I just want to end this suffering, and I'm low-key hoping something happens to my parents, so I can kill myself immediately.  


It felt good to at least share my problems with you guys virtually.
