"An interesting title", I think not.Hi 

Tonight I guess is the night I actually try.
There's not much history to me - perfectly normal childhood, no significant disabilities, depressive episodes every so often.

I've OD'd 3 times. The first one landed me in an inpatient psychiatric unit for 4 months.
I don't know if it was a cry for help - I just ended up getting help because someone called me selfish and I felt guilty.

This time is going to be different. 
I care. I think I care. About the people I'm (hopefully) leaving behind - But at the end of the day, this is my life. Not anyone else's. I am so unhappy all the time. The only thing I can think about is dying and I just wish that people would forget about me so I won't hurt anyone.

My friend from the unit died 3.5 weeks ago. It was kind of my fault. 
I guess i'm the next domino in the suicide chain.

I'm on here because I want to get it off my chest, but I can't tell a "real" person because they'd try and stop me and that would just make everyone think that i'm not serious and all of this is for attention.

I don't want to die. I really don't. But I have to.
Things are never going to get better because at the end of the day, there's nothing to get better from.

I'm sorry. I feel this was a bit of a mess.
But thank you.
