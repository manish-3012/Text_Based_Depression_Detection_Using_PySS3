I feel like ive got nothing to live forThis sounds super dumb and stupid, but that doesn't surprise me whatsoever because it's coming from me, and I was worried this was going to happen, and it did

Whenever I got really sad, no matter how much I wanted to die, "kingdom hearts 3 is coming out soon, I need to be alive for that!". It was the one thing that kept me going
I've beaten everything I could possibly beat in that game, and now I have nothing left to live for. 

I'm just a college student with no fucking clue what I'm doing with my life. Yes I have friends, but they won't miss me for long; they have other people they care about more, people objectively better than me.  I'd get over me pretty quickly if I was one of my friends.
My family is less so, but honestly I barely see them because I'm always so busy. I'm shit at my job, my coworkers hate me because I'm shit at my job, and I'm annoying as fuck. I'm just permanently loud and obnoxious and ugly and I just hate every aspect of myself. I wasn't even born with the right fucking genitals and the NHS is too underfunded to do anything about it.

I've finally done it, I've hit rock bottom after my most anticipated game of all time released, and Ive finally got nothing left to live for.
