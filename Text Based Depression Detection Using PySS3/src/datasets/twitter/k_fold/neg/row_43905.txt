my message.Today, 27th of October is the day I had planned to kill myself in 2019. I was so certain I would die. I thought about actually killing myself from June 2019 and I really did make up my mind.
But the problem is - I am still here.
"What am I still alive for?"
I ask myself that everyday but can't find the answer. Nothing matters. Noone matters.
I don't really even exist anymore.
I'm so sick of "deciding" to kill myself and then just postponing it only because I'm a little lazy bitch. I should stop trying to make excuses and find reasons to stay because there aren't.
We all live because of something we decided to live for.
I don't want to have to hold on to some illusions anymore. 
If someone is reading this, I hope you can fix your shit, better than I did. Because I know that somewhere there is a chance for you to have a good life. Maybe it's bullshit, but it's up to you.
I'm one weakass motherfucker so instead of fighting I will give up, but since you're breathing, you can do something better. 
It will be hard, but it's possible to push through.
So don't remember me.
Live fully, live long, live and thrive.

Live the way I could never live.
