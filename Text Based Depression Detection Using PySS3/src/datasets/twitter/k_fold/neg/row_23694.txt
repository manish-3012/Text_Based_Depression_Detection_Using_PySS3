I've got a plan and I've done trial runs... I'm readyI'm in therapy and it was so fucking hard today. I'm ready. I'm done. It's not worth trying to fix everything wrong with me. It's too much and has been going on for too long. I'm so fucked up. A part of me wants to die so bad and a part of me doesn't but the part that wants to is mostly in control and I don't think I can do this much longer. I can't hold on.
