Life doesn't want me to be happyAfter a year and half of increasingly worsening depression, I started to feel good last month. My best friend came back into my life, i was beginning to stand up for myself against my family, and i was spending more time with my dog. Everything came crashing down last week when I was hit with a depressive spell that wouldn't end. Tomorrow I have plans to get together with my cousin and a friend from out of town and get drunk. I have health problems from previous substance abuse and I know if I go too far tomorrow I'll end up in the hospital, possibly knocking on death's door. That doesn't scare me, if anything it feels like death would be more welcoming than life is. I made a promise to someone recently that I would be by their side until the end, perhaps the end is sooner than I thought. I can't help but feel like nobody would shed a tear over the loss.
