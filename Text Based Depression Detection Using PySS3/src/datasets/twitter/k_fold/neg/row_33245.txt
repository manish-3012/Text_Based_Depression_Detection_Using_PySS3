Which part of your head do you aim at?I donâ€™t want to see any bullshit comments saying â€œlife will get betterâ€ blah blah weâ€™ve all heard that shit in here. 

On to my post: Iâ€™ve decided Iâ€™m going to shoot myself in the head with a pistol. What kind of pistol/bullet should I use? I was thinking something like Glock .45 with hollow point rounds. If thereâ€™s something better, let me know. 

Question 2: Once I have my gun, where should I point it on my head? Iâ€™ve seen too many stories where people just blow off their face. If Iâ€™m going to do this Iâ€™m going to do it right.
