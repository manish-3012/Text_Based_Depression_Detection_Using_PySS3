man im donei honestly want to fucking die right now, i want to die but i donâ€™t want anyone to care i donâ€™t want my younger sister to be upset and i love my dog so much but im tired of everything i have nothing to live for nothing keeps me going i see life as worthless i try to improve my mindset and see everything as positive but at the end of the day no matter what i do or succeed in i dont feel happiness
ive been depressed since i was 14 and had severe anxiety and ocd since i was in 3rd grade, i would always have panick attacks in class and start crying and when my teacher would ask whatâ€™s wrong id just tell them my stomach was hurting n theyâ€™d send me to the nurse and sheâ€™d proceed to tell me nothing was wrong then one day the nurse told my parents she thought something might be wrong bc id cry all the time n thatâ€™s when my parents took me to a therapist (they thought i might of been traumatized or raped and perhaps didnâ€™t want to admit it) but really it was just my anxiety. my parents are close minded and said there was no such thing as anxiety thatâ€™s when they started calling me crazy and they basically deaded me emotionally after that. id get called a cry baby and get yelled at every time i showed an upset emotion or started panicking and weâ€™d get into arguments every time i started getting an anxiety attack and my mom would call me a â€œfreak that needs therapyâ€, thatâ€™s when i started turning stone cold i felt nothing anymore i shut everyone off emotionally and didnâ€™t care about anything didnâ€™t care to socialize didnâ€™t care to express joy or get excited about things didnâ€™t care to make friendships or hang out with people i just didnâ€™t care about shit

fast forward to high school i then got into a relationship that i didnâ€™t really care for, somehow it dragged onto 3 years once we broke it off i started wilding and partying with a group of girls i decided to say â€œfuck itâ€ n give into having â€œfriendsâ€ this led to me going out, drinking started doing drugs lots of sex just reckless behavior and deep down i knew that wasnâ€™t me and i didnâ€™t enjoy any of it but i did it just to feel something just to have something to do i felt that deep inside i was going to kill myself or die soon so why not self destruct till then, during that time i went through 4 jobs quitting out of impulse, would get in trouble due to coming home drunk, and man this went on for almost a year until i went to a festival where i was basically blacked out the whole night, my friends n i got back to my friendâ€™s exâ€™s house (she was still friends w him) we ended up having a threesome she got super jealous (she was also intoxicated) and started yelling at me to get out of his house and kicked me out while i was on n off blacking out. i was literally kicked out of the house with no shoes and a dead phone half naked (i was wearing a festival fit) i just waited outside not knowing what to do i didnâ€™t know where i was i didnâ€™t have a way home it was 2am. i saw a man driving back n forth through the neighborhood in his car thatâ€™s when i started to panic and i tried jumping the gate back to my friendâ€™s exâ€™s house just to wait until im safe but i failed to jump so i sat back on the curb n blacked out. i canâ€™t remember much but i â€œwoke upâ€ to me laying in a dark house n started feeling on my clothes which felt messed up i quickly got up and started running in a dark house and the guy that was in the car started chasing me and i began to scream and broke a window trying to escape (i wish drunk me knew what a fucking door was) i made it outside and a couple that lives next door came and asked if everything is okay i remember the guy saying he didnâ€™t know what was wrong with me and that i was trying to break into his house then they kept questioning me (canâ€™t remember anything) next thing u know my sister pulls up somehow fucking finds me sitting on the curb with these people and those folks explain to her that i â€œwas trying to break inâ€ and they were about to call the cops on me, she apologizes for everything that happened and i get in the car she starts yelling at me talking about how worried she was for not answering the phone etc and at that point im just in shock of everything that had happened that night she fails to see that im sitting there covered in blood and bruises and i donâ€™t even say a word she takes me to my parents house and i black out i â€œwake upâ€ to me standing in the kitchen while my parents keep questioning me and i just start repeating â€œI just want to fucking dieâ€ over and over again i walk to the bathroom grab a shitload of pills and down them with hydrogen peroxide and black out end up in the hospital. all this happened in a span of 4 hours (arriving to the friends exâ€™s house n ending up at the hospital). i then ended up on suicide watch in a mental hospital for over a week 

5 months forward here i am. i started going to therapy and taking several medications. along with getting officially diagnosed â€œsevere anxietyâ€, â€œocdâ€, â€œADHDâ€ and â€œbipolar disorderâ€ 

these past five months i literally havenâ€™t done shit ive tried so much to improve my mental health ive purchased several self improvement books, tried meditating, therapy, whatever. but i feel like an emotionless robot im on too many medications and i feel fucking numb like im just there. i just fucking hate everything nothing feels okay everything about me feels fake i smile and laugh when im with my family so they can think im okay but im fucking not okay all i do is wake up, shower, sit in my room, go to the gym, and come back home and sleep. ive tried endlessly to get a job and no one will hire me. i enrolled back to college and have online courses that im falling back on due to my stupidity itâ€™s so fucking hard for me to start an assignment and end one and I try man the thing is i truly fucking try i feel like i canâ€™t do shit. i no longer have friends, after coming out of the hospital everyone i was â€œfriendsâ€ with was checking up on me and i hit them w a thanks and cut them off immediately (they were just party friends anyways) i just put myself in isolation. i feel like i have no purpose. i donâ€™t enjoy socializing, i with push everyone away, i donâ€™t care for anything fuck man i donâ€™t know man im just fucking tired all people bring up is my appearance â€œyouâ€™re so pretty youâ€™ll go far in lifeâ€ â€œyouâ€™re too beautiful to be sadâ€ â€œkeep ur head up youâ€™re beautifulâ€ i feel like my whole life people have only wanted me for my looks and no one wants to get to KNOW me they just want me for what they see but no one wants to understand me but then again i donâ€™t care to open up to anyone because  i know no one is going to ever fucking get it and sorry this is all over the place i wish i couldâ€™ve explained shit better
