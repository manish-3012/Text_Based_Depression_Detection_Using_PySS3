No matter much I distract myself, suicide seems to be the only answerNo matter how much I occupy my time, driving, studying, walking outside, watching a TV show, Youtube, etc, everything just leads back to suicide. Itâ€™s like my brain is wired to think that dying is the only ultimate way to end the pain and be free from suffering. Itâ€™s like something I keep avoiding because I somehow convince myself that I actually should hold on. But in fact, itâ€™s only hurting me more by lying to myself. Itâ€™s masochistic to me to force myself to keep living. Even when I read the Bible and pray, I become suicidal again soon after I finish. I was looking forward to getting a dog after my parents said I could but they crushed my hopes again when they said it was too expensive. I should have known good things donâ€™t happen in my life. Theyâ€™re heartless bastards. Not being able to have a dog is seemingly making me more suicidal which is weird because I didnâ€™t expect a dog to cheer me up. Iâ€™m thinking whether I should experiment cutting my wrist more to entertain myself. I know itâ€™s fucked up but the pain distracts me more than forms of entertainment like TV shows or Youtube.
