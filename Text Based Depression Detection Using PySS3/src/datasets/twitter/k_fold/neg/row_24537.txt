Heâ€™s not here.I could sit here and type paragraphs. I wonâ€™t. My story is dark and tragic and unlucky. Itâ€™s full of loss and trauma and heartbreak. Iâ€™ve been doing this since I was 8. Iâ€™m approaching the 27 club (lol) I want to like life but life doesnâ€™t like me. No one I know TRULY cares if I die. Thatâ€™s not me being dramatic thatâ€™s fact. When I do theyâ€™ll all just be like, oh, well we saw that coming...anyways.  Professionally no one is helping me either. Homelessness is on the horizon but my therapist, Dr, the people who work at disability are all set right? They have homes and cars and food. Corona on top of it all made an already horrid situation worse....hell does indeed have a basement my friends.  AND
I donâ€™t wanna do this anymore. Iâ€™ve held on for so long yet...no help. This is the closest thing to people literally standing there watching me drown. Iâ€™m beginning to hold the belief that people of sound mind should have the right to disappear. I pay the price for being abused as a child everyday. I want my death to shock and traumatize all those who watched me die and did nothing. I want to cut them and make them feel my pain. I want America to see what theyâ€™ve done to me and mentally ill people everywhere. I donâ€™t want it to be like this but they do.
