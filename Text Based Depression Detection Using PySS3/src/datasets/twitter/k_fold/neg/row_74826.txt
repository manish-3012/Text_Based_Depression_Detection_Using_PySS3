just want to air out my thoughtsI already feel so disconnected from everyone around me. everyone my age has dreams and hopes. They literally glow while I look and feel dead. Iâ€™m tired of feeding myself false hope, I have been holding back these feelings and thoughts allll semester long. I used to be able to control this negative voice inside me but now I canâ€™t help but to cut myself and further make myself invisible from others. The amount of hate I feel for myself is overwhelming. As I express this I canâ€™t help but to feel like a pathetic weak little girl. Being that I study biology, I feel as if I should just act accordingly and follow through with natural selection. Just kill myself off because I truly am not fit for this experience. I donâ€™t want it.
