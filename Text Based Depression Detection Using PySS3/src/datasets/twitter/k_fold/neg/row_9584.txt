feeling bad for my boyfriendI feel bad for him.
I'm seventeen and he's eighteen, we've been together for three years now and he's always been there for me throughout my depression and family issues. He loves me with all his heart and so do I, he's more than I could have ever asked for. I've tried to kill myself a few times, he's always come by in the morning and checked on me, he even let me move in with him to help avoid me getting drowned in my depression.
Sometimes it just all gets too overwhelming, my feelings and everything. I love him so much but I feel like things would be better if I was just gone. I know that would be a lie or so they say. They say life is just starting but I don't know if I can't stand it any longer. In the end everything doesn't matter anyways, we all die. I've tried ignoring my feelings for both of us, to feel better but the more I wait it just seems to build up. I miss having a consoler but I don't see the point anyways.
I wish I was a better, happier girlfriend.
Sorry this is jumbled, I just needed to get my thoughts out. 
Hope everyone's night is going okay.
Not going to kill myself, just needed to release my feelings.
