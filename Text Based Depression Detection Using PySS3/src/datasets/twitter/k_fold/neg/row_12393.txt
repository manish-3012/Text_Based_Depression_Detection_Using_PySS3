I've lost the will to live.You know, I'm surprised I've made it this far. Too bad I won't make it much further. At this point I've lost all desire to live. I'm tired of being pushed away by friends,family, and cousins. I just want to die. In my whole years of being depressed... I never actually had a plan to end my life. But now? I think I do. I'm sorry I wasn't good enough for you... I know my creator isn't ready to take me in... but, I'm ready now.
