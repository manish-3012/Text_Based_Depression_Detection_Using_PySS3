What does it feel like?Iâ€™ve never self harmed ever. Iâ€™m honestly very scared of any sort of physical pain which is one big reason why Iâ€™ve never attempted suicide.

To those that do self harm, what does it feel like? I mean I assume itâ€™s actually very painful. How do you even have the guts to hurt yourself to the point where youâ€™re seriously hurt. Like when you accidentally burn yourself and your body reacts by moving away. How do you not do react that way?

This is a very open ended question so it doesnâ€™t just have to be cutting.
