Iâ€™m departing this world in 3 hours.Iâ€™ve made the decision to leave in 3 hours. Iâ€™ve been through a countless amount of emotional torture and stress. Iâ€™m in constant depression and Iâ€™m suicidal. I have anxiety and I canâ€™t deal with life for one more day. Iâ€™m a 20 year old male, I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going or what Iâ€™m doing. I feel like this is the most humane thing. 

I wish all of you on here a recovery and happiness. Depression is a horrible thing and no one should have to suffer with it. I love all of you and have so much respect for all of you because we are all battling the same thing and we all know how hard it is for eachother. We are almost a family here. To all the people that continue to battle it, I respect all of you. 

For me, I have lost this battle.

Thank you all,
Much love,
M.
