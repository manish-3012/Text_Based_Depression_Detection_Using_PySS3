I feel like my abusive ex was the only thing keeping me here.I know that I shouldnâ€™t miss him, heâ€™s bad for me. It was almost perfect, though. He said he loved me, and that was the first time I really felt loved in my entire life. He did bad things to me, manipulation, posting nude pictures of me, and taking videos of us together without my consent, but he loved me more than any other person has before. I feel like Iâ€™m nothing without him. I just want to feel loved.
