Killing myself soonIâ€™ve wanted to die since 6th grade. Iâ€™m now 47 and nothing has really worked in my life. Iâ€™m not a drinker or drug user, but have had had many failed relationships and careers. I never liked myself, have done 8 years without of therapy, taken almost every antidepressant, yoga, meditation blah blah. I just cannot wait to end it all and get out of this fucking place. My roommate is gone for two weeks! Its the perfect time to overdose and drown in the bath tub! I wonâ€™t miss anything except my friendâ€™s dog.
