super triggered by the Epstein investigation right now, cannot relate to 98% of my peers due to violent childhood abuse, woke up wanting to diesee title.

&amp;#x200B;

a multitude of toxic triggers and issues in my life that i am having difficulty overcoming/managing

&amp;#x200B;

live in Canada with supposed "free" health care that I pay for every year with my taxes, and yet can't afford surgery to fix chronic pain, or therapy to manage PTSD, because it's not covered by said "free" health care, and it's so hopelessly pathetic that it all comes down to money. i'm an accountant. we live in a world with abundant resources. i see where the money is flowing. it is not flowing to the people who need it most. it's flowing to economic leaches. vultures. fucking parasites.

&amp;#x200B;

artificial scarcity is the most harmful form of violence.

&amp;#x200B;

to sit on a mountain of food, more food than you will ever need in your lifetime, while people are dying of starvation around you.... just for kicks. this is one of the hardest types of injustice to live with.

&amp;#x200B;

shouldn't be like this. doesn't have to be like this.

&amp;#x200B;

can't live in a world like this.

&amp;#x200B;

can't even commit suicide with dignity, surrounded by the few people who love me, without being threatened by the authorities. can't even DIE in peace without being traumatized by the gov't first.

&amp;#x200B;

doctors are only into it for the money. they medicate instead of heal their patients with an action plan and time and patience like a good doctor should. they medicate and move on to the next patient within minutes and forget about them as soon as they walk out the door. no follow up. no action plan. no therapy. no support. just medication. and more medication.

&amp;#x200B;

calling the cops doesn't help. they threaten and intimidate and escalate trauma. make things even worse. cops are just there to remind you that if you start complaining too much they'll assault you, round you up in your own home and lock you up. more trauma on top of all the other trauma.

&amp;#x200B;

family doesn't help. most of them are traumatized too. and poor. have health problems of their own they can't afford to take care of. in Canada. with our "free" health care that only half the population is eligible for because they have health issues that aren't covered by public health insurance. "free" health care, unless you have health problems not covered by said health care. then we pay for it with our taxes, but don't actually benefit from it. how convenient.

&amp;#x200B;

my landlord is a dysfunctional alcoholic, i realized last night, listening to her rant on about the neighbours and meanspirited gossip and every bad thing going on in the world for the 3rd night in a row, after 6 years living here with the house slowly falling apart, and rarely repaired. slumlord i feel sorry for, but who keeps drumming up new crises every couple of months. i'm trying to avoid crisis and here i am living with someone who invites crisis into her life at every opportunity. cannot cope with a constant stream of negative gossip.

&amp;#x200B;

"did you hear what happened to so-and-so? oh it's terrible!....."

&amp;#x200B;

on repeat. 6 years of this. for once i wish she'd disturb my peace to say something kind or uplifting about someone.

&amp;#x200B;

"did you hear about so-and-so? something wonderful happened!"

&amp;#x200B;

but no. i get hate-gossip instead.

&amp;#x200B;

hate going into work. won't go into detail about that, but it's toxic in ways that matter quite a bit and i cannot seem to change.

&amp;#x200B;

my parents are abusive. father violently abusive, fits of violent rage. has never lifted a finger to help, or pay for groceries, or health care, or even school supplies, nothing has this man given to my brother and i to help raise us and take care of us as children, ditto as an adult. he's a scumbag. my mother is so badly traumatized she'd stuck in repeat-trauma mode. crisis after crisis after crisis, 40 years of this, i've had enough.

&amp;#x200B;

have no support system because i was taken away from my family and raised by the church. so the only people i knew growing up and into my early 20's were mostly church people. so when i left the church, left everyone i know. which i don't regret, that was an excellent decision. very good for my mental health to leave the church behind. but not good is giving up my entire support system, so now i find myself as an adult without peers i can relate to. have no support system. don't really fit into any one group. wish i had been raised outside the church so at least i could relate to peers a bit better, despite the abuse. wish we had laws that protected children from religious indoctrination. if a child says NO! to going to church, to reading the Bible, to following a religion they don't believe in, forcing this on them is one of the worst forms of child abuse. our foster mother would threaten to throw us out on the street, or put us in juvenile detention (prison!) if we didn't pray. if we didn't go to church. the same thing happens to Muslim and Jewish children. it is a terrible thing, to indoctrinate children into religion.

&amp;#x200B;

have had a low grade migraine and feeling sick to my stomach the past 3 days. can barely keep my eyes open but now need to go to work and grin and bear it. not the best working environment, but at least i have a flexible schedule. i am so grateful for this alone, or i wouldn't be able to survive. but i don't get paid a market rate. i should be making more. i pay for the flexibility by accepting a wage below market value. so i'm being economically penalized for being a victim of child abuse and sexual assault, again, as an adult. drugged and assaulted in my own home by my roommate. a newborn Christian, no less.  can't even trust your own roommates. especially religious ones. holy fuck, never again.

&amp;#x200B;

no matter where i turn, people go out of their way to hurt and traumatize and make things worse.

&amp;#x200B;

need a very good therapist. but it'll cost me $2k-$8k per year. ONGOING. when i can't even afford surgery. the surgery i need is cheaper in the long run than the therapy is. how fucked is that?

&amp;#x200B;

sorry for the long rant. am having a very bad day.
