Can Anyone Help?     Well, I've finally decided to post. There's so much going on that I don't even know where to start (I feel like trash just for typing this), so I'll just put it bluntly. I am a Christian. If I were to kill myself, would I go to hell? This may seem dumb, but it is a legitimate question. Thanks in advance.
