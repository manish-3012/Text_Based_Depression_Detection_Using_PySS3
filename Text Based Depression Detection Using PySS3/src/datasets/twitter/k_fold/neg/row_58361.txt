Iâ€™m so tired...Iâ€™m so sick of this. I feel like Iâ€™m stuck in my mind. I accidentally cut my hair thinking it looked good and my family just laughed. I actually canâ€™t do this no more. I want to have hope. But I simply ran out of it, how do people stay positive when life is so sickening. I actually am so tired. I simply want to rest. I want to be happy, but simply I feel like I have to accept happiness isnâ€™t for me. I donâ€™t wanna die, but it seems like the only way to finally not feel pain. Iâ€™m so tired of feeling like shit all the time. Of feeling like Iâ€™m not worth anything. Everyday I feel this way. Iâ€™ve felt like this for 5 years already. I try to help others but simply I donâ€™t have hope or the strength to continue. I hope I make it out. I really do, but Iâ€™m so exhausted of feeling like this. I donâ€™t know how to reach out for help. I simply donâ€™t. How do I tell my parents that I want to die. How much of a coward will they tell me I am. How many excuses will they make as to why I should be happy? Theyâ€™ll say Iâ€™m selfish but I simply believe being selfish is the only way out. I donâ€™t feel like I belong here.. thanks for reading.
