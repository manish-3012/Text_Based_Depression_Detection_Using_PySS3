Killing myself after my GF is okIve been depressed since I remember. I sit by myself drinking till I cant stand with a boxcutter beside me at night. Ive lost my dream job due to covid-19. My girlfriend has an eating disorder and is finally getting help that she needs. She has told me that when she gets better that our relationship will change and that she just wants us to be good friends.

This is the last straw. She was the only good thing I had going for me. I cant bear to imagine seeing her with someone else. I wont be able to go anywhere within a 150km radius of where she lives without thinking about her. Once I know she is mentally stable and is fine living without me I will kill myself. Now that I have decided this I feel at peace.

I've gone to the doctor and started on antidepressants but they dont help. I have my suicide note written and under my bed. When I feel she is ok or I've had a bad day I'm going to go to the hardware store, buy rope and go to my moms house. Im going to wait till its early in the morning, find a good tree in the forest and hang myself.
