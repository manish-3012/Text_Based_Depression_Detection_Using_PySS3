I tried to kill myself the day before Halloween not sure if I was almost successful.I was never told if I was almost successful.  I just looked up nortriptyline hcl and it said an overdose could be fatal. I took 240mg which was 24 pills. 10mg each. They never told me I could have killed myself. I just was saying I can't tell if I'm having a really bad trip or if I was overdosing.  I started freaking out before I could finish the rest which was a total of 30 pills. So did I almost kill myself or was I just in for a bad trip? They didn't ever tell me. They had me drink Charcoal and put IVS in my arms. I was too doped to remember.  I realised what I was doing and I was crying the entire time I swallowed the pills while staring at my pet . The only real close relationship I have. I remember staring at him and he just stared at me back. Just with a curious look. I felt so bad that I was going to leave him. Leave him all alone. I took him in and promised to take care of him and I was just going to leave him. So I immediately told my roommate I think I need to go to the hospital.  At this point I already felt chills and couldn't stop shaking.  I was slurring a lot. Then I would feel fine just out of it when we were driving. Then when the car stopped moving I would feel the need to shake and slur again and it was really weird. I was put on suicide watch and was told I was involuntary hold because they didn't feel safe I went home. So I spent 2 days in the hospital and when I felt normal I asked to talk to them again. I didn't want to be sent away so I told them I would get help. I just didn't know where to go. So today I was released and I feel very confused. I have small headaches every now and then but that's it. I'm suppose to get a visit tomorrow.  This will be the first time I've actually reached out for my depression that I've had for a very long time. Hope it helps.
