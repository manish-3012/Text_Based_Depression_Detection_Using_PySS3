My friend who suffers from depression implied she had a â€˜choice to makeâ€™ and has said about suicidal thoughts before, now she has her phone off and this all happened after an argument.There was tension on a group chat between people and she said she had a choice to make and to another person privately that weâ€™d see her on Monday for school and if we donâ€™t then we should already know why.

I text her mom like I have before to make sure sheâ€™s ok and the message delivered. After no response I sent another one and it did not do so, meaning either her phone ran out of battery or she turned it off. I know her mom usually goes to bed earlier, and her dad stays up later, but Iâ€™m worried as both of their phones are off. I feel like she wouldâ€™ve had to have saw the message and then turned her phone off to go to bed, because if she wasnâ€™t on it in the first place I donâ€™t see it running out of battery.

I donâ€™t know what to do. Help?
