Do I tell him?So Iâ€™ve been suicidal again for a month or so now, my family wonâ€™t leave me alone because I told them, theyâ€™ve taken most things I could hurt myself with. Truth be told, most of the time Iâ€™m too scared to kill myself, but Iâ€™ll have intense moments where Iâ€™ll almost do it. Anyway, only my family know, theyâ€™ve been pretty unhappy since which I hate and why I debated telling them, and why Iâ€™m debating telling my boyfriend. Heâ€™s already going up and down in moods, I donâ€™t want to make him sad. My mum and brother tell me itâ€™s unfair that I donâ€™t tell him, mostly because heâ€™s probably noticed Iâ€™m acting weird and pushing him away, and that heâ€™s probably thinking itâ€™s his fault. I love him, I do, I care about him so deeply but Iâ€™ve known him for 3 months, he doesnâ€™t deserve to be sad or worried about me that badly if that makes sense? Heâ€™s quite good with my problems, he knows I have anxiety etc, but doesnâ€™t know how bad it all gets. I just donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any good in telling him. It would change things. I just need help, do I tell him, do I not? Iâ€™m tired of having all these questions and just Iâ€™m too tired. This may not be the best question to ask here, sorry if itâ€™s not allowed.
