Scared of being driven to harming myself and/or othersI get thoughts of doing things such as going on webcam or in call for friends and harming myself. And because of a [recent event](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3788wq/im_in_the_most_convoluted_relationships_of_my/), I am incredibly scared that I'll eventually be driven to doing such a thing. Is this basically my cry for help? I don't want to scare them like that, and the part that thinks nobody will grieve for me conflicts with thoughts that people truly care about me (because people do). I really don't know what I want to do anymore. I have unpleasant dreams about going back to a psych ward (I went to one last year for an impulse suicide attempt) and I don't want to go back to one.
