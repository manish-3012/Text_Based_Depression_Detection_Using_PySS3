I'm thinking of ending it allI'm tired. I'm so ashamed of who I am, of how weak I am. I severely dislike who I have become and how my life is. I can't change. I don't know how. I'm tired of feeling like I just hurt people or disappoint them. I'm tired of feeling useless. I'm tired of always feeling like the world would be a better place without me. I'm just thinking of ending it all.
