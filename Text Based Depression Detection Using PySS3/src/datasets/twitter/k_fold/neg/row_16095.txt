I'm gonna kill myself in a couple daysThe problem isn't that I don't care anymore, it's that I care way too much. Life seems to want to do everything and anything it can to cause me pain. I'm in love with a girl a have no chance with. It's destroying me that I'll never get to kiss her. I'm falling apart and I can't do anything about it... except one thing.

Kill myself.

Bye.
