I don't know why or what to do.I am 14. My cousin (17 currently) has been molesting me in my sleep fo rthe past few years whenever he's over. We were always forced to share a bed. I wake up and he's... touching me. I didn't do anything except turn away because he's my cousin and I couldn't just jump up and say no. After i would turn on my side away from him he would start massaging my butt... I try to mumble like incoherently to try and make him stop but he wont (sometimes). Then a minute later he'll just stop. I think he may have been masturbating while touching me. All that mixed with bullying and my parents divorce, and my depression... It has almost pushed me over the edge multiple times. I have tried to kill myself 5 times. I am considering it again, but i cant find a way to get myself to do it. I have tried cutting myself but i dont have any blades sharp enough. I try to tell people but they think i'm joking and won't believe me. I just don't know what to do. I have been oppressing the memories for a while. Th elast time he touched me was about 3 months ago. I dont know what to do. please someone just... help?
