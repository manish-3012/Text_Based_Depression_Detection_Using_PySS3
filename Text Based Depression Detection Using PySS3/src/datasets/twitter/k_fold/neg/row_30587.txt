i'm scared of myselfthe thoughts keep getting worse. i don't know who to tell but they are so distracting, i try to do school work and i can't do it. i want to die really badly. i've been feeling this way for so long, i had no idea what it was called but now i recently realized that i want to die. my birthday was yesterday and i just turned 12, but i wish i was never born. i had no body to celebrate it with, i have no body to tell anything. i don't think that my parents care but i really wish they did. they're mean to me, it really hurts to know that i'm not wanted any where. i hurt myself before and i said it was by accident and nobody helped me. i tried it only a little but now i want to try more, i want to be done for, i don't think i can go on anymore. i'm scared, i don't feel like myself, i don't even know who "myself" is, i don't think i can go on much longer..
