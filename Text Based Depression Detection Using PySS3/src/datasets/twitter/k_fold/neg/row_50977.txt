There's nothing anyone can say to stop me now.My endless loop of jealousy, self-loathing and desire to talk to friends and be myself, yet having social anxiety and wanting to isolate myself so no one has to deal with me... it's too painful for me, and no one can stop me from killing myself in January. Everyone needs to stop forcing me to stay. So what happens if I stay? I'll still be in constant pain. What happens if I kill myself? Nothing. Absolutely nothing; they'll survive. They all have other friends they can lean on; in fact, they prefer them over me. So what if I kill myself? Everyone who just says they care really don't. They'd be happy to be rid of me, and I'll be happy to oblige.
