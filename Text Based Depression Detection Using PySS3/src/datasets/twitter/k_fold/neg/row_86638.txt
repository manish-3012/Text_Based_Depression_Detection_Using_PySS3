4 years ago my mother said "what could be so bad"I remember when I was 19, my freshmen year of college I was hospitalized for Valentine's Day for a suspected suicidal ideation.

I lived very far from my parents and it wasn't practical for them to come and visit. They were going to come, but I made sure to convince them it was all a mistake and they stayed home. I told them over skype the hospitalization was a mistake. My mother said to me, I'll never forget "I don't know what could be so bad"
The words sting in my head. I lied. I had every intentions of killing myself, but I didn't have  an answer to her question.

I don't have an answer for you mom, I really don't. I don't really know what's so bad.
