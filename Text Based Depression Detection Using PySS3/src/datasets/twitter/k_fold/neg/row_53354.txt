This is itMy last few hours on earth. I deserve this, it had to happen. I'm going to hurt a lot of people very much. And I can't do anything to stop it. I won't be back here to read your messages. But I do want to say that, IF YOU ARE HERE, YOU MUST SEEK HELP BEFORE ITS TOO LATE. Just talk to someone. That's out of the options for me now. My death has to come soon. This feels so surreal. I can't wait for it to be over.
