Something I donâ€™t understand about peopleMost people say life is meaningful, but they never talk about when a baby dies, I mean the death of a baby is the biggest demonstration that life is meaningless, I just saw on the news the death of 6 babies who died at a hospital and it made me wonder, what will the family think? Have another baby? Whatâ€™s their perspective on life? Someone who was supposed to live 90 years died not even being aware of what life was or whatâ€™s about, what the components to it are, so whatâ€™s the difference between someone like a baby who didnâ€™t even get to experience life and die and someone who committed suicide? Sure the person who committed did so because of circumstances that led there, but the death of baby just shows we can die at any moment and that it really doesnâ€™t matter, this proves that things like assisted suicide should be legal, the only difference between the death of baby and someone who committed suicide is the suffering of the person who committed suicide, but both are meaningless, if people react to the death of baby and then let it go, why canâ€™t it be that way with any life especially of someone whoâ€™s suffering? Sure with those people theyâ€™ve had experiences, but itâ€™s still meaningless, people seriously need to change their perspective on life keeping in mind all the deaths that happen daily and especially those of babies/children because they didnâ€™t even get to experience life.
