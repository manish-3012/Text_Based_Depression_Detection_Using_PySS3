Maybe Saturday?Long story short , Iâ€™m (17) depressed and suicidal. Obviously why would I be here otherwise. Anyways suicide is something Iâ€™ve been thinking bout for the last 5 years, Iâ€™ve attempted it a few times but either always pussied out at the last minute or it just went wrong. But I think that the next time I attempt it (which by the title suggests might be this Saturday) I wonâ€™t pussy out. I think Iâ€™ve gotten to the point where I just genuinely donâ€™t wanna be here anymore and thereâ€™s lots of reasons for that, I donâ€™t know wether Iâ€™m supposed to share them or not? I doubt itâ€™d make much difference, theyâ€™re probably very similar problems that a lot of people have. I donâ€™t know what the point of this was really, I guess I just needed to tell someone. So yeah, if I fail or pussy out Iâ€™ll see ya around if not well eh who knows. Maybe Iâ€™ll see ya in the afterlife or something?
