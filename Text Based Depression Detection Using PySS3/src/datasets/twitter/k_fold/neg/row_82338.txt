I'm ending my lifeI'm not telling anyone close to me that I feel suicidal, I feel so disconnected with the world, I feel like my only friendship is starting to fade, and I feel empty and emotionally drained. I had a lot of goals for life, I wanted to travel, I wanted to find someone to get married to, I wanted to educate myself and get into nursing. 

I feel like I'm throwing everything away but I don't know how to survive in this world. It feels like I've tried everything, therapy, medication, alternative medicines, etc. Nothing that I've tried has worked for me. 

I struggle with so much body dysmorphia, trauma, and relationship issues. I really wish my mindset was different. I could've prevented so much if I wasn't so impulsive and quick to say and do things.

I'm going to jump off a bridge tomorrow. I've thought about waiting to buy a gun, but that would take a long time and finding fentanyl on the deep web seems risky and hard to find, so the bridge is my only option right now. 

If you ever read this, Nick, I love you and I'm sorry.
