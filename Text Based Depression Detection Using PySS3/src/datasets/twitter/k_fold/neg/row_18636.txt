i brought this on myself soon it will all be over............this is my first time doing a tread...........my eyes are filling with tears as i type.......most my life i have suffered from depression and it has gotten worse as of lately.....i think about suicide every day...i have slice my wrist several times just to see how it feels......i have no job my wife never talks i have no friends and no family.........i want to kill myself so bad that just typing this makes me feel like a fool.........i have everything anyone would ever want except feeling happy.........drugs were the only thing that kept me sain but since i have stop smoking weed my lonelyness has only gotten worse.........i have tried everything you can imagine to be happy........ but it seems like everything i do is never enough.......im pretty sure my funeral would be almost empty.......the only people i have ever loved have choosen religion ovcer family and pushed me away since i was a child...... most of the time people come over to my house and never say anything to me pretty much act like i dont exist and this is my house......i think its about time i leave everyone to them selves because im pretty sure no one gonna notice when im gone........
