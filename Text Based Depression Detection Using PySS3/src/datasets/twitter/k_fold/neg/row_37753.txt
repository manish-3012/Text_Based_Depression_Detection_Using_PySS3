Low key high key wanna overdoseHello
Donâ€™t want to get into too much detail right now. But Iâ€™m always back and forth between killing myself and wanting to kind of live. But something happened today  and it was pretty traumatizing. Tbh I usually cut myself but Iâ€™m trying to stop. And since Iâ€™m not doing that I really just want to take the multiple bottles of pills that are sitting on my desk. I already started taking some but I stopped to lay down to convince myself that itâ€™s not the right move. But the urge to cut myself or finish taking the bottle of medicine is just too overwhelming right now
