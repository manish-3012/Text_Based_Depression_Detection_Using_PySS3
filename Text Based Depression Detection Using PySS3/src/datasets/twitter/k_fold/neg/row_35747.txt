Someone I care for dearly is currently institutionalized due to an attempt. Would anyone be interested in sending him uplifting letters?I know this is a strange request. I hope it's allowed. He has so much going for him and so little self worth. His life hasnt been an easy one. He's beautiful inside and out. Please help. I'm allowed to bring him books, care packages, and letters. He has a long road to recovery ahead of him. I know him well enough to know that any positivity sent his way would benefit him. Pm me for address.
