Just some notesDear Reddit,

Just some notes here. Not looking for much except for maybe general comments. I've never shared these with anyone in real life but since this is pretty anonymous (throw-away account) I thought I might as well after reading everyone else's posts.

My life so far has been pretty decent from the eyes of an outsider, I guess. I finished uni doing something I sort of enjoyed and I'm getting an advanced degree in the same field. I've travelled around the world and I've experienced a lot of things that many might not have the chance to experience, and I have a stable job, stable family relationship and some friends.

I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 9 due to family reasons. When I was in 7/8th grades, my biggest fantasy was to kill my parents in their sleep and then kill myself. I guess my closest attempt back then was taking around 20 tablets of antibiotics(which didn't do much except made me sick for a couple of days) but nothing more. Throughout high school I fantasized about death and would often purposefully put myself in dangerous situations such as sitting on the edge of a window or something silly like that. I guess it was not really anything serious as an attempt, but the fantasy felt extremely soothing and comforting in a sense. In uni I felt less like that, when I was dating my former significant other, who had MDD and had had multiple attempts, including experiences of hospitalization. I didnt quite understood what they were feeling back then I guess because my depression wasn't as serious as what they were experiencing. I, however, think I understand it now because I'm pretty sure that I'm in the same boat.

Because of my work I can reasonably gain access to certain materials that are able to kill me rather painlessly if calculated correctly. I have a date that I intend on carrying out this plan sometime in the near future after I've fulfilled some of my last promises to people, and I feel that this is an acceptable thing to do, for the following reasons:

- I've experienced most of the things that I believe that I should experience and I am able to say with certain confidence that if I die now I will not have regrets 
- my friends and family will be okay if they are aware of the end of my existence. It will come as an accident if done correctly and since I'm not really close to any of them, it will hurt a limited amount of people and I can't care enough (since I'll be dead)
- I despise myself and I can't really look at myself in the mirror without having the urge to spit in my face. I guess it would be ideal to live in a place without mirrors and without people so I wouldn't have to deal with it. But I thrive on human contact and it would be worse because I will probably kill myself unhappily rather than ambivalently
- If my attempt succeeds, then I won't have to care anymore. If it doesn't, I'll know what didn't work and gain more experience for the future
- I can't really function without the support of many different substances (like caffeine and antihistamines) and the dependence makes me sick. It needs to be broken

Honestly I don't see any downsides to my plan. But for the sake of debating I thought I'd share, because we tend to be blinded by our own views. Any thoughts will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
