Should I end my life?This is a little awkward to say on Reddit, but when I was 3 years old, I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD. I had to undergone therapy on my motor skills as well as my speech because I had some minor delays as a little kid. As a result of these delays, I had to be placed in special education services and be registered for an IEP all the way through K-12.

Luckily I graduated high school and Iâ€™m currently attending college, but Iâ€™ve been in and out of depression from being ashamed of my past since middle school. Iâ€™m not worried about the ADHD diagnosis as much as autism, but the years of pain and agony from being LABELED as autistic have driven me to almost attempting suicide my sophomore year of high school. I see jokes about the stereotypes of autism all over the internet and people at my school bullying the special needs students and it just makes me angry inside. As a result of these instances, I have never been comfortable telling my friends my past and how itâ€™s affected me today in fear of what they would think of me.

I had thought about a specific date on when I should kill my self, maybe in the middle of my college career or right after I graduate college. I just sometimes tell myself, maybe I donâ€™t need to live all the way until I turn 85, when I can just end everything at 21, or even right now. Another debate Iâ€™m often having is where will I go after I kill myself. What will be on the other side?
