Days like theseI've just had one of those months, where a lot of things have gone wrong, very unexpectedly.
Important, heavy thing. So I'm already fighting to just keep breathing this month. It's been worse then your run of the mill melancholy filled times.

But then I'm at a family dinner tonight, and I'm not even really talking, mostly just listening to my brother and a family friend chat about politics and I occasionally would ask a question or chuck in a statement and my Dad kept putting his hand in my knew and shushing me (not odd behaviour between him and I, but that's a whole other fucking post)
But anyways, this started to mute me cause I normally feel like no one wants to hear me talk, but anyone who has experienced this kinda passive aggressive shit, knows how horrid it feels.

Then my Uncle takes me plate and I say "Thank you so much" to then get talked at harshly for 10 minutes by my Aunt and Uncle about how they hate that term and it is correct to use "Thank you very much" and I just, I just hit breaking point. 
I got up, walked out and got in my car and cried the whole way home. 

I'm know getting messages about how rude me walking out was. It probably was, but I mean .. I just said Thank you, who makes someone feel shitty for that? How can you say thank you wrong?

I'm so exhausted, I'm so tired of staying here so as to not transfer my pain to others. 
I'm just so over all of it. 

I hope everyone here is finding hope and strength today!
