Why isnâ€™t Doctor Assisted Suicide for the Non-Terminally Ill Allowed?I live in Canada, where doctor assisted suicide was decriminalized back in 2015. Now, if you are likely to pass away in a 6 month period, you can get a medical professional to safely and I presume harmlessly assist you out of this world. Fair enough. 

But what about those who arenâ€™t terminally ill, but have still had enough of life. Why are we still forcing these people to take dangerous actions if they want to end their lives? Letâ€™s be honest, if youâ€™re going to kill yourself, youâ€™re going to kill yourself. So why not make it safer and accessible for everyone and eliminating the hassle and stigma of suicide. Suicide should not be a taboo subject. If it were legal and controlled, we might wven have an over population solution. This would be 100% entirely up to the individual. 

I am not terminally ill, and I am not planning to live this fucked up forsaken life any longer. So, why does the Goverment want me to risk the potential safety of others in trying to end my life when they have the knowledge and will power to do it theirselves. Why?
