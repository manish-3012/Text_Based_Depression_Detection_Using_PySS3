Iâ€™m not scared of dying, Iâ€™m scared of not succeeding and being permanently damagedDeath doesnâ€™t scare me. But Iâ€™m afraid that the suicide attempt wouldnâ€™t be successful and I would find myself waking up in a hospital bed permanently injured. Iâ€™m also afraid about how my mom would take it. Those are the only things holding me back.

Waking up is a burden. Being alive is tiring. Iâ€™ve used nothing but my willpower to fight these feelings but after so long it gets old...

Whatâ€™s the point of life if the world has been rooted on evil since humanityâ€™s existence? Whatâ€™s the point of life if the only thing guaranteed in a life is death?
