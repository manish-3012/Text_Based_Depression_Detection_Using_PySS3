Whatâ€™s going to happen to me when I take 15-20 aspirin pills at one time ?Iâ€™ve been reading up different ways to OD on over the counter pills. Aispirn is the thing hahah stuck out most to me, as a child I accidentally took too many aspirins as well I donâ€™t remeber the exact amount but I was like 8-9 years old and I was vomiting a lot and had to go to the doctor to get my stomach cleaned. Now as  a 23 year old adult Iâ€™ve wondered if the same thing would happen or would it be worse ? I donâ€™t really want to die in pain, but Iâ€™m also scared to die.
