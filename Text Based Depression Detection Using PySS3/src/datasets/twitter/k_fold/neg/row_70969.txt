The universe is telling me to end itHey so Iâ€™m feeling pretty broken. Iâ€™m usually okay mentally with no real drive to commit suicide but these past few weeks my life has been falling apart. I would do anything to go back to July when I had a home, a job, and a girlfriend. So I used to share a house with a chill roommate but he and his friends started stealing from me. At first theyâ€™d take small things like change or food, which I didnâ€™t mind but then entire bottles of meds would go missing. I decided to move out, and bought an suv to live in temporarily, with plans to sell it once I got a new place. Fast forward to last weekend the air suspension went out so I ordered a regular coil suspension to it swap it. Yesterday when the coil arrived I turn the key and it doesnâ€™t start.. $200 later itâ€™s towed to the dealership and I find out it also has several oil leaks. Thereâ€™s another $2000 I donâ€™t have. Anyway so I get into my other car to get to work and ended up bumping it into manual without knowing. Itâ€™s 5am I canâ€™t see shit and really donâ€™t wanna use the fake manual when my dash lights are out so I try shifting to neutral to reset it back to automatic, turns out I pushed it into reverse. Transmission is shot, and Iâ€™m late to work with two fucked up vehicles. So Iâ€™m walking to work and my gf calls me in the morning like she usually does but this time she sounds different. Basically she says she needs a break and will â€œhmu when sheâ€™s readyâ€. Funny how this comes up a few nights after she reconnected with her ex girlfriend. Thatâ€™s right another girl stole my girl lol. Once again, fast forward to the end of the day yesterday I forget to tighten some bolts which my supervisor of course noticed. I was already on thin ice for showing up half asleep most days due to living in a car. That being said of course I get called into my bosses office for the second time this month, this time I walk out without my job. I decided to resign instead of being fired with the promise of a good recommendation, after being told theyâ€™d make sure I was fired â€œfor causeâ€ and wouldnâ€™t pay unemployment. Now here I am today: no job, no bed to sleep in, two pos cars, no gf, and barely any money in the bank. Basically everything I worked so hard for this year Iâ€™ve lost in just a few days. I think tomorrow Iâ€™ll invest what little money I have left in a shotgun.
