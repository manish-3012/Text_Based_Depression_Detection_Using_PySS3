Can someone help?!2 years ago I moved back to France. I had a plan and I was fierce. These two years were full of disappointment and failure. 
Everytime I failed I had some sort of a contingency plan so that I could cope with the pain. 
A while a go I met this amazing guy and the job interviews were promising. I even felt like I was in heaven. 
Last Monday he wanted to take his distance. All job interviews came back with a negative response. I had a small project that failed. I am short on money and full of debts. I can't talk to my family and I don't have a lot of friends. 
All plans I had failed. From plan A to plan Z. All failed. 
I feel like I fell down from heaven right into rock bottom. It is like someone took away my drug. 
I can see only darkness. I can't see the end of the tunnel. I can't feel gravity. I only feel void. And this is a new level of pain that I am not used.
The only thing that is preventing me from committing suicide is riding on bus to unknown destinations and me not being so sure that God exists. 
I don't know what to do. Something inside of me is telling me that (that guy) his presence would make me feel better and make feel gravity again. But something else is telling me to find another plan and maybe by finding a good job I could cope again with pain like I used to. And I am here just wishing God exists and that he could answer me.
I just need to share this maybe someone could help.
