how to silence the thoughts?pretty consistently i find myself hardly hearing or listening to people. i find myself wanting to die almost all the time, or like warn people that i am involuntarily awful, that everyone leaves eventually. i find myself narrating my thoughts and life while others are talking. i dont know, maybe i am alone in this, but if im not... how the fuck do i remain present anymore? all i can think about are the negatives. i practice DBT but it doesnt help.
