I fucking hate myselfAnd nobody has a fucking clue. Why would they? As a freshman, I'm ranked #6 in my class academically, I made both varsity basketball and varsity track, and I play two instruments. I look happy for the most part

I've also been self-harming since the 6th grade. The earliest suicidal thought I can remember was around the 4th grade? I hate my body, I hate my face, I think of killing myself about 15 times a day. I've had anxiety attacks over outfits. Outfits.

I have no best friend, have never been in a romantic relationship. I'm honestly too worthless for someone to like me as more than an acquaintance. I've realized I'm just background noise in people's lives. Nobody reaches out to me, nobody talks to me on the regular.

I'm socially inarticulate and can't maintain relationships. I simultaneously crave validation and despise speaking to people. Honestly, I think I have bipolar disorder, because once in a blue moon, all of this is replaced by excessive glee. I feel happier, bolder, more confident. I've done risky things both online and off. I start new hobbies and make commitments and then leave everything half-finished when the high (mania?) comes down.

The only thing keeping me here is my immediate family, and yet I can't bring myself to ask for help. I just can't. My pride won't allow me. I won't be able to handle the look of disappointment on their faces.

I constantly daydream, I read, I watch shows, I do anything to remove myself from reality. Because every time I look at myself in the mirror I want to curl up and die from sheer embarrassment. So much potential and yet I still manage to be a fucking failure
