want it to be overI bought new razors the other day, 5 Wilkinsons. I've never cut with those kinds of razors before so I was surprised by how small and sharp they were. I've never tried to cut myself to bleed out ... I've been stabbed and shit but that's one quick jab. Cutting your arms takes a bit of time and I can't imagine it's painless, but I'm just so burnt out. I tried to kill myself about thirty five times last year, mostly overdoses, some I tried to strangle myself or tried to hang myself, but not one of those attempts wound me up in the hospital or even got people concerned. I'm still in high school so I live with my parents. They kind of brush it under the rug and don't take me seriously when I say I'm suicidal. I don't think anyone really takes it seriously anymore. I've grown up in an age where "I want to kill myself" is a joke now instead of a concerning statement, and it's exhausting. I feel like I'm screaming for help but no one's paying attention to me.

Now that I'm thinking about it more, I'll probably overdose too, and maybe that'll numb the pain or make me so shaky that I hit an artery. I hope I don't live to see the aftermath. Everyone would be so disappointed.
