I feel like i'm about to snap, a bit more than suicide.I don't know if this is the right board to post in. I feel like i'm on the brink. I'm 18, and I feel like i'm going to have a breakdown. Not the falling down crying kind, but the burn down my house, stab my mother to death, and then slit my wrists kind of breakdown. There is only one reason I haven't already done it, and thats my girlfriend, but nothing is permanent. I find no pleasure in anything else but her. My mother is insane, and she's really pushing me to the edge lately. I've always wanted to kill her, but i've restrained myself for years. I have a dissociative disorder, and I feel like i'm really going to explode any fucking minute and end that bitch's life, then take mine so I wont have to deal with the stupid legal shit that comes afterwards. Advice?
