I am really strugglingI didnt know who to vent to or where to go but here sounds like a good place.

6 years ago this come saturday I was raped. Every year I tell myself I will get over it. I push to bettering myself as a person, to heal and recover. Every year I start to feel normal and start to believe that I can get past it then laborday weekend rolls around and I am hit by reality. I am alone, I have no friends because I isolate myself. I struggle to go out and meet people because I am scared of strangers. I push my boyfriend away and I hide in my room talking to people online to forget about my issues. 

I stop eating because I worry about my weight,  I dont sleep because of my nightmares, and I used to self harm. The only reason why I stopped cutting myself was because I was scared someone would see the cuts. 

I am usually good about taking care of myself but its this one time of year when it hits me. It is this one time of year that I struggle to get through. Last year I was going to kill myself, I sat there intending to slash my wrists open. I really was going to do it, but something in me told me to hold out. This year the voice is gone. 

I dont know how many years I can deal with, its almost been 6 years and I still wake up screaming and drenched in sweat. I still jump at small noises and have panic attacks. I cant keep living like this. 

I dont know what to do, I dont want to give up but I am getting tired of fighting. I have people I love and care about but I cant function. 

I dont know if this was the right place for this but I needed to at least get it off my chest.
