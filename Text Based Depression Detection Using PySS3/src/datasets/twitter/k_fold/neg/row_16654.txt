It's not worth itI've been reading and posting on this subject, on multiple sites for the past hour. Best summarized here:

Add to this numerous "motivational" articles about how to stop whining because no one cares about your insignificant problems, at best they pretend to and start planning how to get away from you.

It hurts too much. It's too unbearable, to think that not only am I helpless (almost four years now of irritating people on a daily basis with whatever my latest internal crisis is. And I have a new one every day), but I'm a life ruiner. All I do is complain, and I do get advice, but I always fail to act on it, something else gets in the way. I can never actually act, I don't know why, and it all feels so pointless anyway.

Not only that, but insignificance. Not mattering. No matter what you do, it won't actually impact the world. What's the point, then? If you can't even get recognition, prestige, love...something to fill the void. I don't know what I want. Some days I feel like being a novel hero to my own story, to prove myself and achieve some kind of glory as a substitute since I've rather given up on relationships.
Other days, and most nights, all I want is someone to be there, someone to hold me, tell me they love me and mean it. Someone to want me. Someone to care for me.

But, if the internet is right, then even if I could get that, it's all fake. Lies. I and everyone else will drown in isolation forever. And I don't pretend I'm any different - the only way I know how to connect with people is by using them as emotional waste disposals. I hate that I do this, I wish I could actually have interesting things in my life. But I can never get started. 

And now I see, even if I did, what's the point? There's always a utility aspect to relationships - you have to do something for the other person. Be interesting, make them feel good. I've leeched off people who could do that for me, but I can't do that for anyone else. Giving can feel good, so I don't mind that truth, just that I can't do it...and that I might never be enough, and even then, who can I trust?

This is the third time I've thought about suicide this month. I doubt I'll do anything, but I can't help feeling like that degree of isolation is completely unbearable. I don't want to give up hope. I'm a chronic fantasist, so I guess the possibility of someone truly caring will always linger, that it's at least possible.
