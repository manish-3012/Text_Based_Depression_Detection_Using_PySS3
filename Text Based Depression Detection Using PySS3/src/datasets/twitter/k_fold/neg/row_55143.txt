I want to kill myself because i cant get a girlfriendI feel so lonely and unloved by girls. I will probably be alone for life because i am so ugly and socially disabled. I have had girls openly call me ugly before as well as laugh at me for trying to say hi to them. I am 16 and there is absolutely no sign of my situation  getting better. Should i go through with it?
