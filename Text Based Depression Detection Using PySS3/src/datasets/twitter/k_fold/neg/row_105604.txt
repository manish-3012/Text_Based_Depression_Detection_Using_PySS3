If we get another lockdown I swear to god I will take my own lifeIt will be like all the strength I built up emotionally to cope with the first lockdown will have been for nothing . I feel like a freak for being so scared about the virus as it seems that no one else that I know is as scared about Corona virus as I am. I've been told that people are getting sick of me asking and telling people about my fears about the virus . I feel like other people don't understand how blimmin hard lockdown has been for those of us with mental illnesses.
