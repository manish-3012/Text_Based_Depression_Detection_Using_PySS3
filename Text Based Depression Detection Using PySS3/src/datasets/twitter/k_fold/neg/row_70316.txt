How do people react to suicide?How will everyone act after I'm gone, will my mother and other family members recover?, will people speak ill of me?, I don't want to be remembered as an attention whore, I just want to go, I don't like where my life is going, I'm scared and I think suicide might be my best option, for me and for everyone
