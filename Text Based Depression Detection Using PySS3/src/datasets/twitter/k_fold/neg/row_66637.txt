Fear of the futureHi guys

Ive been suffering from depression and OCD for almost 10 years and have been and currently still on medication 

So basically i graduated medical school in my country a year and am currently doing my transitional year which is basically a year you get to rotate in every specialty to see which one you like and want to specialize in

For the past 3 years Ive been ditching and leaving early on most days to prepare for 3 examinations called the usmle so that i can apply for a specialty in the US

So i almost have no clinical experience at all especially with procedures ive almost done none and have barely scrubbed into surgeries

My transitional year is almost over and lately ive been getting thoughts of extreme regret and shame on all the clinical experience i lost and all the time i spent studying instead of being in the hospital and practicing to become a doctor

I really feel like shit and wish i never entered a field that is so tough and demanding
To be honest i really just wanna end my life and get rid of all the mental pain that i have from the shame

Ive scrubbed into only a handful of surgeries and rarely ever did any procedures, even if i end up doing well in my exams how the hell am I suppose to even survive during my specialty training

I hate myself and not for the first time just wish i was already dead
