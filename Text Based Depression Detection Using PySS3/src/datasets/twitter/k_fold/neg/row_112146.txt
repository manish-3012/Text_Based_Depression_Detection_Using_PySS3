Just took 400mg of Prozac and I kinda regret itIdk I feel like I don't want to die but I don't want to live etlither, don't want to commit to killing myself and now I don't want to have to go to the ER or whatever and go through the process of talking to my therapist or inpatient treatment or some shit. Idk what to do RN honestly
