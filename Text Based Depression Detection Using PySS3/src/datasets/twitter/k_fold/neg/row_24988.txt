Love is fake.For me, anyway. Nobody has ever looked in my direction at any point, but I'm supposed to just deal, right? Love is always sold out when /I/ go looking. 

So I've got this knife in my hand right now, wondering where the best point of entry would be. A lot of soft tissue, but not many vital areas. I don't want to go for the neck and fuck up because I missed a vein or something. 

The bible says that it's not good for man to be alone, yet it happens every fucking day. People always talk about their success stories, how they "found their person" after years of crying and praying. What they DON'T talk about are people like me. The rejects. The socially inept motherfuckers that just want to live. Yeah, those guys get nothing. No matter how they try and change to fit the object of their affections, they get nothing. 

Society rejects people all the time. My room is in the attic, so nobody will know for at least a few days. Let's see where this goes.
