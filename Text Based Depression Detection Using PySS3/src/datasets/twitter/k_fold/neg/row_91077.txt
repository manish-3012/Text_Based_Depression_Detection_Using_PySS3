I'm sorry. I just wanted to say this somewhere. It's okay to ignore it.No throwaway. I don't really have a reason to use this account again. 

Just once, I want to be able to put all of this into words, but I've been staring at the screen for twenty minutes. I don't think I can. 

I am 27. I still haven't finished undergrad. I've never had a real job. I have no skills, no accomplishments, and nothing to be proud of. I'm spending so much money, but I'm not even majoring in anything that will help me make a decent living.

Ten years ago, I was young. I was accepted into the school of my dreams. young. I thought I would be just fine. 

I am not going to be fine. 

Mental illness was an excuse. I still had choices. I still could have done something with myself. Or, at least, I could have ended it, before it got to this.

I don't know how to become a functional adult. It's like trying to speak some sort of language I never learned.

I don't want to hurt the people I love. I love my family. I love my best friend. I love my boyfriend, very much. I was never sure how I got to be so lucky. Just hearing his voice every night has always felt like some sort of incomprehensible miracle. 

If I could have pulled it together, I would have done my best to take care of them and make them happy.

But I'm making them miserable. I don't want to do that anymore. 

I never wanted to be a burden on anyone. 

I'm really sorry. 

Good night, world. I wanted to know all about you. I wish I could have learned to speak your language.
