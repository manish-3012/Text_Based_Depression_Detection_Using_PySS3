Just talked to a hotline...And I can officially say it didn't help at all.

I've been in therapy since I was in high school, (24 now), talked to numerous hotlines, tried a bunch of drugs, both legal and less than legal, and been hospitalized 5 times for being a danger to myself/others.

Can still say that life sucks.

I thought it'd get better. I got a better job, entered a committed relationship, actually was getting back into hobbies and stuff. But throughout it all, just the sheer pointlessness and misery lived on. I've always thought that if the circumstances of my life got better, then I'd want to live, but now I can see that my brain is just a tumor, really. MAYBE if I was hyper-rich and didn't have to work in a shitty job, go to school which causes me mental breakdowns daily, and all that, things might be better. I dunno.

Anyway, I looked at cyanide pills today. And shotguns. Not sure which yet. Cyanide is going to be more painful, I know, but the gun scares me because of the noise. I really don't like loud noises. Both scare me because of the failure rate and the idea of dying painfully. 

It's funny, dying scares me, but living scares me more at this point. I want to go out on my own terms.
