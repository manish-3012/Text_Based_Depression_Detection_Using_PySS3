I will never look like a woman, so there is no point in living. I regret staying alive so longWhy even bother? HRT won't fix my stupid male face, nothing will. I am too poor to afford a surgery. I'm sick of the constant hugboxing and people telling me I'd pass as a cis woman if they didn't know I am trans. My mom thinks I'm a guy still, always uses male pronouns, so do some of my friends and they know my face is ugly and highly encourage surgery. I am done with this life I can't take this anymore nothing will ever fix me. I never want to be born, why did I have to be born? My life is literal torture.
