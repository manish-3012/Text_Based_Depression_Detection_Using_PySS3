nobody would miss me if I was gonemy family only sees me as a convenience, a tool to be used when it suits them, nobody in my life really listens when I try to communicate my feelings (if I say anything negative or vocalise any negative self-talk they just get angry and come after me for feeling sorry for myself), the first person I might be able to say I ever really loved cut me out of her life and only admitted her feelings for me to others after the fact, I lost my job because of other people's anxiety (they admitted, again after the fact that they were out of line), I'm stuck at home at 27 with no one in my life who really cares about me, my life is a mess, and I just wish that either someone would break in and murder me or something else would come along and kill me (preferably a stroke or something in my sleep so I can just drift off but hey at this point I'll take what I can get), I'm completely stuck in life with no way out and I just want it all to end
