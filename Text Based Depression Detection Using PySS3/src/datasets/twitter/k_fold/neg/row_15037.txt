Male (30) dating suicidal female (30)I have been dating this girl for the past 6 months. I was aware that she has been struggling with depression for the past four years and she had a near suicidal moment a few months before we started dating. FYI she has been going to a counselor for help with her mental health. 

I have asked her a few times in the past six months whether she has experienced any suicidal thoughts since then, she said no. Two days ago she told me that she has been having suicidal thoughts and had been lying to me. She apologized for lying and I am okay with the apology, her reason was she didnâ€™t feel safe sharing those thoughts with me.

My girlfriendâ€™s mom does not think this is a good relationship, since she was aware that my girlfriend had not fully disclosed to me the extent of her depression. I am struggling with the decision to whether continue with the relationship since I do like her a lot.Any advice would be appreciated.
