No but seriously what is the point?I just, I keep getting stumped, like I'm better but then I suddenly think "you're so worthless, you should just kill yourself and get it over with" and I've been fantasizing so much about it lately and I really don't know of there's any purpose to continuing so does anybody have any thoughts?
