Friend tried to kill herself.Is there anything I should be doing besides listening to her and making sure she's doing ok? I don't think she's told anyone else besides me. I don't want to do the wrong thing here, and I want to make sure I could do the best of what I can do for her. I don't want to mess up and calling her parents isn't gonna help either, they don't believe in mental health / depression being a thing.
