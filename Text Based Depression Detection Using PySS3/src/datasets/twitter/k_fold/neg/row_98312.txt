I want to kill myself. I cannot stop crying.There's no reason. I just want to kill myself, I know I have it in me to do it, but as cringe and awkward it may sound..I have promised my mother  that I will not do it, but its getting really hard to keep this promise.

I have no friends. Therapy is not an option, because I will never admit these things in person. No one that I will talk to about this. Reddit is my only option.

I have no motivation to do anything. No goals. Nothing at all. I have been isolated for all my life, meaning I chose to sit alone in my room for months. Instead of going out, I honestly dont know how you do it. How can you spend so much time around people and still be happy and have energy?
After a day with people I feel exhausted both physically and mentally.

I used to think that not going out made me feel so bad about myself. So i started going out.. It didn't get rid of the thoughts, I inevitably was left alone and those thoughts came back. It was a mere distraction from them.

I used to think that not having friends made me stay isolated. So after being betrayed too many times to keep track, I gave up on that.

I use to think it was not having someone special. So after I got heart ripes out, played with and then thrown on the ground and stepped on, I knew it wasnt that either.

Then I blamed porn. So I went on nofap, yet they still remain. My head is still torturing me every damned day.

I don't think I can keep my promise much longer. I dont think I can fit with people anymore. I simply lack the trust.

If you read this, i am grateful and would love to heart your advice, what should I do?

Should I just break my promise or continue existing pointlessly?

I really dont feel like going on... I want the road to come to and end tonight. I will do my best to hold it in as always... Thank you if you took your time to read this and sorry for the rant... I dont want to be this way either.

I wish you whoever is reading this a wonderful life full of people who love you!
