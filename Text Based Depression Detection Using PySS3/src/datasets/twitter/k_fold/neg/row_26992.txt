Whatâ€™s the point in living when you have nothing to live for?Seriously,I accepted iâ€™d off myself a long time ago but just havenâ€™t found the balls to go through with it.The urge is always there and I think Iâ€™m ready to go.Iâ€™m just tired and want out of this life,prolonging something thatâ€™s inevitable,man I just want to leave peacefully :/
