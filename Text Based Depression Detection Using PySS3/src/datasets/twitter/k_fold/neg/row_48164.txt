I don't know what to do. I'm breaking apart.This month has been completely hell for me. Iâ€™m your average college student who suffers from anxiety, clinical depression and depersonalization disorder. 

Two weeks ago I tried to hang myself, but the rope snapped and I was still alive. I thought it was some sign of fate, destiny or whatever that I should live. I went to a counselor and got myself 5150â€™d.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5150_(Involuntary_psychiatric_hold)]. I was in there for about a week. My school is under the quarter system. So missing that week set me extremely far behind. It was extremely helpful being there, I was put back on meds (I havenâ€™t been taking any for about a year). Meds that I actually am starting to like instead of loathe and it was a relief being away from my stressors. But things changed once I was deemed sane and was released.

I had two choices once I got there. One was to continue with their outpatient program and the other was to go back to school and continue to see an office psychiatrist and therapist. I chose to go back to school. Now I think I regret that decision. I donâ€™t think I was ready to go back to school.

I worked with my teachers and got extensions and assignments postponed, but itâ€™s still too much. I have three essays to finish by Monday, two stats homework assignments, a lab and a midterm to study for. 

I have a girlfriend who loves me and I had my doubts, but I know I love her. She reads reddit so I canâ€™t really say much. Weâ€™re going through a rough time. Bickering and making up over and over again. Itâ€™s exhausting. She has her own problems as well as do I,so things are rough.

I want to cry, but the iron walls I put up wonâ€™t let me. Itâ€™s killing me inside. All this stress, all the things that need to be done, all the worries I have. I felt like being in the Looney bin put a band aid over the void in my chest and I just ripped the band aid apart.
