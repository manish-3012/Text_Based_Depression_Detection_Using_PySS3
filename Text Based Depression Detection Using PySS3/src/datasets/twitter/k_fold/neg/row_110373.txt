My best friend keeps posting things about how she wants to kill herself, but acts okay irl. So, we're both on Tumblr and we have a rule that we aren't allowed to bother each other about what we post, because we regard it as a place to vent. But she's been posting stuff about self harm for awhile now, and this morning she just posted something about how all she wants to do is kill herself. She's posted a few things about it since then, and I'm really really worried. I went over to her house and asked her if everything was alright and she acted completely normal, told me that everything was okay, and she's just stressed about her classes. I asked her about the posts, and she responded that it wasn't a big deal, she was just stressed about school and whatnot, and she's completely fine. She acted like her normal cheery self when I went over that I was just scared of bringing anything up, because I really didn't want to irritate her or have her push me away. 

So I told her I had a doctor's appt, and after I was done I'd text her and head over to her house, to which she was her usual cheery self (via text) and said that that was fine, and seemed excited about hanging out afterwards. When I was actually done, I texted her and she responded with, "Please don't come over. I need to be alone. I need to do homework." which is very uncharacteristic of her as far as texting goes. (she's always one to respond with a, "Awwww noo!! I have more homework, sorry!! DX" sort of thing. Always full of emoticons and extra letters.

Basically I'm freaking out. I'm not filtering this very well because I really just don't know what to do. I tried calling her brother but no response. I don't want to piss her off, but i really don't want her to do anything. She keeps posting stuff on Tumblr about how she's really upset with today and upset with herself, but she keeps saying that she's fine, she promises, and she's acting completely cheery for some reason. I'm really worried. I don't want to say anything to have her isolate me and have it so i can't do anything about it. And I don't want to make this worse on her. 

I used to have major issues with depression a few years back, so I know she's going to keep trying to convince me that everything is alright, because that's what I did. I never let up either, I was very convincing that everything was alright and even would get offended and frustrated with my friends who knew better and wouldn't let me be. I tried pushing them away even. Ultimately, I owe them so much because they saved me, but we're not the same person. What if I do that and it only makes her feel more hopeless?

She also says that she would accept professional help, because she has a family history of depression and anxiety, but she can't afford it. And she won't mention anything about her own personal issues, or things that she's dealing with.




Tl;dr: my best friend posts stuff on tumblr about how she really wants to kill herself but when i asked her about it, she acted really cheery and normal and said she was just stressed about school. she's trying to convince me that everything was okay and she was overreacting. I don't want to irritate her by bugging her but i really want her to be okay.
