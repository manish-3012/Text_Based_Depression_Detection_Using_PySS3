Extreme Thanks to SWEver since I posted my last post to SW (http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ujasq/reddit_i_have_no_fucking_idea_what_to_do_right/), I have received a lot of advice from different people, and I've greatly reconsidered what I wanted to do.

I had suicidal thoughts before my doctor and therapist upped my anxiety and depression meds again. I had nowhere to turn, so I asked Reddit for advice, because I had no idea what to do. I received a LOT of great advice from many different people and wishes that I would be okay. I just wanted to say that you all turned my life around, because I'm doing a lot better. 

Thank you all so very much for all that you've done.  Sometimes, people don't even know that they change people's lives for the better, be it a little or a lot.  I just wanted you all to know that you've really changed and saved a life.

Love,

Lexa

tl;dr I want to say thanks to SW for saving me and letting me know I am going to be okay
