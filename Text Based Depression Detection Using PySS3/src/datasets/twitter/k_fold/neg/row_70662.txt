I can't even do it while drunk.I get mad at the few who talk to me. Try and cut myself and still feel it. Being so damn isolated from anyone I know drives me insane. If I had a gun I could just pull that trigger and no more nights of this tortute. Living everyday with chronic pain and that feeling of dpression gives me nothing try and pull through. What is the point if there ids no one at the end of the day to alugh and talk to.
