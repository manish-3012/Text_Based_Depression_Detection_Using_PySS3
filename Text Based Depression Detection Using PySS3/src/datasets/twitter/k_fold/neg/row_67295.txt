Adam's ApplePenny361 here. School started. If you see this post, you should read my last to understand more.
The BIGGEST thing that occupies my thoughts when walking those halls... When I see that person...
That person that killed me the way they did...
I've only seen this person twice, but both times, instead of hiding or crying.. 
I can only think about if my dog would enjoy her Adam's Apple...
I think all those thoughts revolve around me wanting death on myself..
I cannot think of the right action to make..
I'm lost.
