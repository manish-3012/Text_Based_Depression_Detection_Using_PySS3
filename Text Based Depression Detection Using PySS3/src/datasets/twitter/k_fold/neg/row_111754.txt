My relationship with the only person I have ever loved just imploded.Im sitting on my porch putting cigarettes out on my leg so i don't go back inside and get a knife. I had been together with my fiancee for mor than 9 years. About a year and a half ago she changed her depression medication and it completely stopped our intimacy. What used to be a healthy sex life became once or twice a year after pestering her for months. I began to feel unwanted and unloved. So i started to branch out online and join erotic role playing groups. Not the best response in the world but it made me feel wanted again...

My fiancee was on my computer today and found my chats and has decided that this is worse than a one night stand because it was "emotional" cheating. Dhe says that she will never trust me again and that she cannot love me anymore. I truly love her and cannot imagine being without her. I just screwed up so badly I don't think it can be fixed. I don't think i'm a strong enough person to go through this. 

I wish i had different antidepressants so i could "definitely not on purpose" take too many of them. In a bottle and a half deep in rum and im thinking if i could keep down double that it might do it.
