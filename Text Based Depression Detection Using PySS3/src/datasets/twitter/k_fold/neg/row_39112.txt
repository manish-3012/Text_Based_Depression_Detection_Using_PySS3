Iâ€™m so burnt out. Quarantine was the once-in-a-lifetime break I needed, but Iâ€™m an essential worker. Now work is even harder than normal and Iâ€™m drained. My brain has nothing left.I know, I know, I should be thankful that Iâ€™m still getting a paycheck. And I am thankful when I can get my wits about me. I know Iâ€™m blessed to still have my bills paid, but my mental health is declining at a rapid pace. First it was daily anxiety attacks, then it was more frequent panic attacks. Now my weekends are wholly consumed by my depression, which has come roaring back alongside daily thoughts of suicide. This is not sustainable. Not a day goes by that I donâ€™t think of offing myself, and recently, the idea of death has an allure to it like water to someone walking in the desert. I need rest, and death is the only thing that can provide that.

I feel like my job is a meat grinder, and that Iâ€™m the meat being fed into it. Itâ€™s eventually going to kill me. Either that, or after all the coronavirus stuff Iâ€™ll get a new job and Iâ€™ll work til I die that way. Joyous.

Iâ€™m posting it here not because Iâ€™m actually going to go through with it, but because I canâ€™t tell my friends what Iâ€™m feeling. Theyâ€™ve all been fired or furloughed by now and have their own set of problems, they donâ€™t need to hear about mine. But I needed to get this out somewhere, so I hope here was okay.
