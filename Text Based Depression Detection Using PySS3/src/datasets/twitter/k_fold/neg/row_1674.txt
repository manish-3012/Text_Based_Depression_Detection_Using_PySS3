Closer and closer everydayI canâ€™t explain it. Iâ€™ve seen 3 counselor and they all make me feel like a piece of shit. Iâ€™m broke, live with my parents and am stuck at a job I hate that pays like crap. Iâ€™m stuck in a hole I canâ€™t get out of. I canâ€™t help but to cry, even at the smallest things.

Everyday I have more and more thoughts of ending it all. I have a gun loaded on my dresser. I keep staring at.
