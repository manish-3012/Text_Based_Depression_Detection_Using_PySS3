The thought of suicide is beginning to become a lot more noticeable... What's a good way to go about stopping this?I'm currently twenty, living in the U.S. and studying at a university. At the moment, I'm not close to killing myself, but I have been. I guess I'm posting this to ask for reasons to be happy. I really want to feel happy... I try, and in a lot of ways I'm good with coping. But coping takes me only so far. I'll have nights where I'll wake up terrified that I got as close to killing myself as I did.  Everything that I see as encouraging just seems to point towards the idea that, "well, you just have to cope." No matter how it's presented to me, the concept of coping isn't enough to get me out of this...it worries me more, if anything. I won't go on and on to explain why I'm suicidal, or why I, I guess, use the thought of suicide. I can't explain it all that well, anyway. At it's core, I'm just...really mentally unstable; I've honestly concluded that, at this point. Other than that, basically, I feel hopeless. I don't see the future working out for me. Each year it gets worse. This isn't missing my youth...It's more like having some deep inclination that my future will be worse...or that I'm already disappointed with the way things will turn out. I really wanted it to be happier.

In advance, thanks for the advice.

I'll be online again tomorrow morning. At the latest, tomorrow afternoon.
