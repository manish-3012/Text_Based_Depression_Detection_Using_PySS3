Iâ€™m trying to find a reason to stayIâ€™ve been in pain for a long time and over the last week almost every aspect of my life has hit a wall that seems impossible to get past. Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m going to fail every subject Iâ€™m taking this semester, my partner just showed me how I donâ€™t engage enough in her interests and how itâ€™s hurting her (often because Iâ€™m busy with uni or canâ€™t even handle myself), my transitioning has stopped working and my hormones are spiking in all the wrong ways. Itâ€™s my younger brothers 18th tonight so I want to go visit family for that but afterwards I donâ€™t feel like I have anywhere else to go or any other option to get through. Iâ€™m scared but I donâ€™t see any other way to get through it.
