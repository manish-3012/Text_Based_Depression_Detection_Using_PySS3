Hit rock bottomThe situation I find myself now is pretty unsolvable. 

I'm 30 and one month ago I lost my job. I couldn't find another and I've basically screwed up every interview I went to because of my current anxiety state.

All my friends left me (most got married, others moved on with their careers, etc). Some other people that I considered my friends stopped talking to me, certainly because depressed people are not fun to be with.

I have no love life. Hell, I don't even hope to have a love life again. Last time I heard about the girl I used to date she was laughing at my "sorry condition", calling me a "loser".

My family are a bunch of conservative religious retards who only make things worse. When they're not ignoring that something's wrong with me, they keep telling me that I should be more grateful since I do have a much better condition than, say, beggars on the street. They also keep telling me that I'm a failure at making friends, that's why everything goes wrong with me.

I have absolutely nobody to turn to. I'm dead inside already. My job was the last thread that kept me in touch with hope, and I lost it. I don't see any other solution but killing myself right now.

If you have any advice, please let me know. I don't really want to die, but I don't want to keep living like this either. I'd rather choose death than continue with my life as it is.
