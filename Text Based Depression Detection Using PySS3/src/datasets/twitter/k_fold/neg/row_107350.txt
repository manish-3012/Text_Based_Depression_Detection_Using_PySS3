I wasnâ€™t happy before this, I have no desire to live with what is coming.I have been stressed and had a hard road for the majority of my life.  But my spouse and I gave up our lives building a business to at least support our children well.  We made them our only priority.  I am lonely and depressed anyway.  Well, now we lost our business to covid.  All gone!  We will lose everything we worked for.  Canâ€™t recoup that kind of income doing anything else.  Our entire lives down the drain.  Everything gone.  I donâ€™t want to fight it.  I give up.  I do not want to live the way we will have to now.
