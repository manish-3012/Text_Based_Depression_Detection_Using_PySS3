Nothing has been ok for 10 years.I've been assaulted, physically and emotionally abused, locked in someones house, got out and became homeless in an effort to save my ass, etc, and everyday I wake up to horrible shit happening.

I just want to die.

I regret not killing myself last night, and I regret not succeeding in my suicide attempt in January. It's been 10 years and my mind hasn't skipped a beat. I want to die.  Nothing is ever ok. Nothing has been ok. I've tried so hard to do everything that I can to make it ok.  It doesn't work.


â€¢I have a job, but minimum wage can't buy a house. I'm always looking for a better job

â€¢I don't have any friends, or family that won't hurt me or wants me

â€¢I sleep in an suv


Etc.

I've done nothing but defend myself from abuse. Why am I punished for that? Why can't I ever have anything good happen to me? Why is everyone out to get me?  I know, 'not everyone is out to get you,' but it's hard to believe that when everyone makes fun of you where ever you go (from teens laughing to grown adults making loud comments about me to ensure I know that they hate me for existing). Anyone else has physically damaged me. Nothing is ok.

I've been to several therapists this year. I'm trying another, but all of them tell me they don't know what to do, in terms of traumas and phobia (I never mention that I'm homeless).


I can't do this anymore. Why can't I just have a house, apartment, or studio apartment, and have good things coming my way? I want to die. I don't want my life to be perfect, I wouldn't expect it to be. But why can't anything be ok?


Edit: I'm killing myself. Goodbye.
