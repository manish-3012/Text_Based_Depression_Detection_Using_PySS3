If I said what I'm really thinking, the police would be at my door tonight.I'm not posting here expecting any kind of help, because I don't think there's any you can give me.  I'll just vent some frustration.  I don't like people very much in general, but it makes even me sad to hear about people with all or most of the qualities and potential for a decent (or good!) life killing themselves.  Think of what came or comes to your mind when you just read "qualities and potential."  Now imagine someone who has NONE of those things and will never have any of them.  That's me.

In fact, I don't even know why I'm still alive to write these paragraphs.  It's probably a lack of one of those aforementioned qualities; courage, specifically.  I've been too cowardly up until now to do the thing I want to do most of all.  I continue waking up, eating, sleeping, and pissing simply because that's the easiest thing to do.

I've wanted to kill myself for years.  It's a very precise kind of suicidal tendency, though.  I don't mean "episodes."  I don't mean hills and valleys, emotional roller coasters.  I mean one solid block of living death.  It is me. 

This year, I am finally being forced to more decisive action than simple passive suicide.  I have thought through possible plans to make this happen and favor one in particular.  I've had years to plan this out; I wasn't in a rush. I just need the final trigger now.  I do not want to be alive to see 2013.
