When will it endEveryday I wake up telling myself I wonâ€™t fall back into these thoughts, that Iâ€™m getting better, that I wonâ€™t relapse while in reality i end up crying myself to sleep, wishing even praying to god even tho Iâ€™m not religious to kill me. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for so long I canâ€™t remember what it feels like to not be suicidal.
