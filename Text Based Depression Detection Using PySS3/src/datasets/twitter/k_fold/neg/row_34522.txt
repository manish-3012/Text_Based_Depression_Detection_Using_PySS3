maybe itâ€™s timeiâ€™m supposed to be in the prime of my life, itâ€™s all supposed to be just starting. but i feel like iâ€™ve already expired. itâ€™s always just been â€œeveryone goes through this. give it a year.â€ itâ€™s been a few years and whenever i think iâ€™ve hit rock bottom, i fall another 100 ft. iâ€™ve always had one thing, which was my brothers, but the past year or so itâ€™s been constant fighting with two, and the other two are getting married and living elsewhere. i generally have a physically hard time crying, so when iâ€™m pushed that far itâ€™s bad. on my birthday i broke down really hard and the brother im closest with saw it. itâ€™s been four months and heâ€™s still being more secretive with me and getting more upset with me than he had previously. might be a coincidence but i donâ€™t fucking know. every constant in my life is fading away, iâ€™ve been holding onto the shards of my life to try and form a reason to live but iâ€™ve about had it. my heart has been telling me to kill myself for a while, my head has only been agreeing more and more. i cant even picture myself being alive at 24 anymore. i know how i wanna do it, and i think itâ€™s time.
