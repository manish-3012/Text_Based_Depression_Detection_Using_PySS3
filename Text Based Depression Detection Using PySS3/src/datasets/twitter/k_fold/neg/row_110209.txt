I wish to be left to dieThree times have I posted. All anyone who sees it does is either make some incorrect response by saying that perhaps my family might not like this. Or hold false hope, and all they do is try and postpone it.  just take my word, this is my life to end, not yours to live. Do not attempt to talk me out of it, do not contact me, because I matter not to anyone; as a result I should be left alone to die.
