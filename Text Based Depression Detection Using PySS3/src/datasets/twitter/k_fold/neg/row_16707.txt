I relapsed after months of not binge drinking and I've been a dick to my girlfriend.In Fall/Winter of 2018, I was a terrible alcoholic. I drank every single day until I passed out and then did it again the next day. I truly wanted to die. My mom saw my problem and put me in psychiatric care, and I improved a lot over the course of 2019. 

I found a great girlfriend and life seemed to be improving at a great rate. Lately I've been so fucking depressed that I haven't been able to stop the suicidal thoughts and binge drinking. For the last month, I've been drinking and trying to hide it from my girlfriend because I feel like she would break up with me.

Today, I was supposed to hang out with my girlfriend, but instead I slept all day because I was so hungover. I feel so depressed. I'm such an asshole to my girlfriend and she doesn't deserve it. She says I'm the sweetest person on earth, and she knows about my past with alcohol struggles, but this time it's as bad as ever.

I feel like such a fucking asshole to my girlfriend for doing that. Seriously, I feel like the worst person on earth. After I woke up and texted her for a little bit, I had to start drinking again to kill the pain I felt on the inside. 

I'm so tired of being like this. I'm so tired of being like this. Every time I make a mistake, I feel like the biggest piece of shit on earth and that I don't deserve to live any more. Do I even want to live anymore? Not really. The only thing good in my life is my girlfriend and she's pissed at me after today.
