(Serious)Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts for the past 6 years but I donâ€™t think I have depression at all . Is it dangerous to think like this on a daily basis.Disclaimer : I wonâ€™t kill myself and I donâ€™t have the courage to do it 

Iâ€™ve been having these suicidal thoughts  for about 6years or so. It literally happens every day .( mostly before sleeping and waking up ) . 

But I donâ€™t think I have depression at all. Iâ€™ve done those depression questionnaire and it says I am less likely to have depression. It really bothers me 

Sorry for bed English, itâ€™s not mother language
