All gone.I've stuck it out as long as I could. Almost 30 and planning that being my last year alive. I was sexually abused as a child by multiple people and now can not have functional relationships with anyone. I trust nothing and no one and am aggressively depressed and constantly angry and hate nothing more than myself. A lot of the time I find myself genuinely wondering if what I'm experiencing is actually real and if anyone is nice to me even a cashier or something there is no doubt in my mind that someone put them up to it like the Truman show because no one in their right mind would do that to something like me. I have been in therapy for years with no result even after trying different medications and different people. I'm not supposed to exist. I have no interests, no hobbies, no friends, and do what I can to be unconcious or oblivious for the parts of the day that I'm not at work. On my 30th birthday, I think I'll finally be ready to take my last steps.
