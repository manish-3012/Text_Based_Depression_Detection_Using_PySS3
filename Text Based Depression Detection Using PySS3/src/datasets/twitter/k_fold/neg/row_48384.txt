Hi. Uplifting comments apprecieated.Hello. I don't want to talk about any reasons why I feel the way I do, I don't want to PM anybody, I don't want to be *here* anymore. The thing I want is to feel happy once again and prevent myself from tripping over the very fine line I am sitting in that is between being in this world or not. I just want any of you to make me feel a bit better. Thanks.
