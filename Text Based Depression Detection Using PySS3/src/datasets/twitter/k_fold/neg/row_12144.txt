Mom has no idea how to talk to me.I've been having really deep depression for as long as I can remember. My mom has never been good about making me feel better, she always plays the victim card and says how she has problems too and how she had to go through a lot and wont own up to her mistakes ever. 

She then proceeded to keep telling me to calm down and then said ok I'm a bad mother, I guess you wont care if commit suicide then so that makes me have to talk to her so that she'll stop.

Fuck this life. I hate every second of this.
