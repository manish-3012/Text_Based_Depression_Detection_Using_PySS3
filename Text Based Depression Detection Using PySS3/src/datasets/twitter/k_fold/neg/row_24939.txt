Iâ€™m just so tiredIâ€™m tired of being such a burden to everyone in my life. My toddler deserves a much better mother than I could ever be for her and at this point I just feel guilty and selfish for bringing her into this world only for me to so desperately want to leave it all the time. Iâ€™m a stay at home mom and my only contact with the outside world is my boyfriend who just yells at me everyday. He deserves a much better partner. No friends to talk to and everyone in my family agrees Iâ€™m my parents least favorite kid. I used to have hobbies and interests but honestly I canâ€™t bring myself to do anything because there just isnâ€™t a point. Nothing makes me happy except for my kid and itâ€™s not fair to her to be the thing responsible for tethering me to life. I make everyone around meâ€™s lives worse and I bring out the worst in everything. I never went to college because I always assumed I wouldnâ€™t live long enough for it to matter. So now Iâ€™m 24 with no job, no money, and no insurance for any sort of help. The only reason I havenâ€™t offed myself already is because I donâ€™t want to live through a botched attempt and bankrupt my family with medical bills. I just donâ€™t want to be in so much pain anymore.
