I am just existing, not living.I am 16 years old.

I am now "working" as a freelancer on one website. But problem is, I feel like freelancing isn't for me, and I live in Ukraine.

In Ukraine, minimal jobs are barely enough to pay for food, living and college. Adding mental illnesses on top, I am a waste of space.

Yes. I am a waste of space.

I am sick and tired of people telling me "no you're not" and constantly sugarcoating it, when they don't know what I am really going through. These quotes on the internet even tho tell me that I am a good person, deep down I still know that I am not, and I am just running away from my life problems.

The reason why I think freelancing is bad because to me, it seems too chaotic and disorganized. I thought it was amazing, because yay! you get to work all you want, it is like a game, just look for what you are talented lololol... 

On top of that my parents complain how much I cost to them. Well, you chose to bring a child into this world...
