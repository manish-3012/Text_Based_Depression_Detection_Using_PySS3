Is it dumb to want to do it because I canâ€™t get a job?To give some background, Iâ€™ve been poor my whole life. My parents are immigrants who donâ€™t know the language. I have no connections, and I was always the loser kid. Now Iâ€™m 22 and back with my parents in this decrepit box we call a house. It gets to near freezing because we donâ€™t have insulation nor central heating. Because I was a loser, I never got the chance to develop social skills, so I now donâ€™t have friends. I canâ€™t speak my parentsâ€™ language as well as I do English, so I canâ€™t speak with them without feeling awkward about it because I sound retarded when I do. What do I do? Itâ€™s been months since I left school and being in this stuffy room with only room for me to get from the bed and to the door is driving me actually insane. The only thing that makes me feel better is driving, but I canâ€™t buy gas without a job.
