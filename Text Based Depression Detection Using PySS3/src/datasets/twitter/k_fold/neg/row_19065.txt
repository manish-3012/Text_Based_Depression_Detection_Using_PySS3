Do I actually want sympathy whenever I crave for suicide?I just think about the things I am going through and it just depresses me and I just cry. I feel suicidal but I also feel like I need someone to talk to freely. 

I do have a girlfriend/partner but I don't feel like telling her anything. She is just a precense in my life. I don't feel attached to her in any way. 

I imagine me telling my troubles to someone and then crying out loud. And just want to scream and cry. 

I am just tearing up typing this shit and I am already feeling stupid. I hate myselfffffffff..

Is it just sympathy that I am craving?  Sorry guys, don't feel to type anything here. I just wanted to vent out
