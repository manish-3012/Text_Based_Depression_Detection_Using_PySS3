i have never felt that emptymy best friend is in hospital because of me. he said if i dont put down the knife he will jump out of the window. he did. now he recovers in hospital. and i just feel nothing. nothing at all. when i close my eyes all i see is myself sleeping in a grave and never wakeing up again. i lost every hope and i cant imagine anything giving me back feelings. im so tired and empty. i dont know what to do anymore. it feels like im just standing here like a statue while time flies by. in over 10 years of depression, suicidal thoughts etc i have never felt... like i do since a week. i dont feel like im alive anymore. like im a human. i cut myself and i had so make sure that im actually cutting. because i barely felt it. this is hell on earth. because im never out of crazy ideas. but now i feel like im already dead. it feels like right now im dreaming.
