I'm almost done with itSome words about me :
I'm 22 yo male from Poland, depressed since I can't remember and social at least since I was 13 yo. First time I tasted a beer when I was around 8, first cigarette at 10, first try with amphetamines and cocaine at the age of 13, when I was 14 I got sexually assaulted by old male stranger and I was too afraid to tell anyone and since I was 16 I keep smoking and whenever I have access to hard drugs I'll do anything to get them and keep myself from sobering. A couple of time i didn't sleep for like a week straight. Since I was 7 or 8 I think till I was 16 I saw my parents every day drunk and I've had to take care for myself, them and animals (we lived on a small farm). It got better only because I told them that if they won't change a soon as I'll be 18 yo I'll move out to another country and forget about them. I have only 1 sister 3 years older than me who used to be a very good sister to me but when she became a teen she just forgot about me. She becase rebel and I've had to be the "Good child" who's always there, always helpful, happy, well mannered etc. I didn't really have a friend till I was 16 and changed school and before that I was bullied by everyone, everyday and I've had nobody to help me out. When I found my first friend at 16 yo I was sure - I'm gay and I have to hide it from everyone. I just became more depressed and suicidal because of it. Skipping a couple of years my friend broker my heart many time without knowing I'm gay, I moved out to another country and became more lonely, got in debt in bank, came out to couple of my friends that I'm gay, almost tried to kill myself a couple of times and abused hard drugs. I've been trying to find myself a boyfriend because I don't care anymore what others will think but I keep having bad luck. I think that I'm the reason I'm so fucked up and only because of me everything bad happens to me and I can't help it.  I'm going to give myself one more year to try some other stuff and if nothing will change I'll kill myself on Christmas 2021. It's my first post anywhere ever and it might be my last one
