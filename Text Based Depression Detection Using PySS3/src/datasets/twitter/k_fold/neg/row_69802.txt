feel like my â€œproblemsâ€ are made up by myselffor the last two or so years Itâ€™s been hard to feel even the slightest bit of happiness. I know there are many different ways to get help, and Iâ€™ve already gotten a therapist but I feel weird and believe my problems are fake and that other people think I am â€œsadâ€ for attention. Idk what to do anymore I canâ€™t help but think how much easier everything would be if I just.. did it. No more stress and no more worryâ€™s. All the shit that has bothered me and continues to bother me will be dead. Finally I wonâ€™t feel emotion. Iâ€™ll be able to be completely empty in the afterlife. Even though I can think of all of these pros to be dying I canâ€™t help but know my parents would be devastated if I was gone. Fuck. Any way I go has problems. Wtf do I even do anymore
