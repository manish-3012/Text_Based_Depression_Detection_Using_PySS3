I feel very ill but I'm too depressed to do anything about itI feel like I'm dying; like I have some serious illness that's sucking the life out of me. I'm pretty sure it's kidney disease as I had a kidney stone about 2 years ago which resulted in an infection and 3 rounds of antibiotics to no avail. 

I have eaten about 4 meals in the past 4 days. "Meal" is generous, a bowl of oatmeal. I'm 6'1 and weigh 122 pounds right now. I feel so weak and tired like I'm wasting away. 

I don't have the willpower to do anything about it. I should go to the hospital and get blood work/urinalysis done but I'm just sitting here on my computer like I have been for years doing nothing.

I think I'm scared that I might actually have something seriously wrong. I don't know how to face it if I do. I just feel like giving up. Honestly, I gave up years ago and I'm just barely surviving now.
