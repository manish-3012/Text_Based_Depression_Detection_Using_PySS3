The creator of the universe hates meOkay. I'm 19. Pregnant. Depressed. I fucking hate babies. I didn't plan this at all. I'm 33 weeks along. I took plenty of tests before and they were all negative. I never had any symptoms. The nurse said to just wait it out, and I did until April when I found out. Ever since then, I have contemplated on killing myself. Giving birth is going to kill me, so why not just end my life now? I don't give a fuck about the baby, who is going to be put up for adoption. My boyfriend, the father, is being supportive through this, but that doesn't really help me. Everyday, I wake up to the fucking baby kicking and I want to hit it so hard, but I can't. I just stay in bed crying and thinking, 'Why me? Out of all the people in the world, why me?' I stay in bed the whole day and sleep. I don't eat as much as I used to. Why feed the monster inside of me when it's causing me so much suffering? It doesn't deserve love. I fucking hate this. I am so tempted to kill myself soon.
