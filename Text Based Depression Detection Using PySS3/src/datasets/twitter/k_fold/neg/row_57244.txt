I will do it one day.I personally think my suicide is set to happen. Like I know Iâ€™m gonna do it bc I donâ€™t see another way out of my misery no matter how hard I try. I know Iâ€™ll always be under my abusive mothers control and everyday she gives me more reasons to end it. And recently I am at a point where I wanna commit suicide to hurt her, not bc I hate her but bc I want her to feel the pain that she puts me through on a daily basis. I donâ€™t think anything would hurt her as much as losing me, losing her precious, obedient kid. I know that will leave a painful scar. I also know sheâ€™ll never blame herself bc she doesnâ€™t see how depressed sheâ€™s made me for every day of my life and she doesnâ€™t believe in mental health but I know sheâ€™ll feel my pain.
