Transgender MtF SuicideIâ€™m an MtF transgendered person in the middle of finally making my transition, but due to an inescapable feeling of helplessness and a lack of support from loved ones, Iâ€™m feeling ready to end my life.

It is something I have thought about nonstop for years, and I know that no matter what hormones I take or what surgeries I have, I will never feel fully at home in my body. So why continue to put up with all the pain, hurt, judgement, and emptiness?

I know there are people who love me, and I donâ€™t want to hurt them. They know Iâ€™m suicidal, but donâ€™t know how serious I am about seeing it through. If it werenâ€™t for the fear of making their lives harder, I would have killed myself long ago. How can I assure them that this is truly the best option for me? 

I know this is rambling and I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting here, but maybe thereâ€™s an answer out there somewhere for me.
