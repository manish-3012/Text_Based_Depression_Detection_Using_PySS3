Seriously depressed, need help.The long and short of it is that I just can't stand to live anymore. I'm a failure, over-stressed, going through so many things at once that are either personal or involve others and I just feel so bogged down. I can't do it anymore - well... I can but I dont want to. I have no good reason to anymore. I need a break...to just lay down and sleep and not have to worry about getting up in the morning or crying myself to sleep every night. If you can quit life, then thats just what I want to do.
