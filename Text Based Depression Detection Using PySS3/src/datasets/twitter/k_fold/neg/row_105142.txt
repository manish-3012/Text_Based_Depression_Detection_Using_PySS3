Maybe I wasn't meant to be hereMeds don't work, meditation doesn't work, can't get weed bc of my parents, music doesn't work. The mental hospital doesnt work.can't talk to girls at all. I'm a 18 year old kissless virgin. I have no friends. The only thing that helps is cutting. I can barely concentrate. I'm going to college soon and I have no idea what I wanna study. If college doesn't get any better bullet to the brain. Sorry it's my only choice.
