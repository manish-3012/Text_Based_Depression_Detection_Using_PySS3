i feel like a junkie...hi...
i am a male (15 years old) i live in an appartment building alone with my dad, mom seperated. i have a ps3 and computer, i play my favourite video game ever on it( Diablo 3) i go to high school (grade 8) i have failed two years already, grade five and grade 8. i am only allowed to play during the weekend, weekdays are innegociable. i am a huge gamer, i hate school so bad, my ipod was recently stolen and my dad was very upset for me not telling him right away, and there was some misunderstanding with him and now hes unhappy for a few days and more to come. basiclly, as things stand, i am living for 8 days out of a month. the rest is just prison. call of duty black ops 2 just came out today, and of course i was not allowed to play. so i snuck the game out the house to my friends house whos mom didnt want me in (new friend, his mom wants to know me better first) so i just hung out with him. when i came back my dad found out i snuck the game out and now... he's lost all confidence,trust,will,and care for me. i feel like the source of pure guilt, and my dad has a horribly social attitude which is already slowly killing me internaly. what the fuck do i do? should i visit the after life since life seems so... uninteresting, i mean i wish i could enjoy the weekdays but, theres nothing to want to do. help? please? thanks alot in advance, ill be waiting.
