I have been thinking about killing myself for a nonsense reasonI have cistitis pf repetition. I have been a year with It and i am scared because the symptoms don't go. The doctors say that I am ok but the last four months I only can think that I am tired of being afraid for my health, that i am going to die and that I should kill myself now so I don't have to deal with that situation. I know that I am overreacting. Now I am ok I can have a total normal life there are a lot of people that have the same problem and people with serious ilnness and aren't as "depressed" as I am but I don't know why I am facing this that bad. I usted to think about how many pills i need, where i am going to do It, etc. Thinking about It makes me feel peaceful but at the same time scares me because I don't want to go to that point.
