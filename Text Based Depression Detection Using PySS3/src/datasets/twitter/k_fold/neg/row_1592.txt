I want to go so badBut I can't leave my boyfriend and cats.

I experienced a lot of trauma during childhood that still affects me each day. My dad also killed himself when I was a toddler. My mom and everyone who raised me are now shunning me because I decided I didn't want to be a Jehovah's Witness anymore. I lost all of those people at once. I have chronic mental and physical illnesses. I'm in pain physically and mentally every day. I haven't been able to get or keep a job since the cleaning job I had for several years but I lost that when I moved away to a different city. I'm relying on other people to live. I'm extremely underweight and its so hard to get myself to eat unless I'm medicated. Even then I don't enjoy my meals, trying to choke it down past the anxious knot in my throat. I hate my body, I look like a skeleton. My teeth are in poor condition as I have problems with neglect. I'm a joke to my peers. It feels like people around me just see a loser when they look at me. I'm 29 and have no accomplishments to feel proud of.

I want to be a source of love and light to the people around me but this weight is so heavy. I'm in such a selfish place and I feel so guilty for that.

I think about ending it a lot. But I am afraid I will survive and have to face people being disappointed in me. Or if I don't survive what that will do to my partner. I know how much this kind of loss hurts. I feel trapped.
