Iâ€™ve been so anxious lately and everything feels like itâ€™s crashing down around me. I feel like Iâ€™m failing myself and I donâ€™t know what to do.I know my life isnâ€™t actually going terribly but I canâ€™t shake the feeling that Iâ€™m failing myself. There are things I want to accomplish but lately Iâ€™ve barely been able to function. Iâ€™m so sick of pretending like everything is fine. So many people rely on me to help them but Iâ€™m struggling to help myself. I want time to fix myself but I canâ€™t because I have so much shit I have to tend to in my life. People always say suicide isnâ€™t a viable option, but I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. I donâ€™t feel like I fit into my own life, like Iâ€™m an imposter. I doubt anyone would actually miss me if I was gone. Maybe thatâ€™s not true but I canâ€™t shake that thought.
