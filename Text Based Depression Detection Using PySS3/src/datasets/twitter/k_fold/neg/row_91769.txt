Thinking about giving upSo I really screwed myself. I am going to completely fail a class I can't drop. I have tried moving heaven and earth to get out of this class but nothing can be done. I feel like I've ruined my future. I'm supposed to be transferring soon but I think that's all over. I've essentially lived for my GPA. It was one of the only things keeping me going, but now I'm so lost. I want to end it all even though I know it's stupid and selfish. I can't talk to anyone about this and it's eating me alive.  I don't know how long I can keep going anymore. I just want to sleep forever.
