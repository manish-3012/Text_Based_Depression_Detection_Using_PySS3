everynight it's the sameEveryday is the same, I wake up, groggy, after taking too many xanax to help me sleep, dragging myself to the living room contemplating going into work but then secretly staying home and working, stressed, sad, just frustrated at these angry customers that keep coming in nonstop. I'm sick of customer service. Metrics changing, worsening, they are expecting so much from us yet my brain is breaking, my depression worsens, and i want to die. 

I slowly take more and more medication everyday, more antidepressants, double dosing myself, double dosing my antianxiety, double dosing my hypertension and high blood pressure medicine. I just want to die in my sleep, i dont want to wake up anymore I don't want to keep having to try and fail in this life.

I'm so lost, everyone is so lost, im not important, im just another sad fat guy who wants to die, so why should i keep living? i have seldom few that care about me that love me but i dont even love myself, i hate myself. 

I'm trying to get out of this job and better myself but there isnt another job for me that i can afford this rent, why did i move.

i shouldve stayed and died in dallas, i shouldnt have gotten into a long distance relationship and dragged him down with me, i cant stand living anymore, i cant stand this job.

i want to be better but i cant, i cant get a new job because i have no other skills, im scared to take a chance because what if it doesnt work out again? because life hasnt gotten better so why not just fucking die.

I'm trying to break into streaming but im boring and ugly why would anyone watch me be bad at video games, im not entertaining, its just going to take to long to even build a following if that is even possible. i need a change now

i cant keep doing this i dont even know if i dont want to be depressed, i dont know if i know how not to be

i dont know 

its 3 am and im not excited for when work starts, too many xanax to help me try and sleep, maybe i wont wake up
