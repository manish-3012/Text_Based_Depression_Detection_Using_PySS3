I badly hurt my boyfriend and can't live with the guilt.Full story is here https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/59qnym/consent_i_16f_think_i_might_have_raped_my/

The short version is I raped my boyfriend a few days ago. Didn't mean to but it happened. This is one of the cases where suicide would be inarguably selfish, but I can't help but think about it. I'm a complete mess, I've been breaking down crying, having panic attacks that seem to last forever. I was suicidal before this, but managing. Made it to over half a year since my last attempt. I've never amounted to much but the main thing I live by is trying to be a good person. Mental illness is keeping my from doing jackshit but this is the least I expect of myself. And now I failed it. I didn't just hurt someone, I hurt someone I love more than anything in the world. And badly. I've gone through the same thing which just makes it worse. I feel like I deserved it now, and that I'm not allowed to struggle with it anymore since I did the same thing to someone else. I've been through wanting to rip my skin off because I felt so dirty, taking burning hot shower to try to burn the filth I felt off. I've been through trying to kill myself because I felt I was ruined and no longer had a place in this world. And now I've inflicted that pain on someone else. He's told me about how he feels dirty and ruined now. And scared of me. I can't hide my guilt from him, and how much I hate myself, meaning he ends up having to help me rather than me helping him. I'm just making this about myself because I'm a horrible person. I don't know what to do. It's taking everything I have not to just kill myself right this second. 
I just want to make this all go away and I can't. I can't even take back what I did. No matter what I do I'll never be a good person again, I'm a rapist for life now. 

I'm sorry if this is hard to read or doesn't make much sense, my head is all over the place right now and I'm on the verge of a panic attack.
