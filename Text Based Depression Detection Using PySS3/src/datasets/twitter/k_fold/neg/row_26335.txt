I hate my sexuality and want to dieI'm a guy and am attracted to both guys and girls
But all my life I've always wanted to share my life with a woman. 

I'll never be able to have a normal relationship with a woman because of this. I'll never be happy and want to die. There is no point in this. It's just living in misery because I can't obtain what I most desire. 

This is pure hell. I hate life.
