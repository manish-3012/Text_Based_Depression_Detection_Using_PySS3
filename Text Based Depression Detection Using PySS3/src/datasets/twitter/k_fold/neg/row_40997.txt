Childhood feeling died 3 years ago.It was all i enjoyed in my life. It has always been there, since the beggining, but it decided to leave me at the age of 13. (Or it died) and now i see the world as a boring meaningless existence. Cant have my dream job. Can't achieve this, that. I sometimes imagine having a peaceful home, and a great big field yard, but i will have to fucking work my ass off everyday, every second. So it would be pointless.

Childhood feeling made me feel like i was in a dream. Such happiness, and a mysterious feeling. There is no way i could feel it for sure. It gets worse year by year. I become even more feeling less, to the point where i am just so fucking careless. To commit anything illegal, hurt myself badly, die. It no longer scares me. Shoving a fork in the outlet doesn't scare me. I just think... "this is just how it is" 

So on September... if my sister doesn't get any shrooms, lsd, dmt. I will kill myself for sure. 
Edibles made me feel amazing last summer, but i've been too long sober, that drugs don't even feel like a good idea, but that is a lie of my mind.
