My health just continues to fail just like everything alwAys doesUndiagnosed, untreated except for my Cymbalta prescription. I went to the cardiologist for heart issues and they found nothing, but I am still in so much pain. A mix of working, anxiety, genetics and bad life style choices, I think I am dying young bye no choice.

Heart disease. Depression. Crippling Anxiety.

They all mix and thatâ€™s how this shit is created. People donâ€™t think about their choices, like me, and by the time itâ€™s too late you see what youâ€™ve been doing wrong, but you canâ€™t help yourself so youâ€™re just struggling, suffering to survive.

I think 2019 is my last year of life.
