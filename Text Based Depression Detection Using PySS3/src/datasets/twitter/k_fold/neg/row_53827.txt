I need help and I don't know how to get it.I don't know how people go about getting help for social anxiety. I can't make a phone call, definitely can't walk in anywhere and even if I managed to find a therapist, I don't think I could handle talking about myself for any length of time. I went to a couple sessions in high school and it didn't help because I couldn't figure out how to say what I needed to say. Plus I can't afford it. 

I'm starting to think suicide is my only option. If I can't get help,  I'm never going to be able to function as a contributing member of society. I don't know what to do.
