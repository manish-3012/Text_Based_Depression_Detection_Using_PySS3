i feel so weak and pathetici just hate myself so much. iâ€™ve been having to live somewhere i canâ€™t be myself, speak how i want, dress how i want, live how i want, etc my whole life. i wanted more than anything to leave here but i got so sick at 12 and iâ€™m 22 now and still sick and just keep getting more diagnoses and things wrong with me. it just keeps piling on. my parents are abusive and extremely controlling. i feel ill never leave here. i hate being manipulated and i hate hearing yelling and fighting. i tried to work when i was younger to leave here but i just made my health worse. iâ€™m trying to get disability to leave, but itâ€™s a process and i donâ€™t wanna be living in this house during the process. i canâ€™t take it any longer. when i was younger every birthday i just promised myself to go another 6 months and see if things get better. they never did. i wanna leave but i have no where to go. 
i also just hate myself so much. i feel so ugly. i hate my body and everything about me. i hate my voice, i hate things iâ€™ve done or said. i feel like iâ€™m a terrible person for things iâ€™ve done to live.. i know theres people in society who would say i shouldnâ€™t even exist because iâ€™m not contributing.. and i agree for myself.. i never shouldâ€™ve been born and i wish i never was
