What is wrong with me?Everything hurts, but the pain is so far removed. I've been walking in a place of darkness for so long I can't even remember the light, and I just.. can't be alone anymore. I do reach out. I try. I try to be a person, to find faith in the people around me, but no one even sees me. I can't find a job, I can't take care of my child - who is severely handicapped - I can barely force myself out of bed. I can't sleep, but I can't wake up. I am so horribly, painfully lonely.

I watch the people who have hurt me, broken my heart, I watch them thrive, be happy, be content the moment I'm out of their lives. My best "friends" speak horribly behind my back, and no one genuinely wants me around, excepting my child, who deserves none of the hurt I find myself blaming him for. My family just reminds me that I'm fat, that I'm not good enough, that I'm broken. My mother took custody of my son away. I have nothing. I am nothing. And for the first time in years...I want to give up.

Obviously, I'm posting here, I want talked out of it. I think I just want to believe anyone could care about the girl who sits alone, all day, all night, staring at walls and drowning in hopelessness. Please help me. Please just... care enough to be there. Anyone. Someone. Please?
