I want to kill myself but I donâ€™t want to abandon my dogWell, I have had past suicide attempts and my last one was 5 years ago. All it did was teach me what I could do to be successful next time. I have not done anything significant in my life. My father is in prison and my stepdad molested me for almost my entire childhood and then later died. I joined the military to try and find some meaning in my life and have a sense of â€œfamily.â€ But, I ended up being raped and came back â€œhome.â€ I was homeless and ended up becoming an addict and then fell into several abusive relationshipsâ€”just ending my last one in August. I am living in a shelter and all I want to do is get high one last time. My family is distant and has disowned me from making sexual assault accusations and becoming an addict. I donâ€™t have a job and I have absolutely no friends. All I have in this world that has meaning is my dog. He is the only thing that has kept me going for the last 2 years and now I feel ready to leave. He is staying with my abusive ex while Iâ€™m living in this shelter and although I hate him, I know he would take care of my dog. He loved my dog more than he ever loved me. I am just afraid that my dog will think I abandoned him. But maybe he wonâ€™t care or notice at all? As long as he is getting love, exercise, and enrichment as always, he may not even notice I ever left. 

Iâ€™m not even sad anymore, Iâ€™ve just accepted my life for what it is and has beenâ€”a waste. I know my life will never amount to anything because of my past choices and I have accepted that. I know that I am a disappointment and failure and highly doubt that anyone would miss me or anything. Iâ€™m not even sure if anyone would notice. I was forced to attend a suicide prevention class today for veterans and it just made me aware of the things I should hide from other people so I donâ€™t tip them off. I truly hate myself and Iâ€™m ashamed of who I am. Not seeking help, just wanted to say how I feel and donâ€™t have anyone to listen.
