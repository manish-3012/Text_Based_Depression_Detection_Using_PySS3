AloneHouse to myself. I truly feel like giving up. I am in so much pain. I am suffering in silence. I just want to feel something. I hate going on like this. I am in desperate need of warmth. I am scared of what I will become in the future. My life will be meaningless and I will pay the price at the end. I feel deprived and depraved. I want this nightmare to stop be the only way out is a bullet. I just want to breakdown.
