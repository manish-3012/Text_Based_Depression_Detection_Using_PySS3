I think I may have given two men I'm sleeping with a sti (herpes) neither of them are single and I've potentially ruined their relationships- not something I ever wanted to do. I've already taken the pills. I don't want to be alive if it definitely turns out I did give them it.One of the men knows shit about me that could ruin my life if it got out and if it turns out I have given him herpes, I wouldn't be surprised if he told anyone who would listen all about me. My life would be over. I'm fully aware I bought this on myself.

I just wanted to get this off my chest.
