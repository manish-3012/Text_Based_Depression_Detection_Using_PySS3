So my ex-fiancee is now using dating sites againAn update to my original post (to get the full context of this post read my original in my profile). Literally a week after our relationship ended (or a couple of months if you're her), I made the foolish decision to check the dating site we met on out to see if she created a new account. Turns out she has. I had to know. 

I feel so fucking hurt and betrayed. This is the final straw. I cannot cope with life anymore. I know that what I did was wrong, but it feels like I'm being punished for having depression. I'm not exactly capable of rational thought. I just don't care anymore. My life just keeps getting worse by the day. If she is willing to do that to me then she never cared about me at all. All I ever did was love her and despite what she may think, I did care about her.

She was with her ex for three years before she left him. He treat her like shit. Took all her money off her, made he mouldy bread because he wouldn't go to the shop and wouldn't spend any time with her at all. We were together two years and she's broken up with me because of my depression. This is why I can't open to people because they just hurt me. 

Screw it, I think this might be my last day. I can't take anymore.
