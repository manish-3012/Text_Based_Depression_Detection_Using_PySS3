Want to kill myselfI can't find reasons to live. I have friends, yet always feel lonely, and there aren't any problems at my house. I just want to stop living, and I've never been as close as today. I'm probably not depressed, I just feel a permanent sadness in my life, like every day is just a net loss for everyone around me, including me
