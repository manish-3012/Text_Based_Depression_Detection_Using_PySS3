Found out I only got my job because of unwitting nepotismI'm 19, and don't have much. I've been working a retail job for over a year now. It's not a lot, mostly cleaning and it's minimum wage, but i'm not particularly smart, have asd and adhd and was really proud of having a job of my own. Today I found out that it was only through nepotism, that my Grandmother's friend is the owner of the company, is the reason I was hired. 

I never asked for this, my parents knew I would be too proud to go through with it so they lied to me and never mentioned the fact. When I confronted them they told me that this was how things work. 

I have never felt so humilated in my life. Any sense of self-esteem I previously held, which wasn't a lot in the first place, is in ruins. I really thought I had accomplished something. And now it makes sense that they never fired me even after I fucked up so many times, and why the management was so patient with me. 

I have quit my job and seriously want to kill myself now. I have no close friends, no hobbies or skills. Nothing to look forward to in life. Even my parents admit i'll probably spend my 20s celibate.
