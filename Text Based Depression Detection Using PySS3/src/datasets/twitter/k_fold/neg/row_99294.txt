no one cares anymore.i feel like this is where my life ends. i used to have a lot of people caring nd always asking me if i'm doing okay. now i have ruined that and no one asks me if i'm doing okay. is it wrong to have someone telling me that i will not be alone? is it wrong of me wanting someone to care? every day it gets worse. i try to ignore all the bad stuff that's been happening lately. school is not going well, the relationship with my parents will never be okay and i begin to hate myself again. i thought i would never go back to the self hating but here i am once again. i don't see anything good in my life anymore i wish i just died
