I'm going to die anyway, why not now.I'm terrible at putting all the shit that's in my head into words and i feel like i won't get how i feel across but i'm out of options.

Firstly, i'm 17, I live in the UK and currently go to college.

I can't help but angry with myself for feeling like this, i have a great family and what others would see as a good life, i look through alot of posts on /r/SW just to find someone who is going through the same and see if anyone has anything helpful to say about them and i see people who are abused and things like that, my pain must seem like nothing in comparison.

My grades at college are terrible, exams are coming up, i'm extremely unprepared. I don't enjoy many things anymore. As soon as i leave college my parents expect me to get a job new job since the one i have now is only part-time which really stresses me out, i'm very shy so the mere thought of having to meet and impress new people scares me. I'm a homosexual (Not Openly) with no means to come out and see it more of a burden than just a part of me. I spend most days worrying about the next and often stay up late at night unable to sleep, and cry, just thinking of the inevitable reality of my failure - even now i'm crying as i write this. Why would i want to live just to fail and struggle, i could easily swallow as many pills possible, or to sit in the bath and cut myself until i can't keep my eyes open. That pain seems much easier to take than living a broken life or to watch my family and friends die, death seems much more peaceful and the route i'm more likely to take than life.

Sorry for the huge block of text.
