I can't do this anymore.hi. I'm David, 16 years old. I have a form of clinical depression, that my psychiatrists call 'Drastic'. I constantly think about suicide, and when I am not, I am thinking about murder. I hallucinate imaginary things, and wish brutal and merciless torture on people who have done very little wrong to me. I am insane, and I can't handle it anymore.

My mother beat me daily, and CPS never believed me, as she always put on a 'nice girl' facade. Eventually I was able to trick my father into moving with him, even though he didn't believe me either. He still makes me see my mother from time to time, and it still happens when I go over.

The stress forced me away from school. I was physically incapable of going to school, and when I did show up, I could never do any work. I had such a bad social persona, that I couldn't make friends. I was never taught about any form of social life. I ended up failing 9th grade, gaining zero credits.

I was in 10th grade. Halfway through, I didn't know how or what to do, and I got called into the office. They told me I had to go to a military school, or I had no hope of graduation. I took the military school route, and dropped out of public school.

A few months ago, I was hopeless. Rock bottom, miserable. I had nothing. I was bored, and started to skip rocks across a parking lot. Gave me some mild entertainment. One rock accidentally broke a window. It was a public building, so I tried to look for a number to notify somebody of it. Ten minutes later, I was beaten, ripped apart by an attack dog, and tossed into one of 5 squad cars. I was apparently breaking and entering. I was only charged with vandalism. I can't go to military school anymore.

I started to look for a job to pay off the vandalism fine. That was two months ago. I have sent out over 250 job applications. I have gotten two interviews. No jobs.

I am nothing but a failure. It would be so easy just to end all of this, but I'm either too cheap or too much of a bitch to do it.
