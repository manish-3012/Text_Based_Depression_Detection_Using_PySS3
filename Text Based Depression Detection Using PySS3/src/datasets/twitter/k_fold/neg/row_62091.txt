16, with a criminal record...So I now have a criminal record, it's all my fault. I have been told time and time again that criminal records pretty much destroy any chances of getting a good job, and I looked it up, there are basically no chances. I was already considering suicide before I did get my record, no prison time for me, just a massive fine (I have no money, so parents have to pay it). I was so stupid and immature, I just wanted attention, I am not that popular and I saw an opportunity. I am already really shy, and I don't generally talk to anyone unless they are one of my few friends. I have never had a girlfriend or even talked to one because I just lack the confidence, and they all probably think of me as some evil lifeless loser because of what I did. I also have trouble concentrating in my classes and get really bad grades, I lack the motivation to do it. I will never be loved, I will never be successful, a lot of people hate me for what I did and I have really bad teeth from lack of proper care because I'm just careless. I don't know what to do anymore...
