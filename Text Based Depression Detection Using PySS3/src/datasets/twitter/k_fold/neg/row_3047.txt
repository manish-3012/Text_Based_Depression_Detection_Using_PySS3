Thanks for the postsI've been surfing these topics here for a while now looking for something. Although I honestly don't know what I've exactly been looking for.. strength? Courage? Hope? Who knows..

Nothing makes sense when your world is collapsing in itself. I decided a long time ago I would take an early leave, the follow through is what takes time. Theres so many things to consider and the longer your in this hole the more you realize all those things running through your mind don't seem to matter anymore. I wondered how this would affect my friends and family, how my actions would burden them. But eventually I realized it would be best for them, it would be best for me. 

Researching to get everything right. Not to fuck it up. Not to be around to regret my actions. To be 100% certain this is what I want and that there's no coming back from this. I can't tell you what a fucking relief it is to be certain.

I just wanted to say something to someone. Just to be able to say something about this even if the audience is composed of people who don't know me. Thank you for that. I enjoyed the posts, it kept me around longer than expected.
