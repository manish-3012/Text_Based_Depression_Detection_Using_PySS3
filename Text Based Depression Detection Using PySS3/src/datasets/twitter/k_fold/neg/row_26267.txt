I don't know what to do anymoreI've tried getting advice a couple of times from /r/depression and my posts got no responses. I'm honestly considering suicide because of the situation in my life right now.  Simply put, I am being blackmailed for NSFW things I've done online involving other friends, and the one blackmailing me was someone who I thought I trusted but who I think got jealous when I told him about things I was doing with other people.  In essence, he's threatening to out me out to my real life friends about what I do, things that I feel would make my friends never want to associate with me ever again.  This group of friends are the only real group of friends that I have, but I'm not denying that what I've done would be seen as extremely weird from their point of view.  I'm being forced to ignore people I like talking to and associating with, and I feel like I'm being a bad person by cutting them out of my life with no explanation.  I'm at a loss for what to do and I'm having panic attacks thinking about what will happen if he decides to show my friends what I've done.  There's no chance I'm comfortable talking about my situation with on-campus resources, and have no one to turn to if everything goes wrong.  I'm not sure if I should cut my losses and deal with my depression until it gets better or if I should just end it all now.  I've never thought about suicide seriously until this moment, and I'm honestly so lost.  I don't know why I'm even posting here because I feel there's nothing I can do anymore.  Either I lose a friend and someone I care about, or have my secret revealed to my friends who will never be able to look at me the same way again.
