My existance is so stupid.It is. 

I might as well just be dead. 

I don't have any face to face friends. So, I won't be missed. My dad barely talks to me and my mother is just a full on nut case. 

So, I won't be missed very much. And the little bit that I am, well maybe that will be punishment for the bullshit that they put me through. 

I'm so tired of waking up in the morning and then hearing the words later that day, "You are fat." "You are ugly." etc... Everything is about my looks. I don't ever hear anything positive about myself. My confidence is shit. My self image is even more shit. 

I came to reddit a long time ago, to see if i could make some friends as well as use it as a distraction and an escape. 

Well, I got myself caught up in some stuff and got myself banned from a sub I used to escape into. So, there went that. 

I left reddit for a while and then came back. And tried my luck again with finding some friends. But, no one talks to me for a long time. It hurts. 

My birthday is next week. And this is always a really hard time for me. I mean a really hard time. 

Every year something really bad has happened on my birthday. 

Five years ago my mom told me about her and dad getting a divorce. And then the next year, he got me some really nice gifts. She broke them and stole the money he gave me because, "That was her money for all of the years he lied to her." 

So, that was more important to her. Getting what she can out of him and then calling me things like the devil offspring, because he is my dad. 

I think, to get back at her, I'm going to kill myself on my birthday. I have a few methods already planned out. Quick methods. 

Because, I just can't take it anymore.
