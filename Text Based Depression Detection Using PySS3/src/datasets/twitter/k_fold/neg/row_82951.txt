I don't even care if I get taken advantage of anymoreReddit has been trying to convince me that I got raped the other night and I don't even have any reaction to it. I drank and hung out with my toxic ex because I somehow thought we could be friends. What did I expect? I do stupid things all the time just so I can feel something. I already know that no one cares about my feelings or well being, and I've accepted that. I make the conscious decisions to let people treat me however they want to and that's my fault. I don't give a shit about myself so why should anyone else? I just wish I'd die already.
