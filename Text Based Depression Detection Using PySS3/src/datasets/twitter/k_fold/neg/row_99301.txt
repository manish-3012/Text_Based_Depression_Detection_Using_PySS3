I wish I could just stop thinkingI've never posted here before and I don't know why I am now. 
I dont want to waste anyone's time here so think of this as just me talking to myself. 

Im seeking medical help after realising I can't do this alone anymore,  im on a second medication after the first made me so much worse where I couldn't stop crying whenever I started. 

I've always wanted to kill myself since my teenage years, im now 29. There has been times its not been so hard but I can't remember a day I haven't thought of it.

I can be walking down the street and thoughts just pop in my head of jumping infront of an oncoming truck or whatever it may be.
Never acting on it but I just feel so tormented by my own mind that some days its too much and I can't get out of bed.

I lay here right now after being at work, I work in wholesale and I force myself to be charming and happy always smiling for my customers. It helps me forget if just for a moment or two that im not happy, and helps me not be tormented by my thoughts.

But now we have to wear masks (which i believe in being safe and I am in no way anti mask at all), however I realise nobody can see my fake smile so now I dont smile at all. 

I still try to be charming and have a bit of banter with customers but Ita getting harder everyday to do it. 

I know I will never kill myself because of my family. My nephews who won't understand and who miss me already due to covid. My wonderful girlfriend which sadly I can't see much anymore due to covid again.

But I hate myself because I partly resent them, because I feel trapped. I want out, I don't want to be alive anymore but I can never do it to them. 

Im sorry if this is the wrong place for this as it is suicide watch and I am insisting I won't do it. 
I just really want to.

I might not reply to comments. 
Just wanted to tell someone because I put too much pressure on my girlfriend with this.

Thanks for listening
