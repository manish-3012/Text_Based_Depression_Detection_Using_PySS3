Broken beyond repair.It just keeps setting in more and more. I wonâ€™t ever get my happy ending with you. I loved you with everything I had but in the end I pushed you away with how stupid I act, I couldnâ€™t ever help it but I tried my best. I cannot live without you though, without the future I envisioned, of us happy, living together, marriage, having a family, I just canâ€™t and donâ€™t want to live without that, without you. Nothing but a miracle can fix me. Just please donâ€™t forget me. I will always love you from the bottom of my heart.
