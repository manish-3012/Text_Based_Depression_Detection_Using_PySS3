Itâ€™s hard to keep going when I donâ€™t have anything to look forward to anymore.Iâ€™m going through a really bad cycle of depression right now. I havenâ€™t felt this way since I nearly killed my self. Maybe even worse. I canâ€™t take this anymore. I want to do well in school, I want to get up and study and work hard but I canâ€™t bring myself to do it, I canâ€™t bring myself to keep my room clean, to drink water, to shower, to do anything. My life isnâ€™t worth living any more. I stay up nights hating myself beyond words. Iâ€™m doing badly in school and Iâ€™m stressed. I donâ€™t want to live anymore. Every day is just me going through this awful cycle again and again. I donâ€™t know what to do. I hate myself so much, I hate being myself. I want to drink, I want to do drugs, I want to kill myself, I want to do anything to not be myself for a while. I keep pushing away people I love, I canâ€™t bring myself to tell anyone whatâ€™s happening. Iâ€™m too numb to cry and when I do cry itâ€™s out of anger or hate. I have issues with my body too. I canâ€™t bear living this life any more, it doesnâ€™t feel worth it. And nobody understands how bad it is which makes me even more frustrated. My grades are terrible and I want them to be good beyond words, I want to do well in school. I have dreams that I want to follow and I need good grades for it, which I can achieve if I was able to apply myself. But I canâ€™t, I canâ€™t bring myself to do it which makes me hate myself and be mad at myself for not doing enough. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me and I donâ€™t know how to fix it. Itâ€™s starting to feel like itâ€™s too late for me. I donâ€™t think I can find it in me to keep living this life.
