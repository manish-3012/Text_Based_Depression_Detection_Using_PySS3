Am I suicidal and just don't know it? The past couple months, I have been experiencing very constant thoughts about dying. Not active suicidal thoughts - Itâ€™s not a â€˜wantingâ€™ feeling, but more of a strong curiosity/mind-wandering collection of thoughts.  
 

These thoughts feel like intrusive thoughts, except instead of them coming every so often, I find myself thinking them at least a couple times a day.   
 

Things like:   
 

\- picturing myself getting hit by cars/buses while I walk down the street  
 \- the process to the hospital if i were to get hurt  
 \- how I think my friends/family/work colleagues would feel, and how they would move forward  
 \- the food that would go bad in my fridge  
 \- future events that I would miss if something were to happen  
 \- how many pairs of shoes would be left in my closet  
 \- what it would feel like to pass away while Iâ€™m sleeping, and if it would really just feel like Iâ€™m sleeping  
 \- food I would miss most if I couldnâ€™t eat anymore, music I would miss, movies, things I havenâ€™t done yet etc.  
 

The list goes on - but they seem to be little mundane thoughts like these.  
 The thoughts donâ€™t make me feel sad or depressed. (I have gone through depression before a couple years ago, and was on medication for a little while, so I feel like I know fairly well what depression feels like, and these thoughts donâ€™t seem to be like that)   
 

The past couple months of my life have been very up and down emotionally, so that could definitely be a contributing factor. 

I know that I already have personal issues with low self esteem and having a lack of confidence. I have many aspirations and passions that I want to pursue, but often times feel overwhelmed by them, and feel unproductive in working towards them.   
 

These thoughts do not feel particularly negative or upsetting, Iâ€™ve just never had such a long period of time go by with such constant thoughts like these.  
 

Iâ€™m reaching out here to see if anybody else may have felt this way before too, or if anybody has any insight into this type of thinking.  
 

Thanks!
