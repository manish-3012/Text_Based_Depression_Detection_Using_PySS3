I'm beginning to seriously fantasise about suicide.For years I've figured it's highly likely I'll end up committing suicide. After childhood my life has just been anxiety and then corresponding depression (and visual issues beyond the age of 16). Age 13 I figured a lack of social skills would lead me to an extremely bad adulthood. 

I forced myself out back into school after regularly going the gym/martial arts. I'm 23 but I was moreorless shut-in between 11-22 until I left for University (heck I literally spoke to 0 girls until I went to school aged 21).

Despite this I'm being totally crushed from all angles by being surrounded by success and the longer I go on without any meaningful relationships/friends the more my sanity is breaking. I don't want to be tied to a life of reclusive wreckage, but all the self-doubt fostered over my life is constantly engulfing me and I'm in turmoil every day now it's ridiculous.

I contacted the University mental health service but it's a waiting list and I feel if I fail I can die with at least having tried, but more than anything I want to make friends and have a life I can accept. I don't think my ambitions are too crazy, I just want to find people who genuinely care about me and not only wish for, but encourage my success. 

It took lots of discipline to get to where I am, but I started trying to improve myself aged 19 after almost entirely giving up on life at 16. It's ridiculous I buckled and lost my discipline when I enter real society.
