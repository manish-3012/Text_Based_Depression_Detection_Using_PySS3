Thank you Suicide Watch.A month ago I came here and posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/uzwnc/i_dont_feel_whole_any_more_cant_even_sleep_i_cant/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/v6kjw/i_need_some_one_to_talk_to/) to sw thinking, it was pretty much a lost cost posting here and that I was already gone. But after posting and talking to a few people I realized that I was willing to give life another shot. So I tried my hardest to live again and break out of depression, but things just got a lot worse.

It got so bad that I was actually ready to kill my self with a few methods I found online. I was even able to actually find some one online who was willing to sell me pills to help me kill my self as well. But before going through with any thing, I thought about you all who helped me and realized that I was battling depression the wrong way. Instead of trying to help my self I realized at the last minute that I needed help from other people. And while I'm not some one who enjoys other people helping me I realized it was my last shot at life.

So I wanted to thank you all because last week I finally told my parents about me being suicidal. I didn't have the hope or courage to tell them but I finally did because of you guys. My father got me a therapist and I checked in with them today, and while I still don't feel 100% I think going there will help me a lot.

TL;DR: I've fallen into a deep depression didn't want to get help from any one. Now by opening up to my family with the help of reddit I can get the help I need.
