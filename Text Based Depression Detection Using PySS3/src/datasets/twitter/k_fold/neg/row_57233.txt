Tl;dr, I'm sick with Hyperparathyroidism, a disease that causes mood swings, among other things. To help with the symptoms, I started smoking weed, which then turned into oil pens, which are 98% THC and make me psychotic -- my fiance left about a month and a half ago, saying she was having herself committed (she now appears to be staying with her parents). Since then, I've come off the drugs (for the first time since all this shit started happening). I've discussed it with several therapists, and it hasn't made any difference -- in fact, the more we try to go through these posts, the more of a monster I feel like, and the more sure I am that I need to keep people safe from me. I don't feel like the same would happen again, but everyone keeps telling me to "work on myself" -- I'm not sure what there is to work on, especially if I can't go over these specific problems with her. 

I feel like a monster, and I can't bare living with myself much longer -- I can't bare the shame; the guilt; the pain I've caused her. I know that anything I do to myself might only cause her more pain, but the nightmares get worse (I keep remembering the things I did), and the auditory hallucinations ("It's going to be okay, bear") are leading into visual hallucinations (the most common, recurring one is me holding her safely between my arms as she cries because she hates the fireworks). 

I want to believe she would want me to get better, but I can't take any more of the pain

I miss her; I can't bare what I've done; that wasn't me, but it doesn't matter, because she's not here, and I can't help her -- I can' let go of any of it. 

I despise myself; I can't live with myself much longer (it gets worse with each passing day). 

I loved her
