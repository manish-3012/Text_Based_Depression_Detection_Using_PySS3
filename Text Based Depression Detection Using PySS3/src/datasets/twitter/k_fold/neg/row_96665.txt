I'm tired of the same bullshit over and overEveryday I sit at the computer all day doing whatever eat, sleep repeat. I go work my shitty ass job when I have to. I go to school sit there, do and learn nothing. 0 friends, 0 people to share my feelings with. I finally get one person to talk to, someone who knows what I'm going through and boom there gone from my life just like that.  Theres no way im ever going to get my dream job. I'm tired of this bullshit excuse for a life. I just want it to end.
