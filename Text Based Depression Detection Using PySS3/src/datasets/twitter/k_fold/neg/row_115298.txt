i donâ€™t have the energy to write a notei barely even have the energy to type this out. everything i do feels forced and pointless. iâ€™m so numb yet so fucking sad. i feel bad leaving no explanation behind, my family thinks iâ€™m doing somewhat better. but the thought of writing a suicide note even just to my mom and dad exhausts me. i donâ€™t want to do anything. i feel bad for hurting the people i love but i just want to be gone.
