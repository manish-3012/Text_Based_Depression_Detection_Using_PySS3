is suicide worth itii dont really wanna get into all my problems but i just dont feel like life is worth living any more, the usual i guess. im 17, i live in turkey, and ive felt like this for a few years. ive had anger issues since i was a kid and ive just been scared for a few years that i might kill myself during an anger attack or something. recently though ive been thinking of suicide in a more calm, methodic kind of way and im just really scared right now because i dont know if i want to die yet?? like fuck yeah my life is meaningless, and the meaning i try to give it doesnt seem genuine and i dont think ill ever be happy in modern society. i just wanted to ask if suicide is worth it, obviously most of you guys will say nooo dont kill yourself theres so much to live for but whats the point. nothing changes if i live or die, maybe my cat would miss me and my family would be sad and friends would be clueless actually no one would know why i did it but i just dont feel like i have the strength on me to keep on living. do i seek professional "help"? i dont know what to do im scared of death but i feel like death would be better than living the rest ofmy life
