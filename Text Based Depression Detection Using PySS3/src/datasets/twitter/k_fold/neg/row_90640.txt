Today is my birthdayToday is my birthday, November 6. Why do I fee that I donâ€™t want to celebrate my birthday anymore? Like I wish I didnâ€™t know when my birthday was. Because this day should be special to me and I should be happy, and all that happened today are just like any ordinary day. Maybe Iâ€™m just expecting too much but I really wish I didnâ€™t know when my birthday is.
