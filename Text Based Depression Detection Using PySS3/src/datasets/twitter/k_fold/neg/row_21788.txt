I can't take it much longer.I NEED to be put down. I am an abomination. All of my body parts have something wrong with them. Nothing works right on me. I have too many mental illnesses. Every day I get more stupid. Please kill me. I need it to end. I am a genetic mess. No one in any medical field will ever understand me. I just want to be put down. I just want it to stop. Every day everything wrong compounds on me. I can't handle it. I need to die. I need it.
