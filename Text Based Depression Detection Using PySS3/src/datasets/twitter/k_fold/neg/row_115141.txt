Had addiction since 9 years old9 years later i still relapse. Having an addiction makes life unbearable. I tried therapy and it didn't help at all. I don't have people to talk to, i just want to die. I know the longer i live the more shit i go through 
People always say it gets better but I've been waiting for almost 10 years and its only gotten worse. I cant even kill myself yet because i don't live alone. This is hell and i know it is
