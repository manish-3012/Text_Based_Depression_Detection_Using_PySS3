My mom tried to kill herself today. I feel lost.It's the second time this happened. I am so tired. I feel like me and my siblings are making all the wrong choices. We tried to have her committed because we felt that she was going to try it again, and all that did was worsen things. 
I have been dealing with depression myself and I have had thoughts about killing myself too for a long time. I don't know how to get better myself and look after my mum. We don't know how to guarantee her safety in the long term 
I haven't slept for a while now, I am going to try to get some rest. Even if this isn't read by anyone I don't have where to share these feelings.
