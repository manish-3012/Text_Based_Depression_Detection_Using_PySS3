I turn 22 in a couple hours.Best to go out on the same day I came in. It's my gift to myself. I've been wanting to do this for a long time. I don't know if I'll succeed, but I'm going to try.

**Edit**: Going to wait to see how my birthday goes. So check back in ~24 hours.

**Edit #2**: My birthday is going alright so far. So it's looking like I won't be trying to kill myself. Things can change really quickly, though. I'll update again tomorrow. I'm also going to see my therapist tomorrow, so I'll update after my appointment.

**Edit #3**: I saw my therapist today, and I didn't talk much about my suicidal thoughts (although I mentioned it). It really helped to talk about some of the things in my life. Thanks for the support everyone. Can't guarantee that I won't ever feel suicidal again, but you guys really helped me a lot.
