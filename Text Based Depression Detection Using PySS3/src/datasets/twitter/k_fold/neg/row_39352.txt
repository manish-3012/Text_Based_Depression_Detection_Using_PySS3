I hope today is the day.I'm sitting in my car with my gun in my passenger seat. 
The pain is fucking crippling. I want to be done. I spent the last hour driving around finding a place where I hope no one will find me. I kissed my babies for the last time. I wish I could have been better. I wish with my whole entire heart that I wasn't this shitty person. I hope I have the strength to pull the trigger and just let be over. 
God let it be quick...
