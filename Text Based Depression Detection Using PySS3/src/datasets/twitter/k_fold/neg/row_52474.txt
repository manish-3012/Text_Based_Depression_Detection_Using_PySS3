I'm not gonna die, but every bit of me wishes I was.As the title says, I'm not gonna die. I feel like I have to say that 20 times a week to so many different people. It's never fun.


But no. I'm not gonna die. Not even close. I came close, probably the closest I could come to dying, but it didn't happen.


In May I was diagnosed with leukemia. The first thing out of my mouth was, "I don't want to die". And every day since, it has been the topic of my life. I wonder, if I knew how much stress and frustration, how much more suffering I'd do, would I have said that? I don't know.


I won't begin to explain all my suffering in my life. I feel like I could write books, but what good does that do? I feel robbed. I could've died and it would've been an honorable death. Painless, probably. I would've probably been put the sleep for my dying breath.


But no. I went through chemo, I went through the suffering. I went through the puking, the shitting, the tired days of doing nothing. Quitting and losing everything in my life. The nights crying into my pillow because I'm so miserable. Why did I go through it?


So many people think I'm so strong but I'm not. I'm not strong. I've suffered my whole life, and I feel like I'm constantly just getting kicked in the stomach over and over.


I have shit mental health, shit physical health now, and I'm so unhappy. 


I feel so ungrateful because I want to die. I should be happy I'm not going to, but at what cost? So I can cry more, hate myself more, puke more, and suffer more? 


I'm not gonna die, but I wish with almost every fiber of my being that I was. At least it would've been honorable.
