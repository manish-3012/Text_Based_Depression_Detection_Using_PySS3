Everyone in my life would be happier without me in it.Thatâ€™s honestly how I feel. My parents, my brother, the rest of my family, my â€œfriendsâ€, everyone I know...their lives would be so much happier without me in it. I know it. Iâ€™m a huge burden and a shitty person, all I do is ruin everything and annoy people. Any social event is made worse with me in it. Everyone would have more fun if they didnâ€™t feel obligated to drag me places just because Iâ€™m their daughter/friend/relative and they feel obligated to put up with me. If I died, people would be much better off. I donâ€™t think most people would even notice I was gone - Iâ€™m basically invisible when people arenâ€™t hating me. I only really have 2 kind-of-friends, everyone else in my life is family who are stuck with me until I do them all a favour and kill myself. And anyone who did notice I was gone would probably be happy to be rid of me. Yeah, it might hurt my immediate family at first, but only at first. It would be like ripping off a plaster. Once the initial pain was gone, theyâ€™d realise what I realise - that their lives would be much happier, easier and more free without me. All I do is ruin everything and make people miserable with my existence - I want the people I love to be happy and have good lives, and the best way to do that is by getting rid of the burden thatâ€™s making them miserable: me.
