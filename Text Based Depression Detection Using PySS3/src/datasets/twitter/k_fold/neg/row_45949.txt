I'm a failureIm a 22 year old man and I'm a complete fuck up. I pushed away the only person who consistently made plans with me, my ex, and now she hates me. I have other friends but they rarely talk to me anymore. I'm a major pussy and don't know what it takes to be a man. I was raised by my mom and my dad never taught me anything. I'm effeminate. I used to be really funny and outgoing but now I'm just a husk of a person. I don't laugh anymore. I rarely smile. My eyes have shadows and I look dead inside. I feel deeply ashamed of myself and how I've treated others, and I'm ashamed of my past. It haunts me every single day. I wish there was a painless way to just go.
