I hate feeling better, getting life back on track, moving on from the hurtful shit, finding new friends......and then getting hit on the head by a steel fucking pipe and being robbed of all the good and well-being that i've collected.

I saw a dream, of all things. It opened up memories I had buried some time ago. I thought I had moved on and put the past in the past, but oh no, 'tis just an illusion.

So like the classical domino effect, it culminated from having a small nightmare into saying "fuck you" to all the self improvement i've made because i'm not planning on being alive at the same time next year. Fuck.
