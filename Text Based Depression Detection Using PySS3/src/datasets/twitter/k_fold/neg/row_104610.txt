I feel peace and satisfaction when I imagine the noose around my neck, or being stabbed on the stomach (the two parts where anxiety paralyses me the most)and I don't like to think it as if I'm crazy, i just feel like death has already shown itself upon me,only that my way to die will be in my own hands.
thanks for the space, and attention, I'm not looking for help,I don't really want it,but feels good to just express
