Pls help me its Urgent [Confused]For the battle I've been dealing for years and years now; ocd, depression, and anxiety. I've been battling and for years things I learned gets more better as I accept it, more peace I receive in return. However, today I had a struck and a dilemma; I stopped playing sports for I have vertigo which fcks with my balance. So, I find joy in other things I programmed and for anything else I knew in life I felt accepted and loved, for months I've been doing so, while dealing with my ocd I need to accept the Intrusive thoughts and anxiety/depression. Now none of these anxiety/depression/intrusive thoughts can fck with me. But what I cant deal with is when I'm in anxiety my body goes in a big lump of pain. Top to bottom, my head a severe migraine and almost taking out my frontal lobe is the only way, My joints ache like they were frozen, My muscle tightens and prickles; all of these physical pain is caused by my anxiety and depression. I know that suicide is not the way but its been weeks now and I dont feel even a second for it to stop. Remind yo that I have no access to any medicines. I live in a 3rd world country, philippines. Is there any other way?? please help me
