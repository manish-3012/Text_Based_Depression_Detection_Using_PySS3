Stuck in-between having extreme hope and hopelessnessCheck out my post history for details, but the tl:dr is this...

I am going to college and doing well. I live with my wonderful SO and our adorable dog. All of that is fantastic.

The only blood family I willingly speak to is my mother. I was abused by my father growing up and after recently finding out what horrible, sickening things he did to my siblings, I want nothing to do with him. 

My mother is elderly, in poor healthy and gets confused easily. My father is a control freak and if I contact her or vice versa, he makes sure he is involved. This has been causing me to cry multiple times a day and have panic attacks. Just hearing him say, "hi" in the background is doing this.

I'm stuck between having so much motivation for life, and then nothing because my happiness keeps getting destroyed by his presence and knowing the situation is basically taking the relationship I have with my mother. There is nothing I can do to help myself (no contact with him means none with her) that won't make her terribly sad. I'm basically the only person she has who is kind to her.
