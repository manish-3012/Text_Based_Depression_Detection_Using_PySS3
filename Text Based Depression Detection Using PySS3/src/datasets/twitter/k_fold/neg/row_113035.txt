Why live?A question one must ponder for themselves, though I do have my own answer to it. 
Devoid of happiness, understanding, support, satisfaction and even the occasional basic comfort, my life might sound like a pointless and quite tedious existence. This is indeed the case but one reason keeps me going, one singular purpose. I do not wish for those that made my life a living hell to win. Why must I die, because of them? No, I WILL live, if only to oppose this "role" I was given. 
Suffering instead of pleasure; hatred instead of love; frustration instead of satisfaction. I will eat, have the food turn to dust in my mouth, and still swallow and enjoy it.
That is my resolution.
