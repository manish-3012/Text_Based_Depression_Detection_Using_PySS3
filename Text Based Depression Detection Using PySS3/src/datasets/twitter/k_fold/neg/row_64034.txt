PoetrySometimes this place is all I have
When the guns and the knives
And emotions drive mad
And tell me to do things
I know that are bad
Cause you all understand 
What it's like to be under
Death's command
To pray hard to God 
But does he understand 
What is God
What is fate
What is man 
Why do we exist
What's the use in living 
It it all just meaningless 
Tell me where you happy once
Or did you always suffer 
Did you ever smile 
Was anyone a buffer
Did you lose it all
Did you fight
Did you fall
Were you abandoned too
Abused
Were you forsaken
Mistaken 
Lonely 
And used
Are you a lost child
Emotions run wild 
Threatened to kill
Do you long for a noose
Or a blade or a pill
Did all of your loved ones
Sneer at you
And tell you to chill
Sometimes you're all I have
Life's beaten me down
In the dirt on the ground 
Fate be damned
All of you
Unlike The Man
By God
All of you
Understand
