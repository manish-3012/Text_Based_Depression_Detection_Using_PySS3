laterThis pain will not decrease, I've run out of ways to help myself. I want to feel joy, I want for a minute to not feel this way. I hate myself so fucking much. I think I'm going to hang myself today. I feel so much relief just thinking about not being here. My heart aches so much and my sleep has been tainted by dreams of people I won't see again, I waited for it to get better I waited for it to go away. I reached out, I got the help available but I didn't get much out of it. 13 years of pain, far too long to endure. Something like a shitty movie dragging on. I've lurked this subreddit for sometime. I wish you all the best, reading this board has given me a sense of connectivity in regards to my mental health that I hadn't experienced elsewhere.

Adios !
