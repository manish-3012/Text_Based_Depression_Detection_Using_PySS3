I want commit suicide after a total asshole spent days taking advantage of me sexually. I don't know what to doI have PTSD and I can't go to therapy because no therapist in my area accepts my insurance.

I keep taking illegal drugs and even overdosed before and had to spend a week in the hospital. I don't know what to do

He also taunted and verbally abused me all day long during the days 

And touched my body for HOURS a day

And now he is in love and he's getting married and the girl makes hundreds of posts about him on social media calling him a "sweet, kind, beautiful soul"

i dont know what to do
