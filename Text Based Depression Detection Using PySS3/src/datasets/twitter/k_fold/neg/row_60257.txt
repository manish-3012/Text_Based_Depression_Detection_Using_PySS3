I never even gotten a response here.Hello, I'm posting here because I'm out of options, I have no one to talk too. Please, I just would like someone to read all this and help. I don't think I can keep living anymore.

I am a 19 year old guy that lives in the shitty state of Wisconsin. I've dealt with depression for the majority of my life, starting when my parents divorced when I was 6. There's a ton that I could go on and on about regarding that but I just won't. As in my past experiences nobody really cares anyway.

Here's the important things, I had been living with my father for almost 9 years until me and him got into a big altercation last week. Me and him had gotten into an actual like fight three times before this (all within the past few months), where he hits me and a ton of stuff. My father never laid a hand on me before this.

I've been living with my aunt for the past week. It's nice here, but everything is eating at me.

I began talking to an ex of mine about two and a half months ago, again. She's always been the one thing that helps me make it through this. But I've been so fucking down and depressed and angry that I've been taking it out on her. Daily. And I'm pretty sure I've lost her again as I haven't heard from her since yesterday morning.(we talk everyday.)

I know I can't rely on someone for my own happiness but I've tried letting go, and I can't. I love her so much she's helped me through everything life had given me shit for but I still treat her like shit and she doesn't deserve it. She's the brightest part of my day, and even arguing with her is better then the best conversation with anyone else.

But I've ruined that. So add that on to the stuff with my dad, the depression..and I'm at my end. I've given this a lot of thought. It's what I want. It's how I'll stop feeling like death every day. Just close my eyes and never have to open them again.

I'm sorry.
