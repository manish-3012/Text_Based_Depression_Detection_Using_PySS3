Getting help after attemptI had an attempt on Tuesday. I have been so tired of this seemingly endless cycle of SI that Iâ€™ve been in since jr. high. I have kids and often genuinely feel like everyone in my life would be happier without me. Not initially, though. I know they would be sad, but they could eventually move on and then be better off than having to deal with my shitty brain acting up and getting intensely suicidal 5 or so times a year. 

But maybe I can get my brain balanced out. After the attempt (which was dumb and probably bound to not work anyway, in hindsight) I told my husbandâ€”hours later. He took the day off work the next day and asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital. I didnâ€™t. I donâ€™t. But I am seriously tired of putting my loved ones through the inconvenience of dealing with my depression. 

I went in for an assessment and they wanted to keep me inpatient. I explained that I definitely did not want that and that I was not in danger of attempting again any time soon, especially if I got to see a psychiatrist to help adjust my meds. After calling two different doctors I managed to get into the partial hospitalization program. I did the same program last year: two weeks of going in for five and half hours doing group therapy, daily one-on-one with therapist, and meeting with the psychiatrist about twice a week. Iâ€˜m going to be working really hard to make this the last time I have to go to the hospital for mental health stuff. 

So seeking help post-attempt doesnâ€™t necessarily end in being locked. Not that this is a guarantee though. Just wanted to share my experience.
