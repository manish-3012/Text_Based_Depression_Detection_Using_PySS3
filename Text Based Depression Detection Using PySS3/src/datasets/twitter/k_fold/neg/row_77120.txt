My life has come to an endThis might jump around. I don't know how to word all of this really. I've had anxiety and depression my whole life, but when I was 11, I was bullied and that made it show up. It was light at first but it only got worse. I was so shy that I had no friends and stayed home all the time. I started cutting. First I used safety pins but then I used knives, and was pleased with the blood pouring out, as I thought I deserved to get hurt. My depression and anxiety went undiagnosed for a long time but finally I got help and got put on meds. I still struggled. The meds didn't help much. Everyday I struggled and cried and had panic attacks at school. I had to miss so much school that I was taken out and put on independent study. I was smart. I might still be. But these pills make me seem dumber, I get spacey and can't think as well as I should. When I left school I lost all the friends I had from that school (I had been less shy). So now I'm 18, can't drive, stay home all day, can't get a job. I don't know if I can go to college or not. And I go to school an hour a week. So most days I just sit at home and waste away because there's nothing to do in this shitty ass town. I have friends but they go to regular schools and get busy. I am a drain on my parents, a drain on my friends, a drain on everything. I've lost what I had and now I have nothing. I hate myself deeply and want to be dead.
