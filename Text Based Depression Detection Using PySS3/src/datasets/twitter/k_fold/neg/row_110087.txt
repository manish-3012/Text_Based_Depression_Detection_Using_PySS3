completely hopeless, i tried and i'm still worthless.I am writing this here because I have nowhere else to go/talk to. There are so many things I hate about my life I'm fat, I'm unsucessful (28 and still live at home), never really dated, etc. I am so behind in life. I wanted to be a totally different woman by this age, but here I am. A month or so ago, I decided to fix it. I started walking a few times a week, counted calories, started to learn programming (as a hobby I will never be good enough to do it as a job and am too old anyways), etc. I wanted to turn my life around in a small way. I lost weight, have learned a little bit but today during a walk a thought came to me. Even though I have come a little ways, I have so far to go. I'm still a loser even if I eat healthy, or learn something, it doesn't matter. Even if I accomplish weight loss more, or learn a skill, would a dude really want to date a 28 year old virgin? Even if I improve myself, who would even care to be my friend? In that moment I realized I wasted my life, and no improvement can bring back the time I lost in depression (which was my ENTIRE 20's, the best years of your life...gone thanks to depression). I just have no motivation now, and know my best option is to die. I can at least say I did try, but I can't think of any reason to not die, I have no hope left.
