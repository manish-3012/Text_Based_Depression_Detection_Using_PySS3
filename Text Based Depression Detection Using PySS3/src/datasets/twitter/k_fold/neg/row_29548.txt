I feel like an open woundSometimes I start to heal and then itâ€™s like the scabâ€™s ripped off and I just want to disappear.

Iâ€™ve been feeling so much better lately.
Better than I ever have.

Nothing has *happened*. I donâ€™t know why itâ€™s suddenly unbearable again. Itâ€™ll probably go away again, but I worry one day itâ€™ll hurt too much and I wonâ€™t be able to bear it. 

I know Iâ€™m better... Itâ€™s better, everything is better. I donâ€™t understand why I still want to die.
