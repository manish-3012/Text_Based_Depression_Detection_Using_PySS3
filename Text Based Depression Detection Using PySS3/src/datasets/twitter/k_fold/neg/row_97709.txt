Consider this my suicide noteWell, this is it I guess. If everything goes according to plan, I should finally kick the bucket sometime within the next two weeks. This would be my 9th suicide attempt over a span of 3 years\(damn, time does fly fast when you're a self\-loathing, worthless piece of shit\). During this time, everyone was telling me how one day I'm going to look around and realize how grateful I am for not offing myself, but that day never came, things are getting only worse and worse with each passing day and I lost any kind of patience I had about things ever getting better. I just can't take it anymore.

Now, I'm going to spare you the details of the continuous years of abuse and severe frustration that I had to be put through. None of it really matters now. What I do want you guys to know is that I've always been a good boy who never asked for much from life. All I ever wanted was to live, be happy, love and be loved. Doesn't sound like much, does it? I don't think so, but apparently it's too much, much more than this pathetic piece of shit of an existence could ever offer me.

And, yes, before you say anything, I'm aware of all the pain that I am going to leave behind after I off myself. I have a mother and a father, and also friends who care about me\(well, at least those who didn't give up on me, like a good amount of them did\). But you know what? I don't care anymore. I tried explaining them that my entire existence is a lost cause and continuing it would benefit neither me, nor anyone or anything else, but they don't want to listen. At this point, if they still choose to grieve over my death, it's their problem, not mine. I made a decision, and I'm going to stick to it.

Don't you ever think that I wanted this. I would have loved to carry on living and see everything there is about life. I'm still so young\(early 20s\), but I just can't live like this anymore. Maybe life wasn't meant for me.

Now, one last thing. I want to address to this  community that I've been\(on different accounts\) part of since 2016. You people are just wonderful. You were always there for me when nobody else was. It is a great thing to do for your fellow humans and I seriously think all of you are fantastic people, both the creators of this community and all the users who ever tried to help others. I'm sorry that you're all going through shit and I genuinely think that you don't deserve it\(as much as I like to think that I don't deserve what's happening to me, but that's not for me to judge\). Anyways, I want to thank you all for the help and support you have offered me \&lt;3.

Alright, I guess that's it now. Goodbye, beautiful people, and I hope your days will be better than mine were.
