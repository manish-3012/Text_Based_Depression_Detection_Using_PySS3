Im tired of everythingSometimes i feel like a burden to my parents. Like a fucking parasite thats sucking away their food and time. Sometimes i feel like running away and leaving a note behind saying that i was going to start a brand new life when in actuality Iâ€™ll be overdosing on pills and killing myself. Iâ€™ll be smoking my last cigarettes looking at the moon and thinking to myself how much of a piece of shit i am to my parents and the people around me. No one will ever marry me. I wont have children to play basketball and teach cycling with. How Iâ€™ll never have a wife that loves me the same  way i love her. Loving me no matter what. Through thick and thin. But thats never going to happen. Im going to die all alone with no one beside me. Lately during these quarantine days Iâ€™ve been straying away from my religion. Not praying. Doing disgusting actions that arent allowed. I wish there was a way to just not exist. Never be born. Never be the burden that i am to my parents and family.
