Yep. I lost my job. Over dumpster diving.Past few years everything was going awful and the start of this year actually was going well. I thought I would be able to do better. I had a stable job that I liked where I worked with people who I liked. The pay wasn't fantastic but it was better than nothing. Then on Monday I get put on suspension and not told why, at all, until Friday. I go in in the morning for a meeting with HR people, my manager, some other lady and my union rep, because apparently we're unionized at a gas bar. I sit down and they proceed to tell me that I'm under investigation for theft. What did I steal? Expired food from the dumpster. Evidently, this is tantamount to theft and against their company policy. Immediately fired after I said yes because I didn't think that anyone would fire me for being poor. The only reason I 'stole' it was because I had no fucking food otherwise. 

So I'm out of a job. Great. Shitty considering I'm $200 short on my rent for February 1st. I could have said "Hey I'll have the last bit on my next cheque" before but now I don't have anything to fall back on. I'm going to be homeless in a few days. I just lost my job that actually made me kinda happy and now I get absolutely nothing. I don't have a scrap of food in the fucking house, the post I made on Random Acts of Pizza as a hail mary to go "Oh maybe I can get SOMETHING out of this piece of shit day" went no where. Just downvoted to hell. No way to pay rent, no food to eat, nothing to do. Stealing WiFi from a neighbor, having to sit outside to get it. Might as well get used to the cold considering I'll be homeless in a week. Rather be dead than homeless.
