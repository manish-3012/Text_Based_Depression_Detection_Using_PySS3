I need helpI've run out of reasons to try, I'm trying to convince myself this isn't the right thing to do, but it's the only thing that feels right. I have spent my whole life running from these feelings, but I can't escape them. 

My life isn't going anywhere. I'm just sick, disabled, disease riddled and hopeless. What's the point in all of this? Every minute of my life is an internal hell that I'm sick of. 

How do I keep going? I just don't know anymore. I've tried everything, pills, self-harm, therapy etc. It just doesn't help. I'm trapped inside of myself and I don't understand why I feel this way. The only girl I ever loved is dead, suicide the night I didn't answer her message. 

I'm disgusting and futile. I either need a way to be okay, or I gotta go because I can't live like this. I can't see myself making it to the end of the year if this keeps up.
