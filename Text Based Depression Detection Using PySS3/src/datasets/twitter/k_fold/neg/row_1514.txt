i hope someone reads this, itâ€™s physically painfuli canâ€™t think, so idk what to say, it just hurts. if i could think, then maybe i could talk to people to feel better, but no i canâ€™t. i wish i could ask for a hug, but the people i know donâ€™t bother with me because iâ€™m boring since i donâ€™t feel normal and literally canâ€™t think, and also i lol hideous so thereâ€™s no chance anyone would want to talk to me. iâ€™m just stuck alone in my agony. iâ€™m not even sad, sometimes i am, but i donâ€™t know. i want to talk, but i just canâ€™t think, i donâ€™t know what to do... i really hope someone reads this...i donâ€™t want to seem selfish, but i donâ€™t think anyone else has what i have, i really think i might have dementia or something like that, but iâ€™m only 18. i donâ€™t know what it is, but itâ€™s so bad. i just want to be appreciated by someone who cares. my phone is dry, i have nothing to wake up to, i keep going back to edit this post because i canâ€™t think. iâ€™ve lost all faith in people too. i sometimes feel normal at night, but only sometimes. and i can feel a difference.
