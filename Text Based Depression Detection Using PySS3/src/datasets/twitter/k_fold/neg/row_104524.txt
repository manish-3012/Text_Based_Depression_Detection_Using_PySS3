I just don't have a reasonIt feels so weird and sad that the only people I can talk to are strangers on the internet, anonymously. But my "real" account has tens of thousands of karma, and I basically have no friends in real life, so I guess I get along better with you guys than I do with the people I know.

For most of my adult and adolescent life, I've gone through occasional dark periods when I've fantasized about suicide, but they were pretty short-lived in response to something that had recently happened. And usually it was just some kind of revenge fantasy where I thought I could force people to know how much they hurt me, but I know that's not how it works - they'd just be surprised and confused, then forget about me and move on.

However, this episode has lasted about a month. I spend a long time every day (and especially every night) dwelling on suicide, and the only things stopping me are the lack of anything less painful than a sharp object in my immediate reach, and the fact that I've promised some things to some people and don't want to leave them hanging. Basically, suicide is an item on my to-do list. Even though it's at the bottom, I've started to avoid taking on any new commitments because they'd delay it, and I think I can wrap up the rest of my tasks within weeks. On the other hand, there are times (once every couple of nights) when I think I might be willing to let everything slide and just do it right now, if I had a gun or some sleeping pills handy.

My main problem is that I'm so lonely. The people in my workplace hardly talk to each other, and there's no one I see outside of work. I've gone out with a friend just once in the last few months, to see a movie, and he was just looking for anyone he knew who was willing to go with him. But at the same time, there isn't any particular thing I actually *want* to do with anyone I know. I dislike bars and parties and just "hanging out" for its own sake; I'd rather be *doing something*. Basically the only thing I like to do that can be done with a friend is video gaming, and I honestly don't know anyone who would want to do that and lives nearby.

It's probably relevant that I'm gay. I came out to my family at Thanksgiving and friends soon after. No one was upset or even really surprised. The general vibe I got was just "why are you telling me this *now*, if you're not seeing anyone?" The few gay people I know told me this would be one of the happiest moments of my life, but in fact it's made me more depressed than ever, even though it went as well as I could ask for.

I've been trying my damnedest to meet someone on okcupid, where almost no one ever responds to my messages. I actually did go on a couple of dates with someone who really seemed to get along with me, but then he suddenly broke it off because he's so busy and took personal offense that I wanted to see him more than once every two weeks, and now we're not on speaking terms. That was a month ago, and I've had no other contact with anyone since then. Worst of all, I've realized that this last guy is the only person who's ever made me feel appreciated or attractive, and now he's clearly retracted that opinion. I'm starting to feel fairly confident that I'm not going to find anyone else to date me as long as I'm in grad school, maybe for the rest of my life.

Well, rant is way too long already. There's more I could say, but I don't know what's relevant. My life seems so easy and comfortable compared to the other stories I've read here. Maybe that's just a reason to get out of the way so you guys can deal with the people who have bigger problems.
