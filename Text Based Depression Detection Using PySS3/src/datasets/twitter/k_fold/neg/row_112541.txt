Struggling to find a reason not to.I think the only reason I can't at the moment is thinking about how it would affect my parents. When they're gone I'm not sure if I'll have the strength to go on. I might not even make it before they go. It just feels like I'm going to spend my life alone. Like I'm some unloveable freak that failed at, arguably, lifes one purpose. If I'm doomed to live alone then I'd rather not live at all. I try and try and try to find someone and it never works. Then I hear people say 'You just have to wait, your time will come'. Well I've waited long enough, I missed out on my peak years of life being alone and I'm seeing less and less point everyday to carry on.
