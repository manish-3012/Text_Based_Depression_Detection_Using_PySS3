I just want to die.My life has been pretty horrible from childhood on. I'm now 41 years old, I don't do drugs, I rarely drink, I'm intelligent, attractive and I work hard. No matter how hard I work, I can't find a job that pays enough to live on. I grew up extremely poor, in an abusive, toxic family so I wasn't able to go to college. I've worked in the service industry most of my adult life so I've never had medical or dental insurance. I have an eviction on my record because I ran from a domestic violence relationship a few years ago (they were convicted but I can't get the eviction removed) so finding a rental is near impossible. Jobs that pay only $15 an hour with no benefits even want a degree. I'm staying with a friend right now but if I can't find a job that pays a livable wage soon I'm just going to kill myself. I can't afford to be alive and I can't keep living like this. I already have a plan to do it without being too much of a bother to anyone else.
