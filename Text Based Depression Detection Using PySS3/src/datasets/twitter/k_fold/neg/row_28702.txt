I don't know what to do anymoreHi,

Using a throwaway because my boyfriend knows my main account and I don't want him seeing this.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 13 I tried to kill myself.  I had to take medicine, go to therapy, all that fun stuff.  I'm now 23 and have been on numerous medications, went to several therapists, and it's not better.  I try so so hard but the feelings never go away.  I honestly don't know what to do.
