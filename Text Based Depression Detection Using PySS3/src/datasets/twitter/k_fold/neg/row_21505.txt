Suicidal thoughtzI don't  know why I'm  here. I'm  home alone. I'm  thinking  of taking a shower, washing my hair. Maybe putting  make up on. Maybe watching  a favourite  show and drinking  some wine.

Then I want to kill myself. I dont have anyone I can call. No one I can speak to. I don't  think anyone can help me. I've  isolated  myself so long I'm  out of options. The family  members  I have, resent it when I'm  in crisis. I dont blame them. They have their own troubles. My husband has gone somewhere  and I doubt  he'll  be back tonight. My friends have moved away and those that stayed, I have  ghosted .  But my dogs are here  and I don't  know who will take care of them. It just hurts too much, you know? I don't  want to be this person. I know people  have it harder than me, and I should be grateful but I don't  think I can do this anymore.
