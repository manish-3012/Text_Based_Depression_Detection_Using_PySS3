It's too lateI'm a miserable, worthless person. I'm not good at anything. People think that everything I do is weird. I'm a bad friend.

If I think really hard I've never felt bad for anyone else. I've never felt guilty. I don't do terrible things, it's just that I've never cared for anyone but myself.

People have never given me a reason to care for them. Everyone I've ever known in my life has lied to me. Even my own parents lie to me everyday.

I'm a 21 year old who stopped socialising with people my age at 16. I have 1 year college under my belt. Oh and I have no work experience. I spend 100% of my time at home. I don't like going out because people don't like me AND I don't like people.

I'm a miserable useless ugly bitch who will never amount to anything.
