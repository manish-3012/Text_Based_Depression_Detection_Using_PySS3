Getting constantly accused makes me suicidalEverytime anything goes missing around the house the blame immediately falls upon me. A few examples - 2 cases of beer got stolen from a unlocked beer shed. instead of confronting the neighbor who has been caught stealing beer, i get blamed. Also, 3 of my moms prescribed pain pills go missing, instead of questioning the person with the broken tailbone whoâ€™s in a lot of pain, they blame me. And this is a constant thing. if they lose a pack of cigarettes, they immediately blame me. Iâ€™ve literally agreed to take a drug test, but they refuse to give me one. I donâ€™t know what they want me to say. I am on medication for depression, and they know stressing me out with constantly being questioned of stuff i didnâ€™t do makes me even more sad. At this point, i donâ€™t know what to do.
