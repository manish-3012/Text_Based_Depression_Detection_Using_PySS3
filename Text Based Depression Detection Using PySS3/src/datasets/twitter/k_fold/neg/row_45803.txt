Everyone expects me to get better (Rant)Yet my body is pretty much feeling the effects of stress. I get waves of nausea quite often, I feel nervous and anxious, I feel like I don't know how to reconnect and mend broken bridges with people...

Heh, how could I? My social skills are horrible, I just realized that my social isolation has reached critical levels, I've wasted seven years of my life and my stomach can't even handle pills!

It's like fighting a war against an entire army by my own, I'm not that strong, I know I shouldn't feel suicidal, as I haven't suffered that much compared to others, yet I feel like I'm a time bomb... I feel like I'm very close to snapping at someone...

Of course I care about what others think me, because, I've barely been accepted in my life. I was myself, I tried to be sincere, to keep my morals, and life just spitted on my face time after time!

Where does it stop, when does this fucking cycle will stop?! Of course I've tried to improve, to get social skills, to try to meet people, and it seldom works! 

It's always the same. People want me to put on their shoes, yet they rarely do it for me. If I don't talk to people, they won't talk to me. I'm always a giver, and most people just take from me time after time.

I'm sorry mom, you always told me to love myself and to not worry about friends, but... How can I be sure if I'm not a fuck up, if almost every single person I met ends up forgetting about me, and most people just take, take and take...
