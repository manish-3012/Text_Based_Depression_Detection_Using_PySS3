I don't remember a time I didn't want to dieThe title says it all really.  I have prayed to die for as long as I can remember.  I was 16 and got pregnant to persuade my mother to let me marry the love of my life.  She signed the consent form and he was killed in an accident three days later.  I kept the baby and during the birth had a near-death experience due to pre-eclampsia (really high blood pressure).  I chose to come back because his baby needed me.  I don't think a day goes by without me regretting that decision.  
My 'baby' is all grown up now and we are estranged...so what was the point of that?  
Oh I have had a 'life' for the 40 years since that accident.  I married and my husband died of cancer 5 years ago.  I have a step-daughter who tries and she's lovely but hopelessly inadequate.  I built a career but I have just wrecked that by changing jobs and my new firm is awful to the point where it's broken me inside.  I  can imagine some of you are thinking "It's only a job, get another" but I have spent 20 years getting to this point and it's destroyed my self confidence - I can't walk down the street without shaking visibly so how am I going to get through an interview?
That is, in a sense, beside the point anyway.  For four decades I have had the facade of a 'life' and even seemed to be doing well for myself but all I've wanted is to not be here.  You wouldn't put a dog through this much misery!
