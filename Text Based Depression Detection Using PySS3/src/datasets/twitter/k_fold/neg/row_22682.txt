I really just want to die.I really don't understand what's even wrong with suicide. why should it matter if I want to kill myself? what is it going to hurt if a jobless, miserable person was to leave this earth. I won't be here to care if anyone is "hurt" they'll get over it anyways... 

I really want out. the things I looked forward to don't even spark joy anymore. I hate everything about living. 

I wish there were easier ways to kill myself... I've been making pro con lists for different ways of suicide... I just want to find the easiest one... I don't want any risk of coming back. 

I really wish I could just die... I don't want to wake up tomorrow.
