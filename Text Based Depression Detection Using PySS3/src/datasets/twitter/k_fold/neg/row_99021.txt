I tucking hate my shitty life and the fact that I have been denied the life I deserve and have earnedAnd before you Petersonian assholees chime in with your victim blaming; I have worked tremendously hard and done all the right things. It's all luck and Peterson and his fanboys/girls are just corporate worshipping victim blaming assholes who don't know anything about the realities of people's lives.

Between continuing depression and anger as to the decline in quality of life and the indifference to it all; in how life is easier for women but people say the reverse; on how the world runs on sociopathy and the only way to succeed and be happy is to be a complete and total monster; on how religion is a scam causes God clearly doesn't love me and only demands shit from us; on how I should just kill myself but victims of suicide are just seen as villains and you end up causing even more suffering; on how COVID is just a scam by big tech to cause a recession and make us even larger screen addicts but people are stupid and gullible and willing to destroy society and people's hopes and dreams and cause mental illness spikes to slightly extend the lives of people who are elderly and going to die in a few years anyways (not that I want to kill the but letting them die is clearly the lesser evil to what ended up happening); that corporations are continuing to exploit us and that billionaires could easily improve the lives of all with no difference in quality of life (there is no difference between having $100B or $1B or $500M in lifestyle but their sociopathy and infinite greed makes them indifferent to suffering for the sake of their own selves); on how free trade has screwed us all; on how women entering the workforce should have allowed men to work less hours and an equitable distribution of house and office work and that having everyone work 60-80 hours a week serves no one but the corporate overlords; on how life in the modern era is pure hell for 99.99% of the population; on the fact that I should die cause why ducking bother
