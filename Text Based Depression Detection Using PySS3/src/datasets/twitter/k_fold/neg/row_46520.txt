I Hate University (This is a dumb rant I am sorry)I'm so tired of university and everything surrounding it. My roommates' friends don't like me, which I get. I'm very different from them and my roommates, but I'm not allowed to talk to people during in person classes, and no one in my club really wants to talk to me, and it's so goddamn lonely and I just feel bad because I want to try to make friends but idk how and I don't share interests with my roommates and their friends and I have a different background and I really don't want to exercise and diet with them.

I can't function with food, and it's so bad. I eat like once a day because it's just too stressful to eat more, but now that I'm in my parents' home because I have to pack because they're moving, I'm binge-eating and my stomach hurts so bad from eating so much suddenly and I regret and I'm so tired of everything.

Like I can't imagine having to keep doing this shit. I don't want to go to my virtual classes tomorrow, I don't want to have to keep packing up all my shit, I don't want to have to keep eating and internally debating everything I do and don't eat, I just want to sleep for a while until I can wake up and feel not like absolute garbage. 

People keep telling me maybe college just isn't right for me but the only thing I haven't completely failed at is academia. It's the only thing I vaguely know how to do. They only thing in uni that I don't absolutely hate all the time is my language and history classes. Like the class part of uni isn't my issue. It's literally every other thing and I'm just so tired of it all.

If you read my TedTalk, thank you, I'm sorry, and have a good day/night.
