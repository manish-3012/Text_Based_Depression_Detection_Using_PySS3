I Need Help and Donâ€™t Know What To DoAlmost everyday my partner is telling me they want to kill themself. Because of the political climate and because our jobs suck and because weâ€™re living in an apartment with a bad roommate and because nothing is interesting or that they care to do. They use to be on meds and now they arenâ€™t. They went to therapy but stopped after three days. I constantly try to encourage them to make a doctors appointment but they have too much anxiety to actually do it and it feels wrong to make the appointment for them. I know I canâ€™t force them to do anything, but Iâ€™m starting to get so burnt out and my parents donâ€™t support our relationship so I canâ€™t ask them for help. I donâ€™t have any friends I feel comfortable asking for help and my partner has said that I can not tell their family. They donâ€™t want to live anymore or care about anything and nothing I do or say is working anymore to lift them up or cheer them up and I feel like I am literally doing everything I can And I donâ€™t know what I can do anymore. I feel like I need to do something.
