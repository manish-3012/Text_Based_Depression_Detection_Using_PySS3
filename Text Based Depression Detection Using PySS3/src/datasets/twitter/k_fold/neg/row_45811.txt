Got in legal trouble, how can I live up to my expectations and go through this.Long story. So I basically knocked up my girlfriend and needed money to fund the abortion, so I broke into some dorms at my school and stole laptops/books. Did this again, other dorm, only stole money from peoples wallets. Awaiting court date, given order to not go into university housing (dorms). Was at my fraternitys party, one of my best friends little sisters was there, she was too drunk, i made sure to walk her back to her dorm. Went with her into lobby, some cop bringing other person out to detox recognized me from previously and got me for criminal trespassing. Went to county and got a drinking ticket too. My father died when I was 13, i feel that I have completely fucked myself and fallen so below any high expectations I was given. I'm looking at 3 charges of criminal trespassing, an underage drinking ticket, another criminal trespassing, disorderly conduct and theft, and some burglary. all 3 occurrences, different nights. And I've never had any prior convictions of anything.

I cant go to jail, I just dont know how I can ever fix my life, I feel like im in a black hole and I have completely fucked myself over and I'll always be labeled as a felon, criminal, and I dont know if i can live with myself with that title. I have completely fallen short of my high expectations that have been set by my family, I just dont know how I'll be able to live with myself after this. I cant hurt my family by having them lose a father from cancer and a son from suicide or jail, but I dont know what I can do. I feel like I am forever unclean, like my life is over and no one will ever want anything to do with me. I'll never get a good job, or get into any good post-grad schooling because I fucked up tremendously in the period of a month.
