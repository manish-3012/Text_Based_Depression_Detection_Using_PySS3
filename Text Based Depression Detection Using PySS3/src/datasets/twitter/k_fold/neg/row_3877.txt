re-planningHello, I have decided to replan my suicide. Nothing will stop me this time. Everytime I look at myself I'm disgusted. I dont want to live anymore, I dont want to have to do anything, I dont want to keep ruining things and fucki g shit up, hurting people, feeling like this. I know people want me to stay, like my brother, mother, my close friends, but as selfish as it is, I need more than them to keep me here. They cant help. No one can. I dont want them to anymore. I have never felt so low. They want me to stay and I feel sick with guilt, after I promised my brother I'd stay. But i cant. I cant stay alive to not hurt others whilst i stay here, suffering, in so much pain day to day. I can't. So I'm going. I dont want to talk about it, I dont want talking out of it, I just want to plan it whilst I'm ready before anything has a chance to change my mind. 

I dont know yet when I'll go. But I'm going. 
Perhaps before college starts again, then I will go.
