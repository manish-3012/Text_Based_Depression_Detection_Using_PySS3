I remembered how unloved by my family I am.I signed up for tennis back in high school. My dad only attended one game. But he made sure to be at every one of my younger brotherâ€™s football games.

I tried being positive and said I was good at something. My mom snorted derisively in response.

My parents spent thousands of dollars to send my brother all around the country for wrestling and football camps. I was shot down when I asked if I could do a study abroad program. â€œIt costs too much moneyâ€ is what they said.

I canâ€™t blame them. Six years in community college, and I donâ€™t even have an associates. Iâ€™m just working food service while my younger brother is working his dream job, and my older brother is headed for management positions.

And here I am. Suicidal and depressed. Nothing accomplished since I was born. I wish my parents aborted me. It would have saved them the trouble of having to deal with me.

Theyâ€™re good people. They donâ€™t deserve having a worthless piece of shit as a kid. I couldnâ€™t even be born a boy. I knew they wanted another son. But I fucked that up.

Once I kill myself, I can correct my mistake of being born into a good family as a horrible, hideous, worthless, unsuccessful, depressed, mopey, stupid, shitty, whiney, ignorant, lying, conceited, annoying, burdensome, awful, failure, disgraceful, lazy â€œ, inconsiderate, vengeful, bitter, moronic child that I am.
