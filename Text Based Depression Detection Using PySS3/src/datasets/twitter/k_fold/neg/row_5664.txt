I don't know what to doYears ago, my mother was diagnosed with severe depression, up to the point where she was put into the hospital for about 3 days. Although she is completely okay now, I have been dealing with issues for a year or more and I have been having a lot of suicidal thoughts, and 2017 has literally been the lowest point of my life so far. I am still a minor, so I talked to my parents about seeing a psychologist or therapist after putting it off for so long, but their reaction makes the entire situation much worse. My mother is not taking me seriously and she think that going to a church will solve all of my problems, but I am not a religious person at all and going to church is the last thing that I want to do. I have told her this, but she continues to make excuses as for why I am feeling this way. My dad also does the same thing, so I am at a loss and I have nobody to go to at this point. We aren't the most wealthy family, and I understand that a therapist can be costly, but my mom insists that if I get one she will have to get rid of some of my really important belongings, which is not a risk I am willing to take since they are all I have at this point. I have no idea how to get through this and I just want to get it over with and kill myself.
