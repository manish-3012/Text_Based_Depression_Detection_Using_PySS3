Not sure if I want to do it anymore.For the past 6 or so years I've been very self conscious about my appearance. Being ugly destroyed my self-esteem, confidence and as a result I'm now a social retard. I try not to go out to public places, I never step out of my comfort zone, I never came out because I feel like a complete anomaly in the gay community, since every gay person I've ever met is confident and good looking. Hating the way I look and the fear of living the rest of my life alone eventually got too much and I just stopped caring about everything during the past few months. Last night I tired to end it, I took around 350mg of diphenhydramine so I would become tired. When I could feel the effects I placed a plastic bag over my head and tried to seal it around my neck, but I guess passed out before I could seal it properly.

Today I woke up confused and even a little disappointed, wondering why I was still alive. Anyway, I continued my day as normal, I went to college, talked to my friends and went home. But now I'm not sure if I want to try again, at least not anytime soon. I still hate the way I look, and the fact that I'm gonna die a forever alone, but it did make me appreciate the things that I did have like my friends and family. 

My problem is that when I stopped caring I stopped doing my college work, to the point where I'm probably not even going to be able to get a pass grade in the course. I went though highschool and a year of college previously with barley anything to show for it. Now I've found something that I'm interested in and good at, and I'm still going to fail. I don't know how I'm going to explain this to my parents. I don't know what to do. I don't want them to find out this ever happened, but I feel like I don't have any choice. Do you guys have any advice on what I should do?
