Not suicidal, but I need some help...I hate my body. I know every girl probably says this but I feel like they don't know the same kind of hate I do. I've struggled with my weight all my life. I've always been a slightly chubby. Over the past year I've dieted on and off, and have lost a total of 40lbs. People say I look amazing, so thin and whatnot. But I just don't see it. I still feel as fat and ugly as I did 40 pounds ago. I stand in front of the mirror naked and just stare at what I hate. I tell my self how fat I am. I can't stand it. I want to just be happy with who I am but I can't. I'm pretty sure I might have body dysmorphic disorder.

The first 10 pounds I lost the healthy way. Working out and eating right. But the last 30 I've experimented with bulimia and anorexia. And unfortunately, I like it much better. I usually eat 500 calories a week. I know this is terribly unhealthy, and I feel MISERABLE all the time. But my problem is, I only feel happy mentally when I feel miserable physically. When I eat, I feel so much more energetic and not so fatigued, but mentally I feel SO fat and SO ugly. 

I hate feeling like this all the time. I really want to be like my friends, who are confident with their bodies just the way they are. I just want to be happy, Reddit. I need help, and traditional counseling doesn't seem to work...
