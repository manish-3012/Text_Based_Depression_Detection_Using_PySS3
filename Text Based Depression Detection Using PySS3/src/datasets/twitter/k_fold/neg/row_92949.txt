"Why do you want to kill yourself?" - someone asked me that last weekI was going to write this when I was a bit drunk but I need to get it off my chest now I suppose. So yeah someone, I won't elaborate on who, asked me this question. And all I could think was "is it that obvious?"

I crave social interaction but the fact is i genuinely don't like other people. They're too happy or too cringy for me to tolerate. I don't get people my own age and it's not like anyone else would get it. I'm fine most of the time by myself but those moments where you just want a friend to actually like you hit hard.

I've never had a relationship go longer than 3 months and my last real relationship ended when she cheated on me with my best friend(well former best friend, I won't ever speak to that rat ever again). 

I want to know what it's like to have someone like you. To find you attractive, but I hate the person I see. But that's the sad part isn't it? It dosent matter if you're dumb or smart or if you're ugly or pretty, it's all the same when you're dead. 

And I won't go to a therapist, there's nothing I hate more than the idea of paying some quack to dig about in my head for a solution that doesn't solve the overarching problem. The only comfort I have is alcohol and I will keep it close to me till the end.

I'm tired now. I guess I have been for quite some time.
