need adviceHey guys i ve recently come to a problem like in my country i did not go so well and maybe i become sth i dont want to.Anyways i applied for a uni in sweden and i might have not been accepted (reserve like 2 months and the sign up deadline is august 28).As i said i might have been accepted by a uni here in my country (fathers job) and i dont like it at all, neither the life im going to have back in my village nor the job itself.My only gateway was this uni because okay its sth i really like and feel kind for this chance i got, even for the application i made and it seems that because i didnt had a good grade in high school (a bitch teacher who didnt liked me) drop the grade like 1,5 and in this time by different circumstances i could have been there.Any reason to live a life i hate?
