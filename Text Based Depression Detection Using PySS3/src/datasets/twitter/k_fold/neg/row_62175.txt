Social inability is going to be the death of me.I am unable to effectively socialize with others.  In my three years of college, despite being involved in a research group and several clubs, I have been unable to develop a single meaningful relationship.  

Whenever I'm with others, I essentially turn mute.  Between social anxiety, insecurities in my social capability, and being uncomfortable in groups, I can never get the words out, let alone think of them in first place.  Even with my friends I am most comfortable with, I always stumble over my words and end up mumbling purely out of fear of being mute the entire time.

Has anyone else overcome a similar issue?  I live every day longing for interaction, but struggle with even the simplest hellos, and it has been fueling my suicidal thoughts as of late.
