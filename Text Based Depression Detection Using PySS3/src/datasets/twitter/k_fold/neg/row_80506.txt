enoughi am of the opinion this life isnt worth living

its utterly sad and tragic

society is pretty cuthroat

if you dont fit in you are a outkast

you hover on the edge not living 

why put up with it its plainly not worth it

people let you down turn their backs on you

i dont have a friend in the world

every day it gets worse and worse

i am tired of all of this
