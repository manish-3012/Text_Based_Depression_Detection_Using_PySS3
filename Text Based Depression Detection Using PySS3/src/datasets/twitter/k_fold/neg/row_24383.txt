So scared after all of itAfter a break up and a terrible episode of depression I was too close to ending it.

I decided to pull it together and ask for help, one of my professors who is close to me spent so much money for my therapy. 

I had my last session almost a couple months ago. I was fine but as time is passing I am feeling so lonely and I am so afraid I am feeling suicidal again. I am so afraid of letting anyone know because I am tired of being a burden I feel like ending it.
