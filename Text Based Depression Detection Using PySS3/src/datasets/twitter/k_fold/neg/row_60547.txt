Ever get the feeling that you've fucked everything up so hard and there's no going back?I've come to the realization lately that I don't like who i currently am. I don't know what I've done with the choices I've made, and i can't sleep at night thinking about all the shit I didn't do.

I don't think I've felt truly happy in months. Too many responsibilities and too much pressure, all of which I've put upon myself. 

It'd be easier to blow my brains out.
