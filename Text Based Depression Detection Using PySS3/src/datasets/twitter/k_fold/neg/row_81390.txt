Nothing is getting better.I'm trying really hard to make things better. I'm going to the gym for 2 hours a day. I'm trying to talk to new people. I'm communicating with my family and a few select friends about how I'm feeling. Yet I still find myself thinking of the best ways to kill myself nearly every night. And I'm too scared to do it anyway. I've stayed up late staring a knives thinking about what the best way to go would be.

I just really want everything to get better. I keep crying for no reason and it feels really emasculating. I hate myself the most I ever have at this point I wish that I'd never tried and that I'd jumped infront of a train when I had the chance.
