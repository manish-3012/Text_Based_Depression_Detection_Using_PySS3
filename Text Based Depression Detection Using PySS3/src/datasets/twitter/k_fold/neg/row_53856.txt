pls help meDude what the fuck am I supposed to do? Ive been so god damn depressed since as long as I can remember but I just cant bring myself to end it all. I drift through the days not knowing or caring what happened. All I do is sulk around in apathy. Im just done. Nothing gives me joy anymore nor takes the pain away. I just want to burn
