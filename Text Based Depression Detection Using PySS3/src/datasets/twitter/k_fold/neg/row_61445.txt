Embracing Pain. Loving the Darkest Parts of Me.All the Monsters in my closet are parts of me, and since I started inviting them out to play and hang out instead of fearing their existence and shoving them away every chance they appeared, I have feel a sense of wholeness and peace I never thought possible. What I am suggesting is that the Monsters that haunt you are all parts of self you have rejected. Just because everyone else is shit and nobody loves you, doesnt mean you should do the same to you. Want revenge on all the assholes? Love yourself. Sounds tricky, right? Its simple. Decide you love yourself. Decide often. And when an ungly monster rears its head, see what it has to say. Listen. That monster is a part of you. Embrace it. See what happens.
