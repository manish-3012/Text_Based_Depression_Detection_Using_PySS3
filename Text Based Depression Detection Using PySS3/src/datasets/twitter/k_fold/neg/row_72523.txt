Just tired of doing this shit called lifeIm 17 and ive been depressed for 4 years now and im starting to spiral out of control. Ive tried asking my family for help but they just call me a failure and tell me to get a job. Ive been drinking and taking Xanax just so i can feel something. I honestly think that i wont make it much longer.
