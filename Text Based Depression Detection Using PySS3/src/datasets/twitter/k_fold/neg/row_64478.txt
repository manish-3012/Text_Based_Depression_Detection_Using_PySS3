WorriedI'm a fucking idiot. I'm not pregnant, but I might be. I'm still a teenager. No, I didn't have unprotected sex. I'm not THAT stupid. But condoms aren't 100% safe, even if they are close. I live with a mother who fucking hates me and a father who cares only for my grades. I asked my mother "haha, here's a funny joke. What if I was pregnant?" She replied dead seriously, "if you're pregnant i'll either kick you out with the child or kick you out and take your child." The last thing I could possibly want in this lifetime is for a child that I might have to be raised by my mother. I asked counselors at school what I should do if I was pregnant but we all know by know that guidance counselors/student assistance counselors are worth nothing. If I am pregnant, I WILL have to kill myself. There's no other option.
