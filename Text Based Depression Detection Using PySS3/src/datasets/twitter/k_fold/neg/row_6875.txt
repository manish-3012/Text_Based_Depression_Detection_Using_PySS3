Another pointless day on the hampster wheel.Wake up, take care of kids, go to meaningless job, come home,  take care of kids, scrounge dinner, finish the work I didnâ€™t get done during the day, go to bed dreading having to get up and do the same crap over again tomorrow. I thought I felt better yesterday, but here I am again just wanting to be done with it. The lulz of it is that I donâ€™t ever have long enough alone to kill myself. I realize Iâ€™m the one who made all the decisions that put me where I am, and Iâ€™d be burdening everyone around me with the consequences, but in the grand scheme of things, none of it matters anyway.
