Still a child.I want to keep this short... But I know I will fail. And I know I might just delete this because of how "public" this is... I thought about messaging the mods but... I am not comfortable with that too.

Anyways... Fingers crossed.

I am not depressed. I bet if I went to any psychiatrist, they'll say the same. Psychologists may give "OCD". And yes, I do have OCD. But I am not depressed.

Which makes suicide even worse. Clarification: None of you know me... So let me just say this... I am not going to kill myself tonight or.. in the near future, at least. Why? Cuz I'm not depressed. Cuz I don't have the... Liberty... To be rid of this world.

But still... I pray and I pray that someone somewhere, in real life or on social media, just gives me a kick up the ass so I can go jump off a bridge. But I know... Unfortunately, I am not going to do it. I'm not even going to leave my bed.

Reasons to wish to die? Only one long term. Firstly, I am 20 years old and male. Country may matter but I hate it so... Leave it.

1) There have to be some renovations in my house and so I need to vacate my room and move to the other bedroom for 10 to 15 days.

I just got off a stressful exam and this is my vacation. I need rest with my PC and with my bed.

Hence the title... Still a child. Above 18 but still a child unable to leave his room. Pathetic.

I hope these 10 days can push me.

2) Family.

Step dad isn't here... And when he is... He cares only for work work work. And my mother is busy with my brother who recently got married. I won't sugarcoat it: I feel alone.

3) Girlfriend.

Yes. I have one. A crazy one. I need to break up with her. She hurts me and angers me beyond what I can control. I have hit her.

I am not a good person who deserves to be on this planet. I know. Then give me a pill to die and I promise you... I won't be here tomorrow. It's the other methods... Jumping... It involves driving to a bridge. Where people are. I can't. I can't make a public spectacle.

Back to the girlfriend... She has ruined my life. And I have ruined hers.

We should break up. Yet each time we try it... I feel alone. So I text her. And I make it up. And the stupid idiot that she is who believes she's in "love"... She comes back.

It is love... She does love me. But why doesn't she see that I am a horrible person who is only going to hurt her if we ever got married?

Stop texting her? I wish it was that easy... Emotions. Reddit is no friend of mine. I don't feel comfortable with the judging eyes. Neither do I have friends in real life to go to. The emotions, they're too strong. I will text her.

4) Sleep schedule.

Yeah, it's reversed. Slept at 1030 and woke up at 1930. And now... I have a whole night to stay up... Alone. All alone.

5) Health.

Epilepsy(minor). I don't know how many doses I've missed because of the schedule. I just had an aura(it's like a warning before a seizure).

I would very much like a seizure. Honestly, it is for attention. And I feel as if in each seizure, my dead father visits me. Family will notice me if I'm having a fucking seizure.

In health... Many other niggling issues. Diet is pure cheese and all that junk food. So, my stomach and my intestine are ruined. Backpain and neckpain due to whatever reason.

***

To sum up.... I am a mess.

But no, not as bad as a "normal" suicidal person. Hence why I don't post here... What place do I have here?

I'm not depressed. Sleep is because I like binge watching TV shows. My diet is the same as 5 years ago. It is just showing its normal effect on my body. I haven't had a seizure in over a year (possibly two or more years).

I just feel like a "plastic"... Fake. Looking for attention.



Regardless of the truthfulness... I just wish to die. I know you aren't going to help push me. You are not going to give me a way. You'll try to keep me here or you'll just read this and upvote and go. "Thoughts and prayers". Okay.

Then why am I here?

Because I'm alone. Because I do wish to die. If I can muster up LITTLE FUCKING STRENGTH... I can attempt to die. I don't even know if jumping into the river kills you to be honest.

It is childish. I had real reasons years ago... Depression, unable to cope with OCD, unable to meet my girlfriend, etc...

But now they have all vanished. On paper, I should be happy. It is vacation. I am probably winning a gold medal for topping my college. I still have a girlfriend who loves me.

But "suicide" remained constant. I wanted to die then and I want to die tonight.

But again... I won't use my strength.

What do I want from you? Well, I would prefer you to push me to kill myself by saying that I'm a horrible person to hit my girlfriend... But yeah... It's not r/sucidedoit... It's r/suicidewatch.

So... I guess I want the same as always. Attention. My family and my girlfriend are busy at the moment so I turn to my last option.

Say a few words. Then go... Help others who deserve it.
