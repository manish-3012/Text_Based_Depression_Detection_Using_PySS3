tired of this pitiful existence. i might kill myself soonthere is no place for me. i'm an 18 year old autistic trans (or at the least gender questioning) person. i know that already makes people have no sympathy for me. I know i'm a disgusting, broken human, and i fucking mean it that i'd never wish this on anyone. It's torture, waking up and hating yourself but knowing you can't really do a damn thing about it, because in the end, people don't change their nature of hating others they fail to show even the slightest bit of empathy towards what you've gone through. My family is religious, and i stopped caring about religion a long time ago, but God is a fucking tyrant. If i had a choice this wouldn't be me. 

I've never been normal and i am jealous of people who seem to find life easy and get things handed to them. Even if curing being gender-confused was a thing, there's no way to stop being autistic. Supposedly we are prediposed to being LGBT.. i've suffered with mental health problems, trauma, not fitting in/bullied my entire life. no amount of therapy will make me truly happy anyway so what's the damn point? I'm autistic after all, everyone knows they're not equal.

i fucking hate going to LGBT support groups and feeling butterflies in my stomach and feeling accepted for the first time in my life just to have it taken away by people who want to treat me as even more subhuman. I fucking hate knowing that i'll probably commit suicide either way eventually, even if transitioning will delay that. I bet this post will get reposted to one of those trans-hating subs, so everyone can agree that i am a waste of a life and should end it right now and i agree with them. I am so tired i bothered writing a 3 paragraph long post while my chest hurts from crying so much.

I've been scared of doing it because i don't want to hurt my family. but what's there to lose now? they'll all hate me anyway
