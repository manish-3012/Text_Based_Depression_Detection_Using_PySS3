Advice needed when visiting a suicidal person in the hospitalI've been asked to go with my boyfriend to see his niece (14) today for an hour at the hospital. She had attempted suicide just a week or two ago by taking all of her antidepressants. This is the second time she's been hospitalized for suicidal thoughts/attempts since December of last year. I feel it may be largely due to her parents having issues and getting divorced in the same time period. The two of us aren't especially close, and I'm not really sure what to say or expect. I've never been in this type of situation before. I was told I can't bring her any food or cards or anything really. Maybe this is the wrong sub, but does anyone have any words of advice?
