Iâ€™m thinking about offing myselfIâ€™m 18, addicted to drugs, and I ruined my life. So Iâ€™ve been doing drugs since I was 15, and eventually they slowly ruined my life. I didnâ€™t get good grades in high school, I barely graduated. So I feel like I wonâ€™t be able to get into college. Iâ€™m not good at math either. When I turned 18 I started smoking pills, fake percocets that were stuffed with fentanyl. I know this because a drug test I took came back positive for fentanyl. I went to rehab my first time and after I got out I relapsed and went to rehab again, Iâ€™m currently still in a sober program. A lower level care rehab. I feel like I robbed myself of my childhood my parents threaten to kick me out over the slightest slip up, and I canâ€™t hang out with any of my friends anymore that I consider family. And on top of all this my parents are thinking about moving to boring ass Idaho or Utah. I turn 19 the 21st of august, and Iâ€™m really considering killing myself on my birthday, itâ€™s stressful for me because I feel like I need to find a job to get out of my parents house because if I fuck up and even smoke some weed Iâ€™ll be kicked out. And if youâ€™re an addict like me, its not that easy to â€œjust say noâ€. I wish it were that easy. So now here I am, forced to grow up and live a boring isolated life and just work all the time. I canâ€™t see myself Enjoying life without any drugs, I donâ€™t want the highlight of my life to be fucking Narcotics Anonymous meetings. Iâ€™m so depressed I feel so trapped. I just want this all to end. I canâ€™t take the pain anymore
