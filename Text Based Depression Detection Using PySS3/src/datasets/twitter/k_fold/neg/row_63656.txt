I don't want to die. It just seems like the best option. I don't even know why. But, today I learned that the only reason my mom hasn't yelled at me for being an attention-seeking bitch, is because my stoic dad (who is in UAE right now, with another 8 months before he comes home) told her not to. Because he's worried about me. And you know it's bad when my dad starts to worry. 
But I have a few great friends who care, and a great life, and ambitions and dreams, but I just want all of this yelling and screaming and hating myself to end. Permanently. And it's not easy. I tried to commit suicide three years ago, and again two weeks ago. 

I was supposed to have an appointment with a doctor this week. My counselors told my mom that she had to schedule an appointment, and yet, she's said nothing. She hasnt even brought it up. Its like she doesnt see how serious this is.~~Its like she doesnt even care~~  This post seems kind of all over the place, but I just wanted to let it out...
