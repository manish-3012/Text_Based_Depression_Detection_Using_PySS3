Sparing the living...Months ago I picked a date and it's coming up soon. The water is cold enough here now that it will do what I need it to do in no time. I just have to wait another couple of weeks so I don't spoil the holidays and everything will be fine.

There's only one problem left, and I don't know how to handle it.

One of my best friends is a first responder in my town and I don't want him to be there when they find me. I don't know how to tell him to stay home without telling him why... I had a thought that maybe the friend I've reached out to that doesn't actually seem to care too much if I live or die might be willing to run interference on that night for me. But I'm not sure I trust him, either.

It's hard to explain the feeling I have about this because I know I \*can't\* regret if he finds me. There won't be any me to feel regret. But I still am burdened by it. This is the torture of a damaged mind, I guess.

For now I am simply looking for advice... how do you warn off someone without tipping them off? Is it possible... and should I bother?
