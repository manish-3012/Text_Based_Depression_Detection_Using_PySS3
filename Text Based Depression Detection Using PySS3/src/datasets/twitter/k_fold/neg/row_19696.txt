Thoughts againIt's been eight months since my last suicidal though, 13months since my last goodbye letters, and 11 months since my suicide attempt which would've worked had it not been for a random person calling an ambulance after seeing me. I've been depressed and felt horrible but it wasn't until this month that I started actively thinking of it again. I just get hit with one thing after another. At first I was happy that my suicide attempt didn't work... But now I wish it had. Idk what to do anymore
