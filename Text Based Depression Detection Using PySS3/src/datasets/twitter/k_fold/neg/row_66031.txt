Got nothing going for meCollege has been difficult to the point where I don't even know if I'm capable of being what I wish to be. My partner doesn't feel the same way since I can't see him as often as I could. I'm just not good enough for anything. My family is shit. I just wanna go already their is no happiness here. I wanna leave.
