Iâ€™m ready to dieIâ€™m a 26 year old guy struggling with severe mental health issues which keep me paralyzed. I donâ€™t have a social life and I tend to sabotage my friendships. I have a few close friendships that Iâ€™ve developed in the past year with a couple of 18 year olds I used to work with. Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship and Iâ€™m not sexually active. Iâ€™m gay and I canâ€™t come to terms with it from a moral standpoint. Gay sex is unnatural to me and is damaging to my mental health and I canâ€™t see myself living normally. I refuse to date men and am not interested in having a family due to moral issues so Iâ€™m quite lonely. Iâ€™ve decided that Iâ€™m going to end it all in 3 weeks. I have severe issues and am unequipped to take care of myself so I live with my mom and donâ€™t have a license. I was thinking of disappearing on the 23rd and hitchhiking and taking public transportation across the country so I cam see the U.S. and partake in an adventure before I die. Then Iâ€™m going to get drunk in a hotel room and slit my wrists in the tub. I want to leave $100 for the staff member who will find my body as a sorry for having put them through this potential trauma. I want to document my journey through photographs so my family and friends can see the last moments I experienced before ending my life and hopefully that will bring them some comfort. How does this plan sound?
