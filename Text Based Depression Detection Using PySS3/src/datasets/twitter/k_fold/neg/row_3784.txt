"daddy issues"hi, they talk about girls with "daddy issues" like they're whores, and i'll admit that all of my relationships I participated in were an attempt to fill a hole in my heart

I suppose I should start at the beginning. my father was the one who spanked me when i was bad (i self-harm to this day). he was always the one who yelled at me when i did something wrong. when my mom couldn't get me to confess to something, my dad was brought in. him screaming at me usually could get something out of me, even if it was a lie. 

as i grew older, my father would usually interrupt me with "why aren't you saying [insert me agreeing with him/being thankful/me apologizing]" whenever i had the audacity to argue with him. this continues to this day.

one day, i yelled at my father back for the first time for the first year, instead of just breaking down into tears like i usually did. he threatened to spank me, despite me being 18

nothing i ever say is good enough, nothing i ever due is free from criticism, i always fuck up, im always in the wrong

i would outline all of the arguments ive had with him but if im honest with you they're all the same

1) i do something wrong
2) i try to defend what i did
3) get interrupted
4) dad goes on a rant about how i don't appreciate, don't apologize, how im bad, etc
5) this upsets me
6) dad apologizes for yelling, what he said, says im right
7) make up

then it repeats when i fuck something else up

hes told me im close-minded, stubborn, stupid, a host of bad things, but the worst is that he doesn't really listen to me

he'll just stop talking and turn away, because his lecture didn't get to me

i apologize for bad grammar, i kind of just wanted to put my feelings somewhere

im probably going to go to college counciling tomorrow too

i do really want to self-harm tonight, i think about suicide often and i have a headache from crying about it so much

sorry to leave all of my baggage here
