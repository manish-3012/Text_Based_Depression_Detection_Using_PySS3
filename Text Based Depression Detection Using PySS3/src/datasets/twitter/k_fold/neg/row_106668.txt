I really don't see the point in living anymore (trigger warning)im 13, a trans male. i have 16 mental disorders.  i am in foster care, because i was sexually, physically, and mentally abused by my parents and brothers from age 5 to 10. its 2 am and im alone with only my thoughts to keep me company. i have scars and fresh wounds from SH on my wrists and thighs. its like im in a dark cave with only one way out, suicide. i dont have access to therapy because my case worker and parents dont think theres anything wrong with me, even though im 5' 3" and weight 62 pounds due to anorexia. but anyways, im gonna make the plans soon.
