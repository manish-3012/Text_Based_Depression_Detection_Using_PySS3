My university punishes helpSo Iâ€™ve been hospitalized twice in the last couple months for suicidal ideation. Then I had to go to student conduct to â€œtalkâ€ about it bc those attempts involved alcohol. Basically they told me there would be issues if that happened again. I tried to explain that I wasnâ€™t getting drunk to party but to deal with my mental health issues but that didnâ€™t matter. So Iâ€™ve had one suicide attempt and am currently working on a second because Iâ€™m too afraid to call the non emergency police again because of what student conduct said. Should I go to the policeâ€™s non emergency number again bc I need it or should I care more about my fucking education as a first generation student who is trying to make sure I can repay my family someday. I cannot get kicked out of this school. This school is the way for my family to get out of poverty. But I want to die. And maybe this isnâ€™t the right sub. Iâ€™m so sorry if I misinterpreted this sub and this is super triggering. I just donâ€™t know where else to turn. Iâ€™m so sorry.
