If i take 100 of my anti depresant pills, thats a lethal doseAm researching ways how to kill myself again. I dont think im gonna actually do it, but there is still a small risk i can. I could hoard my anti depresant pills up and then take them all at once, but theres a risk it wont be enough and i might just end up permanently disabled due to brain damage or something, but its still something im considering to do.

I have shit life situation currently. I have piles of assigments and less than a month to do all them and im just... im just giving up. I cant give a shit anymore. I just want this all to end. Im sick of being alive. I just want to die. I havent done anything today besides gaming for 30 minutes twice and then going back to sleep. 

Im a failure. I should just fucking kill myself.
