Killing myself or somethingFor several times I had suicide thoughts. But this time, there is a difference. I didn't tell anybody, because I don't want them to stop me. I really really don't want them to stop me. Well actually... I couldn't tell anyone, even if I wanted to. Because there is no one that I could explain my pain to them.

I just can't see a bright future... I can't even imagine who this pain would end. So... When I think of killing myself and ending this pain within few hours, I can't resist.
There is only a problem... I really love my parents. They really love me too. I know how they would suffer from my death. But I am suffering too.

That's it.
I don't even know you... I don't seek for your help... Or maybe I do... I have no idea why I have written all these. Maybe somewhere inside, I need someone to persuade me not to kill myself, so my parents won't suffer. Or maybe I just need someone to tell me nobody understand how much pain I have, and I really have the right to end this pain, without caring about others. Or maybe I just need to tell others that I am dying.
I really don't know.
This pain has destroyed me such that I can not even think clearly...

I really really really need to end my life... I really want to do it.
