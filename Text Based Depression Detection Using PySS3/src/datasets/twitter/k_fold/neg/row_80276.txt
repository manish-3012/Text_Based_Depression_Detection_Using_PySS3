i keep indulging in drugs in order to put myself under a larger load of unfinished work so i will be pressured to kill myselfafter i failed to get into any colleges, i felt nothing. i had gone almost as far as i wanted to in life. in fact i hoped that i would get rejected by every place i applied so i could end up doing something else with my life. even now i am lying to myself about what i want by putting in so much effort for a early transfer program. so i sabotage all of this work by indulging in a drug habit. ive gotten high everyday of the past 2 weeks. i get high at school and home. ive driven high several times. im typing this bullshit high af. i hope that one day when i wake up sober i will realize how much ive fucked up my life and end it. i dont know what this post achieves. i just want a place to practice talking abt my real feelings so i can say the right words to my friends when i kill myself. i wont die until i can find something to say that will make them know that it is none of their faults
