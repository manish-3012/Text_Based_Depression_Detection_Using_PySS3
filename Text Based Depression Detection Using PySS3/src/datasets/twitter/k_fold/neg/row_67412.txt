Why do people think they're better than I am?I don't get it. I have an education, but I don't think that makes me better than everyone else, I don't lord it over someone who doesn't have one's head, and I treat people with respect. Yet people act like they're better than I am. They dismiss my ideas as misguided, I have to justify my every action (or lack of action), and no one believes my explanations. I just...don't get it. Why are there so many people who are completely convinced they're better than other people, and refuse to treat other people as their equals. No patronizing, no acting like they are the final arbiter of what is and isn't reasonable. Why can't more people be more humble. You don't necessarily know more than I do, so knock it off.
