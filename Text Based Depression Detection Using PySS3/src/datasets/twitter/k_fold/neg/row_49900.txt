Running out of optionsI'll try to keep this as short and clear as possible.

I'm 24, and I've had issues with depression and anxiety for years following a pretty rough/hardcore sexual assault. I've attempted suicide a couple of times already, and I had a stint in an inpatient psych unit. For a long time I self medicated with alcohol and weed. I'm clean and sober now and have been for over a year, but I was caught with a nug of weed I had still in my car (after I'd stopped smoking). So now I'm in legal trouble too.

I can't find a job, so I can't move out of my toxic parent's house. I'm also facing jail time over fucking weed of all things because I can't afford the diversion program and probation is also expensive. My boyfriend is the only person I have who really gets me, tries to help, and makes me feel better, but he lives across the city so I barely see him.

I just feel like I can never get ahead of my past and I'm running out of options. I just don't see a way to improve my life anymore and I don't see the point of continuing to live in a way that just makes me miserable.
