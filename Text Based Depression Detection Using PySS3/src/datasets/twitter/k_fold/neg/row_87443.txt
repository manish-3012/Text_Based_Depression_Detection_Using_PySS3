I think I'm finally getting helpI'm not going to work at all tomorrow, I'm calling out from both of my jobs and I'm finally going to get the help I need. 

I've been up and down a lot, I almost killed myself just last week, and that was my wake up call. I'm tired of dicking around and feeling bad for myself. I'm tired of putting off getting the help I need. It's getting harder and harder not to cut myself every day, and my walks home are just filled with thoughts of stepping out into traffic.

I am going to finally be the adult I keep wishing I was and I'm going to get some much needed help. 

I'm done crying over myself, I'm done. In this moment of clarity I am declaring myself to be done and to be finally getting the help I need.
