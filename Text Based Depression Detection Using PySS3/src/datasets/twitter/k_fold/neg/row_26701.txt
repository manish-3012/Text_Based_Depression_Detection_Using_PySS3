so i was walking home the other day, and decided to kill myself.obviously i haven't gone through with it, which is a good thing. i suffer from chronic pain - every day i wake up and feel like i've been assaulted in my sleep. i can't sit upright for too long otherwise my back gets excruciatingly sore. it's gotten to the point where i can't feel my other aches and pains because the illness is so bad.

that's why, when i saw the doctor the other day and he told me i'd have to cut back on the medication i was taking (opiates and sleeping pills) i felt somewhat distraught. i didn't even get an exit strategy for the sleeping pills, so now i have to stay awake until i pass out from sheer exhaustion, which can take a day or so, and somehow attempt to make the most of my shitty life on two or three hours of sleep in constant agony. i was walking home from the doctors, which unfortunately gave me time to ruminate on the problem, and i realised that the one thing holding me back from just going home and slitting my throat in the bathtub was gone.

that one thing was caring what my friends and my family would think, and how i didn't want them to be unhappy if i did kill myself. it didn't feel very good to admit that, but i knew i could finally just *do* it and end five years and counting of being in pain. luckily, my mood improved before i got home and i managed to just settle down and watch a movie, so i didn't do anything about it beyond tell my parents.

but i think it'll probably happen again, and i might be closer to something i can actually do myself some damage with. dark days are coming, with no sleeping medication to knock me down at night and more pain on the horizon as i lower my dosage of painkillers. i need help, because my doctor isn't helping much. i just want to be okay, but there are times when i just want to be dead instead, as that provides a permanent solution.
