A friend in trouble? or being dramatic...can't tell :|I experienced something last night that was life changing.  I have a friend who lost their job, their love and overall enjoyment for life.  This person gave me messages I'm not sure what to do with.  They said that they want to disappear, sell everything and collect from their retirement fund. They want to know what it's like to leave and not tell anyone.  Death was mentioned a few times, but assured me that they weren't going to kill themselves. They mentioned having trouble in the past and thought this was a chance to be different, but to no avail...it wasn't.  It was a confusing moment and I have never seen anyone so devoid of emotion.  This person isn't a good friend of mine, but told me things they haven't told anyone.

Later on, they told me after last night, they weren't going to speak to me again and that I should accept it.  It was 2 hours of my life I never thought I'd experience.  Confused and Worried.
