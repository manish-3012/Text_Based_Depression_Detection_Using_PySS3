I don't know how to feel anymore. I don't know if I'm depressed, but I certainly am sad. I don't have any reason to be particularly angry or sad about, I have bad things that's happened to me that I can't explain why... but I try to look back on those types of things and get what I can from them. As soon as I thought I was over with my depression, it just comes back. I'm too afraid to get help from somebody in person... I'm just a teenage girl and I don't think my parents would take me seriously. I use to self mutilate, and they knew and they didn't do anything about it and I really wish they would've as much as I don't. Anyhow, the depression keeps sneaking back up on me out of nowhere.

Here's **my** story, Reddit. 
I use to play video games all day every day, barely showered/ate or did anything else for that matter. I was angry at everybody for whatever reason I could find. I met my boyfriend a month and a half ago and we started dating, I spent less and less time online playing video games and more time with him and now when I'm not with him I don't know what to do. I sit here and I cry and I think of horrible things, about how I can kill myself and nobody would care.

I don't know what to do, I'm not sure if I'm suicidal... I use to think about it often but now I just don't know how I would do it. It'd be too much work, 

If you can understand this mess of words, I just needed to vent and I would like to hear what you have to say and would like your advice and support. *Thankyou*.
