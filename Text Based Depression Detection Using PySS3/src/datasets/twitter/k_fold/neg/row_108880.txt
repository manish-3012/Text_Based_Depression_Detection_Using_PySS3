People say to wait until you grow, people say to wait and it will get better...but what the fuck are we supposed to do until then?Like just what the fuck. What am I supposed to do for over 4 years with no guarantee and when I donâ€™t know what happiness feels like ? Spend my days crying, cutting, feeling numb, feeling empty and frustrated, feeling apathetic and artificial and uncaring, every second being shit and garbage? What, am I a fucking robot? Are we in general, as a bunch of hopeless depressed people, actually just a bunch of robots who donâ€™t feel and think, who are just supposed to magically pass the day? Jesus Christ what the fuck
