I really want to dieWhen will the depression and suicidal thoughts end? I donâ€™t see anything good in staying alive. I can either stay alive feeling like absolute shit for the rest of my life, or I end it all and the thoughts are finally gone. I donâ€™t want to face the reality of life in the future. Iâ€™d rather give in and end my life. Staying alive will not be worth it.
