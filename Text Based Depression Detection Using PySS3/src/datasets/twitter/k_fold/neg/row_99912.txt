I keep getting nagging thoughts telling me to kill myselfWhenever I get bored I keep getting intrusive thoughts that wonâ€™t shut up, they keep repeating phrases telling me specific ways to either damage or kill myself and I try to distract myself but nothing is fun and Iâ€™m constantly bored so I have nothing to focus on except the nagging thoughts and I know my life isnâ€™t going to get better so I donâ€™t know why I resist the urges but Iâ€™m scared I think and Iâ€™m probably just doing it for attention anyway because Iâ€™m manipulative and toxic and I know it will hurt people if I kill myself and Iâ€™ll say I donâ€™t want that but I donâ€™t trust myself
