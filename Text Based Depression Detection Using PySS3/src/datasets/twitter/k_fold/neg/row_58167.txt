i just want someone to talk tolong story short, 18/m/canada been depressed and suicidal since 2006. been getting worse and worse over the past couple of days ever since my last exam. spent the better part of Tuesday debating whether or not to off myself, ended up in a fetal position in bed for most of the afternoon trying to sleep, hoping that i wouldn't wake up

i hate myself so fucking much it's incredible how i haven't killed myself already. i'm lonely, unattractive and my personality is fucking shit, but goddamn, all i fucking want is someone to talk to. could be about anything, fuck, we can even play a fucking steam game or something, just fucking anything until i pick my dad up at the airport in a few hours

please

edit: i'm going to bed to try to get some sleep, many thanks to those who took time out of their day to talk
