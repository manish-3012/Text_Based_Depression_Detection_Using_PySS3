I should have just done it this morningI'm so fucking tired of constantly being disappointed and horrified by society. People are assholes and morons, and we will be our own downfall. I shouldn't have to stay and suffer. Shit, I don't know why I post here, Reddit is just an echo chamber of depression. It's this or nothing.  I want to cry but I'm so both emotionally blunted from meds (I've been spending months weening off of that I should have never been put on to begin with by a hack doctor who has since been fired for basically malpractice) and exhaustion, that I can't. All pain, no release. [Fuck everything, everyone, all of it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVfvBq0aW8w)
