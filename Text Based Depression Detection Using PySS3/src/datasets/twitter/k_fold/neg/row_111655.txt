How to get rid of the â€œincelâ€ mindsetIâ€™ve been feeling like killing myself for a few years now. Part of the reason I want to kill myself is my lack of any romantic/sexual experience. I am 18 and I have social anxiety to the point where people can notice my hands and face shaking during normal conversations. It has gotten so bad to the point where I just hide from everybody. I spend most of my days at college sitting in my car at the parking lot waiting for the next class. I have posted here many times talking about how desperately I want to commit suicide. However, I am too scared to go through with it at the moment. Sometimes, I just feel like life wonâ€™t be worth living in the long run.
