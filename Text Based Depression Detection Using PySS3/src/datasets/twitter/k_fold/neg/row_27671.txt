I lost almost all hope I had for a good life and now I just am considering how to die without making a mess of such a fuss, don't wanna create (more) problems to my husbandmy mental issues are taking the best of me and I am about to give up. I don't feel like myself again, I don't want to do anything that used to make me happy, I just want to not be anymore. My meds are gone and I don't have money to buy more or even go to the doctor to get a prescription bc I am unemployed

But I don't want to let a even bigger mess for my husband to deal with, he doesn't deserve this

I just am tired of feeling this useless and weak
