I'm getting better, but I still need help.Hey, I'm O-dak, a 14 year old genderfluid pansexual male, you may or may not know me, I've actually been a part of this community for a while, Yesterday I talked to /u/cwhite1026 , when I explained my problems, I realized the idea of me healing isn't as farfetched as I make it out to be, I just need to promptly tell my parents about my suicidal thoughts; so they can find me help, I just need advice on how to present the fact that I am suicidal, any ideas? Edit: (btw, don't know how to pm) Edit: and if you want to see the post in which I talked to, and explained my problems to /u/cwhite1026 , here it is: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4b0lt3/i_dont_know_what_to_do_kinda_long/ just a warning! it is very long!
