Today feels like the dayI'm a terrible wife who makes my husband angry and asks too much of him and I contribute nothing. I cant even have babies. I'm 33 and I'm so in debt and it's all my fault. I have plenty of pills to do the job. I cant decide if I should do it here or sneak out and drive somewhere so he wont have to be the one to find me. Probably the latter.
