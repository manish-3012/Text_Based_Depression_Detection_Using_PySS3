I want my life to change... because I can't live this anymoreI am in an abusive relationship that I stay in because I always make excuses for him.  I had only my friends left, who I had doubted really cared about me, and today it was kind of confirmed they don't even like me and I think have been humoring me as to not hurt my feelings.


I apparently have no social skills.  I get a friend and I am willing to do anything for that friend but have absolutely no idea how to read their signals.  This is one thing that pisses my boyfriend off too.  Because of this I end up doing harmless things that end up pissing people off, and i can never tell they are angry.   I apparently ruined all of my friendships by doing this, and only found out today.  Of course I was too stupid and oblivious to even realize there had been problems taht started about a year ago.  I judt had no clue.  I was really blindsided by this information.  


I don't have any family but my mother.  She has no friends, no family, nothing, even my sister has disowned her and i am the only one still in contact with her.  she has munchausen by proxy and has... well... things were rough growing up.  When I am in her life I am enabling her, when I'm out of it she has literally no one and starts talking about suicide.


So today I came to the realization I have no one really.  you know 5, 6 years ago I knew I was a social idiot but I thought I had changed.  I guess not.  I don't have much hope for myself at this point.
