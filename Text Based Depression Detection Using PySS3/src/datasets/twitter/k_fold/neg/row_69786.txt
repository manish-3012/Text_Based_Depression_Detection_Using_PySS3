i donâ€™t know if i can do it anymoretonight i realized that everything is the same. iâ€™ve felt this way for years and years. every time it gets better for a while, it always gets worse. iâ€™m so tired of getting my hopes up just to hit rock bottom again later. 

iâ€™m at the age where iâ€™m transitioning into my future and iâ€™m supposed to start planning my life for years to come. i donâ€™t know how to do that when i donâ€™t see myself living that long. itâ€™s so hard to envision myself making it that far at all. i donâ€™t know what to do. 

i donâ€™t know how much longer i can keep this up. feeling really shitty tonight. iâ€™m just so tired.
