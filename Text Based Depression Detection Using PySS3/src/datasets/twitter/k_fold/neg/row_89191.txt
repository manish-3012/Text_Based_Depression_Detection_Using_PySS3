I am crushingly alone and I want to dieThe title says it all, I am alone and nobody loves me, I am going to die alone and unloved, I might as well go kill myself. I want to be loved. I hate being gay because no-one else in my school is like me, I don't think I can take another 3 and a half years of it.

EDIT: I just wanted to clarify, my school is fine, nobody is hurting me or anything like that, it's just that I hate being alone and I need to be in a relationship, but it is hard because I am the only gay kid I know, I am feeling better right now and I am typing this the next day. Thanks for all the support, and for the record, I don't have the physical self-hatred to end my life, I wouldn't have the strength to actually kill myself and I use suicidal thoughts and remarks as a reminder that I have a way out and to scare myself out of wanting to die. I am pretty good in terms of survivability and not killing myself, I just get sad and think about it. The weather is getting better where I live and I am going out more, I may be getting a volunteer job so I'll be outside more often. I might be suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder and it seems to be getting better. Again, thanks for all the support. I have plenty of friends and the school is hard at work to get me help. Thanks.
