Does it make me an evil loser if I commit suicide?Iâ€™m just thinking about all the people who will get the news broken to them if do it.  Do I get remembered for a coward?  A selfish person, or an evil loser?  What do people who have had someone they know commit suicide think?  Did it change your view of them?  Did it disrupt your life?  Please share it may help put in perspective what others may think of them if they are seriously considering it but are held back because of the damage they feel theyâ€™d leave behind or how they would be remembered.  Please share any stories or emotions you went through if you are able to.
