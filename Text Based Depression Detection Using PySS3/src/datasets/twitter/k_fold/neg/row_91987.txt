I called a suicide line and they were much nicerI posted yesterday about calling a crisis line how terrible it was. today I called an actual suicide line and they were very nice to me and let me talk. I feel much much better and stable.

just for the record if you need to talk to somebody, don't call a crisis line, those are the ones that want to take you away, they are there simply to prevent you from killing yourself not to listen to your problems.

I dunno I hope I'll be better now I'm not sure, I felt better yesterday too, but I obviously called them again for a reason.

just wanted to let people know not all these lines are terrible, this lady was very considerate and gentle.

thank you guys too, I deleted the post but I read all the comments.
