I just wish it all meant somethingWe all die eventually. Everyone we love will die eventually. All evidence that we ever existed will fade eventually. The universe will end eventually. What do we think we are? They act as if we're special, somehow. What could we possibly believe we are? They babble as if it'll change things. How can we hope to ever amount to anything other than delusional bits of carbon and chemical reactions? Everything is forces and particles. I wish there was a point. I wish I can just accept it and stop whining so goddamn pathetically. I wish that something, anything mattered at all. I wish I meant something.
