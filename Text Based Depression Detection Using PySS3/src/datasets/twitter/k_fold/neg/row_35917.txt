Today is the dayI've decided that after years of attempts and constant contemplation, I'm going to end it today. I'm going to get extremely drunk and (probably) make a bad decision.

But I don't care anymore. I just lost my job, I found out all this shit about my now ex-girlfriend that has brought me to my breaking point. Not to mention, I only have $50 to my name and rent is due in a week. I'm at wits end. I, and no one else, has any answers so this is my only way out. I have no family, no friends that really care, and nothing to leave behind. I'm worthless alive and I'll be forgotten when I'm dead.

Anyways, I'm done venting. It shouldn't be much longer. Just want to enjoy my last 6 pack.
