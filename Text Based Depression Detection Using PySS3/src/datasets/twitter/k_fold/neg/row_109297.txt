Major screwup and im done with thisI may have screwed up. Badly. Innocent people have been hurt. I was already suicidal but the thought of my daughter living with my suicide keeps me from it so far. Every hour of every day I wish for any kind of death. Illness car wreck, whatever. I dont know how long I can keep myself off the ledge.
