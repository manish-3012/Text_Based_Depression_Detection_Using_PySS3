I'm so worried about someone I've never metI saw a post of theirs in r/depression and after looking through their post history saw that they were in serious danger where they were staying. Their post got a lot of comments, and I left one too, asking for more info and that maybe we could get them out of there. Then I wake up today and almost all of their posts are deleted. 

I don't know if I should post their name for privacy, but it hurts me so much knowing I'll probably never hear from them again. I want to help them so bad but in the end I'm completely useless. They could already be dead by now and I'll never know. 

My life is full of other problems that constantly bring me down but this has been getting to me all day and I needed to say something. About a year ago I saw someone's post here an hour too late, and they had left a suicide note. I still check their profile every once in a while hoping that they didn't go through with it and maybe came back and left another post. I'm so scared that this situation is turning into that again. I wanted to rescue this person and keep them safe but I might already be too late.
