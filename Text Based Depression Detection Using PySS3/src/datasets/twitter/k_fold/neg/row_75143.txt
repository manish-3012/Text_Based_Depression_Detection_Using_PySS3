My statusHello,

I feel really bad at the moment. I've been taking anti-depressants recently. I drink a lot - mostly as a result of the speedy nature of them. I've been trying to help myself for 10+ years and have run away from digging deeper each time someone's played me a card I understand.

"You're a perfectionist" - Ride that high, I've worked it out! Yet, I crash. "You have anxiety" - Of course! That's it! Crash.

I've run out of excuses, out of highs.

This time it's depression. It's like someone pointing at the sky and telling me it's blue. I'd been piling my worries and shortcomings onto the horizon for ever and ever and I'm just tired.

I'm fucking done. I'm sitting here, clenched jaw and uncontrolled tears dictating my mood. I can't see an out, a situation in which I'm happy with the world.

There's so much discontent - I've become frightened about how reasonable thoughts of ending my life has become.
