I want to make it to age fifteenYo. My birthday is on Saturday and Iâ€™ve been doing pretty terrible. My life is honestly pretty all right, but Iâ€™m ruining it with my depression. I canâ€™t get any work done for school, also thanks to the ADD. I canâ€™t maintain relationships. I donâ€™t think that Iâ€™ll have anything to look forward to at this rate. Iâ€™ll have a stupid office job or something.

Iâ€™m also stupid anxious all the time. Like, I have this fear and I donâ€™t know where itâ€™s coming from and it just doesnâ€™t want to go away. Holding conversations is hard. Trusting people is hard.

So, my family knows that I have depression and they want me to good birthday. I donâ€™t expect it to be good because of my lack of friends and crap. I donâ€™t want them to put this effort into my little party, just for me to commit suicide before it happens. So Iâ€™ll just do it after. Or maybe Iâ€™ll feel better, who knows.

Sorry for the ramble-y rant thing. Iâ€™m just so tired. And tired of being tired.
