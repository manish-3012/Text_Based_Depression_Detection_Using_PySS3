Depressed, what did I do?"your depression is rubbing off on me"

She is the love of my life, the world, everything I work for, and most of all my girlfriend. I have really bad problems going back to a divorce my parents had and now I can't trust any woman, not even her the perfect one. I'd give everything for her but I just cant trust. I've been to a counselor about 7 or 8 times not trying to work on this just so I dont lose the one I love, and I get "attacks" of this constantly. Today I've been really depressed thinking of hurting myself, anything to gain trust for her but whatever I do it stops. Shes depressed now, Ive been depressed for as long as I can remember. Why does it have to be a LDR she is my life. I hate myelf. How could I do that to her :( I feel like ive ruined everything. I told her I felt I was in a really bad condition today :( And then that came out. I can't keep myself together :(

EDIT: I am feeling a little better thank you for all the help everyone so much. Im going to get some rest and see how I feel in the morning but I will continue to answer then. Thank you again for everyone offering help and willing to take their time to talk to me. I honestly didn't think I was worth it :(.
