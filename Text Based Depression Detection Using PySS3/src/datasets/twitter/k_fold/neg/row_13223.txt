Has anyone ever stopped wanting to die? If so how did you do it?Back Story: Idk if I'd really call myself suicidal or not. I know that I will probably never intentionally harm myself (though I have a few times in the past), but I do truly wish I could not be alive anymore. Life is such a chore and I feel sorta like it will never get better. It's actually just getting worse as time passes. I was 12 years old when I first noticed these incredibly persistent feelings, eventually causing me to write suicide notes "just for fun". Since then there hasn't been a single time in my life when I've truly enjoyed life or cared at all about whether or not I would live to see tomorrow.

So my question is has anything ever worked to help anyone here start enjoying their life?
