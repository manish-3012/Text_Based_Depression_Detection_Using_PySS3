What am I still fighting for?Is there any reason I'm still hanging on? Any reason to believe that things will change? Is it naive to have hope? I still do have hope somehow despite the things that have happened in my life. But everyday I just get hit with a new obstacle and I don't have the energy to keep going. I just want a break, a day of just not having negative thoughts plague my brain 24/7
