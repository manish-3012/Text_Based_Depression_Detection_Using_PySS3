I donâ€™t wanna be here anymoreThe only way Iâ€™ll get peace is in death. I donâ€™t belong anywhere. I just wanna rest and never wake up. Even this whole post is pointless so idky Iâ€™m doing it. Not gonna get any attention or anything, idk I just donâ€™t know anymore. Iâ€™m beyond tired, words canâ€™t explain how miserable every day is. I just want it to be over. I really hope I gather the courage to just do it one of these days.
