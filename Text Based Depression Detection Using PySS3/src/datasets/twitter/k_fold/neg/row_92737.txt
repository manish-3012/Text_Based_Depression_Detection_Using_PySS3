Fear of failure makes me not want to liveI don't know why but during my teenage years Ive developed extreme fear of failure. I am now going to college and this fear still haunts me. I dislike trying out new activities bc I'm afraid I'll be publicly humiliated or fail terribly and that will demotivate me to keep going. Like for instance if I have classes in laboratory Im afraid I'll spill something or break the equipment. I have to worry about these things instead of learning about the class itself. I really hate myself for being like this. It's impossible to enjoy life to a bare minimum when all I do is worry about not failing and not disappointing others or myself.
