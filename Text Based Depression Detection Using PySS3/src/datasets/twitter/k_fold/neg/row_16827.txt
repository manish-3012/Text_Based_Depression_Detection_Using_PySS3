First suicidal thoughts in 4 yearsI have been having suicidal thoughts for the past week. I tried to kill myself about 4 years ago, and spent a while in the hospital. I was prescribed anti-depressants and went through therapy for quite a while. Recently, my GP began weening me off my medication. I was fine at first, but for the past couples of weeks things having been getting worse and worse. I have been having intense social anxiety. I find it unbearable to be in public situations with strangers. I am afraid to speak to my friends and family, I don't want to burden them. I have an intense feeling that I have disappointed them, and they are embarrassed by me. All of this has become compounded by the fact that I have lost my job recently. I don't know why I am even writing this, I just feel I need to tell someone and this is anonymous. I don't want to feel the way I feel. Sometimes I wish I was a kid again, and didn't have to deal with any of my problems.
