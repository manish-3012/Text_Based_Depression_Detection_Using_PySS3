Nobody cares and the ones who do care canâ€™t handle it anymore. I have nowhere to turn.I have been living back w my abusive family for a while now. My mental health is entirely deteriorated. BPD is out of control, as is my OCD, as is my PTSD. I now have permanent, constant chest pain, all the work I did on my mental health is destroyed, I canâ€™t regulate my emotions, I have no self control. I am barely holding on and last night my partner told me I always talk about how bad the problems he mentions makes me feel, and that made me feel so much worse... so much worse. I am no longer comfortable talking to him about how close I am to ending it because I do not want to push him any further. When I mention it on social media, none of my friends or acquaintances reach out. I know that if I killed myself, all of these people who left me with no one to talk to would post about how much they regret not speaking to me or wishing I couldâ€™ve gotten help... they all would. But while they have the chance to be there for me, they wonâ€™t be. I mentioned it again to my partner today and part of me is considering pretending I feel better again because I donâ€™t want to scare him anymore, because losing people I love while Iâ€™m in this fragile state will make it all worse. I have no reason to believe my life will do anything but get worse and worse. Even if I do stay now, I feel like Iâ€™ll still have to end my life eventually, so I donâ€™t even want to waste my time. I am so alone and stuck and miserable.
