Does it ever stop?â€œWe would have invited you.â€
â€œI wasnâ€™t actually invited Iâ€™m just kinda showing up.â€

Itâ€™s so stupid to cry over. Iâ€™m so tired of crying. 


Does the feeling of being a burden ever stop? Most of me wants to end it. Stop this cycle of pain I feel. Itâ€™s exhausting. 

Iâ€™m too cowardly to end it here. In this country. Where suicide is so high. I donâ€™t want to jump in front a train. I donâ€™t want my family to deal with this 1000â€™s of miles away.

No one wants to date a depressed girl. 
â€œBut, why donâ€™t you find someone?â€
â€œYou must attract so much attention.â€

â€œYou could get anyone you want.â€

I donâ€™t believe these words. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m beautiful. I donâ€™t want to sleep around just to sleep around. I donâ€™t care if someone does but for me it just makes everything worse.

Is that all Iâ€™m worth? 
Just here for someone else?
If I canâ€™t find anyone then am I worth nothing?

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be good enough for anyone. Iâ€™m no good. 

Weâ€™ll see if seeing a psychiatrist will help but I have such low faith nowadays.  Maybe Iâ€™ll think of a good way to end it.
