It's so hard to liveI have always been alone in my thoughts making up things which aren't real daydreaming all the time because my real life  is too painful to cope with I dont know how much I can take it just wanted to say it it's so pathetic to live for me I have achieved nothing I am so hopeless I dont deserve to live its fucking painful so much pain everytime I am waking up I am having short breaths i cant breathe properly i have literary no one to talk literary no one no friends never been in a relationship too really would have liked it i guess i am gonna die alone and hopeless
