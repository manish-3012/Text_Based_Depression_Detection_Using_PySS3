Just kinda hit meIt just kinda hit me how fucked up I am. Normal people wouldnâ€™t even consider suicide as an option, but for me it feels like the solution to a lot of problems. For example, Iâ€™m in a long term relationship thatâ€™s been on the rocks for a long time, but if things ended she would probably be sad for a bit then go back to being normal and doing normal things, I on the other hand would seriously consider and might commit suicide. Idk. Just hit me.
