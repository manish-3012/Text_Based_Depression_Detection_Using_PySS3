I guess I'll ventOkay so I'm 13 and before you say "oh you're too young to be suicidal and depressed. You haven't gone through anything" Yes I fuccing have. I guess I started feeling sadder than usual when my biological father moved away in the beginning of 2018 (my mother and him divorced when I was about 2) I missed him but also hated him for leaving me and being abusive to my mother. I also   have had a lot of surgeries because I have a pacemaker. It makes me feel a little bad when I can't do things such as riding a rollercoaster with my family. But that's all fodder compared to what the big problems are. I made a really really bad decision and my family kinda hated me after that. It made me start to feel like nobody loved me and I became suicidal. I started self harming because it made me feel a little better and I thought everything would be okay and I would eventually stop but I didn't. So now my arms and hands are covered with healed and new scars which makes me feel even worse because I feel like I'm too ugly to be loved. I feel like nobody cares about me, like everyone just wants to be rid of me. My best friend stopped talking to me for whatever reason (I moved schools this year so we could only text each other) And everyone at this school just treats me like a pile of trash, because of the aforementioned really really bad decision. The only thing that makes me happy is my boyfriend (yes I am only 13 and shouldn't be dating ik) and he's the only person who makes me feel loved. But now even that isn't keeping me from wanting to die. I can't think about anything else but how to kill myself. I feel like I have no purpose in this world and I should just die. Like my family would be better off without me. Like my life wouldn't be trash anymore because it would be over. Like being dead would release me of all the pain. I guess that's all. Thanks for listening
