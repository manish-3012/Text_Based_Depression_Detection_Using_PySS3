Ending it tonight.Long story short, I have a supportive family, they know of my condition and do anything to take care of me. Have a good set of friends who help me distract my mind whenever I'm feeling down. Went through a breakup but I'm 'kinda' starting to like someone new but I don't want to say it because of my mindset and it might seem wrong so fast. Have good grades, am doing well in college, have one of the highest CGPA in my branch, all the lecturers love me. Yesterday was a good day after 4 months of this depression and suicidal thoughts, actually put efforts on studying and did self care for myself. But at night I got suicidal thoughts as usual. Seeking professional help too and it's making me a bit better. But yeah, tonight I'm giving up all of it, yeah seems like I have it all and am crazy to kill myself, but I don't want this anymore. Stopped talking to everyone after I got thoughts last night, I'm supposed to inform, but nah, I'm going to go meet my friends for one last time, spend time with my family, and kill myself when night comes. I just want to say thank you to the reddit fam that helped me over the past couple of months, you're amazing and kind people. âœŒï¸ Goodbye.
