I wish I was suicidalI'm truly so sorry if what I just said offended anyone. I don't want to in anyway diminish or lessen the suffering that you guys goes through. For me though, this is true, and I wanted to get it off my chest.  What a weird feeling, to wish I was suicidal. Each day is literally torturous and I am so beyond dissociated that I no longer have any tools to deal with any of this. It is just pure torture, neverending, much in the way that I'm sure that many of guys have, but also quite different. My dissociative disorder, at its basic root, doesn't touch my motivation/sadness. There are some papers that propose that I don't have anhedonia but rather an attentional mechanism (or lackthereof) that gives the illusion of adhendonia, and I can't agree more. Before this got to the point where I had literally 0 percent of my former self/emotions, I was actually never so motivated. Each day, every second, I had the greatest wish, to get better, as I could feel the part of me still in the right dimension. I was the opposite of depressed. But now that I can't actually feel any sense of normalcy, its like I'm stuck in this weird limbo. I can't kill myself, I don't feel suicidal, yet at the same time I for sure can't live like this much longer. Each day it gets rose, but I don't actually ever get more depressed.  I wish I was depressed and suicidal so I could just off myself, because I know for sure I am never going to get better. I guess I am going to put up a fight and try everything possible in terms of treatments and waiting it out, but I know I've lost the battle.  I dunno, life is just weird.
