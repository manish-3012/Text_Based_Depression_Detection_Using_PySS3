Ive attempted 3 times.. its not worth itI'm on my kindle sorry for my grammar. I tried to kill myself 3 times over a span of 4 years. Guns, gas, hanging. Not a single one worked. I mixed some stuff to make a potent gas and locked myself in my car. Took some extension cables to a rafter. And used a glock. My last attempt blew offnmy right ear and a portion of my back skull. Playing piano was one of the only things able to get me threw the day before and I cant do it now. My fingers are clumsy. It will take me a few hours to write this somewhat coherently. It is never ever worth it. There is always something more. Always. My physical rehabilitation teacher.. who  my wife and my keystone always compliments my hands. And I cant play anything g for her without stuttering. So she helps me move my hands and fingers over the keys. Anyways just think. There is so much beauty in the world. Don't let you being sad not let you make music.
