I just donâ€™t know.I mess everything up. No one cares about me. Iâ€™ve been deeply depressed for the past few days. Like on a scale probably 10/10, the most depressed Iâ€™ve ever been. I tried talking to my boyfriend but Iâ€™m not in the states currently (Iâ€™m on vacation), and he sucks at replying or says that he doesnâ€™t know what to say. I know heâ€™s not a therapist but still. I just want someone to tell me everything is going to be okay. I need someone to tell me that. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I cry every night all night, since I canâ€™t during the day while Iâ€™m the presence of my family. I havenâ€™t eaten in days, and I donâ€™t feel the need to. Iâ€™m so alone. I have no friends to turn to. I have no one. Iâ€™ve become a shell of a  human and Iâ€™ve come to terms with pain and dying. All I do is annoy people. Nobody should have to suffer through being in the presence of me. I watched my family today from our hotel room, as they had fun on the beach, swam, drank, and ate lunch, constantly smiling and laughing. They all seemed so happy without me involved. They donâ€™t need me in their lives, no one does. They got my brothers, the two children they wanted. And then thereâ€™s me, Iâ€™m nothing and I wouldnâ€™t be missed.
