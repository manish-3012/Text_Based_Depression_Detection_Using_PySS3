I honestly never thought I'd be back here again.**I'm a coward.** 

*Much has happened since I've last posted on another account (see below) but nothing has made it better.*

I said I would do it, but I never did, due to fear of the consequences, the damage that it would bring to the people around me. I wanted to be selfish. I wanted to let go without thinking of anyone else and the burden it would put on my family. Because I didn't go through with it, until today, I live with numbness in my mind, living from day to day, with no hope for my future. 

I was a person who used to put up a fake smile to be like the happy-looking people on facebook. That quickly faded with my vision towards my life goals. Who am I kidding, I have no life goals; I never did. 

*I know with this, many have said, "Oh, you're not the only one that feels this, I've felt it too, it's normal, just suck it up and move along" , but those words just don't affect me anymore.*

Today, I'm an obese Asian faggot who mopes around all day thinking maybe tomorrow will be better, stuck in a dream world of one day living the "happily ever after" type-of life. I don't think I'm going to be able to survive this upcoming year of college. I am and have been a failure and a pretender for my whole life, but for once, I think I can actually succeed in leaving this world behind.
