I feel empty.First of all, I just want to say. I know Iâ€™m not the worst off person, I know some people would be overwhelmed to live the way I do. 
The thing is, Iâ€™m just empty, sad and feel terribly alone. 

Secondly, Iâ€™m not sure if this is the right place to vent and I canâ€™t guarantee Iâ€™ll make any sense. 

For the last 10 years, Iâ€™ve felt alone, numb and have struggled to find any light in any situation. 

I went through years (4) of feeling numb, with no emotion. I struggle with depression and anxiety. Iâ€™m on high alert all the time, itâ€™s exhausting. 

I work, 0830-1700 Monday to Friday. It barely pays the bills. So no money for luxuries. I have an apartment. The added stress from having less than 5 in the bank a week from the end of the month tips me over the edge. Sometimes Iâ€™ll sit and stare at the wall until I go to bed once Iâ€™m home from work. 

I frequently have the urge to just end it all, kill myself. I mean, I donâ€™t feel as I anyone would care. Other than my mother. Sheâ€™s the only reason I havenâ€™t. 

Iâ€™m weak, and I know I have to push on and live my life. I just wish I could enjoy it.
