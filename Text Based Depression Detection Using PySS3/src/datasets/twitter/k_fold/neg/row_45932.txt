ways to relieve anger?I've struggled with depression and suicidal ideation for almost 8 years now and with recent shit in my life I'm at one of the worst places I've been in. I'm angry all the time and I don't want to be. I'm angry at other people for not seeing me but then my anger doubles onto myself. I'm so used to taking this out on myself in the form of self harm, and most of the time it's because I'm physically restraining from breaking and ruining the things around me, because that makes people worried and scared and I don't want to deal with that too.
 
Basically I want to break everything I own so I break myself instead and I don't want to do either. Most resources I've found are like "take a deep breath!" or "do something you love" but it feels like stuff like that is nearly impossible, and then I end up breaking things that I actually like. I'm so tired of feeling this way and no one is hearing.

I don't want to end up being someone who punches holes in walls because I hate myself. (btw this only applies to inanimate objects and not to people or other living things besides myself)

Damn I'd give anything to break a few chairs right now though.
