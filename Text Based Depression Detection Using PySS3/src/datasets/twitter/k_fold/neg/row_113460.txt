Im ready to dieIm finding the easiest way to do it. The only thing that is stoping me is my girlfriend. The grief that will haunt her. We're living together now. But if I upset her and she doesnt want to talk to me? What is there to lose?

I cannot get back.. I fucked up a year in my life. Everything needs to be fast paced but I fucked it up. I lost a year because of that.. I always feel anxiety because of it. There is no one I can talk to.. i feel pressure. I feel sadness.. it's eating me. Im ungrateful. Im torn. Its better for the people around me to just not have me anymore.. their life will be better without me..

Especially my girl. I love you. Im sorry. I hope you find what youre looking for. Its not me.. i cant just change and be that.. better of with another person. Im sorry....
