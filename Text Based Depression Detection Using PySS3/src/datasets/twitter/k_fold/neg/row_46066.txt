my best friend tried to commit suicidewe were walking next to a street when she dropped her bag and ran towards the street, my brain didn't catch up and I didn't understand what she tried to do (as well as her boyfriend).

 luckily she stopped, otherwise she would be dead

her bf started to get all hysterical and started to cry  (I don't mean that offensive) and she put on her happy face and acted like she was all good again, but im not stupid, I may have autism, but even I understood that she was faking it and im kind of mad that her bf made her hide her pain again, as it is happening a lot, but that's not the point.

im just feeling lost, my brain still doesn't really catch up with what happened, and it was about 2 days ago.
