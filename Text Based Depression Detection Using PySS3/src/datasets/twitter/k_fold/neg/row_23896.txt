hypochondria is killing me.hello there.
for years now I have been suffering from random pains and illnesses that are damaging my will to live and making my depression worse

lets see here, i've nearly killed myself due to thinking that I have;

brain cancer

appendicitis

rabies

dementia

organ failure

and so much other fun fucking stuff.

i used to be on medication for my fears but my mother took me off of them.

currently, i'm in pain and thinking that i'm seriously sick yet again and its pathetic.

it's really not a life anymore.
