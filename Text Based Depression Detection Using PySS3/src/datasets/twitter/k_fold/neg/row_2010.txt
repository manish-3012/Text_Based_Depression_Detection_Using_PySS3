You left a hole in my heart and now Iâ€™ll leave one in my head.I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this. I donâ€™t want attention yet I (sorta) want my story to be heard but this is mostly a vent. Whatever. Sorry for not being good enough. I knew I wasnâ€™t but I was hoping you wouldnâ€™t  realize it so quickly. You told me â€œforever and everâ€ but you went back to him. I hope he makes you happy and I hope your fantasies come true. Goodbye mein SchÃ¤tz. Dad, sorry for not being the son you wanted. I still love you. I forgive you. This isnâ€™t anyoneâ€™s fault, Iâ€™m not a coward. Iâ€™ve endured this hell for several years and for multiple people but now that Iâ€™m alone I can enter my heaven without effecting others.  May my Wrath and my Sorrow be quenched.
