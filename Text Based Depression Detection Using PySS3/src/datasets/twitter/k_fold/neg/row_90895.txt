Can you believe it? I want to pull the trigger but I can't deal with not knowing the 'unknown' ahead of time? I am fucked up - LOLI've been reading the posts on this forum for the past few weeks.  It breaks my heart but at the same time I get this weird feeling of comfort knowing that I am not the only one that wants to commit suicide.  I have been planning my suicide for quite a while but based on many different events that have happened in my life.  Now I feel that I really want to go through with it.

So I bought a gun, a new Sig 9mm Legion.  I guess I want to go in style but also want to make sure the bullet does maximum destruction.  I've read enough about the human anatomy and the base of the brain that I know where I want to aim the gun.  I have practiced putting the gun in my mouth and pulling the trigger.  However, I can't get my brain to accept that I can do it with a real bullet!

How do you condition yourself to be able to pull the trigger?  I think I'm afraid of what happens next.  I tell myself that next is basically nothingness.  You just don't exist anymore.  But that thought seems so illogical that I can't comprehend non-existence.  Does anyone else have these problems?  Is there any way of getting past the instinctive need to survive?  

Thanks for reading/listening.
