Trapped in my headI'm a 17 year old guy. I'm failing literally all my classes and I can't even find the motivation to check my school emails, let alone actually go to school. My entire family is disappointed in me and it sucks because all my siblings are successful and smart but I'm nothing. I have no dreams, no motivation, no future, even thinking about my future makes me sad. I got diagnosed with schizophrenia a year and a half ago and I feel like it's ruined my life. I feel so lost and alone, fucking nobody understands. I've tried to get support from friends but I haven't had good experiences so I no longer try. I have nothing except mental illness and anger. I doubt I'll ever be able to be successful judging by how unstable I am and have been for the last 3 years, I mean I can't even tell what's real or not, how much more useless can I get? I just wish I had someone to talk to that understands everything. Therapy and psychologists make me feel even worse because I feel like they're testing me and digging around in my brain, it's invasive and I hate it but my family and friends could never understand. I have nobody, I don't even feel like I have myself 

This is a repost but I guess I just want someone to talk to
