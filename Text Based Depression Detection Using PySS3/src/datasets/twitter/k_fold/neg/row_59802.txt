helpi made this throwaway and i donâ€™t know why. i think to vent or ramble about how i feel since some people i know also know my main account. i havenâ€™t been okay in a long time. iâ€™m 20 but more of my life iâ€™ve been like this than an actual functioning person. i made a whole long rambling post in /mentalillness but idk. i donâ€™t ever post much anyways so idk who to do or say or where to go. i just feel really alone and iâ€™m so scared
