Telling my parents Iâ€™m suicidalHi. 14F here. 

I want to die - why else would I be here? I burst into tears at sports practice, thereâ€™s a voice in my head constantly harassing me, I fantasize about my death and how it would affect others every day. I want people to miss me. I want everybody to realize how much (or little) I mean(t) to them. 

I know this isnâ€™t healthy or normal. Iâ€™m seeing a therapist now, which is neat. My parents brought me to therapy at my request but I didnâ€™t tell them what for. I donâ€™t want to give them the burden.  I donâ€™t want to explain why I feel so bad to them. 

My parents lead very busy, stressful lives as it is. They work in law, which is a tiring field to be in. The family dog is sick and lethargic right now.  Theyâ€™re redoing the house and have to make a lot of decisions. Thereâ€™s so much stuff on their plates right now, I donâ€™t want to distract them from it and add more to worry about. I donâ€™t want to break my momâ€™s heart. 

Iâ€™ve told them before I felt like I want to end my life but quickly took it back saying I would never do it and I was being hyperbolic. But that was months ago, and now itâ€™s getting worse. Sometimes I really do think about doing it, ideas like hanging myself on a basketball hoop structure at school or tying my feet to a heavy concrete block or rock to drown myself in the pool pop into my head often. Iâ€™m starting to get scared I will really do it someday. It gets overwhelming sometimes at school and I spend my lunch period crying. I used to blame it on just being a dumb angsty teenager but it hurts a lot now. 

I told my therapist (my first time going was two days ago) and she listened. It was nice, the thing is I can only see her like once a month since her schedule is so busy. It got worse after I talked to her about it and it kinda sucks that I have to wait until May to discuss it more. 

I have a meeting with a psychologist for medicine, which Iâ€™m kinda worried about. I donâ€™t want any scary side effects, who knows maybe Iâ€™m just being dramatic and I donâ€™t really need it. 

I donâ€™t want to tell my friends, Iâ€™m sure they have a lot to deal with too in their lives and I donâ€™t want to scare them away. Itâ€™s not like therapy anyways where theyâ€™re bound by law not to tell anybody. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t feel good.
