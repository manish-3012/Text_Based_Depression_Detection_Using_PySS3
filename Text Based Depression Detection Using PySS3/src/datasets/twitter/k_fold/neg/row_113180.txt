First post here. I have wanted to die for almost 30 years.I don't know what to say but I knew I needed to post. I'm so mentally ill from decades of abuse and trauma starting in childhood and continuing to this day. I want help, I've tried to get help. The more honest I've been and the more I've reached out for help the more isolated and abandoned I've become. If I killed myself my "friends" would mourn me and have something to say about me on social media but where are they NOW while I'm still alive and asking for help? I'm not a priority. I want my life to get better, but it just gets worse and I've lost hope that it will ever improve. I'm in so much pain all the time, I want to die so bad. The only thing that keeps me from killing myself is my little brother. Every time I've tried to do it it's the thought of him that stops me. It's terrible though because I've been suffering for so long I just need it to end, I desperately want out. But I'm stuck here suffering because I know he's already been through so much and if I killed myself it would destroy him. He also went through years of abuse and trauma and is very mentally ill and can't get the help that he needs. He has also struggled with suicidal thoughts for years. I fear that he stays here continuing to suffer because he doesn't want to hurt me either. Sometimes I wish he would come to me with a suicide pact so we could both leave this earth together. Maybe then we'd finally be free of our suffering and our family would understand just how severely they fucked up and how much harm they caused. I would never suggest such a thing to him though. I want him to make it. I want him to find the support he needs. But if he came to me and he was set on doing it I'd want to go together because like I said he's the only reason I haven't taken my own life yet. I wish the world had been kinder to us. I want to die so bad right now I wish I could make myself do it but I can't.
