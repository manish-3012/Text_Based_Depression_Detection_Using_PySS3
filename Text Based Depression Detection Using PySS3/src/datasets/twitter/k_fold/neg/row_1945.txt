I need a reason.I am running out of reasons to keep going. I am not enjoying work anymore, my future (and main goal in life, becoming a lawyer is unattainable now), and my girlfriend (the only girl I saw a future with) broke up with me. I dont even enjoy stuff I always used to like video games and sports. Whenever I am alone I feel sad and it only helps when I am with friends but thats maybe 2-3 times a week. It just seems like a more viable option every day that passes. Any advice is appreciated and I am seeking professional help on Monday.
