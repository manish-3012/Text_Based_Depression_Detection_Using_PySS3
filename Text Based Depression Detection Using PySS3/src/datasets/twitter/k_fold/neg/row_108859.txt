I donâ€™t know how to fix thisMy friend died. Iâ€™m out of state and Iâ€™m going to miss the funeral. My boyfriend is processing and wonâ€™t talk to me and Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m ever going to recover for this, or if my relationship will. Iâ€™ve been suicidal before and this is really just making it worse. I plan on killing myself once I get home in 2 days. Iâ€™m supposed to be kept away from medications (because Iâ€™ve expressed suicidal intent in the past to my psych) but I have enough stockpiled to seriously hurt myself, if not die. Iâ€™m just fucking tired of this.
