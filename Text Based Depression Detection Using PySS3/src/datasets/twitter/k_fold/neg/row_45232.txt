What's the point?I don't know how I lasted 7 years doing something I absolutely hate. It's gotten to the point where I don't enjoy anything anymore. I feel like the antidepressants are not doing their job anymore. In 3 months, I can finally get my diploma, but then what? That is if I get the motivation to get off my ass, stop smoking and drinking coffee all day, and actually do something productive. But what's the point? 
Yesterday I cut myself, which is something I didn't do since high school. It felt strangely good, like talking to an old friend. Maybe even a truer friend than the guys i met and call friends at college. And I say guys because I literally met 0 girls in this fucking place (how sad is that?).

So tell me, what's the point of living if I feel worthless everyday, with nothing to enjoy, not being able to accomplish anything?
