This night, I am going to get myself into a coma.Life is so hard. In a coma is like sleep, but longer. It also makes me feel good.

â‰§ ï¹ â‰¦                          (â”¬â”¬ï¹â”¬â”¬)

Should I?

Comment.

My mind: It's hopeless to live. (???)    My mind, too: But if I died... It will be worse...
