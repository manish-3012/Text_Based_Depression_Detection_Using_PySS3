i had pills in front of me while typing this**destroyed by 3 women in a one week period**

woman one i gave a shit about, we got along great, she left me for someone 30 years older that could provide for her
woman two i fell in love with right off the bat, she claimed to feel the same way and said there was a future, found out shortly afterward she lied to me
woman three not ready to talk about this one yet


**getting betrayed by a friend of ten years**

friend of 10 years met a girl 10 years his younger (he's 30 shes 20), he's only known her 2 months, she was/is a drug addict with a 4 year old son. she only comes around when my roommate has money/meth/weed. recently my roommate was in a wreck and got a nice settlement, guess who moved in? now for the drama, her sons father says he wants custody, she doesnt want to give it up, roommate decides to kick me out of the house to give her son his own room in the event cps comes.


**no money at all
**
recently injured my knee, no insurance, cant go to the hospital to be seen about it, much less afford medication, can't do physical work, got fired from my last job which was a good job, now i have no money and no prospect of a job at all


**court case against me**

misdemenor court on june 22nd for bounced checks, must make a "substantial payment" towards what I owe (1580) before that date or I will go to jail, where i will sit out my fines at 5 bucks per day (316 days) before i even get seen for judgement/sentencing on my case

**unattractive**

self explanatory

**suicidal**



several thoughts of suicide have crossed my mind, from considering methods of doing it (pills, gun, running into a busy highway) to having pills in my hand ready to take them

------------------------------------------------------------------

i am beyond depressed, i feel like i cannot handle this any longer, i have to type all of this out because i cannot talk face to face or over the phone about my problems, i cannot talk vocally about my problems, anonymously or in person, i can talk via text, or IM, but not with my voice, it's retarded. i wish there was some medication i could take to make me feel better, or even someone that would be willing to work around my issue of being unable to vocalize my problems
