OCD eats me upIf you want to read why I'm here please read my previous post. I dont want to die, but I dont want to life like this anymore. I want to be a good person, get a good job, family etc but I cant. It's hard to accept for me but I have to. I wish nobody of you had to be here and you all could live the life you want and find your inner peace I hate myself for not being able to be happy. Nobody will know why I killed myself, I should not think about it, it all makes me even more sad
