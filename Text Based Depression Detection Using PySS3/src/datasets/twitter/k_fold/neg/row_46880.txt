Hello, fellow suicidal individuals!Judgment day #2 (haha) is coming to me... The first one, I really was going to kill myself, but I was caught before I finished the bottle of pills. I failed.

What will change my mind? Words on the internet will not, honestly, but I just wanted to maybe say hi to the other people who are feeling this way no matter what the reason...while you feel alone, we're together in a sense. We're at the pit of despair, or something like that.

I hope you all climb out, but I doubt I will. And as for you, the helpers, thanks for reading this. I hope you can help some people. A lot of people really just need some care or warm words. I wish I could help people, but I'm not equipped to do that anymore.

I've been to hospitals

I've been on different kinds of meds

I've been to therapy

I tried different activities

I tried. Now I'm waiting to see if anything changes... why that day to be judgment day? Well, intake part 2. I'm still trying. And even if I don't kill myself, I'm going to stop talking to a lot of people and cut off relationships. Why? I need to move on from them... And I know, no matter what, I'll do something crazy.

I love you, kind stranger who read this! Thank you so much! I wish you the best, and I hope that you find some sort of joy or contentment in life.
