HelpThese last few months haven't been the best. My girlfriend cheated on me. I'm a freshmen at my school, but my grades are slipping. Last semester I was a straight A student, but with only 2 weeks of school left my grades are all D's and my parents are threatening to pull me out. I am also Atheist and is bullied because of it.
