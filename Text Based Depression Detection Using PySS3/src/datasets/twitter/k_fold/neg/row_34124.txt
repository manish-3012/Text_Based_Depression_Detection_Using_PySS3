I feel hopelessI don't want to wake up tomorrow... my marriage is in shambles. I know my cats love me, but even they would be better off without me. I am a burden to everyone I meet. 

I have health issues and I lost my job because I wasn't there long enough to get FMLA. I don't have funds to go to the doctor and get diagnosed, not that I haven't been trying over the last year. 

My spouse and I experienced a miscarriage at the end of April and we wanted that child.

Everything is falling apart and I don't know what to do.

I just want it to end.
