Iâ€™m not living for myself.Honestly Iâ€™m just going to be blunt and honest about this instead of sugarcoating it and making it look like a beautiful piece of writing. I want to end my life, itâ€™s all I think about and Iâ€™m only here because people need me. If I didnâ€™t have my mom, my friends and the rest if my immediate family I would have ended it a long time ago. Iâ€™m nothing but a dropout, minimum wager who lies with his parents at age 20 and has has a life full of failures and pathetic choices. Iâ€™ve done shitty things I canâ€™t live with, my life is nothing besides my mediocre minimum wage job, I donâ€™t have a future and Iâ€™ll never be capable when it comes to living a normal life. I care too much about peopleâ€™s sanity and thatâ€™s why I havenâ€™t killed myself yet. I hear the screams of my family if they were to find me dead, I see what it would look like and what would happen afterwards. I fantasize about this shit and itâ€™s never going to stop. Even if I could rid myself of my disabilities, make life a great thing and never have another bad thing happen to me ever again I would still say yes to suicide and I would say yes over and over and over again with pride. I canâ€™t live this pathetic life anymore and Iâ€™m slowly starting to care less about how others would feel if I was gone. Everyday I see images of my death, I hear my own voice in my head telling me to do it, etc. Iâ€™m not glorifying suicide and I donâ€™t want others to do so. I want this for myself and itâ€™s been a long time coming. All I can do is sit here and endure my shitty life, let my past traumatize me and wait until I have no more people depending on me. The day when thereâ€™s no one else in my life will be the day Iâ€™ll be gone.
