I think about suicide all the time but wouldn't say I'm depressed.On a day to day basis, I'm great.  I'm not ever worried about anything, I enjoy my work very much, when I'm around people I love it.  But any time I'm alone, and it can literally be minutes after getting home from seeing friends, I just get... blank.  I guess.  I just feel really apathetic, emotionless, and robotic.  Everything I do I just do for the sake of it, I feel like.  There are some inconsistencies in this though.  I love to cook and bake, but hate to eat.  I like to play video games and read, but I hate to make myself leave the apartment.  This gets progressively worse as the weekend goes on, to the point where I hate to leave the apartment for any other reason than to go on a run or go to the supermarket.  When the week starts up again, I'm back to normal.  I love seeing people at work, giving tours of our facility, doing the research that I do etc.  It's like all of my energy and affect are expended during the week or something.

But what's worse is that every night before I go to bed, I fantasize about suicide.  Usually jumping off of a very high place.  It's fun.  It helps me fall asleep.  But I never actually want to commit suicide *at all*.  I just really seem to get comfort in the thought of dying (especially by my own hand for some reason).

I used to go to therapy, but they had a policy that if I expressed suicidal tendencies they'd have to tell family members.  I don't think I have tendencies, but I'd really like some opinions on why my weekends seem so fucked up and my weekdays are awesome.  And it's all in my head too, if a friend visits me on a weekend, I appear to be just fine.  I talk to them fine, cook something, we play games together or just hang out.  A-ok.  The moment they leave it's flat affect and robotic mode. 

Does anyone else experience this?  Am I looking for problems where there aren't any?  I would love any insight into this from you guys.
