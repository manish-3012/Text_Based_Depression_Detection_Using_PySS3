Goodbye friendsMy name is Jane Milnes. Today is my last day on earth. I've been planning my suicide religiously since I was 13. Tomorrow is the final day for me (well I guess it's today since I'm writing this at 12 at night, but I digress). To all the wonderful people I didn't get to meet, hello! I hope you have a great life. I want to be remembered for something after I'm gone. I've spent most of my life trying to be an artist. Art is really the only thing that has made sense to me, and it has given me a sense of purpose. I'm not very smart, as you can probably gather from my horrendous writing. But art gave me the means to communicate with the world in a meaningful way. So if you would like, check out my instagram jane_milnes. It is the only record of my work thus far. All I wanted in life was to touch people with my art. Unfortunately I failed at that. But if you are curious feel free to check out my page, it would have meant a lot to me. Goodbye again friends, treat each other kindly, and never take the people in your life for granted. This is Jane signing off for a final time. Goodbye and I love you.
