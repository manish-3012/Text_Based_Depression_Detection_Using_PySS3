18 y/o. I donâ€™t think I have depression, just an apathetic attitude towards life.I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s normal for a college freshman to feel this way, but basically I started questioning my goals in life, and now I donâ€™t know what I want out of life anymore. I love my family and friends, Iâ€™d take a bullet for any one of them, but looking at life in the bigger picture, Iâ€™m trying to see whatâ€™s going to happen in the next 60+ years thatâ€™s going to make it all worthwhile. Then I kind of draw a blank. But I donâ€™t want to kill myself, because A.) Thatâ€™s a stupid reason to give up the one thing youâ€™re sure you ever get, and B.) It would kill my loved ones and Iâ€™d never want to hurt them. Iâ€™ve been sad and depressed before, but I never killed myself because I had hope that it was all gonna be worth it someday. Iâ€™ve been going through some intense anxiety due in some part to a really bad drug experience, and I would get through it by thinking about all the little parts of life Iâ€™d be able to enjoy again. And now those things just donâ€™t hold the value that they once did. I really feel like Iâ€™m just going through the motions. Iâ€™ve experiences pretty much every emotion, so what new am I ever really going to experience?
