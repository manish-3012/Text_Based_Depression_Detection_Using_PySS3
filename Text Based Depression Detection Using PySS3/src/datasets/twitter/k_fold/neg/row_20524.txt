Iâ€™m sorry I wasnâ€™t strong enoughIâ€™m tired, Iâ€™m ruined and I donâ€™t have the strength or to keep going in this miserable life. I canâ€™t take back what I did, what I said or how it affected everyone. 
I get it. Iâ€™m an asshole. Iâ€™ve hurt too many people and the regret is beyond anything I can bear. 

S, Iâ€™m sorry. It has to be this way. Look after L.

L, Iâ€™m sorry i hurt you so much. I wish I could fix what Iâ€™ve done but I know I canâ€™t. It was never your fault. Forgive me, I know youâ€™ll see this on here. Iâ€™m sorry.

Z, youâ€™re a dick but youâ€™ve got the damn balls to admit it to everyone. Props. Keep it cool.

F and A see you in hell lads.




Iâ€™m out.
