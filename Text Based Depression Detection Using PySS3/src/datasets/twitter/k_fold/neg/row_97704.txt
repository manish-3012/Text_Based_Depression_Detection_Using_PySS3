Donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m waiting forIâ€™ve been planning on looking myself for a while now and Iâ€™m just waiting for a specific date. I have bipolar 2 and sometimes it just feels like itâ€™s draining knowing that Iâ€™m going to have to deal with it for the rest of my life. Sometimes I want to really do it when Iâ€™m depressed and especially during a mixed episode but then when Iâ€™m hypomanic itâ€™s not even a thought in my mind. Itâ€™s just shitty knowing that Iâ€™ll be going back and forty always and forever. Any advice please help
