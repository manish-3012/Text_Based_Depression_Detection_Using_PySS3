I want to do it, but I'm way too scaredI've had a near death experience when I got high (barely breathing, had to open my window, my head was hurting since I fell off the bed) and that scared the hell out of me. And I said I'll try to get better, but I just can't. Nothing is going the way I want it to be, I'm crying constantly, I just want to sleep or feel numb or something. I hate my family and their house and their voices and their presence, I don't feel like I'm being that close to my fiance since we can't really have some time alone since he's at his parents too..I'm feeling so alone I just want this all to end. But I can't do it
