This may possibly be the final straw.Now before we start, I am getting help. Iâ€™m slightly suicidal so thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m posting here. 

My girlfriend (of 1 month but thatâ€™s besides the point) broke up with me yesterday because Iâ€™m â€œcold and mean and possessive.â€ She said Iâ€™m not healthy for her and I understand why. 

Sheâ€™s a lot like me in many ways. Depressed, has anxiety (worse than me in most ways) and likes a lot of the things I like. Even though itâ€™s a short relationship I felt a DEEP, DEEEP attachment to her. I would say Iâ€™m in love with her. She even had the same feelings. 

But I fucked up. I kept making jokes saying Iâ€™m gonna kill myself and kept doing it even when she clearly didnâ€™t like it. I wasnâ€™t doing it for the attention really. It was a way for me to cope I guess. I also kept poking fun at her for when she accidentally called me one of her friends names. Iâ€™d pretend to be upset whenever she would say she thought someone else was cute(even when i could tell she wasnâ€™t serious). 

She loved me as much as I loved her. I still think she does too. The day before we were cuddling and saying we love each other every 5 minutes. This wasnâ€™t really like her at all. During class today I kept catching her glancing at me from time to time. Iâ€™m going to give her space for a few days then try to talk to her in person. 

If this fails I think Iâ€™m done with life. You can say what you want about it being really short of a relationship or how Iâ€™m young and Iâ€™ll get over it (Iâ€™m 18), but I really donâ€™t think I will. I donâ€™t want anyone else but her. I fucking love her with all of my strength, heart, the passion of a million suns, whatever. If she says no Iâ€™ll respect that but I will probably be done with life.
