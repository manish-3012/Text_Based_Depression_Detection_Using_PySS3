Fuck.I'm tired of feeling "tired"
I can't concentrate for two fucking seconds.
I picture jumping from a balcony and the crack
of bones as they hit the pavement.
I scream silently and cry into my pillow.
Why do I stay here?
What's the point?
I'm just being stupid and dramatic, right?
I'm fucking tired.
