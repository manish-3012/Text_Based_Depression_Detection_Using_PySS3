I feel like my life is a burden on my family and societyI suffer from severe OCD which causes severe depression when it manifests itself

I posted this because of issues I'm experiencing and wanted to know if I was being an entitled asshole or if I should do what I thought was right for my mental health

The comments on this post have reminded me of how much of a monster I am. How it's unfair to my family that I burden them with my disability. I've always known this I feel like a monster for not being able to pay for the things that keep me from things getting worse and I don't know what to do.

I feel like no matter what I do I'm nothing but a waste of space asshole who deserves to die as everything I do and need to keep myself from suffering causes nothing but pain to others. I really really just don't want to exist anymore. I'm sick of this disability I'm sick of what it does to me and Im sick of the things I need to do to keep it at bay. It's not fair to my family and it's not fair to me. I just want to make sure I'm not longer a burden on anyone ever again.
