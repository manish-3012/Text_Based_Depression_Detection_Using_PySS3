Hello fellow people.How are you all doing fellow people who have contemplated suicide?
I find that my medication (Wellbutrin) seems to just increase the amount of apathy I feel, while not actually helping me in any significant way, feels like I'm just putting off the inevitable.

Well anyways, how are you doing?
