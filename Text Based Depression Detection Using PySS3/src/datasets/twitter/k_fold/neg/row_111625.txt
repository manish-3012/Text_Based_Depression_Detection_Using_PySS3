Savoring death atm..sorry if its too long and dumb to read you dont have to if you dont want to.So ive been comtemplating whether or not to kill myself. p.s this is going to be really informal with the grammar and all. i really dont know why i want to. im a senior in high school and even though im doing horrible in school, i managed to do well on the act and got an acceptance letter from one of my top college choices. honestly, i should be overjoyed, as any other normal person would be, but im not. I know that they can rescind your acceptance if your grades drop too low but honestly mine are so low that they would just have to accept me anyways. I know im smart and clever but i can never find the motivation to do my school work and study like im supposed to. i know i can do well in school because the few times where ive "clicked" a subject in a certain class, ive done well on the tests and quizzes but it will just all go away the next day, back to failing everything. ive been depressed ever since 7th grade and its only gotten worse. im a tennis player and been playing since i was 10. I just quit about two weeks ago and my mom, who enjoys watching me play, has been ignoring ever since i gave up in a match at a tournament. i had given up because she was watching me and i cant handle the stress of what shes thinking as im playing. my dad and sister are completely chill with me right now and im glad because thats all i have left. idk what to do anymore other than dying because my last straw just went out the window. I know its silly with being accepted into college and all, but what if i get rejected nearing the end of the year? i cant fucking stand all this bullshit the world is giving me, even though its tiny compared to what some are going through. ive always been great at hiding my emotions and i havent cried in a long time. im trying to major in chemistry to become a pharmacist in 6 years but idk if i can do it considering how much work you have to put in to be successful with it. Looking at my grades right now and the work i will have to do in college, i literally fucking hate myself. I want to know if i can major in chemistry and have that as a backup just in case pharm undergrad is too hard for me and i can lean on the chem BS. Before getting accepted into college i had always worried about what college i would get into, if any. Now its about my degree which wil determine my life. I cant help thinking every day and night what will happen if i dont make enough to support myself and how if i dont kill myself now, i will  later on because ill be homeless. Ive reached a melting point, breaking point, whatever the fuck point and i wanna just take my car and go 100mph down a highway till i crash and die. On another point, my mother said some hella mean things before she ignored me last week and its been taking a toll on me. She told me it was embarrassing to watch me play tennis(at the tournament) and she was ashamed to be my mother. She had a miscarriage when she was young and then she had my sister and i. Ever since, ive felt like i was a mistake, and that the first baby was meant to be the older one and my current sister the youngest. i feel fucking worthless and ive been praying to God ever since even though im an atheist. That is how you know i am desperate, when i pray to a God i dont believe in. I know im ranting but please read, think, and help me.
