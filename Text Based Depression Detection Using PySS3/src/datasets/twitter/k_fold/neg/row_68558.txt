My next birthday will be my lastLast march, I was at a point where life was only pain. I wanted to end it so badly but online I was told to wait because it would get better.

So, in only five months, everything got so worse I honestly don't care anymore.
My boyfriend whom I loved most in the world tried to commit suicide, failed and blamed me for having destroyed his life before he broke up.
My best friend for thirteen years turned her back on me because I have changed so much lately. 
My grandma, the only one I could ever really talk to, died of cancer. 
My parents gave up on me. And so did I.

On September 17th I will have me 18th birthday. I will wait until then for the miracle of my life getting better. If it doesn't happen, then it's OK too and I will look for my luck in another life I don't mess up like I did with this one. I have come to peace with my decision. I was scared at first but now it's more like mild fear before a test. 

I'm curious what disasters the last 27 days of my life have prepared for me. 

Wish me luck.
