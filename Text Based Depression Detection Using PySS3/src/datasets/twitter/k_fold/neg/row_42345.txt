I hate myselfEverything is my fault. I have no friends because of ME. I have no SO because of ME. I'm such a failure at even being a person. I'm so depressed and anxious because of my own sick brain. I just want to blast the sickness away... I fantasize about blowing my brains out just about every day. If someone is so bent on killing themselves wouldn't it be better for society if they just did it?
