I keep telling myself it's the one mistake I wouldn't be able to fix.I just want some peace. From this torture here on earth I seem to be doomed to repeat. It's my fault anyway. I'm the only one keeping me unhappy. I could do anything. Go anywhere. I keep reminding myself that if I do die, when I do die, I will get peace. No matter what my life was like. It's up to me to make peace happen in life. And it's the one thing I can't take back. I have no fucking clue how but you bet your ass I'm going back to sleep, and I'm gonna wake up again tomorrow. I still won't have my son but I still have a chance to have peace. I can be at peace and still be alive. I choose to believe it.
