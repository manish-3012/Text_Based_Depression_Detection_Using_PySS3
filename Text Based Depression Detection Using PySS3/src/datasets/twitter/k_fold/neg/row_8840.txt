Donâ€™t see the point in living anymoreGive me a reason to live and Iâ€™ll stay alive. 

My life is fucking shit. Everyone in school hates me because I was a little shit my freshman year. I would preach about communism and say tons of edgy shit which pissed a lot of people off.

Iâ€™ve changed but people still hate me.

I never get invited to shit unless itâ€™s for some project or something like that.  Other than that, no one really wants me around.

I am the epitome of a loser. I have nothing and no one, Iâ€™m unattractive, have bad grades and no friends that actually want me around. The people I do have donâ€™t really want me around.



If I donâ€™t post an update by Sunday, Iâ€™ll have a bullet in my head.
