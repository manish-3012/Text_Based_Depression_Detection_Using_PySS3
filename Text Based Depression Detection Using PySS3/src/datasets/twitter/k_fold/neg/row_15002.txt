Iâ€™m barely holding onI have been up all night having a prolonged panic attack. I get these a lot but this one has been sustained. I take loraz butbit isnâ€™t working. Iâ€™m back on lamictal but it hasnâ€™t kicked in yet. I have bipolar II. Iâ€™m in a depressed phase. Iâ€™m clawing at my skin and fantasizing about bleeding out. I punch myself to feel. I donâ€™t know how long I can do this. Everything is spiraling and I have to hold it together so we donâ€™t lose our apartment and my job and my family. I just want to be dead and for this to be all done. I donâ€™t know what to do or who can help at this point
