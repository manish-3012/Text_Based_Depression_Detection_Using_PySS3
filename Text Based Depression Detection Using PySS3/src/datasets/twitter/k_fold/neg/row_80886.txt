What happens when you ask for helpI've been depressed/suicidal for over a decade.  I've only tried once, I've never told anyone.  As far as any one knows for sure I'm just seriously depressed.  I'm extremely afraid to tell a friend let alone a professional that I want to kill myself because I'm terrified that I'm going to be thrown into an institution.  My life is fucked as it is, if I'm put away for a while I have no idea how I'd ever re-enter society.

I'll be perfectly honest, I'm going to be extremely skeptical of any answers to this but I'm giving it a shot.  

I'm falling apart more and more after trying to keep it together.  I have nervous breakdowns when I'm watching a show.  I can hide it in public down to a twitch but when I get home I shower and nearly collapse.  I'm so scared of everything all the time, and sometimes I feel very angry at everything for it.
