Going back and forthI'm a 17 year old boy. A few days ago my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me for another guy. We've been having rough times but I love her so, so much, and the thought of her forgetting about me to be with another guy is so heartbreaking.
      I thought everything was going to be better. She slowly cut me out of her social life then her life altogether. Of course I wasn't perfect but I though everything was going to be fine. As I type this out now I realise how petty and small it seems but I've been battling depression for a few years now.
      I started to have a pretty bad depressive episode a few weeks ago, and It pushed her away, nobody can handle me, I just want to be ok. I need love. I sound so crazy for being so young but I can't take it. I've been to the emergency room twice and tried to hang myself. It was 3am and I woke up feeling terrible, so I went out into the shed to do it. I called my girlfriend to say goodbye for the last time but I guess my mom heard me outside and she came out and stopped me.
       I have never felt so betrayed my someone I love. I love and miss her so much it's tearing me apart. I blocked her number her Facebook and her instagram to try and get better but it's killing me, she was a part of my life every single day.
      I'm scared of myself. I feel ok right now but something's going to hit me and I'm going to do it. My brain is fighting itself to death.
           All the times she said I was so handsome and all she could ask for, even just a couple weeks ago, were lies.
           My dog of 14 years died, my chef that I was apprenticed under was fired, I had a terrible mental snap then my girlfriend left me for another more attractive guy. Nobody can handle me. I'm sorry this is so scattered but my brain isn't right, I feel sick, I just want to talk
