Help me please. I'm scared.Help me.  I can't be honest with my own psychiatrists and psychologists.  I only tell them what I think they should hear.  If they knew I was abusing the pills they proscribed me and how suicidal I was I'd be in a hospital.  I don't want to be there so I keep lying.  I don't know what other options I have.  My parents are starting to notice me acting "different".  My facade is falling.  I'll be in deep shit soon.  Please help.  I'm scared.
