I just got back from the audiologistA national expert that I've been seeing just admitted to me that there's nothing he could do for my hyperacusis. Told me that I need to "work on living my life", as if there's anything left to live. I don't have anything left to live for. I can't talk to anyone. I can't see anybody. I can't go anywhere. I was an audiophile, and now I can barely even hear the sound of my own voice. I was an extrovert, and now, what little I can still hear hurts me so bad that I start screaming.

I had to sit for an hour long car ride back home with my dad barking in my ear. He took me out to lunch, and the whole time, all the cars in the lot were blasting music, but I couldn't say anything, because if I did he'd get angry at me, and then he'd yell and make my ears feel even worse. He took his sweet time finishing up his sandwich. He walked slow as possible as I tried hurrying back to the car. I had to sit still and say nothing the whole fucking ride. I just got back home, and I have a knife.

I don't want advice. I don't want feedback. I don't want to answer any more questions. I want to die.
