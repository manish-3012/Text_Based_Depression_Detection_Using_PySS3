I just really feeling like it's not worth it sometimes.He cheated. I'm still here, with a baby. I want to find a way to keep living but I just feel like there's no escape from this pain. It doesn't feel worth it, and everyone is tired of hearing me talk about how I just don't know if I can live anymore.
