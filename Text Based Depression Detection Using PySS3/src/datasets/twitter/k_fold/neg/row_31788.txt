i don't want to wake up tomorrow and have the means to make sure i drift off to a peaceful sleep and ensure that i am not here to wake upi'm tired of people

drama

anxiety

paranoia

trust issues

mental health disorders

personality disorders

just exasperated

throw my body in the woods; let wilderness take care of me

ship me somewhere where setting me ablaze on a float downriver is acceptable

otherwise throw my cremains into a river that feeds into the ocean or some shit
