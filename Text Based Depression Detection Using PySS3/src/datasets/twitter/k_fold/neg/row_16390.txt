i really don't like any of thisI've been thinking about this the whole day, and I finally came to the realisation that my life is completely meaningless. Like seriously. I have no reason to live on at all.

I barely have any friends and I doubt they really care about me that much anyway. Same for my family. No one likes me, no one gives a fuck about me, no one wants to talk to me. I'm really lonely and it just makes me feel even worse.

Every day is the same. I wake up completely dead inside, go to that dreaded hell hole known as highschool, come home, spend like 4 hours on homework and shit like that, sleep and repeat. That's it. Every goddamn day.

I already has an attempt a year ago. Did anyone care about me then? No. Do they care about me now? Still no.


Honestly I just want to finally be at peace for once. Thats all.
