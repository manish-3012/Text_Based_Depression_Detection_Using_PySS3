Iâ€™m so doneI know Iâ€™m young but I donâ€™t want to be here anymore 

Iâ€™m too tired,I hate my family. Why does no one care when I do something. Why do they only care about anyone else. Iâ€™ve always been the good kid up until the last 2 years but before that I was just the good kid, thatâ€™s how I rationalized never getting anything from my parents or siblings but now Iâ€™m just a pain. Social anxiety ruined my life.

No I ruined my life. I just suck now. I donâ€™t have a purpose at home, my brother just gets to be a snarky ass and when I defend myself I get in trouble and Iâ€™m just tired


I know Iâ€™m stupid, I know my reasons are stupid but I just canâ€™t with anything anymore. I donâ€™t want to do this. I want to go I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore
