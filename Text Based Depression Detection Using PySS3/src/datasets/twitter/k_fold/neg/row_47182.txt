Tired of my life and suicidalReddit folks, 
I guess I am done lurking around here. Never thought my first post would be something like this. 
Anyway, I just wanted to say I am shit tired of my life - I am very stressed and have anger management issues. I am on the other side of the 20s and single, and vent all my frustration out on my sweet sweet parents. I am done living like this. Like this, with tons of anxiety and guilt, like a hopeless mess stuck in a pattern of bad behaviour. 

I feel suicidal, and no, I don't seem validation from you all, but I am really tired. If anyone's been through a shitstorm like this, please opine, because I am done trying and losing my mind.
