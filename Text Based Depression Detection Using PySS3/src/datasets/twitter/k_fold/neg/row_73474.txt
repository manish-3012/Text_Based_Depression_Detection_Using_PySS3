I dropped out of college.School was never for me. 

I technically didn't graduate highschool. I was going to drop out, but California has retarded ass mandatory education laws. My only options were the CHSPE or waiting until I turn 18 then dropping out. Through the power of multiple choice questions, I passed the CHSPE.

I had originally entered community college to transfer to uni to get a C.S degree. 24/7 I'm in my room. If I'm not on my phone blasting my ears to death daydreaming, it's gaming on my laptop or programming. I enjoy programming. I can spend hours (my record is 11) typing away.

I was never going to pass the math classes, but at least I can say that I tried. Sucks that it was trigonometry of all classes that was my breaking point but I guess retards gotta tard. My GPA was barely hovering above 2.0. School had already given me my warning, so now I'm unable to get financial aid even if I wanted to go back to school. And I don't. I've always hated school. Never once have I enjoyed it. You go there, you sit, you regurgitate, you forget. I had a minimum of 4 more years of that, and I sooner slit my own throat. 

I honestly don't care. I *tried* to mask and fake as if I had a way out. In all actuality I never did. I was doomed to fail from the start. Again at least I can say I tried. All I know is that I have either a lifetime of minimum wage work or death. Death is really looking good. I'd have to buy some rope though since I can't buy a gun. I've also humored myself of taking the $1400 I got from FAFSA and just booking it to who knows where. Perhaps buy some gear then go die in the woods Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

But I decided I'll give it *one* last shot. I've given myself until January to learn what I need to learn and build the website for an idea I have. If it works out it works out if it doesn't then I'm done. We'll see what happens when the time comes.
