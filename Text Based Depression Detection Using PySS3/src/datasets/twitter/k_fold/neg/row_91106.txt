PointlessGot to the point where I'm worried about myself.  Got out of a long term relationship and finally moving out next weekend. Hooked up with a close friend only for a 360 to occur and she decided that that's not a thing. Very hungover and just feeling like there's no point or need with anything. I'm essentially a pointless individual and there's too many people on this planet anyway. Just nothing is going my way, I'm not coping well and just sick of battling through with the whole it gets better. Feel like a huge burden on everyone and they would all be better off without me.
