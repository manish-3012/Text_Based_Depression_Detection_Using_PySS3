Help meI know exactly how to do it, but there are people who would be broken if i did. Sometimes i fantasize i cross a genie allowing me 1 magical wish. I'd wish for a death that wouldn't affect my family. Because I know if i wished for anything else i would eventually fail at it and be thrown down harder than before.
I cant show it to anyone i care though. How rotten, weak and pussy i am inside. Because all i got back from talking was ending friendships or at the best case scenario a sort of hang in there as a display of pity. I dont want no hang in theres. I want the fucking formula to being immune.
I dont want die. What i want in the end is to be strong and invulnerable OR die. There is no point being weak and torn down by every failure. I see people getting back up and succeeding. I dont have that switch where i can just get back up and be like "twas nothing". It will always haunt me. Every failure eventually comes back to my memory to the point that i even made a mental exercise: pull out a memory from the past that doesnt instantly bring regretful one attached to it. I came up with one. A crappy birthday card i got when i was 6, which turns out to be my first memory. How weak is that?
Theres a million things i want to say but im just putting it like this for now... Maybe because my head is spinning i dont talk with much sense anyway.
Every thing i set myself to do, i fail. No matter how big or small. I dissapoint the people i care about. I had love once in my life (fucking long distance dating) and when we got to meet she was dissapointed that i was so weak. I will never be loved cause i will never be able to portray any dominance or "alpha" status. I will always be on the side and watch powerless. I watch as my friends are happy and i cant force myself to become happy or immune to offenses like they are. Why keep going when all the road is full of bumps and the roads i see others take are smooth?
