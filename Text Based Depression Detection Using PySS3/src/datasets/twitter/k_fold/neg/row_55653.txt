Getting drunk instead of killing myself....Sort of a slow death... but I can't hurt myself... I just haven't figured out how to ask my parents for their grown son to move back home.... because things are falling apart mentally. Or rather, things have fallen apart.

Anyway, just another day to put off real life while not doing anything harmful to my friends and fam....
