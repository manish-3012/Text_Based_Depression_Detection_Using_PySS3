Brief story of my suicide attemptEverything had fallen apart. I was alone and broke in an Airbnb. I had no one to talk to except for my sister. I was in a state of hopelessness and despair. 
    I had recently become aware that a medication I had on hand could be  lethal in larger doses. I know most meds are a guaranteed failed attempt, but this one had some much better odds. (Not sharing the name of the med as I donâ€™t want to give anyone any ideas). 
     I called my mom to tell her I loved her. I wanted to try and potentially leave her with less pain about my death. My suicide note was written and I swallowed the bottle of pills. 
    After 10 minutes the anxiety that I might die crept in. I would describe it as more of a primal anxiety. I wasnâ€™t ruminating, rather it was more of a flight/fight state. 
   To kill the anxiety I reached back into my bag and swallowed around 17mg of Xanax. 
  I awoke to have a tall blonde man standing over me asking if I was okay. Turns out my mom figured something was horribly wrong by the sound of my voice and me randomly saying I loved her so she called someone she new in the city I was in to check on me. It turned out he broke into the Airbnb I was staying in. He claimed the door was open but I know it was closed. I convinced him everything was fine and he left. 
    Prior to my attempt I was on 3mg of Xanax a day for around 3 months. I ended up having to go to detox the next day as I knew my doc wouldnâ€™t give me anymore and that I couldnâ€™t go cold turkey. 

Thought Iâ€™d share my story. My only advice Iâ€™d have for those out there, and Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™ll be this way for you, but when youâ€™ve begun youâ€™re attempt, thereâ€™s a high probability youâ€™ll find out thereâ€™s a piece of you that wanted to keep living.
