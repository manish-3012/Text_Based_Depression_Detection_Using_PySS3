I know that this sounds egocentric, but I feel like there is no value in my life if I can't be the smartest person in the world.**This is because when I was younger, I never had any friends or real-life hobbies, and people told me I was too intelligent for those things.**  I believed their lies, and thought I would compensate for it by being the smartest person in the world.

But scientific research says otherwise, so I still have no reputation.  I actually made an important scientific discovery, but I ruined my reputation on the internet, so almost nobody will believe me.
