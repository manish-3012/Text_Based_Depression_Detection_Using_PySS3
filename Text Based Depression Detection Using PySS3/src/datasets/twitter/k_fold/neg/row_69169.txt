I want to do this so badI'm sick of lving with constant anxiety over a really bad mistake I made. I'm sick of not being good enough for anything. I'm sick of just being meh. I wish I was never born. My life seems like it is one constant fuck up after another. But if you didn't know you'd think life was going great for me. Got a teaching job, graduated college. I'm so sick of this, the only thing stopping me right now is the thought of my dad coming home and finding me. He doesn't deserve that. No one deserves me, I don't deserve this life I've been given. Life would be bearable if this person wasn't contacting me reminding me of my past mistakes.
