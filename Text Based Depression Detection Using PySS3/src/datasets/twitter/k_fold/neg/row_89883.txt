I am constantly anxious and I feel trapped. My head feels light and spacey but it hurts. I don't know what to do.Every now and again, my mind moves to the past and it feels like this foreign thing. 
It doesn't seem like a long time at all.
I don't feel 31. I feel like a teenager, the same confusion and fear.
The thought of not being here anymore feels so attractive. I don't want to be in pain anymore. Its tiring trying to be normal. I'm so tired.
