Never had these thoughts before.I'm 35 been with my wife for 15 years. We have two beautiful children together. She came to me seven days ago and said she wanted a divorce. I havent eaten anything since then. We have had some issues but none that seem so insurmountable that this is the only option. I love her too much to let her go with out a fight. I have suggested counseling and a separation to no avail. I'm at a loss. The only thing keeping me going has been my kids and without her by my side I don't see how I can face them. I can think of nothing but wrapping something around my neck and being done with the pain. I already took the trash out so no one else will have to.
