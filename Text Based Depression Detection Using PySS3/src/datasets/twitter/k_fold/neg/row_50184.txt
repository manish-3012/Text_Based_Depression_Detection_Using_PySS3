Moral suicide?Everyone defaults to suicide being immoral, but I can think of modern pop cultural or historical examples where it is honorable to kill oneself. I think of Bruce Banner from the MCU- he was willing to die to stop himself from hurting others again (except he got cockblocked by the Hulk). I am such a bad person and if I killed myself it would acknowledge that, maybe atone for my terribleness, and most of stop me from being selfish in the future. Yeah of course the possibility of me doing future good is lost. But I feel like there is nothing I can do to change the past. Why can't people see what a monster I am and let me handle it my way?
