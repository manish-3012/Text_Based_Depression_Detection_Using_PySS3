I am uselessI have to preface this with the fact that I have Asperger's. I just cannot function in the presence of new people. I always find a way to fuck it up. The only socialization I get is at a weekly group that I have been going to for years. I cannot speak to anybody I don't know unless I am so drunk that I will not remember it the next day. And all my former friends are leaving the state. So I literally have zero friends. And it has become next to impossible to find new ones. Maybe I'm better off dead. No more cares about being lonely or having panic attacks at the prospect of being around people I don't know.
