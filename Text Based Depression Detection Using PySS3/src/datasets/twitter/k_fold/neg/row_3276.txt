My aunt and uncle baby sat my brother and I when we were little but they molested me and not my brother.I(25m) just had my 4th breakdown in the past year about this same thing and my mother refuses to acknowledge it ever happened and questions every single detail of the story. The problem is I was maybe 5 when it happened and so she sees a missed detail as proof that it never happened and uses it to berate me and insult me. In addition she will give me answers(fake answers) about what happened and then when I say the same thing she says I am a liar and that I am lying for attention. I never asked for any of this and yet I have had to deal with it in silence for almost 20 years. I finally come out and talk about it and neither of my parents give a shit because it would mess up the family dynamic. I've seen a shrink(s) and they were all worthless(said it was my fault) and I still have nightmares. How am I supposed to move on with my life if I am strangled by what my aunt did to me, and by that fact that I am 1000% relying on my parents on everything because I cannot find a job anywhere, especially one that allows me to move out. I feel like I am being tortured and there is no way out.
