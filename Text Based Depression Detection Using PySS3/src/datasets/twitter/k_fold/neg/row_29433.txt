Few questions about rehabilitation homes or wards.I attempted my life once and was hospitalized in a temp area for the 72hr hold. I'm out of options and maybe considering it.

What does it take to get admitted to one other than that?  
Are there long term places?  
What are the more long term ones like?   
What is usually the amount of freedom you get?   
What do they cost?
