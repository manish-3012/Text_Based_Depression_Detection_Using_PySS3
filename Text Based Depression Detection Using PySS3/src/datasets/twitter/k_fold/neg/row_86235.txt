IdkThe constant feeling of melancholy is getting old. I want to be happy but itâ€™s like my brain wonâ€™t let me. Today I had a good day but hereâ€™s some background:
- I work directly and only with the guy I dated (he broke my heart making me feel used and not good enough for him). 
- I feel static in life. I donâ€™t make the amount of money I wish I did and I know it takes time. I have a lot to be grateful for. I feel like Iâ€™m not good enough at anything. 
- Iâ€™m away from home and my family (mother, grandfather, and grandmother). This has been the norm for over a year and Iâ€™m still struggling. 
- I have no friends here where I live now. I mean I do have people I could say Iâ€™ve hung out with but no one ever reaches out to me or asks me to do anything. Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m an alright person so sometimes I donâ€™t get why no one wants to be around me. 

So, basically I donâ€™t see the point in trying. Itâ€™s more bad days than good and I canâ€™t ignore that I feel worthless. Iâ€™m just a spot in someoneâ€™s peripheral. Things would be better if I wasnâ€™t here because no one is looking in my direction anyway. I keep thinking of ways to do it and Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m scared of myself, scared that I wonâ€™t succeed and the consequences will follow suit. I just donâ€™t think I deserve to be here when my entire life started from being an accident in the first place.
