Suicide notesYo wassup Reddit. Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression for about 6 years now. Iâ€™m ready to end it. Recently, Iâ€™ve found myself writing my suicide notes for a few people I care about. However, thereâ€™s this one note that Iâ€™m struggling to write. Itâ€™s for my old best friend, who I called my brother. We had platonic love. That bro love. A few years ago tho, he moved across country because his parents were dealing with divorce and his mom had moved him and his siblings out there. I was already dealing with depression and this hit hard because I wasnâ€™t going to see the homie anymore. We were both dealing with a lot and my depression and suicidal tendencies really took a toll on him and he started pushing me away because I was bad for his health. I didnâ€™t understand his choice until recently and it made me upset. Upset because I loved dude and upset because I knew everything had fallen apart because of me. He found new friends and I struggled and still struggle finding new ones. He stopped talking to me eventually and still doesnâ€™t talk to me till this day no matter how many times I text him, hoping heâ€™s okay and reminding I still care for him. Anyways, Iâ€™m here because Iâ€™m currently writing my notes and man itâ€™s just so hard to try and write one for him. I have so much to say but I donâ€™t know if heâ€™d even care for one. Itâ€™s hard for me to believe that heâ€™d want my negative energy back in his life one last time. But I also donâ€™t want to make him sad with a note full of emotions and â€˜I love youâ€™â€™s. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™d rather die without him knowing I died or die with him knowing and also knowing I still cared for him. Plz help lol
