My girlfriend cheated on me and I feel like sh*tI tried the suicide hotline but it's busy so this is my next bet. I used to love my gf until she cheated on me. I feel like nothing matters and I was thinking to end it because of it. I was loyal and loving to her but she was not. She cheated on me for like 2 months like wtf. I read the text messages and yeah. I hate myself because I should have known that she was cheating on me.
