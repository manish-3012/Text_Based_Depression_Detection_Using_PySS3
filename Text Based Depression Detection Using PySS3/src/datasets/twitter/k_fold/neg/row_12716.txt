Thoughts during rough timeIts been about a month since my ex broke up with me after two and a half year relationship and immediately had sex with another guy. In the beginning I thought I was strong enough to get through it by relying on my good friends and family but after a week I started to sporadically get thoughts about how easy ending it would be. 

I thought nothing of it at that point and considered it to be somthing that just happens when you go through tough times. But it has been increasing a lot and desperate to get through this I started surrounding myself with people at all times and yet I feel more and more lonely. Desperate to feel a whim of happiness I grasped to drugs and have been smoking weed daily for over half a month. This worked in the beginning but just fueled the down feeling the moments that I'm not high.

Right now I'm scared to sleep because one of two things happen, either I dream about my ex and wake up crying with a feeling of loss and the thoughts creep back into my mind or I dream that I end it and I wake up happy which in itself scares me that this sits so deeply that dreams about this makes me happy. 

I really don't want to have this feeling, I just want to be happy. I've been holding up the facade that I'm happy to people around me because it would break my parent's hearts to know that this plagues me.

How do I get these thoughts out of my head, how do I approach the people around me without freaking them out, how am I supposed to make my way through this?
