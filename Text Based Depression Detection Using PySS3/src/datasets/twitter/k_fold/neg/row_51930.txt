I canâ€™t do it anymoreI feel like Iâ€™m not even here sometimes. My best friend left me because she got a girlfriend, decided she didnâ€™t need me anymore or want me because of that and now hates my guts and blocked me. 

It sounds so dramatic but I canâ€™t even get out of bed. Every time I try and go out and act like everythingâ€™s fine I feel sick to my stomach. The feeling never leaves me, when Iâ€™m with other people at the back of my brain is just â€˜sheâ€™s gone. sheâ€™s gone. sheâ€™s goneâ€™. I cry so much now, I canâ€™t stop thinking about all the memories I have with her and all the stupid funny things we did together and all the conversations we had and

I canâ€™t cope. The day after she left I had to go to school. I left at lunch, went home, drank a 1/4 of a bottle of vodka and cried myself to sleep. All I can think about is â€˜who am I going to talk to at 3am now? Who am I gonna send all the funny things I find to now? Who is gonna be there for me now?â€™ Thereâ€™s nobody. I just want her back, the pain is so strong. I want to kill myself. I want it all to just end, I canâ€™t deal with this anymore why wasnâ€™t I good enough

I canâ€™t breathe I canâ€™t stop crying
Iâ€™m so pathetic, why didnâ€™t she stay 

she doesnâ€™t even care

fuck
