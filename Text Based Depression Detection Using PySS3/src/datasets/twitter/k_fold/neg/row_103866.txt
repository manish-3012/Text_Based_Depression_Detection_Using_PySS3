Unhappy birthdayToday is my birthday and all I want to do is die. I'm sick of talking to people I'm sick of working I'm sick of being depressed every second and wondering if ill ever be happy again but most of all I'm sick of being alive every second of existence is painful and I don't think I'm strong enough to do it for much longer.
