NooseI made a noose at work, I was in my office alone and put it around my neck and pulled. It felt good. I only stopped because I knew my coworker was in their office next door and could come in at any moment. It felt good but also scared me a little. idk. I'm on meds and currently in therapy but i still just don't want to keep going in this shitty world. i'm tired.
