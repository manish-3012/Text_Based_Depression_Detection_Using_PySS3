I really cba anymore...I always feel like Iâ€™m the one to do something wrong and I always have to be the one to make things right I have tried so hard in my life to change and be a nice and happy person to be a round but Iâ€™m really fucked up deep down and Iâ€™d rather it just be all over. Iâ€™m sorry mum and dad i wish I could be a different person :(
