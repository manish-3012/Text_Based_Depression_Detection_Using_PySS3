Iâ€™ve personified deathI canâ€™t help but think of death as a person. He says to me that he can make everything okay, and stop all my worries. He can take the emptiness inside of me and fill it with joy. He can make everyone who ever slighted me regret it. And all I have to do is embrace him. 

He says it will hurt for a little bit. That Iâ€™ll feel cold and Iâ€™ll shake until I finally bleed out, but the hot water and aspirin will speed that up. He says that if the blade is sharp enough the sting shouldnâ€™t be too bad. 

I spend my days thinking about him. Tonight, I planned to meet up with him. But Iâ€™m too scared. Iâ€™ve taken the aspirin and drawn the bath but I canâ€™t bring myself to go any further. 

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting here. Iâ€™m sorry.
