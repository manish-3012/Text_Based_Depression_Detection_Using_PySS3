Almost done with this garbage lifeAs the day of my suicide draws closer Iâ€™ve been sure to keep appearances up so my parents have no idea. Itâ€™ll probably hit them like a truck out of nowhere, just seeing me die, I doubt they have any real idea itâ€™s coming. The idea of finally being free of all the bullshit, is the most comforting thought Iâ€™ve had in years. I wish it didnâ€™t have to end this way, and I wish I had done many things differently, but hey sometimes you just get fucked over by the world. Sometimes youâ€™re just unlucky, I get it, Iâ€™ve accepted it, and Iâ€™m ready to die. In case this is my last post here goodbye everyone.
