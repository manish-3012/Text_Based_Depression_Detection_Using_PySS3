I have never had suicidal thoughts before, and I'm a little freaked out.I'm new around here, so please let me know if this isn't the right place for a post like this. I'm hoping someone might have advice, or be able to relate to what's going on with me.

I have been struggling with chronic pain for about four months now, and the doctors I'm seeing can't seem to figure out the cause. I have gone through several tests and tried several different medications, and the pain waxes and wanes, but I don't know why I have it or whether it will ever go away. As a result I have been pretty depressed, sleeping a lot and having trouble focusing at work. I don't see my friends very often because I just don't have the energy to get out of the house.

For the past few weeks, I have started having these weird, fleeting thoughts about ways to die. I don't actually want to die, and I'm not particularly sad when I have these thoughts; they just appear, and I'm usually surprised to find myself thinking these things.

Example: I'm supposed to be taking warm baths with diluted bleach, since I just got over a MRSA infection and that's one of the ways to get rid of any bacteria that are still hanging around. Tonight as I was adding a cup of bleach to the tub, I thought, "I could drink this." I didn't want to drink it at all; it just occurred to me that I *could,* if I wanted to.

I don't want to talk to my husband or my friends about this, because I'm afraid it will just freak them out. I am seeing a counselor for help with my depression, but I'm reluctant to bring this up with him-- I don't want to give him the idea that I'm going to kill myself, because I'm honestly not going to.

Has anyone had an experience like this? Any suggestions?
