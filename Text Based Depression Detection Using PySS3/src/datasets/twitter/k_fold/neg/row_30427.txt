postI'm a 15yr old who's been in Online schooling since late Elementary. I have zero social skills. The last time I talked to a person in real life besides my parents has been literal years. Parents are divorced. Both have a PhD. All conversations with my parents have been either about schooling or an argument (that usually is about school). Left the only friends I've had for six years behind an hour ago. I didn't keep up in my online schooling and my parents have submitted the forms for public school. I plan to drop out of highschool as soon as possible- my father has already said he will disown me if I do so. I have 0 skills. I also have chronic UC with a pull-through and with it nightly incontinence. I'm a pathological liar- I had to stop myself from adding details to try and exaggerate my situation as I typed this. I absolutely despise myself for it. 

There are no painless means of suicide in the house, but I'm very seriously considering it anyways. Plenty of prescription meds thanks to the UC and a whole bread basket of other smaller medical problems.
