I have lost everything I cared about no matter how smallThere is literally nothing left, I hate everything that is, nothing works out and Iâ€™m in a prison, Iâ€™ve always had suicide as that one thing Iâ€™ll never get low enough to until now. Iâ€™ve genuinely never seen myself this low and I donâ€™t know how to talk myself off this ledge. I really donâ€™t want to suicide, I want to see myself go and do the things I wanted to, but I know I canâ€™t and I feel like I have nothing now, I probably wonâ€™t have anything ever, nothing, I swear to god nothing Iâ€™ve tried ever worked out and itâ€™s just over. Iâ€™m so tired
