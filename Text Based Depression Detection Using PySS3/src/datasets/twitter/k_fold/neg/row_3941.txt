Too weak to end itIn my heart of hearts I know I canâ€™t do it. Which is awful because now there is no way out. I cannot live a normal life. Not even a functional one. I am creating chaos and hurting anyone who gets close to me. I donâ€™t even care about hurting them otherwise I wouldnâ€™t do it. Iâ€™ve crossed too many lines to be able to mentally deal with who I am. I am a bad person, selfish and always have been. Iâ€™ve tried to change but itâ€™s impossible and too hard. 

The hours and days are endless. Everything is pointless. I have tried all the help but it doesnâ€™t work. Thereâ€™s nothing more to do except wait.
