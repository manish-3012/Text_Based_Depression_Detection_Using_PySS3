24M, I think about killing myself everydayMy whole family is dead. Nothing I do really makes me happy. I don't feel comfortable in any sort of social situation. I exclusively have sex with prostitutes. I feel hollow everyday, and I really can't imagine it getting any better. Whenever I've tried to talk about my problems, the conversation dies immediately, I get empty platitudes from an annoyed person, or you just get made fun of behind your back. You quickly learn to never talk to anyone about your problems. 

I exercise frequently, I eat right, I sleep a lot, but it doesn't do much. I'm in the best shape of my life and completely dead inside. I'm in college, but I just feel like I'm going to end up poor and alone and I'll be dead on the street. I see other people being happy and getting excited about things, and I could never imagine myself in the same situation. I hear people that are decades older than me talking about how they're going out to lunch with their mother, and I couldn't imagine doing that.

I have no idea what to do. Everyday is an inconvenience, and often times I feel that if I were going to die I'd be happy about it because then I'd finally have an excuse to let go.
