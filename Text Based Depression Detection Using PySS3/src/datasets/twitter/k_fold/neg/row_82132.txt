I think i might be depressedFor about half a year I wasn't as cheerful as always. 
I was that one kid that everyone liked in school because I was handsome and funny but at home my dad's an alcoholic and my parents always argue sometimes more than 7 times a week. 

I started smoking year ago and since then I haven't felt genuinely happy. I've been tired of having to put up a facade of that funny guy. I fell in love with a girl that thinks she isn't good enough for a guy which I not even am cuz she doesn't know who I really am. Nothing brought me happiness in a very long time and the only thing I enjoy now is listening about loneliness cuz that brings me peace while most of my friends whom I myself tought how to smoke now are getting wasted all the time and there wasn't a single time we hang out without smoking since then. 

The only thing that had a chance to light me up was that girl i fell in love with but now because of quarantine i won't probably see her for a few months and I'm scared that this feeling of emptyness might strengthen...
