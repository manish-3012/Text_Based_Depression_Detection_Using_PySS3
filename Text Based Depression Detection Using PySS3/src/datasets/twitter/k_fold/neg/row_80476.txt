Has anyone else been let down by mental health "Support"?So for a few years I've been in and out of psych wards, and been under the "Care" of the local mental health team. But all my nurse seems to do is make me worse. She claims she tries to help but she keeps telling me to for just an example, clean up, get a job, even though I've told her over and over again I want help with motivation. She's recently referred me to someone who's going to "help" me find work. (I.e. forcing me to do something I'm not ready to) I rarely even go outside. Another one which is quite funny, she contacted the local council. She said they'd help me clean up and help me with support etc. Guess what? The council guy came round and told me I need to clean. I mentioned motivation, he just said "Well find the motivation. If you don't clean up in 6 weeks you will be in breach of your tenancy." Bare in mind this is a local authority. I KNOW what I need to do, but I need to get motivated. They have this "get over it " attitude which is extremely damaging. The only reason I'm even still here is because attempts that should've worked didn't. I'm just sick of it all :( 

They keep saying the old favourite "You don't really want to die." Yet my best friend, who knows me inside out knows that it's genuine and even she's pissed off with all this "Help." I'm even worse than what I was a year ago because of it all; which quite honestly I thought would be impossible. I just don't know where to turn now. I'm UK btw if that helps, any suggestions are appreciated. But please don't just be like "Seek professional help." I have a CPN, a psychiatrist and a psychologist. None of them know their arses from their faces; and none of them seems to know what's wrong with me, let alone how to help. They just seem to be chucking everything at me in the hopes I get magically cured. So yeah.

Tldr: I've literally lost all hope, and all professional help has just been making things worse.
