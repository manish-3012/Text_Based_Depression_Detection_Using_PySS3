How to kill me without breaking my moms heart ?These days are very strange to me. 
Sometimes I decided to leave this earth. 
Family pressure is the worst. I know our parents never support our works. What I want to do wasn't on me. Without success, nothing is countable. But it takes time to win. They don't understand. They love me. I know, but I don't feel that way.

Ma, Dad, Could you ever say, " I'm proud of you."
 Just for one time? 
So I can die peacefully.
