Iâ€™m just tired of tryingFirst time posting anything on reddit, wish it had been under better circumstances than this but oh well.

Anyways my backstory is that I am a 19 year old male that has suffered from bad social anxiety for the vast majority of my life. All throughout high school I was scared to go to parties where there would be more than a few people because I didnâ€™t want my social anxiety/awkwardness to get in the way and make me seem like even more of an idiotic loser than I already make myself out to be. Somehow I managed to get through high school and 2 weeks after graduating I left for the Army, and for once I actually kinda truly enjoyed something in my life. But as life would turn out I got injured during training and was medically discharged last month after serving only 9 months of my 6 year contract. Once I was put on medical hold I was treated like utter shit by just about everyone, and as you can imagine this didnâ€™t go so well for my state of mind and it quite frankly destroyed me mentally. Throughout the agonizing months as a medical holdover awaiting discharge I never went to see anyone about my depression, mainly because I feared what might happen and how it might affect my future civilian life, and the thought of that absolutely terrified me. So now here I am back in the civilian world labeled a â€œdisabled vetâ€ at the age of 19 feeling mentally drained and depressed every single day. I am set to start college this upcoming fall but in all honesty I just donâ€™t know about this life anymore. Iâ€™m tired of hearing the same things like â€œYouâ€™re  so young, you shouldnâ€™t be worrying about stuff like thatâ€ or â€œthings will get better once you go to school or get a job.â€ Iâ€™m always told to go out and make new friends but every time I try I just end up making a fool of myself. The few friends that I had moved away to college and donâ€™t care too talk to me anymore, and every attempt Iâ€™ve made at getting to know a girl has been an absolute failure. I just feel like a weak worthless man who doesnâ€™t have any talent, has never had an actual relationship, and fails at every attempt in advancing in life. Believe me when I say that I would have pulled the trigger long ago, however I fear that my suicide would break my mothers and grandparents heart and I really donâ€™t want my depression to affect their lives as it has affected mine.I donâ€™t really know what I hope to get out of typing this or if anyone really cared enough to read through it all, but Iâ€™m honestly just in the stage of staying up every single night debating about whether or not I should stay and fight or just push the off button. Any insight or advise would be appreciated, and Iâ€™m typing this on mobile at midnight so forgive the inevitable spelling and grammar errors Iâ€™ve made.
