I need help please or advice please?Hi. Is it ok that i made this account? Iâ€™m just really scared and i donâ€™t know what to do and im scared people will be mean to me.
Iâ€™m 13 and female.
I have schizophrenia and autism and add.
Yesterday i didnâ€™t go to school because i was really upset because the voices were making me cry and making me feel really bad and i didnâ€™t want to go go school so my parents said that i can stay at home. 
Today and just now i have been feeling really bad and they have been saying mean things like telling me to hurt myself and try to kill myself because im a really bad person for not going to school. 
I am suicidle and my parents know but i have just taken a bunch of my medication and i hurt my arms pretty badly and iâ€™m bleeding a bit and i feel sick. 
My parents are out to the shop and i donâ€™t know what to do? But if i call someone like an ambulance or the hospital wonâ€™t they be mean because i hurt myself and it was my fault? And will they not be nice because i can hear voices but what if they donâ€™t believe me and are mean because i will be crying? And will they know that i hear voices already? Iâ€™m just kinda worried and my arms really hurt and my stomach really hurts alot and it wonâ€™t stop. What do i even do? 

Im sorry if this was written badly or something i just am kinda shaking and im worried and scared and trying to clean blood off my arm before it gets on my bed or my clothes or anywhere. Im sorry if this isnt the right place to put this. I got messaged that it might be good here.
