Literally nothing fucking mattersDon't try to say it does. It doesn't. There is no meaning and no value to my life and to life in general. I don't want to live without a purpose. I can't create a purpose. I want to die because living is nothing. I wish I could die but I'm scared of failing my attempt and ending up damaged enough that I can't try again. But I don't think I want to continue this.
