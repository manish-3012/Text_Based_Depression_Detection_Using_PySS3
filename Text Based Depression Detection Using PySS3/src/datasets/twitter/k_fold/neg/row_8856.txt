Can't find the courageI want to end it, but I dont want to hurt those left behind. I can't find the courage to end it even though every second I exist is pain and sadness and loneliness.

The only person who did just abandoned me. Everyone says my life is just starting but I know I'm nearing the end. If I ever have the guts to do it...
