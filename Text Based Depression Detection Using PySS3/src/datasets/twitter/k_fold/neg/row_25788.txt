Why continue, when you are a net negative to society?I just wish I could feel. I wish I could be normal. What use is life when you drag down all those around you? What use is life when it's nothing but isolation, contemplating yourself? Not producing, not socializing, what is the point? People actively avoid me. I try being friendly, being helpful - it seems pointless. I've become a net negative to society. 

I've always believed in doing everything possible to improve society as a whole. Through politics, or volunteering - improve society, improve the community you live in by any possible means. Maybe this way of thinking has backfired on me - when I look at myself, I see myself as nothing but a overall detriment to society. Hardly any social networks - therefor I hardly ever make anyone feel happier, give someone the pleasure of company and socialization - if anything the opposite. It seems as though people actively try to avoid socializing with me. Maybe this is because, ultimately, people feel worse off when they try talking to me.

I've been thinking a lot recently - would it not be a heroic act, to end myself for the betterment of society? There is only so much an individual can do, easily replaced by another individual. I hardly think that I contribute in any meaningful or positive way to society. It's highly unlikely I will ever marry - not being the wreck of a person I am. Whatever social interactions I have clearly are nothing but a negative for the other party - I only do harm. Any work I do benefits the community - it only benefits the pockets of wealthy men I will never meet, who will never contribute back to society in a meaningful way. If I'm going to be a negative on society - why not minimize the damage?
