Killing myself would probably be a dumb decision, but I'm pretty dumb.I feel like I don't want to live anymore. Maybe I could donate my body and hopefully become useful.

I don't have plans for my future because I never believed I'd make it even this far. I am a failure and will amount to nothing. 

And then there is some stupid boy who I can't seem to let go of. Great, suicidal over a boy, right? It makes me angry that I let something so trivial bother me this much. I feel like he takes advantage of me but I love him too much to change anything. Or maybe I'm just addicted to the thought that someone might like me. 

I'm probably just gonna get drunk and see where things go.
