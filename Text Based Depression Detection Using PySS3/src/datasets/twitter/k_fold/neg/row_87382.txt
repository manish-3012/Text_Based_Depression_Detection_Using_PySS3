Not sure what to do in regards to money and life anymore.Iâ€™m going to go see a counselor today on my college campus before I do anything to myself. I was seeing her last semester before I killed myself and was alright from November until a few days ago.

I feel like my depression is getting worse and I canâ€™t even hold down a part-time job. My depression keeps interfering with my work. I work with children, so I have to be happy-go-lucky all the time and I just canâ€™t do it. I donâ€™t want to call in again, but I know that I canâ€™t do the damn job. 

I couldnâ€™t do my last job anymore working at a jail for nearly ten years because I got too depressed being there. I think the root of my problem mutated and grew while being there and itâ€™s totally affected my life. I had to pay for university somehow, but the work made me totally cynical about people and the world around me after seeing how people treated one another and themselves in there.

I try to think positively, but the memories are there in the subconscious.

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.

What would I do for money if I canâ€™t hold a job? 

I want to continue being a student, but I donâ€™t even know what the endgame is anymore. I want to be a teacher when Iâ€™m done, but I canâ€™t even keep myself together for these daycare kids.
