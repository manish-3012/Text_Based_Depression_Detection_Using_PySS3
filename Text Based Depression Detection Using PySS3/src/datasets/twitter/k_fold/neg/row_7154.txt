I dont know anymoreIm not sure how to go about this.   Life has lead to a very depressing time. I feel like nothing is right.  Im 28 no job, significantother , no nothing. Im an overweight male, and i honestly feel like i cant win.  I try my hardest to smile and act like its okay but it drives me nuts.  I want to escape.  Why doesn't anyone like me. I try my hardest to be nice and help, but in the end im still the same
 sad piece of shit on the side.  Why bother, its the same shit over andover.  Being used and it gets old.. Im not sure what to do anymore
