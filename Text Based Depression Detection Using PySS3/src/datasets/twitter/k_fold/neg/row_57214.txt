I got a balloon for my birthdayI don't really know what to say. I made a deal with myself that if nothing got better by the time I was twenty-two I would end it. I was twenty-one at the time. 

It was my twenty second birthday on Saturday. 

I have tried so hard.
I've been to therapy ever since I was fourteen. I spoke to my current woman a few weeks ago and told her I was having suicidal thoughts. She didn't really say anything. Then I OD'd and when I got out of hospital I told her the same thing. She said I should throw anything that could potentially be damaging away. This advice I saw as ridiculous because I'd never do it so I discharged myself.

Don't really know what to do now.
I don't want to die. I just want to be safe.
