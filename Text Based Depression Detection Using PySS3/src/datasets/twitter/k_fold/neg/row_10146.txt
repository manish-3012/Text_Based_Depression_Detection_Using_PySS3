Human suffering, the story without an end.Our ancestors went through it; our great-great-great grandchildren will go through it. And now it is our stage, and we go through it now. Our joys and sufferings are Shakespearean. They are a microcosm of what we all experience. It is up to all of us to decide if we have reached the end. I won't detail my own joys and sufferings here; if you want to know badly enough, you will find them under other posts of mine. I have had a mostly good ride, until recently, where it has turned painful. I had no need for God when the ride was going well. Now I wonder, meanwhile falling deeper into the pit. I have seen how good the ride can be, and I have seen how bad the ride can be. If it can change from great to awful; if it can change from joyous to miserable; if it can change from riches to poverty, surely it can change again in the other direction. It's funny in way; when it's good long enough, we don't think about it; when it's bad long enough, it absorbs us. I have found myself to be a nihilist: it is all meaningless, both the good and the bad. We create our own meaning. I have forgotten how to do it, or stopped doing it, but I am not sure I want to remember how to do it again. The universe will get by just fine either way. To strive for everything in the face of the knowledge that it leads ultimately to nothing, is insane. And yet it mesmerizes me that people do it every day. Something about life wants to live, and I have lost any understanding of what that something is.
