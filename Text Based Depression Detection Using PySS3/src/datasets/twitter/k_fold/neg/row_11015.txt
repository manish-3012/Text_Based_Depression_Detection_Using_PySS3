I've had itThat's what my supposedly best friend said to me after living together for not even a month. I told her for years that it was a bad idea, that people who come too close to me just realise they hate me. She promised me that would never be the case.

Here we are then. Everyone tells you not to believe all those depressive thoughts. But mine just always turn out to be true. Now I truly have no one left. That was the last person, and she finally realised that I'm just a piece of shit and she doesn't want to be anywhere near me. I don't blame her. I don't want to be anyone near me either.

I'm just gonna kill myself. I'm sick of all this pain. This world definitely is not a place for me. I just fuck everything up and just when I think my pain can't get worse, it does. Fuck it, I've had it too. I've had it with almost seven years of this pain. I've had it with this world. I've had it with humanity. Won't be too long now. I don't even mind if she finds me. Hates my guts anyway, might even be delighted to now I'm not longer a burden to her in any way.
