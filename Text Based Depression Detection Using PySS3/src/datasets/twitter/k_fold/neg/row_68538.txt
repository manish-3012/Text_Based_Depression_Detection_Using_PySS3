Why Do I even speak?I fucking hate myself.  I can't do anything right. All I do is argue with others or treat them like idiots.  When I'm the real idiot.  I'm aware I do it yet I can't stop myself.  I try to not talk to prevent myself from doing it but the littlest thing sets me off.  I try to fill most of what I say with jokes to counter act it but all the jokes I find funny people think are corny or stupid.  I'm a no life that still lives at home.  I'm a piece of shit that treats others like a piece of shit.  I'm tired of it. I'm tired of existing.  No one is ever going to love me because I will never be loveable.  Why do I even bother. I wish I could just stop talking.  I wish I could stop existing.
