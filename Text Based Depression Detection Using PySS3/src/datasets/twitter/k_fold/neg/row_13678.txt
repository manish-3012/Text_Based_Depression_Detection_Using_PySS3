How can I deal with being a complete and utter failureI donâ€™t want to be on some sort of suicide watch I just want to ask a question

My life is complete shit, Iâ€™ve only got 1 friend who has gotten so distant to the point of only sending a text message once every month or two at most 

My parents love me but I can tell that they know Iâ€™m a failure and they try and hide it 

Iâ€™m good at nothing at life and have absolutely no future plans

How do I continue in life with all this thoughts constantly berating me
