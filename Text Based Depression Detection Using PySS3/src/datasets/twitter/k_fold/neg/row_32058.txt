I hate my body and feel so lonely, just wish I could die in a car accidentIâ€™m a gay man in my 20s. Iâ€™m overweight and no one is interested in me. I really want to have a romantic relationship, but  evidently no one finds me attractive. Either on apps or real life, people are apparently repulsed by me. I have been trying to lose weight, but I get more and more discouraged everyday. Everyone at the gym has such perfect bodies and I donâ€™t think I will ever have enough self control to have a body like that. I hate my body and I hate looking at myself in the mirror. Sometimes I feel like cutting open my gross stomach and just pulling out all the fat. 

The rest of my life is mediocre. I have to work two jobs just to scrape by. Everyone else seems to be  building great lives with families, marriages, and all I do is work and cannot even get a date.

I really wish I could just die in a car accident. I fantasize about going to a busy intersection and â€œaccidentallyâ€ walking out into traffic while looking at my phone. This way my family gets all of the sympathy for my death without any of the stigma. Poor guy just got hit by a truck because he stepped into traffic without looking. Tragic. Only reason Iâ€™m sticking around is because I want to increase my life insurance to the maximum amount so my family will be set for life. My only value to anyone is bu being dead.

Iâ€™m a fat blob with no self control who will forever be disgusting to others and will never know the warmth of being in a loving relationship. The intersection is calling. Just a few mode months now.
