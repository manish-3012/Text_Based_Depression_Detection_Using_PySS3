Having suicidal thoughts.Am a 25 year old guy, recently lost my job, now all I do is just lay in my bed all day having suicidal thoughts. Another silly reason I feel suicidal is because I've never had a girlfriend, know it sounds dumb, but its killing me inside. All my friends are going on holidays and are gonna be enjoying, all am doing is laying on my bed depressed and suicidal. Thanks for reading.
