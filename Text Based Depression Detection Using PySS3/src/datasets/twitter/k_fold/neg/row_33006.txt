Why do I keep coming back here?I donâ€™t deserve to live. I watch other people living their lives and I wonder how? Arenâ€™t they sick inside of existing? Donâ€™t they look in a mirror and hate what they see? When they lay awake at night (if they even lay awake at night) how do they not think about every awful thing theyâ€™ve ever done? 

Some people do good things and make the world a better place. Iâ€™m not one of those people. All Iâ€™ve ever done is hurt people and push people away. I should be thankful because I have family that still tries to keep me alive but why? Why canâ€™t they see what a waste of space I am? Are they just scared of feeling guilty or something when I end it?

Iâ€™m not looking for answers for any of these questions. I guess Iâ€™m just wondering what am I doing here instead of taking enough pills to never wake up again or cutting my wrist down to my elbow and letting it all end. Why is it so hard to just end it?
