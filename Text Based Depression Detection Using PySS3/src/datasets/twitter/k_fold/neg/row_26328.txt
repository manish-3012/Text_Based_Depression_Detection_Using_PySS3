Everything just feels so mediocreNo matter what I do I just don't feel satisfied. It doesn't matter what or how much I sleep, eat, work, play, interact with people. I'm always tired. I'm always hungry. I'm never done something the way I wanted it done. My videogames don't feel fun anymore. Attempted to interact with people just leaves me feeling more lonely and more out of place.

Everything good that happens to me just feels meh. And I don't want to be the person that's ungrateful, it's just that I don't feel.

I can't remember the last time I had a genuine smile on my face. It's all been faked, I've only gotten better at faking it. 

I've had people that have brought me down, but I don't resent them because they weren't wrong. Only the people that have tried to cheer me up were.

I feel more attached imaginary characters and fiction than I do my real life and the people around me.
