Felt happy todayI was at work and felt a tight chest pain, I thought I was having a heart attack... It made me so happy I smiled genuinely for the first time in I don't know how long. I was so disappointed when it was only heart burn. I even tried some jumping jacks. Wish I was strong enough to just eat my gun but I'm scared of being a vegetable. I have a failed attempt under my belt and it scares the shit out of me to not succeed. Thank you for you time.
