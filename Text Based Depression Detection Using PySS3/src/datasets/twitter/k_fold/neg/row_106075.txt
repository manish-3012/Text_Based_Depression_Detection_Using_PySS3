I dont know what im doingI really dont know what im doing anymore. A little over a month ago my wife told me she was unhappy and that she wanted a divorce. A couple days later i moved out because it was awkward between us. I found out abfew days after that, that she had been talking to someone else for a while and that they are now dating (unoffically). She can tell me all she wants that she didnt leave me for him but i really so think thats the case.

Our anniversary was on the 13 of march which was the first day i attempted to kill myself. I drove to a secluded parking lot of an amusement park which is shut down until summer. I sat for three hours with a loaded gun in my hand, without the courage to actually pull the trigger. Since then ive tried more than 15 other times. There are several people who know that i want it to happen. Just recently i came forward to my dad, who yelled at me and took my gun away, as it was a present from him, and ive been keeping it in my car as im pretty much homeless at this point.

I have no one to talk to, and even if i did it doesnt make it any better, my ex now knows about me wanting to kill myself yet still refuses to talk to me. As of right now i plan on buying the biggest bottle of sleeping pills they have and consuming it all. Everyone keeps telling me that im young and that things get better but i dont want to go back to "life" as everyone else sees it. I dont want it to get better i just want it to be over. Once i have the courage.. i think ill finally get what i want.

Honestly, i think im only posting here to put it into words. No one else is listening and when people do, i dont want to listen back. I dont want to get better, i dont want to move on. I just want it to be done.
