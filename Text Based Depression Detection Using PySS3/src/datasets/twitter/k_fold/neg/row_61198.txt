Iâ€™ve been looking up videos of funeralsIt triggers me, but I canâ€™t stop looking up these videos. Itâ€™s like emotional self harm. When I think that 
my suicidal thoughts are not as bad, I watch these videos again and those thoughts flare up again. When I see a casket or funeral, I always picture myself in one. I donâ€™t want a casket or funeral. Iâ€™m a piece of crap and Iâ€™m not worth the effort. Iâ€™m garbage. Just throw me in a hole and forget about me.  I love my family, but Iâ€™m so useless. Iâ€™m a financial burden. I want my family to be free and feel good about life. I canâ€™t give them that while Iâ€™m still alive.
