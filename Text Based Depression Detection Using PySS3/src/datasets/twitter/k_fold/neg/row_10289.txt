I'm scared of myself.Nobody tells you that once you've climbed to the top of that mountain, you'll be alone. I met someone and things were finally looking up, I came out of my shell, and then I came to this person last night when I really needed help and I think I scared them away. I've been clean for almost 2 months, and I've been on medication for about a year now. But ever since I was put on medication, these episodes get harder and harder to deal with. It's so hard to get better when every time things look up, even more things go down. I was just so excited to finally have someone to hang out with and I fucked it up. These urges are becoming harder and harder to deal with, and I'm coming closer and closer to putting myself in a psych ward but I'm just so scared. I don't know what to do. I'm so sorry, I have no one to talk about this with and I needed to say something.
