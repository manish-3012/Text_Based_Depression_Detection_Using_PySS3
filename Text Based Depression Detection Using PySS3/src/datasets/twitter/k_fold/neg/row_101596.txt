A new lowI'm not sure if I'm even in the right page but I don't know what else to do. I've struggled with depression for most of my adult life I just never realized that what I was feeling was actually that. I'm sitting here now defeated. I've never fantasized with suicide but in the last two weeks it's become a reality for me. For 12 years I was in a relationship that was completely unhealthy. 6 months ago I ended it when I couldn't take anymore knocks to my self worth. We have a beautiful,  smart,  intelligent,  and kind boy who has kept me motivated and above water. Due to me being the only bread winner in the house for the majority of those years we still live in the same house. Recently, due to her "having" to get a job, I was forced to quit the job I had so that our schedules would work with my son's school schedule. I've turned over to ride sharing and have completely flipped my normal schedule. Money seems to be on my mind all the time and I can't seem to sacrifice enough of my time to make ends meet. The last two weeks have been incredibly stressful and I've retreated into a hole because of this. The fact that I recognize that makes me feel even more useless and idiotic. For a while after the split it was like a new me was born. I was energetic and sociable. I felt like I had the world before me but since things feel like they are stagnating and I'm in this endless cycle of constantly playing catch up its getting tiring. I'm exhausted and just dont want to continue.  This terrifies me. I know without me my son's life and prospects would go down the drain so I feel guilty even giving this voice. My insurance is no longer active and I'm scared to death to take medication after a suicide attempt by my little brother 2 months ago when he started medication. I feel like a coward and lazy and everything I've worked for the past 12 years is flowing down the drain faster than I can fill it. I'm not even really sure why I'm writing this. Self satisfaction or some shit like that. All I know is I feel like a pretender and it makes me sick. I'm tired of crying and stressing. I'm tired of pushing forward and forcing a smile. Everything isn't ok and I'm at a loss what will make it any better at this point. I'm sorry if this rambles on. I'm no where in my right mind.
