if death is not the answer, then what is?if everyone keeps saying that dying isnâ€™t the answer, then what am i supposed to do? if i live, would it be better? every time i tried to kill myself, someone stops me and tells me that things will get better if i continue living. but theyâ€™re not getting better. maybe they do get better for a day or two but then i go back to square one, and sometimes my mental health gets even worse and because of it, my situation worsens as well. why does everyone keep lying to me that things will get better? they havenâ€™t and my hopes are getting crushed again and again. what am i supposed to do now
