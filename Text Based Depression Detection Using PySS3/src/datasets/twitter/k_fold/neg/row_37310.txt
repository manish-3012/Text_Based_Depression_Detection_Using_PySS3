My parentsIâ€™m so close to death at this point, I can almost taste it. Iâ€™m so tired of the pain, of everything. I know itâ€™s not worth it; but I canâ€™t hurt my parents. I love them more than anything. Theyâ€™re not perfect, but both my mom and dad have now spent 19 years raising and loving me so I can become the best version of myself. Iâ€™m so sorry I failed them. Part of me knows theyâ€™d be better off without me, another part knows they would be crushed if I died. So I stay alive for them, even though it hurts all of us to see me in this state. Maybe Iâ€™m not worth it, and maybe life isnâ€™t really worth it, but my mom and dad will always be worth it.
