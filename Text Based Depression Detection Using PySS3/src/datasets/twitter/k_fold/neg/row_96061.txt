My boyfriend is in another country and he is suicidal.What the fuck do I do when he tells me he's taking a walk to the thames river to end it all. I can't call 999 there from Canada. His parents aren't in his life for me to call them. He doesn't have any siblings or friends. What am I meant to do when I'm halfway across the world and the love of my life is wanting to end it all
