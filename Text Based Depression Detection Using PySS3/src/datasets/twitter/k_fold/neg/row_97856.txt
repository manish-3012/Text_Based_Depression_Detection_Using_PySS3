Lost my support, and my best friendI've been suicidal on and off for months, and living with my boyfriend for most of that time. He was patient and loving at the start. Lately he's become angry at me, blaming me for my depression. He has shut down and won't talk to me like he used to. When I ask why he cares about me, he won't answer. I know I will lose him soon, but once I lose him I lose the only person actively stopping me from getting serious about suicide. 
That day will come soon, and I'm terrified. I know I will die alone. I think horrible things about myself and I've tried psychologists and self help, but none of it gets to the root of the problem. I don't know what that root is. 
I believe I might have body dysmorphic disorder. I constantly think I'm ugly, and my boyfriend's lack of affection seems to reinforce those thoughts. I love him, but I feel like he will never love me the way he used to, even if he doesn't leave me soon. 
I don't know if my sorta disorganized description will help out any, but this is kind of my last ditch effort. Please help me. I just want things to be the way they used to.
