I'm in a deep dark hole and I'm not going anywhereI can't believe how disconnected from this world and general society I am. I will not leave this house today or tomorrow no matter what. Fuck everyone else. I have no idea how to explain what I'm going thru or where I'm at. There's absolutely no way out. But there's something new- I feel I'm actually getting closer to suicide bc for the first time in started really considering methods and the pain of those methods. I'm so scared.
