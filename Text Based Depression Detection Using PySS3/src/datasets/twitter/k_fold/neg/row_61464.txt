I'm done.I'm tired of being treated like dirt. I'm tired of making only 8 dollars an hour. I can't afford college. Nothing is enjoyable, even with all of the antidepressants I'm on. There simply is no good reason to continue on, knowing the road ahead won't be any better than it is now, which is terrifying. I haven't quite worked out a plan as to how I'm gonna kill myself, but I'm gonna fucking do it. I cannot go on like this anymore.
