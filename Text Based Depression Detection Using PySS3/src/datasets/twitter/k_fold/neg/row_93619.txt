I wouldnâ€™t mind deathI like writing poems and expressing my feelings, so hopefully this wonâ€™t seem too bad.

If death was to come 
And knock on my door
I wouldnâ€™t mind letting him in.

The lord of the land.
The living all quake 
At death, the destroyer of men.

But I would not hide
And I would not run,
Instead I would let him inside

And lay in my dead
And for the last time
Lay still with death by my side.

Actually writing this made me feel better but itâ€™s not very good. Iâ€™m trying to find things I like but itâ€™s very hard when all I want to do is sleep forever.
