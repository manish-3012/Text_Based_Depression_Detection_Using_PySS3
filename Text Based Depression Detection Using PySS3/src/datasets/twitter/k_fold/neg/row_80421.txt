My life is so fucked right now I can't even kill myself because of all the trouble it would cause, but in a few months I think I willWith a girl for the last 9 years. Happiest time of my life. Literally had everything I could want out of life except kids, and they were a possibility in the future.

She gets amazing job offer out of state, we decide to move for her job even though it means months of me working to get licensed to practice law in new state, it's okay though, my savings and her salary can support both of us while I do that just as I supported her through her residency. We have to sell our house, it's okay though because with our combined income we'll be able to afford a much bigger house together. Things are just going to keep going up and up.

Few months into move to new state I find that's she's been having an online affair. It's been going on for about a year. We talk about it and she agrees to cut contact with him and we go to couple's therapy to repair our relationship. Couple months go by and I find out she didn't stop talking to him after all, she's continuing the affair and lying in therapy about it. 

I confront her and she shuts down. She's done. She wants me to leave. Now I'm back in old state, alone, ability to ever trust anyone again shattered, no house, no job, decimated savings, no love, no prospects of a family in the future, sleeping on air mattress in my friend's guest room. Want to kill myself now but would be too much of a burden on friend to clean out my things.

Plan is to find a job, get some money together for an apartment, go back up and collect all the things that wouldn't fit in my car from ~~our~~ her house, then kill myself. That way all my stuff is in one easy place and no one has to deal with someone who is living with them dying. Already executed a new will leaving everything to my sister. 

That's the plan.
