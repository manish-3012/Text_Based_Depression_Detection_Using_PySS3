Being drunk, I feel less afraid to go through with itI just almost killed an entire bottle of wine.. all I have to say, cheers to all you poor bastards who are struggling in pain like I am, browsing this sub, feeling like letting go, but still trying to find a shred of hope..

Life is fucking stupid, so if I end it now, it won't matter either way
