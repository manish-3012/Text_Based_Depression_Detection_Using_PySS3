Finally pushed the last person awayBest friend said I'm too sad and sensitive and bring her down.  

She was the last person who cares about me,  and now I have no one.  

Gonna take a shit ton of pills after work today,  go to the side of the road and fall asleep listening to pretty sounds.  

I can't change who I am and who I am is SUCH a shitty person holy shit. 
I don't know what else to do to stop this pain of losing people.  It just keeps going as you keep living.  I'm so sick of this shit. 

Used to think life will get better.  It will never be better,  I keep ruining it.
