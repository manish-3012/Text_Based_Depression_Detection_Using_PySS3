Missed my chance. Now what ?I had planned to sneak out of my home , borrow the car, and take a drive for 2 hours to a cliff face not far away. When the time came I could not muster the courage to do this so stayed at home. Now my options have become very limited. I can only hang myself or jump in front of a train. I cannot stay around into October. I must find a way out. I had my chance and blew it. I am so disappointed in myself. Partial suspension seems the 'painless' way out but I have not had any success in achieving unconsciousness from test runs. Short drop looks the only way to go but will be very uncomfortable for an unknown amount of time. I don't want to jump in front of a train as it will mean involving innocent people which I do not want. I am hurting, I am fed up of taking medication from doctors that don't work. I just want out.
