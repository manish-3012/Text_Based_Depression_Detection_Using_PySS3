Apparently I've done nothing right in my lifeI've worked hard, tried to help others, given of myself wholeheartedly, struggled with my demons, struggled against injustice, tried to reach outside my comfort zone, sought help, been medicated...all of it. Yet here I am alone and unloved, not even family by my side, and constantly on the verge of tears I have to hide from the world. People say have hope and love will find you, but it hasn't, nothing has. I am nothing. At his point I don't feel I have the energy to do anymore...to try to meet people, to live healthy, to work hard. I've done all that and it has got me nothing; I feel like I'm cursed and I have no energy to do anymore. What's the point? If I die today it's like nothing I ever did mattered, nothing was ever right. *I* have never been right. Maybe I'm not meant for this world.  I'm so tired i'm done.
