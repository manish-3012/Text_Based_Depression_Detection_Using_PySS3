It's that time againI posted this story yesterday so that maybe I could make someone feel better. But now I realized that I may need someone to do this for me. 

I turned 17 last month I'm still in school and the thought of graduating is very scary. I have no one to talk to and my dog is my best friend but sadly I can not see her every day. I have some friends i have met on the internet through video games. I have never talked to a girl because I'm a shy, quiet person who likes to be alone and stay on reddit all day while everyone else my age are going, getting drunk and having fun. My brother is a complete ass. I am the opposite of him. He is smart im not, he's outgoing im not. My dad has given up on me. Mom thinks i have some chances of surviving in this world but sometimes it seems like she has given up on me just like my dad. The thing that still somehow manages to keep me alive is video games, movies and music. Without all that I would've been buried a long time ago.

3 years ago, 2 weeks before Christmas I was in the same spot almost for the same reasons. I even had picked out the day, the place and how I leave. January 7th, 5km away from home, rope. But then luckily I got sick, didn't go to school, got some rest and thought everything through. But now I don't think anything can help.
