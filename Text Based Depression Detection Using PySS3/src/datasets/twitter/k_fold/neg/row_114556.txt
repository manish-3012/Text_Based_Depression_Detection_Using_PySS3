For me, it's either dying from suicide or dying from a cruel illnessWhat a miserable life. I would love to be able to live carefree and healthy. There are so many reasons to live when you are healthy. But as soon as illness comes into play, even those who would otherwise fight suicide are silent. I am actually a happy person and would like to live a long life on planet Earth, but illnesses rob me of all joie de vivre.
