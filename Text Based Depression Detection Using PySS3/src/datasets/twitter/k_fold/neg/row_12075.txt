Idk if I can actually kill myself.I think about killing myself or getting into horrible accidents or being shot or hurt on a daily basis. Itâ€™s almost all I can think about. I have gotten so close but the only reason I canâ€™t is because of my fiancÃ©e. She is so loving and what I picture when I think about the afterlife. I know if I killed myself she wouldnâ€™t be able to be normal again. How can I kill myself knowing she will never be the same happy and caring person she is. But at the same time, Iâ€™m so tired of struggling and having nothing and never feeling happiness. Me wanting to die is ruining my relationship.
