 Take it. I'm not going to spend all day writing and rewriting this. I honestly don't care anymore. I'm not special. I'm not beautiful. I'm ugly garbage like everything else in my life. The only real friend I ever had is dead, I still blame myself, I could have done more. I'm miserable half the time. I have mood swings. I drive away everyone I get close to... or they leave me... or they die. Life doesn't seem to have a point anymore. I don't want to feel like this anymore... I just started on Prozac 4 days ago... I hope the pills fix me or kill me... I can't live like this anymore.
