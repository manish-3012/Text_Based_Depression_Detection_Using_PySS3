Just over itI went from such a high, had a car, a girl that liked talking to me and being around me, a job that I liked well enough to no car, a job I hate going to and the girl wants nothing to do with me. Doesn't matter how many times I get up, I just get knocked back down. What's the fucking point of trying anymore? I'm just going to fail again.

I don't want to talk to my friends because they're  tired of me being such a Douchebag Downer. They all have lives of their own. They don't need me bringing them down anymore.
