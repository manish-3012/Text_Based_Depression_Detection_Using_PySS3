my relationship with my mom.I'd rather not be in a situation where everything i say is taken as a joke. as some sort of pun. As if im trying to make you laugh by telling you about my issues. as if you somehow deserve my trust after you laugh when i told you that &lt;i&gt; i was molested &lt;/i&gt; by a man you brought into the house and laughed with and drank with and brought around other small children and when you laughed when i told you i was suicidal but then cried when i cut - as if i hadnt told you i wasnt okay. you tell me im making you sad that its my fault youve gotten worse, as if im the one in the bad because im doing this to spite you. to make you feel bad. i tell you i don't feel okay but you only listen when im lying on my deathbed. I tell you i cant feel my hands but you only listen when i can't feel your touch. i tell you i can't see but you only listen when my eyes roll on the floor. You want my help when im dying and i want yours when youre thriving, but only one of us gets what we want. and that someone isnt me.
