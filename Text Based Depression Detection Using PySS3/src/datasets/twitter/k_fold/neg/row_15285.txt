I turn 21 in 9 days. I don't think I can make itThese past 6 months have been a whirlwind. A tumultuous breakup with a partner of 5 years, a major spinal injury, having to stop working entirely and being unable to do my art. 

I feel like a burden. I'm a financial burden to my family, who are already suffering as it is. I take attention and resources away from those who need it more.

I don't want to get older. I've never managed to process that I kept getting older after maybe 15 or 16. I didn't have a childhood. I was constantly sick or caring for someone who was. I nursed my mother through 3 grueling years of Systemic Lyme Disease while struggling through high school.

I'm autistic, I'm transgender, I'm a rape and incest survivor. I'm done fighting. I'm done putting on a brave face. I don't have the energy anymore. Just let me rest.

I want to die and I don't want anyone to remember me. I don't want to be as much of a burden in death as I am now, alive.
