It doenÂ´t feel okay, I lie.I have people who call me(through the goverment) to make sure that IÂ´m still okay. I just lied my ass through but at the same time I tried to be as honest as possible and for the moment it felt honest but when I think about it ten minutes after. Nothing is diffrent. There is like no real change. She asked if I had suicidal thoughts then, I didnÂ´t but now I do and it sucks.
