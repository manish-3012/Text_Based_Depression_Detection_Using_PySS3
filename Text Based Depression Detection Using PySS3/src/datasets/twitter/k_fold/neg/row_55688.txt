i'm not going to pretend this is urgenti think a lot of the posts on /r/suicidewatch are intended to convey an urgency that isn't there, and they are better categorized as cries for help or attention. i think that's fine -- most of the people who function here as suicide prevention counselors probably know this, and only resolve to help someone in pain, regardless of how real, immediate, or serious the suicide threat is. 

that said, i think about it a lot. furthermore i'm never sure if my suicidal ideadiation is more a product of the shitty circumstances in my life (middle aged, no job or career, no partner for 9 years, and mental illness/brain damage/psychological problems). 

i want desperately to be normal, to work a good job, and find a partner i love and who loves me. but i sometimes think my illness issues make those things impossible or prohibitively difficult. i come across as more intelligent and competent than i am over text because i'm a good writer (earning a living wage as a writer is a long shot), but in real life i'm strangled with anxiety and slow thinking. 

i have a suicide plan: get a 12-gauge, short-barrel shotgun with 00 buckshot shells, insert in mouth while clamping down with my teeth on the barrel padded with a washcloth, aim for the soft palate, and pull the trigger. pretty much guaranteed success there; i've done my research. it'd be as easy of driving to the sporting goods store, filling out a form, and swiping a credit card. 

i don't plan to carry out this plan now, but it's always there if things get bad enough, which they well might; i'm set to take prereqs for nursing school in the fall, and if i find i can't do it then i might just sign out, so to speak. i have no children, and as i said no partner. my parents would be devastated but they'd understand.
