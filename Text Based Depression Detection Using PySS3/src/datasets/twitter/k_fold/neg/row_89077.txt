I don't know what to doLately, I [19NB] have been feeling very suicidal and I just want to take my dad's gun and shoot at myself.  My best friend [20NB] has depression.  Right now I'm at their place.  I stayed here to sleep because they invited me over.  But their mom and girlfriend came and, all I know, is that my best friend, let's call them P, just cut their forearms.  Everything was a mess...  Their mom wouldn't stop insulting them, their girlfriend wanted to take them to a clinic (but P refused 'cause they wanted to rest).  The cuts seemed superficial and, as I'm a medical student, their girlfriend seemed to trust me (I'm only in 2nd semester)...

Their girlfriend asked me to ask P to go to the clinic but I knew they would say no, so I didn't push them.  I just waited until their mom left.  It was about 2am... I wanted to clean the cuts with oxygenated water, but there was toilet paper only.  Their girlfriend said they could go to buy some gauze and I also wanted them to do so.  But it was very late and worried so I told them I could do it with anything else, I lied so that they wouldn't risk their own safety, which could make P feel even worse...  That's why I used toilet paper and then I removed some of it with water. I intend to buy some things at 4am to treat my friend properly...

When I was cleaning their forearm, they were asking me to let them cut themselves one more time.  They were saying hurting stuff like: why don't you shoot at yourself but I stay behind you so you kill me in the process? (I've told them about my suicidal thoughts)

Honestly, everything they said kind of hurt a little.  But not only because they were revealing personal information in front of their girlfriend, also because I realized that my suicidal thoughts can become their suicidal thoughts.  The whole thing was awful but well, I don't know if I can deal with it though I don't want to leave them alone... What should I do?
