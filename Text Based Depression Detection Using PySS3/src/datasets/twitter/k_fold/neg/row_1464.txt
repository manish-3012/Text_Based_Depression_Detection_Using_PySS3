Thoughts won't go away.I live in Houston and I am having the same problem. Last year my friends gf called and they put him in a safe house when he came out he had to pay 10,000 on medical fees he was not agreeing to. I feel at the end here. I can't help myself and I want to willingly check myself into a safe house get away from here and get some help. I am depressed and nothing seems go help. I've dreamed of suicide before and the only thing that is honestly stopping me is leaving my family with financial burden funeral cost ect. Even if your looking for help it seems to cost and leaves you more depressed in the end.
