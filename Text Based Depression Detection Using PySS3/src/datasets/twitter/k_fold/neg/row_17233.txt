I'd be lying if I said I don't want to dieSo I recently went to r/advice to get some help on a lost situation.  Long story short, I fell in love, she only liked me.  Now she doesn't like me back and I tried to get her back.  She said no.  I didn't mention this but these last few years have been hard.  I've attempted suicide before, but failed because a homeless man stopped me.  The next day, he was beaten to death.  Well today I spoke to her and she told me she was dating someone else and that she and I would never happen again.  She said she never meant to let what happened between us happen and she regrets ever even kissing me.  My life was hard, school was impossible, family looked down on me, work sucks, everything downhill.  She was the only thing keeping me here.  I keep staring at these meds, and God damnit I want to kill myself.  I know suicide isn't the answer, I've dealt with this before, but fuck I really want to die.
