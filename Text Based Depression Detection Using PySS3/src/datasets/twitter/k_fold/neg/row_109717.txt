nothing left keeping me temporarily happymost people live their lives being happy the majority of the time and then something happens and theyâ€™re sad or depressed for a short amount of time. itâ€™s the opposite with depression: being sad and depressed the majority of the time and then something positive happens and then iâ€™m happy for maybe a few days. 

most of the time i just try to occupy myself by doing things that will make me at least a little positive for a few hours but iâ€™ve ran out of things that keep me temporarily happy.
