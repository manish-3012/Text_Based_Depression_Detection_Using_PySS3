Canâ€™t find a job. Fucked up my life. Zero confidenceIâ€™ve been in and out of school and never able to stick with any program till the end so I eventually decided it wasnt for me and gave up on post secondary.

Iâ€™ve worked mostly customer service jobs and had a really great one it seemed back in August but got too depressed due to a bunch of shit going wrong in my personal life and as much as I tried I didnâ€™t seem to absorb the info I needed to. I also was overly stressed everyday trying to do what they wanted and eventually at my therapists advice I quit to work a seasonal job.

Since leaving the last good job Iâ€™ve had zero self confidence I feel like Iâ€™m good at nothing and have nothing to show for it. I got an interview offer today but didnâ€™t go because I saw they would ask for my highschool grades. Iâ€™m 27 I donâ€™t see how highschool is reflective of me now. I also was a drug addict then and those grades arenâ€™t even in the right name (Iâ€™m a trans guy).

I feel like I fucked up the one chance I had to make decent money. Iâ€™m trying to save for my final surgery in September, but my resumes a mess and I feel like I have no good references anymore and I donâ€™t know what to do.

I honestly feel hopeless and I do t know why I canâ€™t just get/keep a fucking job without my anxiety/depression ruining it. I was put on panic attack medication and ended up dependent on it while trying to make everyone at my last professional position happy. 

I just want to kill myself. I feel worthless and good at nothing. I donâ€™t have the confidence to even interview anymore.
