I think I'm getting close to ending itI have no friends. I have no future. I have no chance at ever becoming anything. I hate my family. I hate everyone around me. My mum constantly degrades me as if I didn't hate myself enough already. I wish she was dead. I wish I was dead. I wish everything was dead. Everyone deserves to die. I hate this fucking planet and I hate this fucking species. We're not special. We're just pathetic parasites that got too smart for our own good but the truth is that an asteroid could easily wipe out any account of us ever existing and I wish it would. I can't wait to leave this shit hole
