Help me decideI find falling to my death risky.... I don't want to risk being disabled for life with my hard head dented....wrist slitting is risky too, drowning...I m not sure where.. a public swimming pool? Could have a live guard watching me from a CCTV. Hanging...I'm not sure how and dont want to risk being paralyzed  for life, the idea of my hanging body in display to my mum isn't comfortable too.. death by helium or nitrogen? Not sure how to get those and a gas mask.. or how to even put a bag in my head without leaking air into it. Death by suffocation? I have thought of this alot...but it's going to be extremely painful.. but I think it would be worth it. I just can't bear living as an guy with Asperger's syndrome. Not retarded enough to see there's nothing wrong with me, not smart enough to know how to fix what's wrong with me. Currently i am not bitter about not having friends IRL since I don't go out. I'm a 20 yr old that still can't decide my future because nothing interests me at all. My online girlfriend dumped me and found someone online much better without Asperger's, knows how to be motivating and fun and not toxic and she really loves him and never loved me and legit just abandoned me despite me being there for her for years. She said it was a pointless relationship, that I cant offer her anything or benefits. I had a good life though, on the internet. From age 10-19, played alot of amazing games and one of these games where I met her when I was 15. I just want to die now.
