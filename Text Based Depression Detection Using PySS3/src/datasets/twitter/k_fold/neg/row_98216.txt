Come morning, I'll just be a memory.I am using your throwaway account because I don't want help. 

I am using this sub Reddit as my means to vent. As the title says I will be a memory in the morning. 

I have struggled with alcoholism for the past six years. I just got out of treatment two weeks ago. Nothing is changed nothings gotten better. I may be sober but I'm completely fucking empty. 

My desire to drink single-handedly ruined the best relationship that I could've ever wanted. She was a great woman but will not take the chance to give me a chance sober. 

I have no family I have a job but I'm too far in debt to make any money. 

Carbon monoxide poisoning will be my way out.
