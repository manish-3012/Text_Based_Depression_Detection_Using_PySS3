im so fucking tired and theres no other wayIm sorry because im so high right now but im still so tired of being treated like im stupid and don't know how to do anything. I do. I fucking know how  to use a screwdriver to screw a screw into a table leg. I've used a screw driver before. im not five years old

why does everyone else get have stupid ass excuses, but im never allowed to have a break? why do I have to pick up the slack for everyone else? im almost 20 years old and I've been taking care of my dad since I was 3 years old. managing his medicine, sleep schedule, making food for him, learning to get blood stains out of clothes and bandage wounds. ITS NOT MY FAULT THAT MY DAD DECIDED TO HAVE ANOTHER KID IN HIS 50s. why does that make everything under the goddamn sun my responsibility? Why do my brother and sister ever help out? they're in their 40s and since THEY'RE SO MUCH MORE MATURE AND BETTER AT BEING AN ADULT than I am, why do they never even bother to call OUR DAD on the phone?

im fucking tired of it. I've made it perfectly clear to everyone in my immediate life (mom, dad, fiancÃ©) that I have been extremely overwhelmed for quite awhile now and I really needed them to understand that its put me in a really fucked up mental and emotional space. nobody cares. not one of them has made an effort to take on any responsibility. all 3 of them have excuses because of their mental or physical health. im sorry because this is really harsh but guess what bitch im struggling mentally too. I want to die so bad but im never allowed to even rest because im too busy doing the things you guys are supposed to be doing.

none of you care. im dying and none of you care.
