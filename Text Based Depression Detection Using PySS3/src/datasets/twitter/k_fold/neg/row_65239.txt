I was close to killing myself last nightI was kinda drunk and my boyfriend called me saying that we needed to talk because our relationship is straining. That talk broke me. We didnâ€™t break up but with everything going wrong in my life, i didnâ€™t want to be there to lose the one thing thatâ€™s been keeping me alive. He hung up and I didnâ€™t want to be here anymore. Luckily I passed out before I could even do anything. I was going to spend a week with him but he doesnâ€™t want me over if Iâ€™m like this. I told him Iâ€™m okay but he just responded with â€œthatâ€™s bullshit.â€ 
How the fuck am I supposed to want to live at this point?
