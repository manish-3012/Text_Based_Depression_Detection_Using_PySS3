What do I do nowI finally tried to do it. I've thought about killing myself so much, planned it out before even, but this was the closest I've ever gotten. I was going to hang myself, and I had everything prepared the way I wanted it. I stood on the chair for so long and I came so close to letting it fall but I caught myself, ripped the rope away from my head, and immediately started crying. 

Am I just weak? I have no idea what to do with myself. I'm terrified of telling anyone what happened and the repercussions. I'm just as scared and alone as I was before but now I have to live with the fact that I'm not strong enough to do it.
