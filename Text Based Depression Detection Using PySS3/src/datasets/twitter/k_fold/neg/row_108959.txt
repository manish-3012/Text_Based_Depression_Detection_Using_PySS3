Can you give me 1 unconditional truth?I'm going completely mad here, at some point (years ago), i started doubting the world, its purpose and other aspects of reality. I've read all sorts of thinkers such as Plato, Mill, Sartre, Beckett, even the bible, and their perspectives are interesting and i can definitely see how someone could be satisfied by any of these. But to me, they are all perspectives, which are completely equal to each other and i don't have a single clue how i could begin to adopt any perspective. Without any perspective, it is very difficult to deal with life, i think. Should i devote my life to combatting as much pain as i can in the world? Or should i make myself happy? Should i try to be a benefit to our race? our society? or science? 
I don't have a fucking clue!!


besides this philosophical stuff, these questions increasingly translate to my concrete experiences. If there is 1+ human that is able to see/ hear me, I will be undoubtedly be thinking about what it is that he thinks i am thinking, what it is that i want him to think that i am thinking, what he thinks about how i walk, what i want him to think about how i walk. I shall not bore anyone by going on, but it are these ever continuing loops that i have been, and am, stuck in. But since i'm in uni i don't have the luxury of just considering the perspective of 1 other human, most of the time. 

And i hate myself for it, all these irrelevant thoughts that just make me miserable, but i can't stop it! I get that its all meant well when my psychologist tells me to try to think less, not go to bed late, and whatever other bullshit he says. But i can't stop these fucking thoughts for the shortest of time, and I lay in bed terrorized by the agony until i pass out. 

I don't have any friends left, i shiver when people look me in the eye, i can't put my feet straight on the ground when there are people on the sidewalk, in class my palms too sweaty to write anything (because it leaves wet stains on the table) etcetcetc. Its a fucking nightmare, and every ray of light seems to be meant to give me some fake hope, so i can fall even deeper after it.



Death seems a sweet nothingness, a place without space and time, a place without worries and questions. Every day its appeal grows, I however feel that i already am a horrible son and brother, and taking my parents son and my little brothers brother away from them, might be the most selfish thing i ever considered. Which indeed is perfect fuel to continue the circle of hate and self pity, which i do recognize but can't stop.. Which....
