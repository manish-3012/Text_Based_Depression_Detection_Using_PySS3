Where the fuck is this "help"Has suicide hotlines ever helped you guys?
I really wonder this because I've been calling the same shit now for three days in a row, and I have heard the exact same thing all the time "oh yea, that's sad, no no, don't do that" and then the call ends... 

and its worse when you hear someone say "go talk to your mom, go outside, get a routine" it's not that fucking easy, like I didn't choose to have depression and to be suicidal, why is suicide the answer? people ask, because at the end of the day no one gives a fuck if you are dead the same to the person behind the phone call, you don't know me so why would you care if I committed suicide?
