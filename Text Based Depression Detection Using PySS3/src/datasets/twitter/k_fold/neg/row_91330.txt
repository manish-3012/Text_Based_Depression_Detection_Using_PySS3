I accidentally wrote a suicidal monologueIâ€™ve been having a real bitch of a panic attack tonight and kind of went into a trance and wrote this. Iâ€™m too afraid to tell these thoughts to my best friend but I need someone to see them. 

I would have to do it with a gun because Iâ€™m too afraid to poison myself and when I practice and see how many ibuprofen pills I can swallow it gives me too much time to reconsider and be indecisive. A gun is quick, Iâ€™m good at making fast, irrational, emotionally driven decisions and I know I could kill myself with a bullet. slitting your wrists has a low success rate and considering Iâ€™ve never succeeded in anything my whole life I donâ€™t feel confident Iâ€™d succeed at that. I could take other pills, maybe some that you donâ€™t have to swallow as many and have a higher success rate, Iâ€™ve looked into barbiturates, I think thatâ€™s what Marylin Monroe used. Although they are illegal and ordering them online sounds scary and difficult. I could never hang myself, I wonâ€™t let someone find me like that - the thought is so scary it gives me chills. Iâ€™m hoping with the gun my face will still be in tact, just not the back of my head. I feel so eager to throw away my life like itâ€™s trash but Iâ€™m a romantic and still want my body to be found beautiful like a fallen angel or Snow White. Then I think about being â€œfoundâ€ or â€œrememberedâ€ and if I kill myself I wonâ€™t be able to see that. Iâ€™ll be gone. I donâ€™t get to leave and come back. I only have one life. People may think back on me fondly but more than anything I will mark myself as a painful memory in everyoneâ€™s mind. I donâ€™t want to be a painful memory or a lost loved one. I want to love. I want to make people feel loved. I want to do good things and help people but fuck, this sadness is so hard I feel weak and I donâ€™t feel like I can do it but I am doing it so I guess I could continue like this but I donâ€™t know how long I can handle this if it doesnâ€™t get better and I donâ€™t know how to make it get better
