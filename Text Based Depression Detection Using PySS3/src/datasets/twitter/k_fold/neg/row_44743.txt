Been thinking about checking out!But Iâ€™m feeling very defiant, fuck you life u will not win! I will continue to struggle and fight and scream and cry for my happiness feeling the pain this is life. how would we know happiness if we donâ€™t know pain I will not give up wether I get cancer, aids, or some god awful disease I will fight to my last breath because life is awful at times but also can be great and thereâ€™s always the chance things could turn around maybe not Tommorrow but hope! Hope keeps me going! Just a thought!
