Would someone be willing to chat with me?Iâ€™m having a really shitty week and Iâ€™m feeling the spirit of suicide creeping up on me again. The only thing keeping me from spazzing is the fact that I havenâ€™t finished watching my favorite Netflix show yet, but Iâ€™m almost finished with the last season. Talking to my family just further frustrates me, and I have no friends. I just need an ear...Iâ€™m in a really dark place.
