Just wanna hide...til I get the nerve...Why won't people just let me shut down, close the world out, be alone? Is that too much to ask? I don't want people asking me if I am okay or if I want to talk or need anything. I just want to be left alone. And, if it leading to me killing myself, which it most likely will, then so be it! It is what is best!!! Why can't people just respect that and let me be? Is that too much to ask?
