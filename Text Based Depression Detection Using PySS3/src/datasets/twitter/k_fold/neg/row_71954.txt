I know Iâ€™m going to kill myself soon but I donâ€™t want my dog to be depressed when Iâ€™m gone.Iâ€™ve already come to terms with the fact that Iâ€™m going to die by overdosing on fentanyl. Itâ€™s my drug of choice anyways so Iâ€™m at peace with the decision. Iâ€™m losing my battle. My son passed away last year when he was just 44 days old and he was my only purpose in life. I canâ€™t go on much longer, I miss my baby boy so much. My heart canâ€™t handle all this pain. My boyfriend has been telling me that I need to move on. He gets upset at me when I cry. He gets upset at me when I get angry at him for telling me to move on. Thatâ€™s the worst thing you can say to a bereaved mother. Apparently my pain is a burden for him. He has told me this. He doesnâ€™t know that Iâ€™ve been cutting my arms, thighs, and face. He thinks itâ€™s cat scratches. He doesnâ€™t know that Iâ€™ve been punching and hitting my face and my whole body. That Iâ€™ve been choking myself and ripping my hair out. I have no family either. All I have is my sweet pitbull Fiona, and the thought of me not being there with her when Iâ€™m dead makes me cry my eyes out. I tell myself that I should at least wait until after she passes away, that way I can spread her ashes on my baby boyâ€™s grave. But itâ€™s getting harder and harder to get out of bed or leave the house. But I only do this so my boyfriend doesnâ€™t get mad at me. I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m getting with this. Maybe some comfort from others on here. But I feel like nobody can even begin to fathom my pain and suffering.
