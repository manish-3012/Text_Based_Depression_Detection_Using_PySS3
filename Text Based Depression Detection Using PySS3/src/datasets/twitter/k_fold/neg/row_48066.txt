I'll probably kill myself if I don't become richFuck. I'm 17, have been living with depression since I was 8, social anxiety for a few years, and I have absolutely no idea what the fuck I'm doing. Me, my mom, and my brother are living on ss and child support. I can't even imagine myself as an adult. I can't see myself doing anything. I've always wanted to die, even at such a young age. My girlfriend broke up with me a couple of months ago and I feel I have absolutely no hope. I don't see the point if living of I'm just going to be poor my whole life
