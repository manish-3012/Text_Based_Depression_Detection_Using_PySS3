Just want to warn some of you: Please be very careful about some of these people who offer support. I realize that many of you are at a vulnerable point. I had one person who wasn't even diagnosed with anything and talking about how he could help and had self-diagnosed himself with depression, etc. I blocked him and then he would keep trying to message me on 3 other screen names on AIM. 

If you do reach out to others, please be very careful about who you reach out to.
