I'll be killing myself if my life stays the sameAugust 6th , 2020


For my entire life I've been using videogames , social media , and watching TV to escape my boring ass life , but now I just lost interest in all of these stuff . Now I can't enjoy anything anymore , nothing makes me happy.


And I haven't seen the sun in like 3 months or something . even if I want to see it , I just can't.


Here I am sitting on the bed , on my phone , depressed all day . Every day is just the same shit over and over again. 


I can't leave the house because my strict ass parents don't allow me to , all I want to do is go see the nature or meet people.


If my life doesn't change in a month I'll be killing myself.
And another problem is I can't do jackshit about anything happening to me bcuz I'm just a 13 year-old boy
