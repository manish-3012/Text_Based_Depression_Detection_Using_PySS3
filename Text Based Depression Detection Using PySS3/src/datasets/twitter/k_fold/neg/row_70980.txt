I don't remember what being ok feels likeIt's weird because I know I was happy at one point. But every time I wonder "Was I ok a year ago? Was I happy?" I don't have an answer. I wonder if I was actually just less-miserable, and the entirety of growing up is just slowly realizing how shitty of a person I am and how truly pointless life is.

Because I know when I was a child I was happy. I think when I was a young teenager I was angsty, but overall ok. I don't know if I was in a bad place or just overly stressed late high school. Now I'm 20 and definitely not ok. So what if I'm actually just coming to terms with what life is and I'm not getting worse, I'm just running out of distractions? And I don't know if I want to die or not but it's inevitable anyway so what's the problem if it happens now and we get whatever bullshit life is over with?
