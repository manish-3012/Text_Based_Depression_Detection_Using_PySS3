Things turned around!So for a while now I've been fighting major depression, anxiety, low self esteem and just overall wanted and tried to kill myself on several occasions. I've posted here on before on occasion and people, complete strangers mind you helped me out in various ways.

About a month ago I switched councilors and holy cap did it change everything. Within the first session I was noticing a change. No medicine, no bible searching, but simple and easy stuff to for me at least worked as a stepping stone that I could repeat over and over as needed and it fucking worked like a damp miracle.

This magical tool? Saying yes. That's it. With my depression and anxiety I was shutting down , saying no and letting fear and everything else lead my life. And it was really easy. I wake up in the morning and I read a question on my mirror. "Are you supersizedme?" "YUP". Then instead of trying to decide what to order at my local bakery, each morning I tell them to surprise me. Try something new, keeps , me moving forward and I just go on from there. 

It sounds weird as hell but it took me from a super depressed and anxiety ridden lifestyle to getting out, seeing my friends again and trying new things. I just went on a trip for a week by myself and had an absolute amazing time. Met new people, had great food and never once had a panic attack or have felt depressed in about a month now.

Clearly everyone is different, but for me it was just getting out of a no state and into a yes state of mind that changed everything for me. Start your day tomorrow with a simple yes question, and then let things come to you and keep taking those steps forward. Just want to give give a huge thanks to all who have talked to me on here. Tons of great people
