I am close to ending it all, How should it be done?I have become a useless person and everyone seems to think so too. No one is here for me anymore, I still have "friends" but they all seem like strangers to me now. I have been friends with all of them for around 4 years now, we have spent everyday of highschool together and as a group. A bunch of kids just wanting to have fun.

I think ive given up on people because of what ive been subjected to. Im not going to say ive been through the worse there is but what's the point in comparing hardships? Im living a rough fucking life and I don't want to keep going. No one takes my pain seriously because im "too put together" and that "ill get over it" I refuse to put up with it any longer.

How should I kill myself? Ive thought about hanging but I don't have an actual place to do it. Ive thought about throwing myself off the balconey of the apartment I live in but what if I survive? They'll just keep me alive. I can't get my hands on a gun either.
