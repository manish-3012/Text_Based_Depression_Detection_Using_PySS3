The inescapable is quite appealingIt hurts. Oh god, it hurts. But like, only inside. I wish it hurt outside. I wish someone pushed me down a flight of stairs so I would have the right to feel like this.

This isn't living.

I can't die, not yet, I have it all planned out, I can't die yet. 

But I can't keep living either. 

Please make it stop.
