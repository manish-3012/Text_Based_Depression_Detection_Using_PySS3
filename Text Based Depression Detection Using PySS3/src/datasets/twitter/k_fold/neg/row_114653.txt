Update from my post a week ago, dog bit puppy and I blamed myself for it's death.Thank you people so much for the support. I was off of my meds for a week  because they ran out and my mother was overseas for work, which is so why I was looking after the puppies.

They were born in the very early morning and I checked on them every 1,5 hours the whole day, at about 2 or something in the next morning I left the mom dog with the babies while I went to wash my hands. When I came back she had bitten the really badly. She was holding it by what was left of it's head and I completely freaked out and instantly blamed myself. I know I did my best, we already decided this dog isn't getting anymore puppies, she was also aggressive towards the last litter.

The sad thing is, she bit the other one as well, the other puppy was defecating blood throughout the day and died in my hands while I was crying and begging for it to have a better life than this one.

For those concerned, I had to look after the puppies because my mom breeds with yorkies and when the mom was close to being due, she had to go on an important work trip across the world. In this time I ran out of medication and couldn't get until she came back and I was entrusted to look after the puppies. I'm on my medication again for those wondering. Thank you for the support

Also sorry if anything is weird, English isn't my main language
