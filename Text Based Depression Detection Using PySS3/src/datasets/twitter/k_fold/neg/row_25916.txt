If only suicide wasnâ€™t harmful to others..You know the thing that sucks about suicide is the consequences. Not on myself but on everyone else. Like if it genuinely was 100% inconsequential to others that decision would be pretty easy if Iâ€™m being honest. It would just be lights out for me and thatâ€™s it. No one in my life would be hurt nor would their lives be disrupted at all. And if it was like that I would do it in a heart beat. But itâ€™s not like that. And thatâ€™s what sucks. Even though I have my little sisters and brother and my mother, the reasons Iâ€™m still here, I still have the urge to just end it all. And I just wish everyone could forget about me so I can die peacefully. Die without ruining others lifes and scaring them for their whole life.
