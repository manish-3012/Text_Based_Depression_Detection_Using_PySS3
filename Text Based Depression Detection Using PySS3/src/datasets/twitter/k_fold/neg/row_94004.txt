Suicide has always felt like an inevitability for meI tried to be social and have friends and recover from being raped and abused but I'm completely alone and no one wants me around . It's gotten worse since I started medically transitioning I'm not attractive so loads of people have just dropped me out of their lives and it feels pointless now to try and transition and have them waste that surgery on someone who's just going to kill themselves idk I'm never going to be able to afford the surgeries I need so I'll always be incomplete and miserable and trapped and i can't go back to pretending to be a woman even though it would likely stop me from being alone -i feel like people cared about me a lot more when I could pass as a cis woman- even though it felt horrible and fake but now I just feel like a hideous freak who no one wants to be around because I'm not a sexual target and now I just feel like maybe no one ever wanted to be my friend or loved me they just felt sorry for me or were using me. It will be better for everyone if I just die they will be happy and I won't have to feel like this anymore
