I made a horrible mistakeI think I may have HIV and might have passed it on to the girl I love. We dated for a year and a half. I have symptoms like prostatitis, swollen lymph nodes, and sore muscles around my pelvis. I was selfish and broke up with her in January and was slutty for a month after, but then we rekindled in March. I havenâ€™t been with anyone but her since, but in that time we had unprotected sex. She knows I hooked up with other people but I should have proactively insisted on using a condom and didnâ€™t. Iâ€™m getting tested Monday, if it comes back positive, I canâ€™t live with myself. She was so good to me and I really loved her but I ran away because I was afraid of the commitment and wanted to experience the single again. I am the asshole who may have killed her with a slow virus, I just canâ€™t believe how badly I fucked my life up.
