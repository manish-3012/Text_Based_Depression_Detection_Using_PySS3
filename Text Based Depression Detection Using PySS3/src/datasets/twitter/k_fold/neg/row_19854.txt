My peers make me feel like shitI was in PE playing volleyball and I jumped up to hit the ball back over the net and my shirt lifted up a bit. A guy on the other team was like "damn she's fat, no offense"
I'm 5'1 and 180 pounds so he's not exactly wrong but I hate being reminded of my weight. I want to rip off my own skin, I hate myself so much. I'm already on the brink or relapsing with self harm and this is gonna be what sends me over the edge. Words hurt more than you think.
