hiI made a host here a little over a year ago. I've managed to survive somehow. I guess because of my dog. There is no one I trust to care about her as much as I do, though people keep telling me I'm not good enough at that.

To be honest, I'm not even sure why I'm making this post, maybe it's all just a cesspool of toxicity in my mind and there's just no one left that I feel like I can open up to anymore so I just pretend everything is okay. My friends would only get angry with me. Tell me that the only reason I feel like this is because I'm not getting any attention from them and that they want to distance themselves because of that. From my perspective it's the other way around, they disappear when things are really bad, and come back when things improve. Almost every day is a bad day for me and that's my normality so as far as my friends are concerned, those are my good days now and everything is okay. But then I have a really bad moment where it becomes impossible to hide. I feel like I only really exist to most people when they need something from me, and beyond that don't really care.

I'm pretty alone in life now and it's the hardest thing, but people think I've coped with the change I've been forced through and I'm doing fine, but I don't feel like I am coping. I get burdened with more all the time because people think I can cope but it's all too much for me to handle. I end up having meltdowns and panic attacks regularly, but no one ever knows or sees this. I can't fix being on my own, I don't know how to without relying on others to just feel okay. Someone suggested to spend more time with my friends, which is nice, but it ultimately ends and I'm back to being at home alone and this always leads to some kind of breakdown.

I'm a huge Pokemon fan so the last couple of days have been so euphoric, but that's subsided now and I feel empty. I wish I had someone to share my excitement. I wish I could feel like that all the time. After my grandma died so much of the things in my life stopped bringing me joy. PokÃ©mon has been the only real exception besides spending time with the people I care about.

I'm not really sure what the point of this post was. At what point is it okay to just quit and end it so I can finally just feel peace? I've been dealing with too much for too long and it just doesn't feel worth it anymore. No one really cares anyway. All this because I don't have the heart to leave a dog.

TL;DR: Don't waste your time reading this or replying to it ill probably never log back in anyway.
