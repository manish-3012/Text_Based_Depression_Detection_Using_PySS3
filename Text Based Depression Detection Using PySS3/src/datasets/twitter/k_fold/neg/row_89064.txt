Assisted suicide vs. suicide vs. outward harmNeed to get off my chest.

Context: too much fucking shit going on.

Reaction: I would really love to just leave this fucking world. I don't want to hurt those that piss me off. I don't want the people that try to help me to suffer from my own invulnerability towards solving these issues. I don't want my immediate family and friends to bear the burden of an intentional suicide. 

I would really love to just leave this fucking world peacefully.
