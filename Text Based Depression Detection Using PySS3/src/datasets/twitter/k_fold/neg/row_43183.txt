Rumination is going to be the death of meI can't do anything right and all I do is look at the world today and how it's change from the a past that I was too scared to do anything in. Now it's gone and there will be no second chance or going back to that thing. I feel completely disconnected from this world and have nothing to live for. Anytime I try something new it just blows up in my face and lowers my self worth even more. The human race is too  concerned with destroying the planet, having corruption in government, and giving us total digital surveillance... Why would anybody want to exist in this? I wish somebody would just run me over or murder me so I find have to be here anymore.
