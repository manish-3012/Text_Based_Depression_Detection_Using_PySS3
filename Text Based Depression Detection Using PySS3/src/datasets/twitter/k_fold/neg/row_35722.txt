Always thinking of dying. I am so sad and empty on the inside and no one sees it.I think of dying constantly. It doesnâ€™t matter where I am itâ€™s always in the back of my brain. Iâ€™m on SSRIS and they only worked for a bit and made me numb. My family sees me as someone who has a good future and my friends see that in me too. But deep down on the inside I am hurting and empty. Every guy in my life has either cheated on me, abandoned me, or used me. I feel like I am nothing. I am always almost on the verge of tears constantly. I feel like everyone hates me even strangers. Iâ€™m always so paranoid and I feel like people are always staring at me and hating me. Death is always in the back of my mind Iâ€™m always thinking of how I would do it. But then I get scared because I love my mom and my friends and I wouldnâ€™t want them to hurt.
