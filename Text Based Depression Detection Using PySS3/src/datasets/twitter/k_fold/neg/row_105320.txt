Why not?Crippled, Alone, awkward, introverted, gay, obese, ugly and an useless asshole. Those are all the things I think about when I see myself. After being in an accident 14 years ago my life has been changed forever. I try to look happy on the outside and everyone things I cope with it well. I donâ€™t. I canâ€™t go out with friends that are like minded individuals or stay overnight because I need medical attention round the clock. So I mostly stay home with my barely Funtional family. I get what feels like blackmailed by them because no one works and my social security is the only income. I feel lost everyday and when home feels like a war zone all the time my only safe space is my room which can be easily taken advantage of because I need the help. All the stress depression and anxiety get bottled up and food is my only coping strategy. This has caused me to become obese and I hate how I look but I lack the motivation to change anything. I feel like the loop will cycle indefinitely and every night it hits me and makes me wonder why I want to live even though Iâ€™m scared to die. I just want to disappear.
