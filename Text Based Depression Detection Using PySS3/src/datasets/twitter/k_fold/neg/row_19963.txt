Ideation getting worse and worseDoes anyone else suffer constant suicidal ideation. And I mean constant: like I voice constantly telling you, "Kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself, you should kill yourself..." on loop, all the time. At night I have terrible nightmares and yesterday I woke up basically catatonic. I am worried about going to a psyche ward because I am trying to move to a new country to be with my partner and worry it will screw up my visa process. I go to therapy but I think I need something stronger. Lately I think about ECT or even a lobotomy. I don't know what to do.
