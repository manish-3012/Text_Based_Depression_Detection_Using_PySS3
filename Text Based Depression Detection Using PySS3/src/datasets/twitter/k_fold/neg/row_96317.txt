seeing people in relationships reminds me of how worthless I am as a personI really wish I was fucking dead. There's no point in me being alive when I'll just end up being alone forever. There's a park nearby where I can drive my car at a high speed into a big tree and finally end my life. I don't want to live anymore. There will always be someone in the world who can replace me. I'd rather kill myself than have to go through constant rejections. I don't give a shit about living past 30. I'd rather not have to live an entire life of being miserable. There is absolutely nothing in life that makes me want to keep on living.
