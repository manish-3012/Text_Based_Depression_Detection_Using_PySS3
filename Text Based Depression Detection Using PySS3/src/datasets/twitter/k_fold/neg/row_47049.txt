Calling an ambulance for myself?I have an exact plan... But since some days i'm not sure about one question... and this question is very important. So i'm sure that i'll cut my wrists but should i call an ambulance for myself or not? If i won't call emergency than probably noone else will. 

Actually my mood is swinging between "yea i'm gonna end my life and if somehow i'll get saved than who the fuck cares? i'll do it again and again until finally i'll be dead" and "i want to do so much things but i have to make a little "cry for help" because if i won't than my life just getting worse and worse, i'll call the ambulance before i'll cut".

Right now i think i'll call it, but actually it sounds pretty lame and unserious... I mean "yea you're just an attention seeker, you didn't want to really kill yourself, you just wanted the drama". But idk being dead frightens me after all... i'm still scared of it. But then there's the shit and the worries after i'll get saved. I mean who knows how my family will react? How my friends will react? How the doctors will react? What if everyone turns against me after that? 

I know i should ask help but it's not that easy... I mean it's impossible. I'm just scared and tired to talk about it and people will probably think i'm just an idiot teenager who's too lazy for school and that's why i start making excuses. But it's not true!! But if i get to the hospital people will believe that i'm sick. Or not? I mean if i'm dead people will definitely believe that i was sick and i was not just an attention seeker but i don't want to be dead but maybe i have to!?

i'm 18, i've got ~53 hours until i do it.
