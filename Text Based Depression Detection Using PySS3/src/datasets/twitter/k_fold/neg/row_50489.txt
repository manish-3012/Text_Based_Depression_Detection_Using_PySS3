i can't kill myselfbut I'm trying.

I just went into a shed and tried to hang myself with a belt wedged in the door. I couldn't bring myself to do it though. I'm going to bed now, so I'll probably be ok, at least tonight.

I just get so angry when I think about how I have no right to say I want to kill myself or any of that shit. I wonder if I'm even that sad in the grand scale of things. I was just sitting there in a shed sobbing by a belt and listening to music that made me feel worthless.

I just can't bring myself to do it. And I hate this. Whatever is keeping me alive right now, I want to destroy it. I hope every single day gets impossibly worse so I muster up the balls to actually kill myself. I want to soo bad. I've been on the brink of passing out with partial suspension before and I always stand up. I ALWAYS FUCKING REGRET STANDING UP. The next day is always fucking worse.

I don't even deserve to say I want to kill myself, because, if I did want to, I would have already done it. I fucking hate this shit so bad. I wonder if I even know what true pain is like. Maybe I'm just making all this up?

But even if I am I won't stop until I'm dead. i wish i had the balls to end it. too bad my family is anti-gun.
