I'm tired of being "okay".Four years ago, I was diagnosed with depression and have been going through therapy and taking medication. During that time, I also self-harmed, attempted suicide, developed psychosis, OCD and eating disorder. 

Now, I'm in a much better place - I eat normally, live normally, haven't hurt myself in about two years, etc. Sometimes I fall into an existential crisis but that's about it. I'm really proud of how much I've made it through. 

However, lately, I've been feeling suicidal again. I wouldn't say that I'm depressed but I'm absolutely tired - of everything. I stopped listening to music, reading books, talking to friends on a daily basis. I also start to procrastinate a whole lot and I feel 'nothing' most of the time. Lately, my parents have been experiencing financial hardship and they've been verbally abusive. My friends also compare me with themselves whenever they get a higher grades or getting a new clutch or whatever. I think about killing myself a lot and I couldn't care less about what others would think. 

Everyone thinks I'm ok but I'm not. I'm so tired of being "okay". I'm far different from being ok. I don't see the point anymore - after all, everyone will die someday, and since I'm doing nothing good for the world, I might as well end it here, right? That way I'm not a burden to my family. Not the depressed friend of the group. Not the annoying girl they all know. 

I'm so done with everything.
