About to start writing lettersI never imagined I'd get to this point in my life. 

My friend is over at my apartment but is leaving tonight. He's stayed for the past 2 days. I didn't tell him that the reason I needed him over was because I've been contemplating suicide. Just told him I was lonely and kinda depressed. 

But after he leaves I'm going to start writing out letters to people. Not sending them out or anything. Just writing them. Maybe it'll snap me back to reality, actually writing out my goodbyes. But I'm scared that I'll still feel numb and realize even more that I still don't care after writing them 

I've spend so much money on therapists and hospital visits and medication and I'm so sick of it. I don't even feel hysterically sad at this point just numb and feeling good at the thought of relief.
