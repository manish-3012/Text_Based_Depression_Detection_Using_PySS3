Always avoided posting here but the voice in my head is too muchCuz i feel like my problems pale in comparison to the many posts i see here every hour. But shits getting hard. Thereâ€™s a constant voice in my head telling me to kill myself for the past 3 years i think. Any moment that Iâ€™m not intensely engaged in something like conversation, work, or video games it just constantly reminds me to kill myself. 

Rn Iâ€™m waiting in between semesters of college. Just got let go from work. Not chilling with friends cuz i quit drinking and smoking and thatâ€™s what my friendships were built on. Basically thereâ€™s not much going on for me. So the voice is just constant i canâ€™t escape it. Itâ€™s getting really hard. Back in HS i could meet new people, date girls, make friends, but that just doesnâ€™t happen now. Idk why. 

Basically i just constantly reminisce on awkward / terrible things Iâ€™ve done and the voice tells me to kill my self. Sometimes itâ€™s so strong that i feel inclined or forced to say it out loud â€œKill yourself kill yourselfâ€ - i even do it with people around (in-voluntarily) and try to play it off like i was saying something else or humming something under my breath. 

Iâ€™ve been through lots of therapy and intensive in-patient psych ward after a previous attempt much earlier in my life. I feel like none of that could help rn. I just think i need people in my life rn. Of course online friends are nice, but you guys know itâ€™s not really the same. Idk what to do. 

Besides that nothing is really wrong. I have a great family... almost all of my problems in life are from the dumb things Iâ€™ve done. I feel like Iâ€™ll never escape the guilt and anxiety so i may as well just kill my self now instead of 10 years from now. Only reason Iâ€™m writing here is cuz idk who else to talk to... my brother is cool but doesnâ€™t know how to handle this stuff really. Fuck
