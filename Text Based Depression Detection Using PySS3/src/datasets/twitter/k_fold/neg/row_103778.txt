My family thinks I don't deserve to be depressedMy parents just told me that I don't deserve to be depressed because of my circumstances. I want to fucking die, but apparently I'm to fortunate to be depressed, I'm just an ungrateful piece of shit. I hate this fucking life, and I don't get why I have to feel guilty about not wanting to be alive. Fuck why does anybody have to endure this.
