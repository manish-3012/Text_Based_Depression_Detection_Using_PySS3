We are in this togetherHello friends,

I have been reading a lot of posts recently about how there is a lack of community and comradere amongst the people here. I thought that (if the mods allow) we could make this a sticky for people who want to be penpals and support one another. That way, people who are looking for someone to talk to can come visit this thread.

I don't think anyone should have to deal with suicide alone or feel like there's no one to talk with. 

So, if you can make yourself available to help or just talk about these things or maybe make a friend on here leave a comment. 

Thanks for listening
