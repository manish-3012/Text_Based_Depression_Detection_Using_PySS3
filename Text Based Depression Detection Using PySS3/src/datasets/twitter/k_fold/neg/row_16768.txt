How I wish I could go through with a suicideI am hoping in the future that I will be able to kill myself but I'm just so afraid of what happens when you die. Growing up with freckles and still having freckles is one of the worst things ever, they make me so ugly and I can't get rid of them unless I get laser surgery but I don't have the money for that so I think the better alternative is to get rid of me.
