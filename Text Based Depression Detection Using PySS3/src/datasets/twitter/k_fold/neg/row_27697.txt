Because of the painI have a severe condition thatâ€™s caused my face to burn and swell. My lips feel swollen all of the time. Theyâ€™re starting to harden. My eyes burn. 

Iâ€™ve spent three years going to specialists trying to control the symptoms, since a severe medication reaction caused it. It was misdiagnosed by dermatologists. 

I canâ€™t go outside in the sun. I canâ€™t lay down flat. I canâ€™t exercise. 

I look like a completely different person. 

I loved life but every moment was agony. 

Iâ€™ve lost my family after my wifeâ€™s affair and now Iâ€™ve lost my face. Literally. 

I donâ€™t know how much longer I can be expected to hang on
