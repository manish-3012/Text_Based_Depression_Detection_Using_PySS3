Feeling suicidal yet againI don't want to live anymore but I don't want to die and leave behind the people who still love me, I don't want to hurt them like that. But I've just got so much pain inside I don't know what to do, I feel like I'd be better off not being around anymore but I know this will hurt the people who still love me. I feel trapped and in a world that will never accept me and I don't want to be in this shit world anymore, it's so horrible. I don't want to live anymore but I can't do anything about it! It's a good job I don't have a gun because I would seriously consider shooting myself in the head.
