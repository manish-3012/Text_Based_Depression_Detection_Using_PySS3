i hate thisI hate my life and I have this world. And everyone hates me too.

Everyday when I wake up I feel stressed. I always am FUCKING STRESSED. I feel like i don't have any other feelings than being stressed, feeling guilty beacause I can't even do stupid homework and feeling worried about my future. I'm very young and I should NOT feel that way. I feel like my friends don't care about me (neither my parents, they only care about my grades) and my girlfriend doesn't know how to help me. I want to die. I'm just a waste of air. I can't do anything, even fucking kill myself beacause I'm too scared of physical pain.

I want to end it all.
