I don't want to grow upI feel like I never got to experience childhood due to my abusive mother and sexual abuse during my teenage years. Now I'm almost 21 (female)  and I don't want to grow up. The world is a scary place. I have a trade school license, but I've lost all passion for the field I'm in after working in it and seeing the ugly side of the industry. I have very child like urges and wants, like coloring and having lots of stuffed animals. I hate the expectation to know what you want to do for the rest of your life and stick to that field until you retire. I hate that with age, sex is expected in relationships as a sign of being an adult.
This entire thing has made me really suicidal. I can't ever go back in time and have the childhood I wish I had and I can't stop time now to try to create the experience for myself. I just feel like the world is racing around and I want to stay right where I am, if not go backwards.
