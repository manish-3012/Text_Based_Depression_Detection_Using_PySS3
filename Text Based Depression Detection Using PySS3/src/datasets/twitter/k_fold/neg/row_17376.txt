I donâ€™t crave death, I just want my problems to be over with.I decided a while ago that I was just going through the motions of living, but the main variable stopping my plan is that a store near me has been effected by the COVID/Unrest sparked gun shortage. I am also worried about what this will do to my boyfriend because I wouldnâ€™t want him to suffer.



My main issues are money, which is ultimately a foolish thing to end a life over. But reasonable, because I cannot accommodate my needs without extra help. I donâ€™t see the point in living if I canâ€™t have the ultimate quality of life; I donâ€™t need to own a mansion, but Iâ€™d like to have the funds for necessary surgeries related to health and not just aesthetics. I also canâ€™t find a reason to go on if my intelligence is limited (I struggle with certain subjects and focusing to a large degree) as an adult student.
