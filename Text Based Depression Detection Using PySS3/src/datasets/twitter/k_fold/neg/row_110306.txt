Im worriedI posted some stuff here before but this time it ain't about me, its about a girl that im going to call A and a dude ill call K. 

A left her boyfriend for K and they were having a great time together but K didnt love her and told her that. A didnt want to give up and stuff got even more complicated when friends of k got mad at him for fucking around with her because they were also friends of AÂ´s ex boyfriend. A lot of stuff happened so ill make this short, K left A because he wanted his ex back and she was broken hearted. K then came back to A and she was to weak to say no so they met and fucked again. K realised that A was still broken hearted even after months so he decided to leave again and blocked her everywhere.

Dont judge K to hard tho. He didnt have any bad intentions he just felt lonely because he broke up with his ex just a few months before he met A.

A now feels worse than ever, is talking about suicide and hurting herself and a few hours ago depression hit her so hard that she was about to collapse. She drank half a bottle of wine and scratched her arm so bad that it started bleeding. SheÂ´s been constanly angry and depressed lately wich makes her treat her surroundings rather unfavorable and she feels guilty because of that. After she got drunk I tried to calm her down and make her go to sleep, I managed it in the end and shes sleeping now but she said some fairly bad things and compared me to K wich will make her feel like shit when she wakes up. For me personally its fine, its not easy to hurt me and even tho what she said stung its nothing too bad.

Im worried sick that she will hurt herself and that she wont be able to get out of that hole and i dont know what to do anymore. So basically what im asking for is a remedy for a broken heart or at least some tips on how to help her get through all of this. Im giving my all to be there for her but it doesnt seem to be enough.

Im sorry for any typos.
