Please Help Me Realize Reasons to LiveI'm on the fence about ending it. Im 23 today and sense I was 18 the thought of killing myself has soothed me.  This past week, I've felt incredibly empty, which leaves me wondering "what is the point of our hard work? " I live alone,  work full time, and go to school. Some would look at me as successful, but I feel nothing.  I use to do hours of art a day, but that stopped working for me,  because locking myself in a room listening to music while painting seems sad all of a sudden. 

Please help me think of reasons. I want to feel alive.
