I attempted yesterdayYesterday I took a handful of sleeping pills and tried to end it. I ended up puking later in the night and so here I am. Idk what im doing with my life. I am struggling with school and I recently relapsed and started using drugs after being sober for about 2 years. I flunked out of college once and I got a second chance with this scholarship but I don't know if I can make it. I don't feel hopeless. I am just ashamed of myself as a person and don't want to be a burden on this Earth or the people in it.
