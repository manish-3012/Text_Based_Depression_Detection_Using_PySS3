i just want to die i canâ€™t handle it no moreiâ€™m 16, but it feels like iâ€™ve been through a life of a 70 year old depressed war veteran or something man. april (possibly this day idk) of last year, my ex girlfriend left me and left me to dread, sheâ€™s everything to me, she lives in tx and we were in a LDR, she would often play w my feelings and talk to other guys (often trying to cheat on me w my best friends who were like brothers to me,) and it hurts man, i miss her so much and she hates me, i had to delete all social media except twitter due to her having those social mediaâ€™s and id see shit i never want to see.

iâ€™m a fat coward, January of 2017 i decided to go homeschooling so i can pass my classes and not do summer school so i can see my girlfriend, i basically did it for nothing and from then to august (start of 2017-18 school year,) i gained 100 pounds, i burned many bridges do to me defending my ex, so much stuff, i miss being skinny and i donâ€™t feel comfortable in my own skin and i just want to take diet pills or something bc iâ€™m too unmotivated to work out man.

speaking of school, i completely fooled around freshman year resulting to me failing most of my classes, i did summer school but got expelled bc i accidentally burned a bathroom down (yes it was accidentally,) fighting a kid who claims to be a blood that i already had problems w, blamed it on him and got caught w weed and matches and such, so yeah i couldnâ€™t make that up, sophomore year i was gone for a large amount of time due to me being in a mental hospital and recovering (i attempted suicide,) and i missed sm work, this year, iâ€™m doing really good, iâ€™ve only failed one course which ima make up. 

but i have a reputation at school unfortunately for being the â€œmost likely to fuck up in lifeâ€ person, everyone knows about me fucking up in school and life and i canâ€™t graduate on time (i have to take an extra year) bc of how bad i did and it hurts bc i seem like a fucking loser and everyoneâ€™s gonna graduate and i wonâ€™t, everyone is also getting a job and having a license and car and iâ€™m in a fucking freshman class for first period, it hurts knowing iâ€™m the fuck up.

and about school, i have lots and lots of friends, iâ€™m super popular, but everyone is pretty much just an acquaintance to me, but i also get a lot of shit for being myself, yeah, iâ€™ll get to that in a bit, i dye my hair pink and cut my dickies on the bottoms above my ankles and all of a sudden iâ€™m gay, i go from listening to nirvana to listening to chief keef, all of a sudden iâ€™m a suicidal wigger emo, i just canâ€™t be myself, people expect me to wear american eagle, true religions, jordanâ€™s and supreme when i was wearing supreme in middle school and got shitted on for it, it bothers me so much.

my best friend who was like a brother to me, and my crew hate me now due to me crying to him on imessage about my ex and he just shits on me and i get mad at him, i start hanging w different ppl and he assumes i switched up on him when i just didnâ€™t want to talk to him for a while bc i was so mad, i lost my brothers. he was all i had physically (my other best friends out of the â€œposseâ€ are really far away,) and it hurts.

i make music and clothes but never released any of it bc whenever i share anything i get shitted on for it, and music and fashion are the two occupations i want to do for the rest of my life, i just feel like iâ€™m going no where w it. 

i come home to the same shit everyday, just jacking off, checking twitter, listening to tyler the creator and lil peep, family fighting w family, just so depressing, EVERY FUCKING DAY,

iâ€™m scared for the summer to come bc last summer was when i was at my loneliest do to me burning bridges and losing my ex, i donâ€™t want to be alone again, thereâ€™s nothing to do in the summer time.

society also makes me want to leave this planet bc, like i said, everyone is a sheep, everyone wants to act like each other listening to the same music thatâ€™s trending, wearing the same fucking clothes they get at their local zumiez and if you donâ€™t follow them rules, youâ€™re weird unfortunately, i just wish everyone can just be themselves, another thing is, im italian so iâ€™m considered white by society which i agree w, everyone decides to shit on white people and everyone acts like every white person is racist, a school shooter, a serial killer, anything thatâ€™s bad and we get blamed on for everything but iâ€™m none of those things, idk it just bothers me i feel like iâ€™m hated by everyone.

i have a therapist and on medication, it doesnâ€™t do shit to me, it helps when we talk but after that, iâ€™m back to shit, i cant do this no more man

i miss my ex i miss my best friends i miss being happy i miss being skinny i miss not being a fuck up i miss the old me 

i canâ€™t do this no more, please,

save me.
