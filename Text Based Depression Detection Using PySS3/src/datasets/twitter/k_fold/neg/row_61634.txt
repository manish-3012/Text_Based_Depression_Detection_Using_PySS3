hii canâ€™t really remember a time in my life when i didnâ€™t want to kill myself.
i want to be successful first though because my amma has been the only person in my life to care about me and i donâ€™t want to continue to be the disappointment i am.
My family didnâ€™t have very much money when we came to america when i was a baby so i hope i can pay her back the money she wasted on me.
Growing up its been just me and my mom being afraid of my dad.
Ive never really gotten to talk to anyone else in my family.
Growing up being the only indian kid really sucked.
I really hope itâ€™s because i was brown and not just me.
My earliest memories were going to bed in preschool feeling so alone and crying. nothing changed. i tried so hard to just be normal and then try to be funny and quirky. the only real me i know is the one who wants to die. i donâ€™t have any friends or any family besides my mom. itâ€™s still the same. im 17 now and it still feels the same. i dont want to keep doing this every fucking day but i just have to last until i can pay my mom back. i get my sat score back tomorrow and i just hope its the 1500 i need. itâ€™s so hard not to killl myself and i just want it to atop and stop crying every night of my life i cant believe ive wasted my entire childhood like this i hate myself so much but i dont think i can last much longer it only gets worse its never been this bad and i just want to stop
