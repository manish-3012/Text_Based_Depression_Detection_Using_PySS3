i want to go to the beachIâ€™m 16 in the US, my spring break is starting next week, I have my own car and enough money for gas.. I want to drive 1300 miles to get to lost coast, California. Iâ€™m suicidal but I want to make my last moments special. Whatâ€™s stopping me. Why canâ€™t I? Why wonâ€™t I?
 
Someone encourage me or discourage me. please.
