The last bit of controlMost days, it seems like the only thing I actually have any control over in my life is whether or not I choose to die at any given moment.  I cherish these terrible impulses because they are the last thing in the world that belong solely to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have given away everything else through my bad choices and my bad treatment of everyone else.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have the means, the motive, and endless opportunities. I have to keep them close at all times, otherwise I don't have control.  If I decide that this is the time, but I don't have the tools with me, then I actually DON'T have that control that I thought I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could talk to someone about this, but I can't.  I start to try to talk to my friends about it. But as soon as I get, "Are you ok, man?" I shut down and change the subject.  I want to talk about it, but I don't want to give away the last tiny bit of my private inner self that I have left.  When I got anywhere near it with my therapist, he started talking about "concerns for my safety."  I know what that means and it would only make things much, much worse.  Now I have to hide things from him, just like I do with everyone else.
