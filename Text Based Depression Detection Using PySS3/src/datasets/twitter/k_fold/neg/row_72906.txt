Itâ€™s over. Not asking for attention. Not trying to influence others. Iâ€™m done.I donâ€™t know where this came from. Iâ€™ve been happy. Havenâ€™t felt like this in years. This urge came out of nowhere and itâ€™s a very strong feeling. I donâ€™t know if I want to ask for help, or if Iâ€™m just going to. I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m going insane. I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s going on. I feel very dissociated. I donâ€™t even know who I am, where this coming from, or anything. Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m sorry guys. Please continue to live. Not sure if Iâ€™m asking for help or if Iâ€™m venting before I make a decision or if itâ€™s just my last words. Love you guys.
