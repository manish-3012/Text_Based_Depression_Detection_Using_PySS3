Is my life badI donâ€™t know where to post this Iâ€™m new to posting so here I go, My dad abused my mom for years in front of me while I could do nothing about it they are still together and pretend nothing has happend I also got builled for years I had no friends because they all left me to be friends with my bullies even in high school I didnâ€™t have friends (I now thankfully have a lot of friends), i still get verbally abused on a daily basis, I opened up to two people and they didnâ€™t care they havenâ€™t checked up on me and when I went to school counseling she made it seem like it was my fault and everytime I would see her she would roll her eyes and sigh really loudly i   donâ€™t know if my life is bad because when I open up people donâ€™t seem to care is it because my life isnâ€™t bad?
