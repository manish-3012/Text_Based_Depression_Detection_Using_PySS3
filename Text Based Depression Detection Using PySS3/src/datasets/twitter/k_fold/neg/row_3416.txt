I hate school and lifeSchool has been so fucking ruff this year. In previous years I have hated it, this year I have had weeks of pure studying just to get a b on a test. Last week I gave myself no free time and when I was finished I felt no joy or excitement I was just dull and tired. I recently did a final and didnâ€™t do well on it and threw my computer and tried to hurt myself. I keep saying that Iâ€™m going to kill myself, but I just end up not doing it. I feel like my life is fucking repeat, with me going to school and then coming home and then working or doing nothing. When my family asks me how school Was I always answer, â€œthe sameâ€ because it is. I feel like It will always be like this. My life is so average that I just know when grow up, Iâ€™m going to work a 9-5 job and casually always hating it, but doing nothing about it , always struggling with money, but never to the point where I lose my house that I will be paying for the rest of my life and giving my children the same fate. I just feel trapped and out of options at this point, we grow up to feel special and then shut down when the inevitable truth hits you. Fuck this.
