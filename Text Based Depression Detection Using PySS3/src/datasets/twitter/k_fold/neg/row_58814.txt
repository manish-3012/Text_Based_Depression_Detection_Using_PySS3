Lonely, heartbroken, college graduate with nothing to live for I just don't want to live..... Part of me does, but a huge part of me just wants to end it.  Nobody loves me anymore.  I have no "real" friends.  Drugs are my only friend right now, and I'm running out of them.  I'm not happy. I miss the girl of my dreams.. I miss her long curly blonde hair, I miss her smile, I miss her witty remarks to my dumbassery.  I shouldn't have ever left her but I was a dumbass.  That's my M.O., though, I do dumbass shit. Not only did I fuck myself over with that decision, I broke her heart...  I fucked up college even though I know I could have excelled.  I never went to class, never did anything but the bare minimum.  Obviously didn't get into medical school like I planned.  I'm a huge fuck up.  I just want to do drugs until I die......I never do anything right.  I'm in debt and with no job... I just want to give up before I fuck anything else up. Even having one understanding person to talk to would help...

I guess nobody on reddit cares either... no surprise.  All I wanted was someone to talk to but shit... I guess I wouldn't want to talk to me either.
