SuicideI'm just here to say that I pray that everyone has a change of heart at wanting to kill themselves. I've been there to and am still there, I know it's hard and you feel like you wanna give up but don't. You are greater than that, even when someone or something made you feel like you aren't. I encourage you to write out your thoughts on a paper or even dwell on happy music because dwelling on sad music will incise you even more to kill yourself (again, I've been in that predicament.) If no one told you they loved you today, just know that I love you, even though I don't know anyone in this chatroom, we have to lift each other up and tell someone that they're worth it and that they are ENOUGH. I'm here to chat with anyone if they need to get anything off their chest, I'm a great listener and advice giver. I hope everyone that reads this finds peace and happiness in their heart some day. And remember, why give up? when tomorrow might be the day that you win?
