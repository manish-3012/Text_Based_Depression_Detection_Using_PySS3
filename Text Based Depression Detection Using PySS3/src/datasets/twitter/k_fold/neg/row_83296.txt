31 yo male, Vancouverite, living with chronic intensifying pain over the last 10 years -- don't want a psych ward, don't want to die, but it keeps cropping up in the back of my headI don't know what else to say. I am on 3 daily doses of Gabepenton, a prescription muscle relaxant, and 6 T3's daily. I have had concussion issues over the years, an injury to my spine, and now thinking from doctors is that I have a bulging disc and osteroarthritis.  I smoke indica to help but I use it as more of an escape. I try to live a healthy live style, have a 9-5, do physicotherapy, acupunture, and ostepathy massage sessions. I am  university educated with a business degree, in a 6 year relationship, but I feel alone and worn out. No one in my everyday life seems to understand chronic pain. it started at a 3/10 but now hovers most days around 8-9/10. I don't want to die but living with pain is wearing on me. This is not a cry for help I am just hurting and so unhappy with my life.  Thanks for listening.
