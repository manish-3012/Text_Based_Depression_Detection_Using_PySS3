thinking about doing*it* againsorry for bad english.

I attempted suicide in the last 3 months and my family didnt even know about it. I hid my neck bruises from them and corrected my hoarseness of my voice because of the rope. 

Every night I think about doing it again. University is making me anxious and I feel really terrible because I am not catching up on my classes and I am not attending my labs anymore. I feel bad because my dad pays for my study and I wasted everything. I am thinking of jumping from the 8th floor of our research building but that would be really selfish for other students seeing me dead on my pool of blood or even my parents seeing me dead in my bedroom closet with a rope. 

I am losing my mind, even reaching a therapist makes me anxious. :( 
I constantly lie that I am doing well in my studies but itâ€™s the complete opposite. Maybe Iâ€™ll do the rope method again and drink a lot of alcohol with lots of analgesic.
