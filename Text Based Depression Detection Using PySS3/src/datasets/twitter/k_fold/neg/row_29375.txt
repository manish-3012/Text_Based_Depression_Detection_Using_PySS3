Desire is strong todayMy class is full of bullies. I'm going to be miserable everyday for the rest of the school year. I have 0 social skills so I'll be the loser who is always alone. I have never managed to fit in, and the people who do know me just interact with me out of pity. I'm the perfect victim.

I can't take this anymore. My parents will never understand. I just told my mother and she just said how pathetic I am. I know I can always go talk to someone else, but my anxiety just prevents me from doing that. I'm going to end my life. My whole life I have endured constant bullying. I don't know what a genuine connection to someone feels like. I just can't take a break. I'm done and I'm so sick of suffering.

I'm going to skip school later and I'll jump off a bridge. I will send a text message saying goodbye once I'm about to jump. I'll pretend I'm going to school so they won't suspect anything. At least now my family won't have a disappointment. They have my siblings anyway who have always been better than me. I'm just the burden and I can feel their love for me lessen each day. They will be sad, but they will soon realize I didn't mean anything and my death didn't make a difference. They won't be extremely hurt. 

That is the plan. I have a strong desire to do this today. But at the same time, I still want to hold on. I've never been this close. I hope I can still hold on.
