I Finished My Suicide Note &amp; I Dont Know What to DoI dont have the courage to do it tonight, but my urge to off myself has just been getting worse and worse over the past few weeks. I'm afraid. I might do it in a fit of anger and sadness sometime soon, but at least I have my final thoughts prepared to leave behind. Every day my outlook becomes more and more bleak and I don't know if I can take it for much longer.
