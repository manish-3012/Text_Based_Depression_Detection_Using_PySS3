Things have been extra bad lately and itâ€™s been laying heavy on my mind. I just want to be okay. Itâ€™s always something.I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m doing on this planet anymore. I was supposed to be stillborn and I wish that I had been. Life is too overwhelming. My marriage is overwhelming. My mental health issues are practically killing me. Depression, BPD, Iâ€™m so paranoid all the time and I lash out at people to protect myself when Iâ€™m afraid that theyâ€™re gonna hurt me. Iâ€™m a giant ball of mistakes and fuck ups and I donâ€™t deserve anything good in life. I donâ€™t deserve to exist and I shouldnâ€™t have in the first place.
