I cut myself deeper... ;(I've been in the act of cutting sense I was about 14 and now here I am 3 years, 17 years old still cutting... I have been doing it deeper and it's starting to hurt less... I feel worthless and unloved, should I go to the hospital?, my plan is to overdose but I don't wanna do it and yet I do.. I don't wanna hurt my family yet I hate living here, it's so unfair! -actually crying rn-
