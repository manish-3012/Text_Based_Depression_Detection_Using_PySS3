Suicidal so escaping to a desert island when corona is overIâ€™ve genuinely been having thoughts about going off the grid completely when the corona situation is over. I picture myself on a personally built raft going from a foreign country (which Iâ€™d fly to) to an island no human has travelled to. Iâ€™d just inform my mum (everyone else has abandoned me) months before departure that Iâ€™m thinking of going on a holiday at some point. Iâ€™m a burden to her anyway. Obviously I need to research further.
