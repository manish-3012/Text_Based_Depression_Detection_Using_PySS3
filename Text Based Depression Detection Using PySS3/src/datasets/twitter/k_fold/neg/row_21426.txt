Finding a TherapistHello, 
My friend has been struggling with a lot of poor self image issues and depression and she needs a therapist. Every day has become a toss up if I can talk her off the ledge or not. She has been to 5 therapists who say they wont take her. I know the guidelines say I can't request contact information so I won't ask for it, but is there any advice you can give me to help her find a therapist?
