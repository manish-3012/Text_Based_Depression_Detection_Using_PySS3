Iâ€™m not meant to be happyI think itâ€™s my time. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this but I just think it may give me comfort. Iâ€™m new to this so sorry if I made a mistake or didnâ€™t say things correctly. I donâ€™t think I can keep going anymore, this week Iâ€™m planning to go buy a rope but Iâ€™m not sure where to hang myself. Lately Iâ€™ve been thinking maybe my house but thereâ€™s always ppl around, or maybe outside in some tree where some stranger will find me. I just wanted to let it out that Iâ€™m ready to leave this world and I know that no one cares so might as well just go with it. Anyways sorry that itâ€™s early, I couldnâ€™t sleep and I havenâ€™t ate. I was trying to sleep but I canâ€™t for sum reason. Anyways have a good morning.
