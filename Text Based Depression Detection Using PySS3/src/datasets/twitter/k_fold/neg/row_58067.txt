Four years ago I almost died. Like actually for real, almost died. I remember I was trying to relax all of the muscles in my body, I though that would soften the blows of being kicked in the ribs repeatedly. I was naked, curled up on the floor, bleeding profusely out of my asshole and my head. I had a full handle of liquor smashed over my skull moments earlier and the impact had thrown me to the ground. He walked away. I thought I was safe. He came back with his gun, the service weapon he carried for his job. I couldn't move. I didn't realize that my pelvis was broken, I just knew that I couldn't move. I laid there, only kind of able to see through the film of blood covering my eyes. He was pointing the gun at me. I'm not even religious and don't even have a solid understanding of christianity but I remember pleading with God in my head to let me live through this. I would give anything, do anything. I didn't want to get beaten and gunned down on the kitchen floor of my own apartment. I laid there in silence for what felt like an eternity. I heard the gun go off, I closed my eyes and for a second I actually thought I was dead. I just heard crashing and crashing. I was so shaken up that I actually felt like I was falling out of my body. He hit the floor and it ricocheted in the galley kitchen. 

I was treated like a piece of meat. The world's ugliest, most unflattering nudes paraded around a courtroom. This was not my body. This was their evidence. I had no say in it. My bodily autonomy was not as important as his criminal defense. The defense attorney had the underwear I had been wearing in a plastic baggie, and then he approached me on the stand waving it around, telling me they were sexy and trying to get me to say that I had planned to have sex with him and had been teasing him. If I had to pinpoint it, this would be the exact moment where the last fuck that I had about my flesh prison fluttered away. I don't care about people calling me a whore. I don't care how many giant photographs of my naked body are tossed around so cavalierly, people sexualizing me without any regard for the fact that I'm actually a human being with feelings. Photos he apparently took himself during the attack finding their way to the internet. I don't remember begging him for my life. But there it is on video. A lot of it's still on the internet if you look hard enough. At this point, various pictures from the day he tried to kill me have spent a longer time on the internet than he has ever spent in jail. 

I regret that I was unable to die. That I share a child with this man. That we bicker over child support as he abuses the courts and his financial resources to re-traumatize me whenever he feels like it. The ass photograph lawyer comes back for an encore whenever it's time to renew my protection order, but it's the only thing that keeps him from being able to win custody and I do it because it's literally the only concretely valuable I can say that I've done for my kid in his life.   


I just lay in my bed all day glorifying my anorexia. Taking as much Xanax as humanly possible and shoveling back enough Adderall to not pass out. The closest I get to actually comfortable is when I feel like tv static. I watch garbage reality shows. I've seen every meme there is to see. I'm over it. I am really and truly over it.
