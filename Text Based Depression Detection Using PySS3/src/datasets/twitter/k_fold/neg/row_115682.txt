Iâ€™ve reached that point again.I told my therapist three weeks ago that I had this unnerving feeling. I couldnâ€™t make out why but itâ€™s best described as a waiting for the other shoe to drop. I was finally in a place in my life where I can do and afford to do things that interest me, making enough that I didnâ€™t get food stamps (after three years of being off and on/mainly on), saw a flight to Amsterdam in Februaryfor a cheap price so I even booked that.

Was pulled into HR over an incident and basically since I wouldnâ€™t lie to involve two other coworkers they were going to fire me. I opted to resign and left. I just canâ€™t in good faith fuck someone elseâ€™s livelihood up, even at the expense of my own. 

I canâ€™t even fathom going out of the country anymore if I donâ€™t have cash. Was planning to get passport made this week. Move out of my sisterâ€™s house (â­ï¸) by January 1. Start working on my credit. 


Now Iâ€™m back to square one. Unemployed, depressed (with the slightest inkling of optimism), and suicidal given I just lost my cushy $3200 a month after taxes unskilled labor job.

Iâ€™m never gonna make that kind of money again. Iâ€™m just wanting to sleep forever. Sleepingâ€™s the only time Iâ€™m ever at peace.
