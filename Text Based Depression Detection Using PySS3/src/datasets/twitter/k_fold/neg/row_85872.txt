CatastropheDoes anyone else ever just dream of a major catastrophic event happening just so that they won't have to keep playing this game of life. Bills, school, work, relationships, debt.

I know I sound awful, but some days I wish the only thing I had to worry about is basic survival..not all the extra stress in my life..for some reason it seems easier to be far away from all these expectations and responsibilities. 

I don't think I'll ever be able to have the life I want , or maintain it, and if I some how am able to attain it, I won't be happy or satisfied, I'll always have to look over my shoulder...waiting for the floor to fall out from under me. Like it has so many times before. 

Man, it all seems so pointless. But I'm a huge coward so I think about dying everyday, but can't seem to pull the trigger.
