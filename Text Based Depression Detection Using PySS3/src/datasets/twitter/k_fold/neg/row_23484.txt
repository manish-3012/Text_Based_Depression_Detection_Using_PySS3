I want to kill myself right nowI'm so sick and tired of leaving, I can't stand waking up to this bullshit ass live. I suffer from depression and anxiety and I'm doing therapy but I'm far from getting better... I came from work right now almost crying till I got in the car. I had a wish to crash to a building.... I have no will to live.. I'm insecure, ugly.. I can't feel happiness, it makes me angry and mad.. I'm constantly feeling numb.. empty all the time and I can't stand living like this anylonger. They say it gets better, it's been a long time and nothing I tried and tried and I failed. I never asked to be born and I'm not enjoying being on this planet. Life sucks and I have no hope anymore. I don't feel like I have people that care about me. I've always been lonely.. I don't have friends and I have no interest in anything. I lost it. I can't love anything.. I avoid people and I stay isolated... Doesn't matter if I try to be with people I will feel worse... Anxiety and depression is like hell inside my head.. I don't want to make my mom sad and I don't know what to do anymore... I'm not looking for attention I'm just writing my feelings to release my mind from stress...
