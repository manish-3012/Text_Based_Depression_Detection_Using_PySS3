Im not going to make itIâ€™m not going to make it though this year, ive given up on school, my life goals are unrealistic, life is so fucking hard, im not going to make it.
All i do all day is sit down and use my phone, i have no energy to do anything else.
I want to rip myself apart. I hate myself for being so useless, why take up space when youâ€™re going to fucking die? Iâ€™m a worthless, barely living piece of shit and why havent i killed myself yet? 
I know my death is going to be suicide, im just delaying the inevitable. 
HELP
