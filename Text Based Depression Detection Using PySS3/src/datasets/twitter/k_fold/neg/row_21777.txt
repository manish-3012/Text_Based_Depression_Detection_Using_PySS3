I can't handle this anymore, I just want everything to stopI don't give a DAMN about the virus itself anymore. It's the people, the media, the governments that drive me crazy, perhaps literally.

I can't control my life anymore. I'm afraid I'll starve to death in a poor country where the government doesn't care about us while everyone else is emptying the grocery stores. I can't afford to stock up on anythhing.

I know there's one, just one person that cares about me and I don't want to leave him or hurt him in any way but I'm just getting worse and worse every day. I kind of wish I was alone, it would be easier to decide then, it's just torture right now, especially since we're in different countries and the one he's in shut down

I'm constantly being bombarded with fear and negativity and I'm just absorbing them like a sponge and it's tearing me apart, I wish I could just shut everything off, it hurts too much

I'm scared of hotlines and chats and the like. I tried them before when I was feeling down and they would all just knock me down more with their constant interrupting and invasive questions.and blaming me for everything. I'm afraid they might just be the last straw if i talk to them and they just add to the pain

I just want this all to be over
