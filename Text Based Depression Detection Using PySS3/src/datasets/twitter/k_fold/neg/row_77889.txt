Iâ€™m so close to giving upone push, thatâ€™s all itâ€™ll take. maybe even a tap or jab, Iâ€™ll be over the edge. I never planned to live this long, the pressure thatâ€™s gonna fall of disappointment from everyone I ever knew is going to kill me. Iâ€™m such a failure.
I want to die so badly it physically hurts, Iâ€™m so tired.
I just want it to stop.
to feel myself fade and have no more worries.
why do I deserve this pain?
what did I do that caused this
by the time my break comes Iâ€™ll be gone
I just canâ€™t do this anymore 
I feel shitty for reaching out, what a fraud
A liar
An idiot 
Iâ€™m not worth the food I eat or the air I breathe 
I just waste it all like I deserve it
