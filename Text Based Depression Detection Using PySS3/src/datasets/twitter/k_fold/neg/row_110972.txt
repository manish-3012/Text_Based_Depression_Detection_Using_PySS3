I wanna dieHey guys its been two years since I moved to Canada to study Engineering in a University. I failed a couple of classes , maybe three in my first two years. I never felt homesick but now it feels so weird. I can't sleep at night and the only way I go to sleep is when I stay awake for too long. I had so many friends in Highschool and ever since I moved I've kinda lost in touch with them but I still follow them on Instagram. Whenever I see their stories of them hanging out and having fun I just feel so depressed and I regret moving. I don't have any student loan debt because my dad pays for my tuition fee ( no we're not rich)which is what makes it so worse. I feel so guilty because I haven't told him I failed some of my classes. Since i have a poor GPA , I'm at that stage where I would be kicked out of Engineering. I'm on a academic probation right now. The only thing stopping me from ending it is my mom. My mom loves me so much. When I was about to move Canada , she was half hearted about it. Eventually she was fine with it since I wanted to go. Now I wish I never moved at all. I can't stop googling about easy ways to die. Each time I think about killing myself, I think about my mom and how would she feel. Why is it that eventhough I have a lot of people who love me so much , I still feel lonely and depressed.  I mean I know some of you may be going through worse stuff than this or this might look like not a big deal. Trust me I know. When I was in Highschool I heard about students killing themselves and I thought why would anyone do that and laughed about it. But now it just hurts so bad. I feel like I'm such a disappointment. My dad even sold one of his houses so that he could pay for my tuition fee and I feel like I'm failing him. This is also another thing that stops me from doing it because all those things he did for my education would became useless and even in death I would fail him. I mean I thought about talking to a therapist or something then i realized I'm too broke and too insecure to talk about it to someone I know. The only reason I'm posting this on reddit is because I can stay anonymous. I was also in a long distance relationship with a girl. I loved her so much and marry her but even while I was talking with her I was scared of my life the whole time. She loved me so much but I threw it all away because I was a coward. I ghosted her for months and I didn't break up with her properly. I feel like I push everyone away everyone who cares about me. I was once a very extroverted person but now I don't even feel like talking to my mom or dad or even my brother.  All i do is wake up, attend some zoom lectures , do some assignments and study. But I think I won't be able to stop myself from doing it if I'm required to discontinue from Engineering. I wanted to be a Engineer since highschool but now I just wanna pass my courses. I was very eager when I moved to Canada but now I just wanna die. I keep telling to myself that if I ever get the opportunity to die in an accident , to take it because that way my parents won't think I killed myself. I don't know what to do to stop feeling this way. If you've read this far, well thanks. I just needed to tell this to someone. Also if anyone thinks this isnt such a big deal like to wanting to die because you failed in college, I completely get it but please don't troll me guys. To whoever reading this, thanks for listening.

Ps : No, this is not like a suicide note or something I felt like talking to someone.
