I feel so aloneSo just the other day I lost my ex fiancÃ© and her daughter which I was apart of her life for the 7 months of the little ones life.. now she decided to leave me and live with her friend and friends husband.. Iâ€™ve harmed my liver severely 6 years ago and now I just want to finish everything off.. I loved the kid and I loved her more than anything and I feel so empty without Them.. I have no one to talk to and no one understand what Iâ€™m going through like I wanna ball my eyes out but Iâ€™m just so numb..
