maybe it's timeI don't know how much longer I can do this. I'm exhausted. I've been struggling with depression, ptsd, and ocd for 7 years now and in recovery for 3. I'm so fucking tired. Saturday is my best friend's birthday but after that I think I'm done. I'm not even scared anymore. I use to be afraid that after death is nothingness. But honestly an eternity of darkness is better that whatever the fuck I'm living in right now. The only thing I fear is the possibility that I fail. I've attempted 7 times now but hey, 8th time's the charm I guess. I'll update on Sunday or Monday if I'm still here.
