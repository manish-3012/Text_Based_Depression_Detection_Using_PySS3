Some realizations I've made after being depressed for so long.1) *Government doesn't fucking work.*  

No matter how hard you try to keep them clean, gov'ts will ALWAYS end up being full of sociopaths, narcissists, and other assorted fuckheads. Why? These people like to have power over other people. It's their nature. Case closed.

2) *Humans are too fucking intelligent for their own good.*

We should never have stopped being hunter-gatherers. Intelligence has allowed us to inflict pain, misery, and suffering upon ourselves on a scale that even the most brutal of warlords couldn't fathom. 

*We love to be in pain.*  
*We love to be controlled.*

The very fact that a thing like BDSM exists in the first place really says a lot about the human psyche.
