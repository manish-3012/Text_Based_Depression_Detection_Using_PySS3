Hey, i am really thinking about killing myselfThats just been the theme of this month. I have tried to kill myself before, and Iâ€™m sort of facing a similar situation now.

My problem is my thoughts, I just canâ€™t stop those depressing thoughts. I mean, they donâ€™t make a lotta sense, I just donâ€™t understand why they keep popping up in my head.

I am currently struggling with moving from phase one of living with my parents to phase two of having a life. Iâ€™m trying to get my business (thats online), off the ground. It seems impossible, i know it takes a lot of patience but it is really really difficult.

My environment has a lot to do with it. Its hard to explain. Ive been trying to block these thoughts and trying to meditate but Iâ€™m actually losing sleep and its getting worse. 

I decide to talk about it this time, because it seems like i am trying to resist that. I canâ€™t seem to ignore it. The thing is, i have to wait for my situation to get better, because theres nothing i can do other than that, im not totally insane right now. i have a long way to go, and offing myself with a gun seems like a very very reasonable solution, if the opportunity presented itself in the near future.
