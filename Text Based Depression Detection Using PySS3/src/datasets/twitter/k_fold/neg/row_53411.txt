I am a benefit fraudI have low functioning autism and I got my benefits slashed by the government because they found out I was a fraud.  I do not work because I am not skilled enough to earn enough to live on.  I complained about this on Reddit and I got downvoted because I was too greedy and scummy and because mentally disabled people are capable of work and don't need benefits.

I am a greedy piece of shit for claiming benefits (disability benefits AND unemployment benefits) and I deserve to kill myself because I am too lazy to grow up and work alongside 14 year old children and other special needs adults earning less than minimum wage or just accept the fact I can't have luxury items like name brand cola.

The downvoter is right, people who don't have real disabilities don't deserve help from the government.  They deserve to be treated like adults who are capable of going to university, driving, having sex and looking after children.

I hope to kill myself by tomorrow.
