I'm practically a ghost how I live now anywayI live with my sister.  We grew up fairly poor but she's quite financially comfortable now. I actually had work and money during the holiday  for the first time in my life this year so i bought presents for everyone. I didn't expect much of anything.  I'm unproductive, nearing 30 and basically a leech. But somehow Seeing my more humble gifts totally outclassed and barely reacted to was still hard. But what really got me was when I found their Christmas shopping list with the names of everyone in the family on it. Even distant present buying cases like my dad, who my sister(who isn't his kid) hates. But I wasn't on the list at all. I wasn't even an afterthought.  It's one thing knowing you're a burdensome piece of shit nobody cares about. It's more sobering to have it confirmed.
