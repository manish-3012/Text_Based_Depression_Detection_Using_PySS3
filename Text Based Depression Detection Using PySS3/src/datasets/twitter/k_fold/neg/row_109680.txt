I keep a box of sleeping pills next to my bed just so I always have a way out.It feels relieving in a way, knowing I can always just take those pills and everything will stop. Iâ€™ve tried taking my own life 3 times (hanging twice and cutting once) but I was too scared of the pain. So I went to a drugstore and bought the strongest sleeping pills I could get my hands on. It sits there as a reminder that I can get away from all this shit whenever I want and without pain.
