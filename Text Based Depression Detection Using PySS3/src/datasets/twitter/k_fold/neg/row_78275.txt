I'm starting to accept that I wasn't meant to be in this worldI've never fit in. I've never been able to relate to my peers. They've always seen me as weird. Everyone stares at me. It's like I'm some weird freak experiment. Why can't I just have a normal life?

I'm 16 and parentless. No close family. It's like I'm drowning in problems and no one can hear my muffled screams. I don't have a mum I can ask for advice. Everyone else has a parent. How can I get on with people who've never had to go through trauma? I'm tired of acting like I can relate to them when they've all been handed everything on a silver plate. They don't know what it's like to go hungry. I'm skinny, malnourished and Im so insecure.

My life is so mundane. Everything costs money which I don't have. Life is the same everyday: wake up &gt; get dressed &gt; eat the same bland porridge &gt; get dressed into clothes that don't fit &gt; go to school (hating every minute of it) &gt; come home to an empty home  &gt; sit in my room &gt; sleep.

I've held on for so long, believing that life will get better. But it's been over a year and nothing has got better at all. Only now, everyone expects me to have gotten over the death of my mum. In fact, life was still shit before she died. I don't know why she even had me in the first place. She knew that I wouldn't have a dad to raise me. I should have never been born.
