At this point I really don't care and I just want to end itI'm 28 I have no friends and my family can not help me improve my life. I don't see my life getting ang better. I also have very little friends. I wish I had built network when I was younger. I can't stand my mother for how she sheltered me and my dad for being careless and not instilling in me what it is to be a man. I don't know how to speak to women, I've only had one girlfriend in my life at 26 and that was bullshit.

I'm tired of my mind racing. always nervous, heavy sweating, my shitty voice and being treated like I'm retarded. I see no value in life, I see no reason to stick stick around and I just feel limp. I hate my shitty walk, my shitty almost unintelligble voice. And all I'm trying to do is find the easiest most painless way out. I'm up and down all the time, and I know whe I feel good I'm just going to end up feeling shit again.  This is not a good life, this is not  life worth living and I just don't give a fuck.

I don't enjoy anything I used to love. I've been thinking gun, jump headfirst off my roof, some sort of poison. I just want to die.
