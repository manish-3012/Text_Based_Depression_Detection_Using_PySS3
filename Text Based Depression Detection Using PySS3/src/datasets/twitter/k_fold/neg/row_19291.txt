I went into a mental health facility to get help. They called the police on me within ten minutes of me being there...I have been looking to get help since last june. I found a therapist that didn't know how to do his job very well so I never saw him again. At the beginning of December I dragged my ass out of bed at seven thirty in the morning to walk into a mental health facility and get help. They turned me down and told me they couldn't take me as a new patient because I didn't live in the right county. I live in the same fuckin' county as the facility. To tell you the truth I think they turned me down because I'm white and every single employee there was latino along with every single patient..._x000D_

So, immediately after that happened I drove to another mental health facility half an hour away from where I live. I walked in and told them I was looking to get help. At first the lady told me they couldn't take me as a new patient that day and to come back the following day. Then she asked me two questions. First, she asked if I had ever had problems in the past with depression. I said yes and that I have been on four different anti-depressants before but wasn't currently on one. Then she asked if I had a plan to kill myself. My exact words were, "If I was going to kill myself I *do* know how I would do it." _x000D_
Now, I don't know if that's an exact yes but I do know that if I'm ever asked that question again I will tell them I'm not going to answer. She said ok and pulled me back into her office. She asked a few more questions like if I was schitzophrenic and what not before telling me she was going to call the police. I looked her in the eye and said, "What the fuck? Are you kidding me? I came in here to get help and this is how you help people?" I ended up telling her that if she called the police it would just make things worse. I told her that I walked in on my own to get help and that calling the police wasn't necessary. She said "Ok, well let me get two other colleagues of mine." She ended up bringing in another guy and another girl to come and talk to me. The guy ended up telling me to follow him into his office. I followed him and he sat me down and started talking to me about what was going on in my life while the second woman just kind of sat there. The first woman who originally said she was going to call the police wasn't around anymore. After talking to this guy for three minutes the second woman left and five minutes later the police knocked on the door. It got really fuckin' bad and they started asking me questions about my "plan". I told them they were fucking idiots and that if this was their way of helping somebody then they needed to re-think their line of work. The police kept asking me if I was going to initiate my "plan". I started to watch what I would say. They asked if I was a danger to myself. I lied and said no. I kept telling everybody there that they were fucking morons and finally asked one of the police officers if I was being forced to go somewhere. He told me that they were called to take me to the emergency room but they couldn't since I apparently wasn't a danger to myself and that if I would have answered yes to any of their questions they would have forced me to go. I got up and walked out while everybody in the whole place was watching. I kept telling them to go fuck themselves on the way out. I don't think I have ever made a bigger scene in public. _x000D_

Reddit, I fuckin' went to get help just like YOU GUYS TOLD ME TO. And this is what I got for it and from it. I created a throwaway account the last time I made a post to suicide watch and I don't remember the user name and password so I created another one. I remember all the comments. "Go and get help."... " I'm so sorry to hear you're going through a hard time. You have to get help for yourself." Yada yada yada. I do have to thank you I guess. Because if it wasn't for you I would never have walked into those mental health facilities. But I got fucked over for literally asking for help. _x000D_

I haven't left my room in a month and a half since the beginning of December when that happened. I litterally haven't left my room at all except to go to the bathroom. I don't eat unless the other person I'm living with brings food to my door... I'm pathetic... I sleep from nine in the morning untill five at night. I don't expect you guys to help and I don't want it anymore. Help may only be a four letter word. But that four letter word is much bigger than what people can actually provide. If you consider help to be just a good comment on reddit suicide watch then screw you. Anything you guys have to tell me I already know. Everything you guys have to say I have heard. Sorry if I sound like a jerk. I have tried SEVERAL times to get help for myself... I'm done trying to get help. I'm not going to call those bullshit hotlines... I'm not going to go and see another doctor. I'm not going to find another therapist when I have been to five in the last three years. I have read so many posts on suicide watch and it bums me out to know my situation is a bit worse then what alot of other people are going through... Yeah I have lost loved ones and yeah I have lived in some pretty fucked up situations. Sorry if that sounds selfish and self centered but alot of times I read other peoples' posts so I can get a grasp on what their going through in order to not feel so bad about my situation. I have gone through alot of what other people go through and post about. I have dealt with love and death. I have dealt with lonlyness. I have dealt with homelessness. I have been through enough to fit a whole other post to suicide watch to say the least. I have dealt with so many things. Once again I'm sorry to sound selfish and self centered..._x000D_
