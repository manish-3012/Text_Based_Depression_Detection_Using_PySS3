venti was at school and i just couldnt take it anymore. i was crying so much and i just wanted to end my life right then and there. i was walking towards the street. i waited for a car to come along but before i could my boyfriend stopped me. i dont think he knew what i was doing, but he comforted me. i really wish i just ran into the street.
