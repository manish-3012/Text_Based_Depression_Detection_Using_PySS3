Has counseling ever helped anyone here?I'm thinking about going to see a counselor I'm just getting really bad now I just feel so numb and I have no empathy even for family. I just don't care anymore I'm to scared to hurt myself and I'd hurt my family. But I don't want to live anymore I have very few things that make me happy anymore and they usually just lead me to getting angry. I hate work so much no one understands I want to cry but I can't.
