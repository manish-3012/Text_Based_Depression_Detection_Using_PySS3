For Ryan, if you ever find thisThe sadness will last forever. 
I remember when you came back, you swore to me that I wouldn't have to be afraid anymore. That you were here for keeps. That I'd never have to cry myself to sleep again. That I was safe.
But the thing is, I never really was. Not even when you'd hold my hand on the long drive home, not when we were singing at the top of our lungs to Radiohead songs, not when we were giggling uncontrollably at the stupidest things. Because all along, we both knew that there would come a day, and soon, where you would move on with your life. When love stopped being enough.
I lived in the past my entire life. I guess I knew from the beginning that there would never be a future, so I did the best with what I had. The problem with that is that the world moves on, whether you're willing to go with it or not. And you moved on to bigger and better things, growing up to be something you were proud of. You are someone else, I am still right here. This is who I've always been, and always will be. This is who I will die as, bound by my pain, never to be anything more than a blue-eyed girl you met in a small town one summer day. 
I don't want you to be sad, regardless of how sad you've made me. I don't want anyone to be sad, or feel any guilt over this. It's no one's fault I was as ill as I was. It's no one's fault that I didn't have the strength to go on with the others.
Please always remember me for who I was: a bubbly ray of sunshine with a heart that loved with naÃ¯vety, a forever-child, never to be a wife or a mother (which is really what breaks my heart the most). 
I have to go because I'll never be safe again. My world stopped turning the moment that you left. The sadness will last forever.
