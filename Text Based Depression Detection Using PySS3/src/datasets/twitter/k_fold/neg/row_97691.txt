I ordered everything I need to kill myselfI'm going to have the supplies soon, I know exactly what to do and I wrote up my goodbyes to the closest people in my life. 

I ruined everything with my ex fiancÃ© and we decided to work it out but I found out he was lying about sleeping with his ex when he said I could look through his phone but then panicked and struggled with me to take it back. I overreacted. We could've worked through it. He left bruises on my arms when he was trying to get his phone back and was saying he was going to kill himself so I called the cops and told them what happened to try and get him admitted for a suicide psych hold to keep him safe. And I should never have mentioned the bruises, he's never been violent, they were barely there, but I overshared to the cop and now he hates me. I've been blocked on everything and all I want is to talk to him and be with him. And I can't handle the pain of knowing he's with his ex I can't handle knowing he wanted to be with me but twice I ruined my chances at happiness. 

My friends and family hate him because he was verbally abusive to me but I'm afraid I skewed everything and he wasn't and now they hate him but he didn't do anything. He's called me crazy before, said I don't remember things right, said I lie. I don't mean to. I don't know what to think. I think I do warp everything. 

I just needed to tell someone. I can't tell the people around me because they'd intervene. I told myself if he contacted me to get back together I wouldn't do it and I'd never tell him I was suicidal but if he doesn't I'll just kill myself. And it's becoming clear he doesn't want to hear from me at all. 

I can't express how much I hate myself. Or how much I need him.
