I'm just so over itSo I have been battling with really bad depression for years now and my mind always comes back to killing myself. I'm just so exhausted especially with constantly being gaslit by people for my own feelings and feeling invalidated. Recently I removed someone on Facebook for being extremely toxic and almost immediately after they messaged me telling me how I was a total price or garbage and I have a bad character for not wanting to have them as a friend when they emotionally abuse someone. That had me up all night contemplating self harming again after being clean for almost 3 years. Than today my roommate went off on me for not wanting to eat at a restaurant while coronavirus cases are surging in my area. Tried to say I should be ok with it since I am working and going to the store no issue. In reality I am beyond anxious doing these things and only do them because I litteraly have to. I'm now laying in bed feeling like the bad guy for having feelings and honestly thinking about trying for a third time... since my other attempts failed. I think the main thing holding me back is th fact I threw out my razors and would have to buy more. I'm so tired of living at this point because obviously I'm not enough and my feelings are a huge inconvenience to everyone around me.
