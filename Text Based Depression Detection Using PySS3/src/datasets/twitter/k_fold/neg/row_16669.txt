Broken loserI am 34 and have worked a dead end job since I was 18. Iâ€™m broke, live with my mother, have no skills, no ambition, short attention span, canâ€™t drive and Iâ€™m constantly fatigued. I feel like itâ€™s possible that this constant depression has just grounded me down to the point where I have no energy. Maybe my body is in agreement with my mind now that I should just stop moving for good.

Iâ€™ve also been dating someone for 2 years in a ldr. Weâ€™ve been together on holiday several times and it was amazing. I have been lying to her the whole time though about my living situation, job and that I can drive.

She is trying to organise a visa to come to me, but the truth is this canâ€™t happen. Iâ€™ve been trying to put it off as long as I can. Through my selfishness I have put her in a position where it would crush her. 

I just really need an escape. I knew life would be hard, but this is impossible.
