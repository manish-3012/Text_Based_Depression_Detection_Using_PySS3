I am tired.I'm tired of lying. I feel lazy, completely useless. I want to escape my responsibilities. All the work I've ever known is schoolwork. I don't want to kill myself because I get bad grades or because I don't turn in my essays on time. The truth is I can't trust myself not to be a useless piece of shit. If I can't do my job in my current environment, how can I possibly become a trustworthy and useful member of society? All I do is disappoint my loved ones, making them suffer.
