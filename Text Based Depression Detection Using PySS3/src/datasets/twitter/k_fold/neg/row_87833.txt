.Turn 30 soon. have a child on the way in a few weeks. lost my job several months ago. about to lose my house. I think i should feel for my 1.5 kids. not really though. at least they'd have the house paid off with my life insurance. I'm not sure what i'm looking for here. should be talking to my wife about this. but i'm supposed to be strong for her too right?
