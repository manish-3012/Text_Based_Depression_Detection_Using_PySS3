i just drank the strongest bleach i could findi am ready to die, i have already drunk 2 gulps of bleach, the strongest one i found at the store, and all i felt was nausea and burning in my neck... i dont feel like im fainting, i dont feel like im about to die... but i want to die... i was shaking so much that i cant even explain it... i have a lot of reasons to end my life, and some are more reasonable than others, but they all hurt me as much... i have tried killing myself 3 times today. i dont usually get out of the house, but i did today, and i jumped in front of a car on my way home... the driver literally flipped me off and called me a stupid depressed teen, then left... when i came home i took a lot of pills, i overdosed on a lot of them... then, recently, i drank some bleach, and nope, it doesnt work either... so im gonna go to sleep soon since for me its evening, but if i do happen to wake up, i will just try dehydration since, you know, you cant live for long without water, and im prolly not gonna regret it at all, since i wont feel anything... so yeah, this might or might not be the last thing i ever typed in my entire life, but anyways, thank you for reading this and have a nice day...
