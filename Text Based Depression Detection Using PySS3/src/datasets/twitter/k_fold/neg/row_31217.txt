Sorry about thisHi everyone. 
I'm sorry to be posting like this. I don't really know what else to do. I've been mentally ill my whole life really. Diagnosed with a huge list of things (depression, anxiety blah blah blah). There has been a tragedy in my family and everything has just exploded. I can't work. I can't do basic life. I've tried counselling, psychiatrists, hospitals, tons of medication.. anything I can think of to make it better. But it doesn't get better. I've started to realize it never will.  I just.. don't know how to keep going? I'm at a stand still. I guess the reason I am posting is my boyfriend. I love him.. a ton. More than anything. I just don't want to hurt him and I know that if I don't make it, it will destroy him. This probably sounds incredibly scrambled so I'm sorry about that. I can't tell anyone how bad this is in my real life, because I have made attempts before and it scares everyone anytime I say anything remotely "depressed" sounding. So I'm telling you. I don't know what to do, or how to keep living, or if anything is ever going to change, or anything at all really. I feel like such a burden on everyone around me. I feel like everything I touch I destroy.. anyways. I'm sorry.
