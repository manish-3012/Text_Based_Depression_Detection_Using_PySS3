I feel purposeless and worthlessBasically the title.  I've lost all direction in life and now I'm simply trying to stay afloat.  But every day is exhausting to the limits of what I can handle, and nothing seems to help.  I just don't know how much longer I can do this, and tonight I want it all to end.



There is no good purpose for me to be here.   Any function I have could be filled by someone else who can do it better.  And there's no worth in me.  Who wants a broken, scarred, closed off and unstable person in their life?  There's a reason I use so much sarcasm.  It makes things look better to others.  But for once I just wish someone would see past that.




I'm tired, Reddit.  So very tired.  Goodnight, sleep well.
