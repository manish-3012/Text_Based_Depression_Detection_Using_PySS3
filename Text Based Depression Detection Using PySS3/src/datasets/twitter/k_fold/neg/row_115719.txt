No feelings, no loveok anyone who's reading I just want to tell u how I feel, i've tried to open up to family but its alot harder than i thought. first of all, tonight may have been my breaking point, i've had thoughts of taking my life over the past few years but always been too scared about doing it but tonight was different. i left my house around 12:30am after my mum asked me 'whats really going on in ur head please tell me' and i told her straight 'i dont want to be here anymore, life has no meaning to me i just want out' so i walked for like 15 mins before my younger brother came sprinting after me and for the first time in my life he hugged and said 'im not losing you please come home' for a minute i felt so selfish and then instantly went back to mind numbing state i've been in for the past few months. i was no longer scared of ending it all, i've got passed the point of caring in all honesty. i have 1 friend in my life who i hardly see or speak to. im a recluse to my whole family, i dont speak to anyone about anything i'm trapped in a bubble sort of speak. just to add to this, i dont feel like i love anything and i dont feel loved. when my mum told me she loved me tonight i didnt know how to respond cos i havent felt love in years so its foreign to me. life feels like a game and i feel like i've lost. thanks to anyone who read.
