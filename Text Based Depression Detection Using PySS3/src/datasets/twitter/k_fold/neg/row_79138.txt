My life is a misery.I honestly need help. To sum it up, my mother is an alcoholic. Every day of my life is a misery. She is either drunk or toxic. She is very abusive and even worse, my dad supplies her with it. I am already struggling seeing as I have lost my bff and I am struggling with school. I even dont have a future since I need to get a job to support her or I need to be married off to a older man for money.. I think I will kill myself...
