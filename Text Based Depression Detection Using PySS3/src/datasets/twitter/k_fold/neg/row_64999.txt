I think I'm going to end things tonight.I'm exhausted. I'm tired of fighting, tired of putting on a mask every single day. I'm tired of pretending to be ok when in fact I'm not. I'm tired of trying to get help as it appears it's been more difficult to get help than it fucking should be. It's as if this world is telling me I shouldn't be here. Maybe they are right. When I finish work tonight I'm fairly certain I'm going to end my life. God why can't this pain just end fucking why! Thanks for listening guys...
