My fiancee, I guess...Ex-Fiancee broke my heart today and won't let me take our child home.My fiancee and I have had some Relationship issues lately, but looking back it was just a toxic relationship that I gave my last 3 years for, and now I have a child whom she's probably going to keep from me....

Fast forward to a couple hours ago, we were at her mom's house, she had just broken things off with me and while I was gathering my things they decided that I wasn't calm enough to take my daughter. So they came rushing at me to take her, of course flight or fight kicks in and I bolt out the door into the rain with my daughter without proper clothing for her. 

She calls the Cops on me, tells them that I took the child. Her mother comes chasing me through a neighbors yard and the neighbor dude got to me right as my Monster In Law was physically grabbing me to take her away. Dude neighbor Pat's me on my back and tells me he understands the situation but it's not the way to go about it and that I wasn't in any trouble because I hadn't done anything that warranted them being called in the first place. He gives me his coat for my daughter and invited me in, and talked to me about things. I told him about how I cook two or three meals a day, wake up at 6 AM and watch my daughter while she sleeps till noon.

His response...

"You know you wanted to marry a real bitch don't you?"

"Her mother never made them do anything."

They fed my daughter a muffin today, from 6 am until 3 or 4, that's all. So now she's stuck there without me to help her and I feel heartbroken over her but also my fiancee. I gave 3 years of my life supporting her professional dreams....

I just feel lonely.
