im 16,well this is my first time posting on reddit. itâ€™s 11:05 in the uk, camhs is closed and any other means of me getting help via messaging is closed. i donâ€™t wanna call anything bc my mum will hear me and question me. sheâ€™s not abusive or anything just a bit drunk and we had a mini disagreement. iâ€™ve been crying for about an hour after it. thereâ€™s a lot going on in my life. my gran is dying, iâ€™m stuck inside and canâ€™t see my closest friend, iâ€™m suicidal. iâ€™m getting tested for autism but, like what relevance does that have? iâ€™ve only been here for 16 years but fucking hell, this place is pretty shit. like i get people will be upset that iâ€™m gone but like i donâ€™t know. i cant keep doing this anymore, i donâ€™t feel safe around myself. i know where all the medication is kept and i could easily just go swallow it all now if i wanted. i live near the beach so i could throw myself into the sea, im a bad swimmer too so itâ€™s pretty much a definite that iâ€™ll drown. i want to go but i also donâ€™t at the same time if that makes sense. i donâ€™t want my loved ones to be sad. i donâ€™t want my dog to be sad and confused, waiting for me to come home. my family is already about to have one death so maybe two would be too much? 

if anyone has any advice to help out, or just anything to say in regards to my post. comment. just donâ€™t be mean, clearly i canâ€™t take that.
