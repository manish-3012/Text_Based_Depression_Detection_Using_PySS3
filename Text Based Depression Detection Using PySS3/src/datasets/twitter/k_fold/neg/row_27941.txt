No one understandsLast week my best friend, the only person who understands my ongoing struggle with depression and self harm, told me wishes he had never met me and that his life would have been so much better now if he didn't have to put up with me. I feel so alone and worthless and i dont think i want to live anymore because even though im surrounded by my family and friends who i know all care about me, i dont feel comfortable with confiding in anyone else or those i have confided in dont understand and tell me i dont need him or to just be happy. I dont want this anymore, please help me.
