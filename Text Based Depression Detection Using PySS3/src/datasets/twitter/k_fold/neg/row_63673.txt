Boyfriend just broke it off. Now I really need to go.Chronic anxiety and depression here. Also possible borderline personality disorder. Was in a relationship for 2 1/2 years. Boyfriend just broke it off (I just got home from work...we work at the same job. Broke it off in the car.) after a long time of him being very forgiving and patient with me, more than anyone else. I can't blame him for finally thinking for himself.

I'm numb now. He was my support system when I had my suicidal episodes. I'm putting in my two weeks tomorrow, and from then on I'll figure out a good time to do this. In the meantime, I'll beat myself up and starve myself like I used to. I deserved all of this and I'm sorry for hurting you, especially when you were the only one who stood by me through everything. I should be focusing on winning you back, but I'm focusing on offing myself instead. You were completely right about everything.

You deserve better and I love you. Don't be mad at me when you find out.

Update: Went from numb to crying. Fuck.
