alonei am writing this drunk right now

its my birthday today 

i havent been to a normal school for 2 years now since i was 16, im 18 now

the past 1 and a half years i have been alone

the past 4 months i was in a mental hospital, because i didnt attend school, due to depression

i have written an application to every school in my proximity 

they all declined

the loneliness is taking a huge toll on my mental health 

yet not even the authorities are able to find me a place in a school

i have been thinking alot about leaving society and living far away,

since noone seems to care about me anyway

i dont know what to do

it all seems so hopeless
