10 more months.I'm gonna give it until the end of the year, I'm gonna try my best, go back to therapy, take medication again, exercise and eat healthy n all that shit. But if it isn't better by new years eve I'm done. It's been 5 years of panic attacks day in and day out, and a lifetime of mental illness before that. I can't even escape the panic attacks in my sleep because they wake me up, i can't handle it anymore. just one more year.
