I want to die.Er, I'm actually not fully confident in that regard... yet. Well, I do. I dunno. If I didn't have a family I would've already, I think. But still not sure how I'd go about accomplishing something like that -- something so final. I miss my old life. Things were good. I'm looking for a way out, I guess. I got a new car recently, so that makes CO poisoning difficult. Can't just park it and go to sleep. That'd be a nice way to go; put on my favorite record... hmm.... it'd be a toss up between Neil Young's 'Tonight's the Night' and The Band's 'Music From Big Pink.' Game-time decision-type material. I'd roll a big joint. Ah, cannabis -- one earthly pleasure on a short list of things I will miss dearly in the afterlife. I'd have a glass of bourbon, too. My family would cry. K would cry, and M too. Who knows, maybe B, R, G? I have a handful of close friends and old loves... they've been good to me, and I'd miss them. I can't see the light anymore... it's really no way to live. It's as if Fortuna, herself, has seen to it my wheel is oriented southward permanently. How else? I need something with no room for error, and I'd prefer not to leave a mess... that's just not decent. Just a fraction of a blip on a spec on an orb in spacetime in....? What happens after you croak? I wanna know. But I need a good exit plan -- something foolproof. I'd like to say goodbye to old friends and family first. I'd like to hold K one more time, but I don't think that will ever happen. I need a way out of this horrible fucking hellhole dump, piece of shit product of chemical reactions... thermodynamism -- meat bags. The first step is outlining the first step in a block of rambling brainvomit.
