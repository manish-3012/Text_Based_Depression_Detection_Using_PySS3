I want to erase my existenceI have had depression for many years. Tried numerous suicide attempts when I was 13-14, but failed. Now I am 18, and I have learnt how not to fail it. But the only thing left is, I don't wanna die. I wanna disappear. I have lost bonds with everyone including my family. I have lost all purpose of life. Can't even try new things, because everything needs money. My family barely makes it by. I don't how to get rid of these constant feeling. I surely have a little hope left that takes me through each day. I just want help before that hope dies out too.
