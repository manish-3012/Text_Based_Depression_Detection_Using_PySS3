I need helpI don't know where else to ask this...   
I haven't been feeling well and sometimes it becomes too much to bare. And I know that in the near future, things will only get worse.  
If it were to become too much, I need a way out. I'm not scared and I've made my peace with it but... I don't want it to hurt. The only solution I see would be an overdose (What drugs/medication and how much/quantity)  
I'm not writing this because I need someone to talk to or hear how "it'll get better", so please don't...  
Help with it would be nice
