I know I need help but it will ruin my life and Iâ€™d rather just die.Iâ€™ve been suicidal for over a decade. Every day I tell myself to just push through and keep going but nothing ever gets better. Iâ€™m in college now and I have so, so much work. I have no friends and every day I want to die. I know Iâ€™m either going to have to get help or kill myself. If I take time off to get help, my college path is over and Iâ€™ll never be able to recover the time I lost. My career will be dead before itâ€™s started and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll even want to be alive knowing how much Iâ€™ve missed out on. I donâ€™t know what to do.
