The Restorative Power of CryingHey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to share my experience.

I was under severe depression.... rock bottom, the lowest point of my life since ever. And it had been that way for about 2years. At some point when I was alone in my room I just cried, and I mean CRIED.... not just a drop of tear here and there, I was bawling... snot in my nose flowing out....  I had to use a bunch of tissue just to clean my face...

Surprisingly, post-cry I felt much better... a lot of the pain was alleviated even if it's temporary.... The pain had been a part of my life for a long time so that caught me off guard.... 

Now, I'm a guy and the society around me where I live pretty much rule out crying for male adult... under no circumstances you're allowed to cry... just keep it down.... So the last time I cried was basically perhaps Middle School or younger even... I've been expected to keep it all bottled up....  I'd say bullshit..... this expectation for stoicism from society is just another of those pressure that people put on us... don't listen to it...

&amp;#x200B;

So I just want to leave my story here.... if you are under a lot of pain, maybe you can try locking your room and just cry... alone... and I mean let it all out.... you might find it beneficial if only temporarily...

Obviously crying didn't solve my problem... the mountain of problems I had were (are) still there...  I was just able to find temporary refuge... brief... but very much needed for me....

Anyone else have similar experience? I'm interested to hear....
