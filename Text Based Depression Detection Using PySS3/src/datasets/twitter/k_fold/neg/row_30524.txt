Going to hell for commiting suicide, why?I'm not going to lie, I am very afraid of being damned in the afterlife. At the same time, I'm very tired of everything. There's nothing here for me anymore, my whole life has been nothing but misery and disaster and this very week has been a turn for the fucking worst. But why? Why would I have to suffer forever? I just want nothingness, no concience, just pitch black. Is that so much to ask for? There is no redeeming myself anymore and even if by some miracle there was, I don't want to anymore. I give up, life is so horrible.
