Why should I even bother staying alive?It's a waste of time. The end result is the same anyways.

I'm not smart, I'm not good-looking, I'm not physically fit, and I'm a social sperg. I have nothing going for me. My only hope at a relatively comfortable life is working my ass off in uni so I can get a job where I can work my ass off for another few decades before I die. Why the fuck should I bother? It makes no sense.
