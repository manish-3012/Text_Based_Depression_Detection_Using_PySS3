Dropped out of university three years ago but managed to land myself into an ok job. I just started and want to kill myself already.I only just started last Monday and already on every commute to work I feel like getting off on an earlier station and taking another train to a place called Beachy Head (a 600m cliff in the UK). I fall asleep whilst planning the trip because it's comforting.
The worst feeling is about 7pm after I finish and I'm already counting down the hours until I have to go back to sleep and go again in the morning. 

I have already proven that I cannot finish university and if I throw in the towel on my first proper placement I think I'll be considered an absolute failure. I'd rather kill myself than have to disappoint my mother again. My family isn't in poverty but we only just scrape by, this was supposed to be a relief for her to stop working strenuous jobs. I can tell it will not last long as she is starting to see GPs regarding pain in her shoulders from working. I cannot believe I'm letting her down so early on.
