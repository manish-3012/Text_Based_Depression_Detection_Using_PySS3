Living with an emotionally abusive person and an enabler mother is great :)It really makes you feel awesome when your mom starts falling in love with a guy who is a total deadbeat prick and then 2 years later she let's him psychologically abuse you as much as he wants. She wonders why both of his kids have zero contact with him now, because she completely looks past his horrible behaviour. One time after he started yelling at me and lecturing me for a really minor thing like throwing away expired food he still wanted to cook my mom told me: "When you find the one you really love in life, there are going to be 10 things about them you love, and 10 things about them you hate. Those 10 things about them could be the most horrible things to you, but they are all tolerable because of how much you love them" that sounded really manipulative to me and like she was okay with being yelled at by him. She gets the abuse too but she enables it, she always defends him whenever I bring this up by saying things like: "He's just going through a hard time right now" or "He grew up in a bad household, have some sympathy".

I'm so fucking tired of it, I could go on and on. Sometimes he is not such a bad guy, we laugh a lot and I know he loves my mom but he treats us like shit and doesn't respect us 70% of the time which my mom is okay with. It makes me want to harm myself (I did just now) and even makes me feel depressed to the point of being suicidal. I'm sick of him and I honestly don't know why my mom feels like she needs him in her life.
