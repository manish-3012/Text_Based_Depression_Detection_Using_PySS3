This life has become meaninglessIve never been the happiest person but the person who claims to love me the most has made me hate life more than I ever thought possible.  I'm so fucking tired and done. I found a nice tree to hang from. I hope they don't cutt it down when I'm done . "My favorite lake spot .where is your god?"
