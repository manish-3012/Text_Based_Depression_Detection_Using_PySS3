I don't have any friends anymoreI live in a fairly small town in England. I go to a private school where the classes are tiny. Meeting NEW friends isn't an option because everyone knows everyone, and everyone has their groups. I have mine, but I never do anything with them, I never meet up with them. Often, they may meet up with each other or they'll have friends outside of school, so it doesn't matter for them. Me? I have nobody outside (locally at least) that I can go to for advice, or hang out with when I'm bored. I used to, but I left them for this group, and whilst I don't regret it at all (this old group treated me like shit fyi), I miss the fun I had. I can't see myself being happy and everything feels like a blur. No therapist can fix this, there's nothing for me here. Help me please, I'm so fucking alone and miserable. I want to die.
