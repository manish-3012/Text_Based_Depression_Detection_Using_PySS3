Please help! My life is crumbling around meMy partner of over ten years just told me for several hours to never come back and to leave her life forever. Drugs and alcoholl were a major influence in the series of events that led to this. I have bawled my eyes out untill she fell asleep. Before she fell asleep she said dont expect me to change my mind when I wake up. I was given one choice. Leave within 48 hours with all my things or go to jail. PLEASE HELP ME. I am scared and utterly shattered throughout my entire being. I have no idea what to even say, I can't even look at her without wailing. And she is now asleep. So I'm reaching out to the world, anyone everyone, please help me. My apologies were all 'noted', 'but not cared about'. I am having an existential and midlife crisis all at once. I am seriously contemplaring suicide and that scares me, because I know that this time will be the very last time. I have nothing to live for without her in my life. My entire 'estate'/(will) is dedicated to her, so at least she will be compensated for breaking her heart. The love of my life, my best friend and my soul mate, my entire life is crumbling around me and I feel like im sinking and cant stop from drowning.
