I hate my lifeI havenâ€™t slept properly for 19 hours so my head is in pain. Iâ€™ve been stressed lately and disappointed with myself, and it probably made me depressed (idk, Iâ€™m not diagnosed). Thereâ€™s nothing serious I need to be worried about right now. But Iâ€™m so unsatisfied with myself and my life. The only things stopping me from killing myself are fear of not going to Heaven and a sliver of hope that things will get better. Iâ€™m sick of living like this. I need a break. I want to go home.
