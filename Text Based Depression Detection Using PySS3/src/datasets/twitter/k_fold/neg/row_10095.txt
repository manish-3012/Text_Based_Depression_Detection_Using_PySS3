Why liveMaybe find things in life that make it worth living:

Small things like smelling the midsummer breeze or gazing up at the starry night sky. Imagine youâ€™re one of those twinkling stars, full of light. Imagine someone sitting far away in Antarctica, looking up and whispering: â€œthat star is important to me, that star is beautiful to me, that star made my life worth livingâ€. If that star disappeared, the sky would be less twinkly, and someone will care. Maybe you donâ€™t feel important now, maybe you donâ€™t feel like thereâ€™s any meaning to life now, although in the future, you could be the brightest star in the sky.

...Big things like picking up a new hobby or discovering something waiting to be discovered.

Why live? Because you havenâ€™t seen all the skies the universe has to offer, or found the treasure at the end of the rainbow yet. Because you havenâ€™t tasted all the terrible or tasty tastes to be tasted. Because you havenâ€™t felt everything to feel: from the water, frolicking and foamy at the end of a stream. To the fur of a cat, cunning and soft. To the hot sand by the shore between your curious toes. To the feeling of the wind dancing cheerily on your cheek. Because you havenâ€™t smelt every smell. 
The smell of Autumn 
The smell of Winter 
The smell of Spring 
The smell of Summer 
The smell of Life.

And if you canâ€™t see, taste, feel or smell, you can love.

Maybe itâ€™s silly but I love/live to garden. To draw. To read. I want to help people in the future. I want to find my dream.

Maybe all you need is to find yours.
