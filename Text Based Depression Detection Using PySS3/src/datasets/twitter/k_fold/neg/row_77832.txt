am madIâ€™ve made a crap ton of mistakes in my life, I lied a LOT. Most of those just to make people feel bad for me or whatever. I guess I just wanted the comfort then, someone to agree with me. I have a mother which I hate maybe more than myself, a family that doesnâ€™t care, a horrid attitude, one disgusting face (luckily itâ€™s clean, but still overall ugly) and Iâ€™m dumb. I wanna kill myself, but like many others, Iâ€™m scared of it. I also just wanna take the piss outta my mom who is completely fine with me dying (perhaps because I make her feel too incompetent, not my fault youâ€™re a bad parent and worse at the internet). And to top it all off, Iâ€™ve made the maybe horrible decision to cut off all my irl friends. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be able to make any online ones either cause not only do I value keeping my info safe a LOT, iâ€™m also bad at making friends (surprise surprise, the suicidal good for nothing canâ€™t make friends). So Iâ€™m just stuck in a pit of suffering. You donâ€™t really need to comment, I just feel a bit happier knowing someone knows about how crappy everything in my life is (myself included). But on a lighter note I do have a fairly good way of life. I will admit by some miracle my grades are good, however in the real world Iâ€™d be utterly useless. I have a decent housing situation. I live in one of those fancy villages with gates everywhere and all those big homes and mansions, in general I would say we are quite lucky to be in the upper middle class where I live. So I also feel it would kind of be a waste to commit suicide. Like when you have all this great loot on your save in a game and all these buffs.

Thanks for reading all of this wonderful human (or whatever you are) :) have a cute little face
