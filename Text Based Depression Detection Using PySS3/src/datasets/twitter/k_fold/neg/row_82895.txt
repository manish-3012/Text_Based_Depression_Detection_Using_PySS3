I don't believe in help and don't really want itI've been having trouble with depression and anxiety for several years now. I quit my job last November (only had ot for a month and got it after I quit college, was an attempt to get better at the suggestion of family and friends telling me that a job would make me feel better - which it ended up doing the complete opposite, now I'm pretty terrified of socializing with humans), I quit college (stopped going, couldn't drop out of classes because of college policy so I ended up failing them all, I'm still enrolled but not taking courses and I assume if I ever get better and want to go back, they'll kick me out because I'm not taking classes and failed all courses last semester), and for the past couple of weeks I've lived every day suicidal and I can't really tell the only two people I ever talk to because they get mad at me. I don't really want to keep living. I've thought about running away from home, anything to get me away from everyone I know because I don't want to know anyone, I don't want anyone to know me. I've thought about getting help and have made a few calls or asked doctors but they refer me some place, who refers me some place, who tells me they don't have openings until 3 months from now. I don't think I can live that far on. Even if I were to get treatment it would be several months until I started to feel better, so it's not just 3 months, it's more than that. Plus I don't think I have the drive anymore to do the assignments a therapist or psychologist would give me.
