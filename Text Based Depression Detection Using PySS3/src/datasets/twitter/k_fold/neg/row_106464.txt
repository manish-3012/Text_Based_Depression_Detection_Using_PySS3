My boyfriend left me out of the blue, and I don't have anything to live for. Please help me.My boyfriend of nearly 6 years got a job opportunity halfway across the world. Instead of talking to me about it, he emailed me from the airplane and told me he would be gone indefinitely. I don't want to live. I don't know what to do. I need to talk to someone. I'm driving all of my friends away with my depression. Can someone please talk to me so I don't lose my friendships too?
