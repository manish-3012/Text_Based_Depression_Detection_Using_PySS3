I Really Can't Do This AnymoreI've about had it with living. I'm only 19, it's my first year of college, and I don't know how the fuck I am going to pay for my next semesters. I'd sell myself as a prostitute but I'm too ugly for that, my parents will probably cut me off financially, and I don't know how the fuck I will pay for all the student loans I will have to take out. My job is shit and I can't get a better one, and if I drop out then I definitely can't get a good job. I wish I was brave like one of my family friends who hung himself a few months ago, but I'm too much of a pussy. 

Sorry for all the cussing, I'm super stressed out and I have just had it.
