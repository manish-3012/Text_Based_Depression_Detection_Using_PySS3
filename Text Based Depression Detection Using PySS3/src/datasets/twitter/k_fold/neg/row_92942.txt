Vent-Iâ€™m hurtingIâ€™ve struggled with thoughts of suicide since I was 13/14 years old, and at the time I didnâ€™t understand it. Today at 25, I still struggle. Iâ€™ve lost two family members to it, and at least 6 other people to it. 
Last week I lost my ex. He was everything to me. We knew each other inside/out. I took down every wall with him. He always told me he wouldnâ€™t leave me (in the sense of suicide)..heâ€™s had some trauma throughout his life thatâ€™s caused him to constantly battle demons. And I should have seen the signs and I just was oblivious because Iâ€™ve been upset with him. 

Now. I feel guilty. And I havenâ€™t felt well myself for a long time and itâ€™s so tempting. 
Iâ€™m trying so hard not to give into the thought, but that voice in your head that asks you when does it get better? That ache in your heart from no longer feeling any happiness itâ€™s so hard to keep going. 
Iâ€™ve been having almost manic episodes since heâ€™s been gone, and covering it up like itâ€™s nothing when deep inside Iâ€™m dying. Iâ€™m broken. 
I canâ€™t feel this pain anymore I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m not strong enough, I havenâ€™t been strong enough ever.
