Don't see any point anymoreFor a while now I've been dealing with depression. It hasn't been officially diagnosed because I'm a minor and my family doesn't believe me when I tell them about how much I struggle just to climb out of bed in the morning. I don't take any meds, though I have had people offer to sell me some. Throughout my entire life I've been in love with three girls. None of them shared the feelings, though. The first one was a very close friend of mine, we haven't spoken in roughly seven years. The second girl was another friend, we still talk and I've moved on, but evertime I see her I get a small pain in my chest. And finally the third girl is a fellow student at my High School. I've refrained from telling her how I feel due to my fear of rejection. Last night a friend of mine, that is also a friend of this girl's, told me that she interested in members of her own gender rather than people like me. Hearing that I have absolutely no chance with a girl that I love made my depression that much worse. I can't stop thinking about ending my life. I've though about the consequences of doing this, but the pros far outweigh the cons. The only thing keeping me from doing it is my fear that I'll fail at it and will spend the rest of my life in eternal pain. Any thoughts?
