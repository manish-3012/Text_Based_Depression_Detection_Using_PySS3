GoSummer is in full swing here now, and just as expected - i just want to dissappear. I dont want to be a part of this. I dont want to watch the sunnshine bright, the park full of people laughing and playing, people at the beach, hiking with their friends, having small parties with their friend group - just to be reminded i dont have a single friend or anyone for that matter that i can do anything with.

Im stuck inside the house 24/7, because i do not want to do anything by myself, just the thought of that while knowing people are with their friends breaks my heart so bad. Ive lost all will to live ever since i was left on my own. And to anyone who just wants to say it get better, please save your energy. I dont care, im done with life and ive been done for so fucking long. I just want it to be over.
