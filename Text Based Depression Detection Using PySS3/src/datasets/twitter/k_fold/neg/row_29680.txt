I'm done caring for peopleI'm done taking crap everyday. I'm done taking care of other people, especially my husband, who doesn't even care about me. This depression, anxiety and endless thinking and counting is killing me inside. I want to be at peace. I want to move to another country to startstartl over again. I'm patiently waiting for that to happen. If not, I'm totally done with this life I have. One final straw and I'm giving up this tiring life of mine. 

No one witll bat an eye. I'm angry and feeling helpless in everything.
