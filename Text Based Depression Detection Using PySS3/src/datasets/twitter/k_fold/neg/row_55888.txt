This is itI've been recently informed that I've been expelled out of my school. My mom is pissed and soon she'll be telling her boyfriend which will lead to me getting mega fucked. She dropped out of her college due to this. I have no motivation to keep going and find a new school. All I want to do is sit and rot away. I am nothing but a nuisance to my parents and frankly they don't care. This is the pinnacle of sitting in this absolute rut I've been in for the past 5 years and I know I won't make it to my birthday, which is in a month. I've already killed myself mentally, it's time I finish it all up
