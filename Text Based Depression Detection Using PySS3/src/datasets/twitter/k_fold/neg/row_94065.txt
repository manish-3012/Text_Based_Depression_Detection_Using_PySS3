I can't tell if my chest hurts from crying or because I'm getting sickLife just keeps on getting worse and I tell myself every waking moment that I can't give up. That I need to bear this pain, alone and for as long as I have to till I fulfill my goals. Even if that means crying every night and becoming a fucking mess... As long as I put on brave face to the world, nothing matters. Because no one wants to hear about how you feel like shit and I accept that. No one wants to care and that's on me. Not on others.
