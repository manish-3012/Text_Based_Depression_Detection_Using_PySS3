idk how to keep doing thisthers so much pain i just keep wishhing it didnt have to be like this. i try everyday to stop this madness but i cant get out of it. its been months since i was happy. maybe even years. and all this plain is so hard to deal with i just want it to go away. cant someone lie to me and tell me im important? that im valued? i forget what it feels like for others to actually be cared for by someone else
