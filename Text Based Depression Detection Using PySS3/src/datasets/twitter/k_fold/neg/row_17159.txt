I Feel Like Iâ€™m DyingWhat the title says. Iâ€™ve been struggling for a long time with what I thought was depression, and got put on antidepressants which caused my brain to OD on serotonin (because my diagnosis was recently changed to bipolar with general anxiety and antidepressants and bipolar donâ€™t mix). But the antidepressants made me suicidal and I got a citation for public intoxication because I threw up  after mixing enough pills and alcohol to kill me and I was in public saying goodbye to my friend. This was a couple months ago. 
Now I canâ€™t be a lawyer and I literally feel like Iâ€™m dying. Like Iâ€™m tearing apart from the inside. I told my therapist about it yesterday but I donâ€™t think she understood what I meant when I said it feels like Iâ€™m dying. I can literally feel my atoms shredding apart. Literally everything hurts. I just wanted to help but I canâ€™t and I wonâ€™t. And Iâ€™ve done so many bad things in my life (both things only I know about and also some public outbursts as a result of my untreated bipolar during a lengthy dissociative episode) that Iâ€™m likely unemployable. Iâ€™m just dying and I want this feeling to stop.
