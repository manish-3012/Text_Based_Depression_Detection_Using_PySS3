I'm Killing Myself Tonight because I won't ImproveI don't want to be understood, just dead.  Understanding helps for an hour, but then the suicidal thoughts come back.  The only thing that might stop this is not being stuck the way I am, but that's been shown to be impossible.  I've tried getting help from therapists, doctors, friends, but they don't do anything.  If it's all the same, I'll be checking out tonight.  Goodbye.
