What else is there?**A LIFE WORTH LIVING**

I don't speak to my family. Either family sees me as "the fuck-up", or they are trying to break me down, or both. My dad still reaches out, but things between him and me never stay healthy for long.

My friends are gone. I wouldn't even know how to get them back. When they reach out, I just don't know what to say, what they expect from me, or how to help. And why bother making new friends? It always comes to an end anyway.

I used to have a dog, but now he lives with my mom. My boyfriend and I don't want to get a dog until our living conditions are better. I don't think that day will come.

No job, no career, no money. I've have many jobs and many beginnings of careers. Nothing sticks.

**TO LIVE WOULD BE AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE**

My passions are long gone. My skills have degenerated. I no longer have the muscle memory to do the things that brought me joy. At this point, I can't even remember what they were, or why it felt good.

I try to help others, but it always backfires. I give too much, I try too hard, I expect too much thanks... but mostly, I just do the wrong things. Recently, a man (whom I loved very much) died because I wanted to "help".

All I can give is pain, and all I remember is pain, and all I can derive from relationships is pain... and I *know* that there is another way, a better way, of living my life... but I can't get there. And I don't think I ever will. In my entire life, disappointment and isolation is all I've known. It's been decades of consistent pointlessness.

**PEOPLE CHANGE, TIME HEALS ALL**

I give up so easily. And I try to cheer myself on to try again. But my inner cheerleader is so weak, feeble, and tired. 

For many weeks, and especially in the past few days, I've been building up the strength to persist and hold onto whatever faith/hope I have left. I've been practicing a good attitude, or at least trying to establish goals/routines again in the face of futile odds and utter chaos. 

**LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT**

Today, a little trinket that my mother gave me a few years ago fell and broke. Knowing that her and I have no future together, and that all I have now is all that I'll ever have of her, it broke me - I spiraled quickly into despair and gave up on the day early on. I've been crying most of the day. I went to my boyfriend, the only lifeline that I have left in the world, and told him I didn't want to live anymore. He point-blank told me that he was tired of hearing it, and that if I was going to kill myself, that it was time that I just did it. He told me to kill myself, if that's what I was feeling like doing.

I don't blame him. It's tiresome just LIVING like this, I can't imagine having to hear about it from the person you live with. And honestly, I can't keep putting him (or myself) through this. There's a pattern of ruination etched into my personality. My behavior is on a looped track. My attempts at change are short-lived. Time to shit or get off the pot. My life is not just my own; what I do affects those around me. If I can't be/do better for myself or for others, then I need to be/do the best *I* can. It's not much, but it's all I've got left; the greatest gift I can give is my absence. I ought to relieve myself, too.

Hugs and smiles do nothing for me anymore. I want for nothing, but to die.

**TL;DR:** Nothing to live for. Consistently hurting others. Joyless and tired.
