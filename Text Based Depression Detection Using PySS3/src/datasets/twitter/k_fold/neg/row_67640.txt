Why do I get so emotional and depressed suddenly?I may be having a good day or just chill and start having these fucking thoughts and I have no idea where they come from sometimes.

i do not have depression or any mood disorders, I do have a lot of symptoms but both me and my therapist think is not a mood disorder
