So confused with everything, the world is dark.So i am 16m, and i dont see myself as one to commit suicide. But as i move forward in highschool and my social life, im worried that i might make the choice to do so at a low point. One of the things that kinda scares me is that my myers briggs personality type is an ENFP, it helps to understand what that means to really get an idea of whats happening in my life. Im very optimistic and confident around other people, but being by myself combined with my mother putting stress on me, i have outburst of depression. I have never cut and dont believe in any way i ever will. But ofter suicide seems like a goodish option. Ive heard all the "think about ur family" stuff and that is a huge deterrent for me but im still skeptical of that phylosify as it seems pretty much like ur ignoreing ur own need if u get what i mean. I dont have any friends and am not nor have i ever been in a relationship(just havent found anyone that i cwould enjoy being with) to my dismay. I just wanna fit in, but i dont want to loose my individuality, another one of my issues. I have not talked to any person other than people on the internet, and i dont plan nor want to do so. Another thing is that i have access to firearms. Im comforted by the fact that they are within my reach(in a glass cabinet that im sure i could easily get into with or without the key)(my father keeps the majority in a big safe but they dont all fit), but i understand their capability. I dont ever see having a future where i dont have tons of regret. I want to have a live in a van tour lifestyle, but ill be poor and loveless and most likely lonley. Ild love to be an athlete but that is very unlikely at all. And i kinda want to settle down but ill regret not doing more, and will not be satisfied with whichever job i choose to do(assuming ill make it through school(again it helps to understand enfp)). Its the catch-22 of my existance. And doesnt all seem like it would be better if i didnt have to bother with it, ive had plenty of happy moments, and 16 years is already a very long time, i dont think i could handle living and just watching my life whisk away in front of my eyes. The world sucks in truth, people cant get over the color of other people. But their is so much beauty... Well i know i have no chance of seeing it. I dont have unlimited money... The ugly is everywhere, beauty is found in the most remote places. I have nothing to offer this world. Ive just been moping through each day. Acting as if im a perfectly satisfied lazy teenager. I look at how some people see me, some really look up to me, and some look at me in disgust. I dont want to be around either of them. I dont even know if i truly want the responsiblity of having friends. But i desire them from deep inside. With the size of this world and some spend it all in the same town.                                                                                                               I dont know what i want
