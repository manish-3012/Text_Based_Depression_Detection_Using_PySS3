Not Mentally My Age, I'm 15 but sometimes feel 2-5 years old, other times I feel 25 years old.I Grew up way to quickly Man, I have to always help my parents with their issues since my dad starts fights and I get the aftermath of comforting My Mom, I've tried having her leave him so many times but she won't, then I'll feel bad cause my Dad will do something nice.
I feel as though I'm taking care of two 12 year old siblings. 

Then at Night I fall into this deep depressing state and just want someone to Pick me up and shush me into a deep sleep, or just talk with me like I'm an Infant.

The hell is wrong with me, I'm pathetic and Being a Guy makes it 100% Worse In my Case, Can't even reach out since I have no Real life friends, so I'm just typing down my Pathetic Troubles here.
