idkI'm kind of new to this. I've only told one other person I want to kill myself, and I think about it all the time. I'm a teacher and I'm pretty sure the only thing keeping me alive is how they would have to explain why I'm not their teacher anymore. That breaks my heart, but I have thought about this intensely even though I have never attempted anything. It just feels like that's what's supposed to happen to me, I don't have any other purpose, I'm not extremely talented, gifted, loved. I don't know but it's definitely kind of weird and helpful to see so many other people feeling the same as I do.
