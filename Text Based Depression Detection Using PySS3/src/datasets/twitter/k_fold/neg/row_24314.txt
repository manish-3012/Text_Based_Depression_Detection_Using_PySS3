Nothing helps anymoreI've been in the last few years been feeling more and more useless, I feel like a burden on my family and the few friends who stuck around, I can't make any new friends and most people avoid talking to me for months on end. I keep foaling at what ever I do. I even fail at the shitty simple jobs and I fear keavi g my house most days for people seeing and knowing how shit I am. I've been on medication and all sorts of treatments and therapies and it's doesn't work, I just always come back to my hopeless and death seeking state, I just want to die but when ever I attempt I keep living, I have gone through almost all the ways I can't think of, I feel so alone in this world, I feel like a evil parasite that destroys all its touches but the world is now slowly killing off and  I think that all the people at my uni and city might be right and the world would be better off with me dead.
