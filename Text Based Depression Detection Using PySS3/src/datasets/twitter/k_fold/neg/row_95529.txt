LOVE &amp; DEATH I WANNA DIEMy Gf is pushing me towards suicide, sheâ€™s getting me mad on purpose everyday and i tell her that i wanna kill myself because sheâ€™s literally hurting me emotionally, sheâ€™s lying to me and hiding shit from me i donâ€™t trust her, she threatens me and i donâ€™t feel safe anymore i feel like i canâ€™t escape from her. Sheâ€™s really trying to kill me because she keeps breaking my heart and fucking me over and i canâ€™t leave, sheâ€™s emotionally abusive she makes me feel like scum saying youâ€™ll never be with anyone else but me iâ€™m the only person who will love you and makes me feel worthless makes me question if living is even worth it. Fuck love because i feel so used an manipulated by her, i give her my heart and all she says is that i donâ€™t love her which just breaks me, she constantly tells me iâ€™m not enough for her and that she wants guy friends i canâ€™t love anyone else but her because sheâ€™s brought down my self esteem, every time i try opening up to her she shows little respect and makes me shut up, i tell her i wanna kms everyday and i just need to talk to her but all she has to say is stop being selfish but how am i being selfish when i just need her attention. Sheâ€™s made me cut off everyone in my life and iâ€™m trapped, i feel like death is the only option
