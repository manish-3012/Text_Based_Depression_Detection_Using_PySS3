Iâ€™ve written the goodbyes.Iâ€™m not really sure how it got to this point. Iâ€™m not really sure when exactly it got so bad, but I have spent the last hour obsessing over killing myself. I have written out letters and goodbye texts, ready to send as soon as Iâ€™m ready to go through with it. 
The worst part is that I know Iâ€™m gonna hurt people if I end it. I know how selfish it is, to end my hurt by piling pain onto other people, people I love. 
I have tried, for so long, to be okay enough to not hurt them, to not worry them. But I donâ€™t think I can keep doing this. I donâ€™t think I can keep up the facade, or even make through another day. I donâ€™t have the energy anymore. 
I donâ€™t want to hurt them. Iâ€™ve started pushing them away because I know itâ€™ll numb it a little, if I let go first. But then everything seems so final, because Iâ€™ve burned bridges and ended friendships I thought would last, cut people off I thought I would have for decades. Those were the people who made it bearable, even if it was just for 30 minutes, and then every bad thought took hold again, and I pushed them so hard out of my life theyâ€™ve locked me out of theirs. 
I want to be okay. It would all be so much easier if it was possible to be okay, but i dont think thatâ€™s in the cards for me, Iâ€™m always going to feel this way, and I thought it would get easier to deal with. But it wont ever be easier. Itâ€™s always going to be a weight around my ankles, pulling me deeper, and into darker waters. No light has made it to where Iâ€™m at now, and Iâ€™m terrified to go further. I think Iâ€™d rather just drown.
