I donâ€™t fear death, and Iâ€™m steadily running out of reasons to avoid it.I find death almost beautiful in a strange sort of way, no more pain, suffering or anything else in that category, it sounds wonderful to me. Iâ€™ve struggled with my desire to end it all in the hope that life will eventually get better, but every time I find myself asking if any of it is worth it in the end. I know that I should keep going for myself and for those around me but the truth is the more I think about death, the more fascinated and excited I become about it. Iâ€™m not sure what the point of this post is, I suppose I just wanted to express my feelings in a place where I wouldnâ€™t be judged as insane.
