My friend is suicidal - How do I help her through this?I have posted this on r/depression aswell, but I want to get as much feedback as possible.

So, a little backstory: We have been friends for about 8 years and we can talk about almost anything, if not anything. She has always had a tendency of self-harming, like in her pre-teen years she would cut herself with scalpels. Two years ago, her sister passed away and it destroyed her. Unfortunatelly, we lost touch during this time so I couldn't be there for her, but we've recently found our way back to each other.

She has told me she's had a relapse of hurting herself, cutting herself, punching walls, even planning her own suicide (setting a date), but couldn't go through with it because, according to her, she wouldn't know how to. We can talk about these things, but I want to know more of how I can comfort her? Have you gone through something similar? How did you cope with it? What did you find comforting? How can I help her through this?

It's not as severe today, but I fear that she might fall back into the vicious circle of grief that is depression.

I have been suicidal myself, so I want to believe that I know how to confront and converse about these kinds of things, but external input can only be a good thing.

I appreciate all feedback I can get on this.
