I keep being told I deserve to dieâ€œYou donâ€™t try hard enoughâ€

â€œYou must like being miserableâ€

â€œThis is all your faultâ€

Thatâ€™s all I hear. People want me to die. Theyâ€™re egging me on. I can tell. All I want is to give people what they want so they love me. Iâ€™ll never be able to experience love while alive. Iâ€™ll never be loved in any capacity and Iâ€™ve never been loved by anybody before. Iâ€™m too subhuman.
