Is it bad I want to kill myself?Is it *really* bad that I want to end my life? No one cares about me, and would probably only pretend to be sad if I died. Most of the time I'm a depressed shell of a person, with friends who give no fucks about me, and a family who only insults me and makes me feel self-conscious. I've thought about just leaving everything behind, and going to start a new life, but I'm too much of a coward to do that. So the only other option is to end everything. I'm never happy anyways.
