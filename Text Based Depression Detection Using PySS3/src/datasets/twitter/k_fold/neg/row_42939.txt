I can't handle this prison anymoreThe prison of my mind. Struggling with severe OCD, anxiety, and now an eating disorder. Everything in my life should point to me being happy. Except my fucking mind. Is this all some sick joke? But no, assisted suicide is only okay for the physically ill. If someone like me who "just needs to stop worrying so much" wants to end the suffering, we are selfish. Everyone ELSE is selfish for making me feel that way! I have spent my entire life helping people and making others happy.   I can't live in this world anymore.
