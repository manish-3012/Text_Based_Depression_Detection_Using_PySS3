Call with momJust had a lengthy call with my mom which was nice.  She was in a meeting but she let me cry for an hour straight over the phone.  Gotta love mom.  But i feel like i let her down.  She worked her ass off her entire life for me and this is what i give her back.  Im trying so hard but i cant bear it anymore. Ive been screaming in my head the entire day doing absolutely nothing.  I feel lik im genuinely losing my mind going mental.  Im so scared.  I feel so close to doing it, and i really want to but it reminds me of everything i might miss.  Idk. Idk.  I really dont know what to feel or do or something.  I just dont know what i dont know. The cry was good tho.  It clears stuff up in my head.  But its still spinning.  Idk what to say but i have to say soemthing so im sitting here doing nothing but venting about my non existant problems.  I really dont know what to do or what to feel.  Nothing to cry about huh .  I just remembered its also my moms bday on the tmr (14). This post is a mess but my head is just racing
