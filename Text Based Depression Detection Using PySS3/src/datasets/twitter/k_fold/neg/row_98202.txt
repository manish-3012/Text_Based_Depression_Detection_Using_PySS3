Just kinda attempted and can't stop laughingSo was having a real breakdown so called mental health crisis number and said O thought i was going to kill myself. In short They said call back if you feel like you might kill yourself lmao.
Then took a knife and didnt do much damage but was like maybe i go get help?  So i went to campus security and was like maybe hospital.
Apparently 999 said I don't need an ambulance dats fine and the security was telling me to focus on the good things all the garbage talk. So i was gonna try jumping in front of traffic.
But they decided to get me a taxi. But then i had to go back to my flat at the opposite end of campus to get my purse.

I can't stop laughing and crying at the same time its just hilarious to me lol
