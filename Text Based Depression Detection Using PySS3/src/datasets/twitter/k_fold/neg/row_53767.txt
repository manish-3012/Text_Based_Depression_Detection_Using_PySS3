I've called the suicide hotline and texted the crisis text line a lot.I've called/texted them dozens of times. My eyes hurt a lot, my mom says its sweat. My eyes were like this for months. I have an eye appointment in one month and I'm going through itchy eyes. It's really dangerous to drive. I couldn't see one time while I was driving.
