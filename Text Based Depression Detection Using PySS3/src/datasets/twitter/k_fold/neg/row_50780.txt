The gun is cocked and ready... not even scared anymoreSo today the figurative gun arrived in the mail. Spent the last half an hour putting the pento powder into little gel capsules, and have 25 400mg caps ready and waiting. Also filled up 8 smaller caps at roughly half the weight of the others just to get me through the next week or so before the day I finish this all off. I am still yet to test the stuff so will take a small capsule later today to determine if it's the actual deal. No real doubts about that though.

Now it is all no longer just an idea floating in space, and I don't have to worry about customs seizing my delivery anymore, I am calm as ever. It's like my emotional circuits have just been overridden and now everything is clear, my final path unblocked and I couldn't be more... well not happy, but perhaps relieved.

Why can't life be as easy as enacting a plan to end it? Guess I was able to do something right without fucking it up after all
