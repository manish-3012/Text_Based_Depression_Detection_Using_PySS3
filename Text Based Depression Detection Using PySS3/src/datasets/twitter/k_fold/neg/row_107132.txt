EmptyI dont want to hurt the few that care, but I'm so empty and done with everything. I really dont know how much longer I can keep holding on. I've been ready to die, I've tried so many times, it's all I want. If I could buy cyanide I'd be gone already. I just want it to be quick and painless. If I had the money I'd buy a gun just to fucking end it dude. I'm so fucking broken and I cant muster up the strength to pick myself up anymore.
