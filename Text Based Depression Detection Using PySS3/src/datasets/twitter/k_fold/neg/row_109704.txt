Going through some shit


I really donâ€™t care if anyone I know, knows this account or reads it at this point. I just need to talk my mind.

Iâ€™m facing a dilemma. Iâ€™m set up to go to school in January, but have yet to pay for it. Iâ€™m deciding to think I may not go now. I have till the 12 of January to decide. The idea was to work, and go to my classes and commute. I have an apartment and some decent savings Iâ€™m living off of while job seeking.

Issue is I came off some meds last year, and had to get back on daily around July. I havenâ€™t not drank more than 4 days off, I can count in a year almost. Usually drink every other day 4/5 beers. Maybe 1-2 nights a week with  energy drinks with vodka, abusing my meds(snorting) which are opiates(this has become a regular thing along with isolation I stopped in 2013 and recently picked up a few months ago again). I also take klonipin for anxiety, Iâ€™m not abusing but taking as prescribed. But the cocktail of abusing the other stuff...Iâ€™m not so sure. 

Iâ€™m on some different generic med, I donâ€™t like till I see my doctor on the 2nd of January. But since I switch to the generic Iâ€™m starting to feel a big change in myself...like really shitty. 

I think Iâ€™m gonna hit it hard at some point. Maybe not tomorrow or the next day. But you know when you get a feeling itâ€™s catching up with you? Itâ€™s just a funny feeling. And believe me none of this is fun. Itâ€™s just me sitting in a chair on my phone listening to music just thinking a lot. Sometimes laying on the floor. Iâ€™m not gonna go into detail...itâ€™s embarrassingly shitty.

But I think Iâ€™m headed for a rock bottom or worse. I may need to not go to school and actually go to rehab maybe and work through my depression? Iâ€™m gonna try to do my best till I can get in to see my doctor. I just donâ€™t wanna waste 2k on a week of a stay somewhere, thatâ€™ll do fuck all that I canâ€™t do at home alone given the time. 

My life was looking good last year, but man. Iâ€™m tired of this shit. To solidify it more, Iâ€™m dead sober saying this right now. 

Thanks for listening if you read this far. Hopefully Iâ€™m still around for New Years.
