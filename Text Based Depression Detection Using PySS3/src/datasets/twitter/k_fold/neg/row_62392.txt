I finally think it's time...Created this account so I could post this.
Anyways to explain a little bit, and I know this is gonna sound coney and wimpy as hell but...I watched the movie Her and there was so many things that hit home for me. I have this hole that won't be filled with anything but someone else's love. Like truly all caring love. I've never had a real relationship just flings that never had any real connection at least from my end. Maybe I'm too desperate, or codependent...and I know from experience that no one likes a desperate person. It comes of as clingy and that you can't do anything without them, it's too much for one person to bear. And so I feel trapped. People keep telling me to go out and try, but truth is I don't want to run the gauntlet of that whole rigamarole. I just don't have the energy for it. I've realized that I can't do this by myself anymore but again that's extremely codependent and desperate. And so that brings me here...that little voice in our heads we all hear, well mines is telling me it's time. I just don't want my family to forget me I guess. It's funny because I just got a job that I'm supposed to be starting tomorrow. Which is fine, I can keep up the charade until I get paid. Then I plan to buy a big bottle of alcohol, some weed and get an Uber to the beach where I'll finally drink myself into a stupor and drown myself. I thinks it's the easiest more painless way to go, at least after the initial struggle.
Anywho, whenever I get paid is when it's happening and I guess I just wish that I could have experienced what it would have been like to have someone hold you, love you for who you are, tell you that everything is going to be alright and that they will hold your hand till the end...
Buy guys and don't forget me.
