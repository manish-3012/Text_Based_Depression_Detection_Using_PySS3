The uncaring voidIt's late, and just need to get some thoughts of my chest before bed; just what exactly is the point of all this? 
Well there isn't one is there! I wish I was wrong. I really wished there was a God, an afterlife, just something after all this misery; but my logical brain just argues otherwise. 
We're just unimportant specs in an uncaring void; everything we do, the people we become, the people we care for, our memories, the good and the bad; all will just cease to exist once we're six feet under! So what is the point? 
I try to enjoy the little things in life that get me through the day; but it really isn't enough. I'm struggling coming to terms of how  small I feel in this chaotic, uncaring void that is the universe.
I really wish I could just skip to the end. I honestly don't know what's keeping me here anymore.
Thanks for reading my frustrated rambling.
