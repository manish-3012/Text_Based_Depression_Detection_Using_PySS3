I'm readyI'm ready. I'm ready to go. I've said this a hundred times to myself. I just can't bring myself to do it. I've been off meds for about 3 months (Sertraline ) but I was doing great for all three months, until now. I checked my bank account ab hour ago and was charged for a tutoring service I signed up for but never used. $69 and suddenly I'm crashing all over again. I contacted the company and am trying to get the money back, waiting for a response. But this suddenly just threw me back into my depressive state where I can't think about anything but ending it. I'm starting at a respected university and have great prospects to anyone who knows me but I just can't find a reason to keep going. I've been a mess for a while, but it just comes and goes. I'm sick of not being able to choose between living miserably or simply ending it all. The one close friend I've had for almost year won't reply to my texts and seems to become more and more distant. I can't blame him, I understand. He's well aware of my mental health and medication and was very supportive when I first told him I wanted to begin treatment and not tell my parents because of their disapproval. Suddenly a few months ago I could tell he was getting tired of dealing with my crisis about once every month. I feel lost. Like I lost a friend. But I can't blame him. I just feel so empty. I don't think I'll make it through college. Disorganized vent here. 

*Update: Good news, the company has agreed to refunded me the money. I'm also talking to a close friend and am doing much better. Thanks to everyone who reached out during my breakdown.
