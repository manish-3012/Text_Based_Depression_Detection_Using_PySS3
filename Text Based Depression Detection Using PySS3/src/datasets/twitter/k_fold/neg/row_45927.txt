i hate existing.i shouldn't be like this. i have certain things going well for me but it's not enough. it just makes me look even worse to others who might say i have nothing to be upset about so i never feel like i have the right to even feel sad. i think this is my third time posting here and every time i just feel worse. nothing helps. the past few months i tried really hard to make improvements. my career improved a little but everything else is still terrible. i feel like crying all the time and i do. i hate existing and i don't want to anymore. that's all i can think about. this isn't how i'm suppose to be.
