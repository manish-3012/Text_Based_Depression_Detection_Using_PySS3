Somehow I got into a relationship. What now?I met this guy thru mobile gaming and we've known each other for almost 2 years now. We're like best friends and we talked to each other about everything and I was glad that I finally have an understanding male friend. Around 9 months ago, he confessed to me saying he likes me but I just replied in gratitude saying 'thank you' because my life was a mess then and I couldn't have room for that. We didn't talk for few months after that.

2 months ago I texted him again and things were awkward. Last week I texted him again, and we're back to normal. Last Tuesday, I met him in person after almost 2 years of talking online. Somehow he still likes me and I'm falling for him too. The problem is, if I kill myself now, he's another person in my list of the people I'll hurt. Should I break this relationship off? Life is better now with him in it but I still think about suicide every now and then because it's my problem to begin with. What should I do?
