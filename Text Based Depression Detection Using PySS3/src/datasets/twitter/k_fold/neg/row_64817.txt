I thought medication and counselling would help me to get rid off intense social anxiety but still have got not even 1% benefit from it. I still want to die/disappear because of social anxiety. Social anxiety made my life hell for me. I really don't know what to do next.Because of social anxiety i went into depression and attempted suicide which was failed. When parents tried to know the reason of suicide i told parents that i have been suffering from social anxiety which made me difficult survive into corporate world like doing job, attending interviews and so many such issues and problems explained to them. 

	Luckily parents understand that i have some serious mental health issues and we altogether decided	to get mental health treatment though it was out of my budget.

	I don't have any other skill or talent through which i can earn money without socializing. For me as well as for family my salary is the only source of income. 

	In fact after some sessions of medications and counselling realized that no miracle is going to happen. I myself have to get rid off mental health issued and that is totally impossible for me as i am really really coward, anxious, hopeless, with zero energy, no will to overcome social anxiety and tired with all this.

I thing there is nothing wrong in excepting fact that not everyone is born to survive into this world. Many peoples life has been destroyed because of serious mental health issues. So I think i am already destined to kill myself.

Sorry for venting and thanks for reading my rant.

Any suggestions and advice always welcome.
