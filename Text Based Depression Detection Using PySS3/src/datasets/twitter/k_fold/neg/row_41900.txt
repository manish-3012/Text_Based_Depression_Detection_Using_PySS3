Vivid visions of killing myself ceaseless since telling family about bipoparI am having lurid and desirable visions of jumping off buildings and stabbing myself in the stomach and cutting my throat. Just failed university. The place sickens me anyway but its not like thats it's unique problem. Lack of sincerity, saccharine lines fed through loops of misinformation. Tired of it. Tired of blaming myself for failure. Not my fault. World is  fucked. Happy people are sociopaths. Happiness is a fascism, it's all I'm allowed to be. Be happy or fuck off. I can help you be happy again. Worlds a mess heads a mess. Want to die. Probably won't until I'm old and sociopathed
