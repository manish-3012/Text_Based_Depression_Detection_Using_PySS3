Maybe they should have held me longer?I swear to you the only reason Iâ€™m here is because I donâ€™t have access to a gun. If you look at my history the same guy that I talk about laying next to, or being in his arms, or whatever I say is the same guy that has cheated on me. Twice. Life is cruel and I donâ€™t deserve this. I have never gotten a chance, in anything in life and just when I get one. Boom. Some other wack ass shit comes crashing down. I hate it here. As soon as my 5 years is up from the last hold, Iâ€™m buying a gun and saying fuck this world. It didnâ€™t deserve me anyway.
