The National Suicide Prevention Hotline hung up on me.When I called, I was crying too hard to get a word out. They hung up on me. Glad to know the world doesn't give a shit. Just like I thought.

Update:
I tried calling them later when I was less of a wreck, and a girl apologized and meant well, but she barely knew English. The conversation was very scripted, as well. I think I'll try reaching out to a more professional resource about my mental health in the future.

Aside from that, I'm astounded by the support I'm receiving from complete strangers. Thanks guys.

Anyone have an alternative to the National Hotline?
