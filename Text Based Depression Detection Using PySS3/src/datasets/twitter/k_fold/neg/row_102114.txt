Iâ€™ll probably kill myself some time after my parents dieMany times in the past (every winter for the last few years, actually) there has been a point where the only thing keeping me alive has been the thought of how much it would hurt my parents if I killed myself.

Once theyâ€™re dead, and I reach that point for the first time, Iâ€™ll probably do it.  Thereâ€™s nobody else in my life who I think couldnâ€™t cope with my suicide, and nobody whoâ€™s close enough to me to be really, really badly affected on a long-term basis.
