My failing grasp to my hopes and dreamsI know that the world is facing a big crisis right now but I can't help to feel the emptiness in my being. I am sorry if I feel this way this just makes me so empty and useless. I just wish that either the feeling stop or I stop living because I am tired of feeling this way. I am currently on medication for more than a year now and I don't know if it helps. I just want it to all end.
