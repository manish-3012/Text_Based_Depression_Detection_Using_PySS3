Lonely and Resigned [potentially extra triggering]A few weeks ago I tried to kill myself, ended up in the hospital for almost 2 weeks. My life felt like it was falling down around me. Between having been homeless, molested, and watching my dad attempt suicide, I finally broke. I was diagnosed bipolar in the hospital and put on meds. I feel like they give me worse mood swings. Yesterday everything felt like a blessing, today I feel so empty and alone. I'm seriously considering trying again, but I also have a therapists appointment on the 1st. I just don't know if I can wait that long. 
I also don't want to ruin thanksgiving for my family. I already ruined my moms birthday this way, but nobody has really given a damn about me. They walk on eggshells around me and have hawk eyes on me, but they don't try to spend time with me.
I just don't know.
I hate feeling this way.
