I Cant do this anymoreMy existence is destroying everyone around me. I know I have to do this. I have all day tomorrow alone to do it. I know I have to before anyone gets home from work. I'm scared but I have to. Its what everyone wants and deserves. I'm bad and I deserve to be gone. Please give me strength so I can free the people in my life from the cancer that is me. I wish so badly I'd never been born.... Everything I touch, I break. I am darkness personified and nothing can grow inside my soul. I give up. Even when I try to be good, I just hurt everyone around me and ruin everything. I am an abomination. I am trash. I am waste. I will never be enough and I will never amount to anything and I just want to disappear. I hope I never wake up. I hope they don't waste time or money on a service no one will come to. Why was I created at all? I serve no purpose other than to destroy others and make them miserable. I know I don't deserve the air I breathe and people tell me so, too..

 They're right. I give up. I give in.
