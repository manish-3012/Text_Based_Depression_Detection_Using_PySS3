Guys, I really need your advice.I'll get straight to the point. One of my best friends self harms on a regular basis, and has suicidal tendencies. We're the only source of support for one another at the moment, so I want to do anything I can to help her. However, she's a very closed off person in general, and it's very hard to get her to open up to me. Her self harm is pretty serious, and a lot of times it gets out of hand too. Tonight was one of those nights. She texted me freaking out, and then immediately closed off saying that everything is fine and she's okay. She refuses to admit that this is a serious problem, and I find that very worrisome. I want her to talk to me abt it, because I know talking has helped me sometimes, but I am also aware that it may not be helpful for everyone. However I do feel like her denial to admit the danger she poses to herself is very harmful, and it scares me. Despite being someone who is going through the same problem, I'm still at a loss for what to do. Should I continue pressing her to talk to me? I want to wait for her to come to me when she's ready but I know her and I know that if I don't start the conversation then it will never take place. And I don't think her ignoring the depth of the situation is doing her any favors. I don't  know what to do. I would really appreciate some advice on this matter.
