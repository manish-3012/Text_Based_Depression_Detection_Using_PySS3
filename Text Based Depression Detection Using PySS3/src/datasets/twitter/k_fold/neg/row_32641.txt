Does anyone else have times right after seeking help where they feel like they're no longer suicidal?I have had these moments the past few times I sought help, whether it was in person, or just using an online chat, where I felt like I was all of a sudden no longer suicidal after speaking with someone. I also experienced this after I got my medication (Celexa and Seroquel for sleep) a week ago, on the first day I took it. I know I'm not cured because I've still been looking for alternate ways to kill myself, and having my anxiety kick in around 6 PM, as opposed to being anxious all day, on the days after I took the Seroquel.     
I would just like to know if there's anyone else who gets these feelings of being cured suddenly after seeking help.
