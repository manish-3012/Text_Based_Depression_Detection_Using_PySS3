Hi.I feel like shit. I canâ€™t do anything right and I am a burden on everyone I care about. I just sobbed to whatever higher power they may be to please show me mercy and not allow me the pain of having to wake up in the morning. 

Iâ€™m so, so tired. I donâ€™t want to do it anymore. Iâ€™ve had a lifetime of pain. Iâ€™m nearly 32 years old and canâ€™t imagine having to live for another 32 years enduring pain daily. 

I donâ€™t deserve to be loved. My parents should have terminated the pregnancy when they found out I existed. I wish they had. Their lives wouldâ€™ve been easier, too. 

I donâ€™t deserve to be called a woman. I donâ€™t even deserve to be called a person. I wish I could set myself on fire and fling myself from a skyscraper. Suicide hotlines do nothing but make me feel like more of a burden. They could be using that precious time theyâ€™re using to deal with me to help someone who deserves to feel better. 

I mustâ€™ve done so many things wrong to warrant this pain. I tried taking my life in 2011 but failed. It resulted in me being Baker Acted. Again, I was someone elseâ€™s burden to deal with. 

I donâ€™t deserve the roof over my head or food in my belly. I am a waste of space. I am a waste of breath.

The only thing that is keeping me here is my beautiful kitty girl. I love her so wholeheartedly. I love her. I love her so much. I donâ€™t deserve her. I really donâ€™t. 

Sorry for wasting your time if youâ€™ve made it this far. Sorry for taking up space on this subreddit. Sorry for anyone whoâ€™s had to cross my path or even look at me. 

Iâ€™m just really fucking sorry.
