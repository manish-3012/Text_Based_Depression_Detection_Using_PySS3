Genuinely, what's the f**king point?Every day is suffering, I'm lonely, stupid, pathetic, whatever insults you want to throw at me, go right ahead, I'm already fucked as it is. Today I just found out something I've been passionate about was a complete waste of time, it's ruined. I'm fucking devastated. When you pour your soul into something, wether that's someone you love, a passion, a friend, whatever. and it crushes right in front of you, it rips you apart, how the fuck do you get on with it? There are many ways to get over it but each one are insufferable as the rest. Maybe i'm not making sense but life doesn't make sense. I don't even know anymore. Guess I'll die?
