The worst part is having a phone full of people that...Absolutely will not respond to you making chit chat or outright ignore you. If I day theyâ€™ll care for like a day, but in life Iâ€™m nothing more than filler at best and a pest at worst. I really wish someone would walk up to me and put a bullet in my head.
