Iâ€™m not at all scared about how my death would affect people around me. Iâ€™m scared that it wonâ€™t work (again).Attempted 3 years ago and I swore I wouldnâ€™t do it again unless I knew for sure that it would work. I donâ€™t even feel like life is real anymore. I feel like Iâ€™m just watching everyone else living their lives. Iâ€™m not sad or emotional about dying, I just want it all to be over really. I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m posting this but right now I just feel desperate and I wanna kill myself but I wonâ€™t do it until I know for sure it will definitely work.
