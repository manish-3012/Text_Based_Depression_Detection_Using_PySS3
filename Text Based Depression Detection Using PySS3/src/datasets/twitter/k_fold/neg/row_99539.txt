Breaking point for me feeling isolated from societyEveryday recently I feel like killing myself I've been usually abusing my medications and contemplating suicide. I'm 21 years old but for my whole life I feel like I've been emotionally abused from my parents to peers. from elementary school to college I was abused for the way my nose looked and I would always laugh and try to smile it off but it really did hurt me it actually emotionally fucked me up as I hate going outside and seeing other people staring it really fucking hurts. I have friends but I just play along to make it seem like I'm happy but when I go home no one knows how I really feel and when I tell my parents how I really feel they just brush it off and just make me feel like absolute shit. I feel alone and empty I don't feel like going forward anymore I just don't even want to go outside anymore I really do feel alone I feel like I have no one to talk to no one to help me I'm lost I really feel like no one loves me and I have no one to talk too I just want to go at this point
