I want to kill myself.I'm tired. I don't want to get better anymore. Waves of pain, guilt, tiredness of living....I don't want to be here anymore. Even when I feel "okay", I don't want to keep going, and that means it's my fault. It is my fault for wanting to stop.

But I feel nothing but guilt and shame and stupidity for wanting this. 

I'm so tired of fighting. I choose to give up every day, even on the occasions that i feel "okay" or sort of "normal". And tat adds even more shame and stupidity-feelings.

 I want to end. I hope i die tonight.
