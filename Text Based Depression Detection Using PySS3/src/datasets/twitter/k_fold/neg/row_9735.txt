Shit might actually be looking up but thereâ€™s something I feel thatâ€™s missingHey yâ€™all I just got some good news so I work in a manufacturing shop in school and I just got a table at my height so I can weld safely in my wheelchair and Iâ€™ve been really depressed still wanting to end it because of a few things. First off Iâ€™m a jealous asshole second Iâ€™m in a fucking wheelchair for life and I canâ€™t seem to get a girlfriend like any of my classmates in all of my classes. Even the retarded kid had one for a while like seriously I basically have no friends and no one really care about me
