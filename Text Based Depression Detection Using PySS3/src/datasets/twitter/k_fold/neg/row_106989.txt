I Just Turned 29 This Month...I'm sorry for how long this ended up being, but I had to write it out somewhere. 

I'm 29 now, and it's so hard to accept. The past few years have been extremely hard. In 2017 I wanted to end it all but I reached out to my mom and she drove me up to the ER. I spent a week in a facility, far away from my family and boyfriend. It was scary. While I was there I was diagnosed with major depression, general anxiety, and bipolar disorder. When I got back home I wasn't much better. 

Every job I manage to get is too stressful on me. I feel pathetic for not being able to suck it up and be a normal functioning adult. Often I job hop because I can't handle being at one place for too long or I fuck things up.

I live in a place that I hate, I'm constantly broke because I barely make money. It's very hard to get a full time job where I live, especially if you have very little experience. I  had to drop out of college because I could no longer afford it or receive financial aid. I feel like even more of a failure because of this. 

My weight is out of control. I'm at 340 pounds and my doctor says I gain on average 10 pounds a month and sternly told me at this rate I could have health problems by the time I'm 40. I already have high blood pressure. I have no other vices. I don't drink much, I don't smoke cigarettes or do drugs. I eat. For some reason eating makes me feel better, and I can't seem to stop. It's just food, and I'm literally eating myself to death, but I guess I don't care enough to stop. 

I get crappy health insurance through the state, but I have no mental health coverage, and cannot afford to pay $150 plus out of pocket to see psychiatrists and counselors. Waiting at the free clinic for longer than 2 hours triggers my anxiety and I have to go home. Again, I'm pathetic. 


Many friends have left me, including my best friend of 14 years. She thought a boy she's only known for 2 years was more important and abandoned me when I needed her most around this time last year. She recently reached out to me and we have tried to reconnect, but it does not feel the same. I cannot get over how she easily abandoned me. I'm too afraid to express my problems to her for fear she'll only judge me and do me dirty again. I feel like I have no friends anymore, and I can't trust anyone. 

I have no interests in anything anymore. When I'm not working, I'm at home, on the couch watching Netflix. I used to love to make art, read, go for walks, etc. I no longer feel like doing any of those things, and nothing excites me anymore. I have nothing to look forward to, and it depresses me.

The only person who brings a small glimmer of happiness into my life is my boyfriend. I do not know what he sees in me at all. For some reason I haven't scared him off yet, but it's only a matter of time before my crazy ass does. Everyone has their limits. I know that. 

I'm 29. I have a dead end job and no future. I'm not pretty. I'm not interesting. There is nothing likable about me and I literally hate everything about myself. Everyone around me is traveling, loving, working, having families...and I'm sitting here rotting away. I'm a fucking waste of space. I've been thinking about suicide a lot the past few days. Have not told the boyfriend bc I don't want to be a burden and upset him. 

I always said I never thought I'd make it to 30. The fact that I made it to 29 is a shock to me. But if I get to 30 and I'm still in this spot...I just couldn't live with myself. I couldn't like with the shame of being such a failure. 

The really sucky part about all of this is that I had some depressing memories pop up on Facebook today...nothing, literally nothing has changed since 1 year ago, and I don't think things will ever get better. If this is what life is like I really don't want to live. 

I'm sorry, this was a lot longer than intended. I don't even know if anyone is reading...I just had to write this somewhere.
