Too much pressure.Iâ€™ve never been good at handling pressure. In fact, I remember being around thirteen and thinking â€œby sixteen I better have gathered the courage to do itâ€ because Iâ€™ve never wanted the responsibility of adulthood.

I feel stuck in a way. I donâ€™t have anything I want to do. There are some things I feel alright doing, but I canâ€™t stand the thought of someone looking to me and thinking â€œthereâ€™s a well adjusted adult.â€ Iâ€™ve never wanted to be a part of any of this. 

Sometimes Iâ€™m not even convinced that I am. Iâ€™d kind of like it better that way, thatâ€™d mean none of this was real and so the reality would have to be something else.
