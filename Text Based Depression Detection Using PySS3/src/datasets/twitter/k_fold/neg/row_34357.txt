NoteI canâ€™t remember the last time I felt truly happy, not even as a kid. I donâ€™t know what I did to deserve this life. Iâ€™m sorry for whatever I did. I sure paid for it. I wished I could be happy someday. I wish I had 1 friend. No one truly knows me, not even my own family. No one understands how bad this is. It gets brushed off as nothing. I donâ€™t want to live the rest of my life my this. I hope I will be happy someday. This is no oneâ€™s fault.
