whatâ€™s your reason to stay?currently iâ€™m at a low point which only seems to feel worse everyday. 
this is the thought i keep repeating: 
itâ€™s okay to live for someone else as long as u stay alive long enough to find reasons to live for yourself. 
itâ€™s helpful sometimes but also brings a lot of guilt and self loathing for being so fucking selfish. 

does anyone have a good thought to repeat? a solid reason to stay that ur brain canâ€™t pick holes in
