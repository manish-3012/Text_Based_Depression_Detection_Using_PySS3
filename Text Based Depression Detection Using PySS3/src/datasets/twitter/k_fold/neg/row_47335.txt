I'm stuck and scared and I don't know what to do.Hello, this is my first post on reddit ever. I joined just to ask for some advice on this issue. For context, I'm an 18 year old female going to online college. The last few months I've been feeling more and more like nothing is worth it and like I should end it all. The main thing holding me back is that I'm afraid of what it would do to my family. About three years ago my older sister tried and failed to kill herself and was able to get the help she needs. She's happy now and is engaged to get married next summer. I feel like a really bad person for wanting to kill myself even though I've seen that it can get better first hand. I'm failing all of my classes because I can't bring myself to even try to do any of it and my mom yells at me a lot because of this. I want to tell her that I'm having a lot of thoughts of suicide but I'm worried that she'll brush it off and tell me to suck it up (which she did when I told her I wanted to kill myself in highschool). It doesn't help that today someone was killed in a car wreck in front of my house. I'm also worried that if I kill myself they won't take care of my dog whom I love very much. I'm just really scared and I don't know what I should do next. Any advice would be very appreciated. Thanks all.
