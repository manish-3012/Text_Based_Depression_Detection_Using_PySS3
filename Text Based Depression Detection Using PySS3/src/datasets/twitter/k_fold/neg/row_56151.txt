Does therapy always work?Is it ever possible to mess up your life so completely that it can be of no help? I made a terrible, terrible mistake a few years back that I desperately wish I could go back in time to prevent, and its effects will probably haunt me for the rest of my life. But I have OCD, so I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s all in my head because the things I worry about havenâ€™t happened. At least, not yet.

Iâ€™ve never had real therapy sessions. Iâ€™ve just had meetings with psychiatrists where they prescribe drugs and follow-ups. But that probably isnâ€™t what actual therapy is like. Iâ€™ve been trying to sign up for a sessions but itâ€™s difficult because all the therapists around me are fully-booked. And I donâ€™t know if itâ€™ll help. Sometimes, I think suicide is my only option. Sorry if this doesnâ€™t fit here.
