EndgameSo I started dating this wonderful guy and I just got out of a pretty emotionally abusive relationship and lately it's just been so hard to seem like I'm interested in the things he likes, I am, I know I am and I'm hoping he does because if he doesn't I know the only actual logical thing I should be doing is giving myself a choice between letting the only best things I've ever had go or continuing to drag him down, honestly I have not had the best relationship track record so this is kind of my last shot and actually trying to be happy and yeah being miserable going into something isn't the best but I'm 22 and I feel like I'm so much older and to me it just feels like I'm some middle aged dude who just has a dog and a job to look forward to every morning. Sure that's a great outlook but I want to actually be able to go to a high school reunion and not fake my way out of going because I don't want to get to look at classmates who are more successful I don't want to sit in my truck one day and slit my wrists thinking that I peaked in high school and that I'll never wrap up my life with a happy ending.
