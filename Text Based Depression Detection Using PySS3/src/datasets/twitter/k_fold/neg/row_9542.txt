I got real bad real fastI had to call the suicide hotline, it wasn't super productive - it just made me feel like shit. There's a very real chance I'll never be able to see my kids again because of a long running lie my SO was telling. The person I spoke with just tried to keep me focused on staying alive for my kids. I'm here because I've already lost them and now the little time I do have is in jeopardy.

And my mom, hah, she rubs it in my face. I was right. Your SO is a piece of shit and you are too because you didn't listen. My financial situation is spiraling out of control, and life really isn't worth it. But I have to be the strong one, the happy one. Encourage my SO and my family to get through their problems. But I don't have anyone.

I have to be this pillar and everyone keeps piling on to it and I'm about to fall over. I can't take it. I just can't. I'm so tired of living.
