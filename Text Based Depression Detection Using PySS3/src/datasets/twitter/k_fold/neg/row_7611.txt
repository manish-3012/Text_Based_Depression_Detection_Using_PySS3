To much responsibilitySo many things i have to do and no motivation to do it. I'm the president of a club but hardly show up(i didn't even want to be president). I have to train the new morning news people since this is my last year doing it but all i can manage to say is "make sure you read the script". Have to play in a concert but the people who only started this year are better than me (played for 5 years). I could list many more things but it would only make my thoughts worse listing all the things i have to do. Why can't this stop? Why do people put so much on me? How come it seems like everyone else can take it while I'm just here being crushed by all of this?

Well stay tuned for the next episode of venting my feelings *plays outro song*
