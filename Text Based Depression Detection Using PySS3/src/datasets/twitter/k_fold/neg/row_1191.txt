â€œI will never talk to you again if you talk about suicide, cutting yourself, etcâ€Has anyone had an experience where you tell someone you trust about your suicidal feelings or that youâ€™ve self harmed, and their immediate reaction is to shame you and threaten to never speak to you again? This has happened to me a few times and every time it does it rubs me the wrong way. Like I understand that suicide and self harm are terrible. But I donâ€™t need to be shamed for something I already feel bad about. Saying youâ€™ll leave me or never speak to me again doesnâ€™t help the situation...itâ€™s honestly just really hurtful.
