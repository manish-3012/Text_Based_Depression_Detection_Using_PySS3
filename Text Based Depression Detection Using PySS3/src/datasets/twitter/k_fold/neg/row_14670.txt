Losing what little control I had left.I don't want to be here anymore. I was on a plane today and I kept hoping the fucker would just crash. Not that I want others to go with me, but if it were to go anyway, I'd have bought a first class ticket at this point.

It's coming. I can feel it in my soul. It's stronger than it ever was, and certainly stronger than me.

Was there ever a possibility that it would end any other way? Naturally, I can remember glimpses of hope that now seem like such foolishness.

I now hope that others understand, but I know they won't. I hope my family won't get hurt, but I know they will. I hope this gives me some relief, but I know it won't matter.

I am lost and won't ever find myself again. I will be forgotten, and it seems a small solace. I will be free, and it will make no difference.
