Idk what to do anymore...I just don't know what to do anymore. All my dreams and aspirations have been crushed one by one. Every day I would try something new but nothing seems to work. I just can't find a reason to live. I had dreams. I was gonna study physics and just be happy. Science was one of the only things that kept me going. But now my dreams have been crushed. I am doing a degree which I hate so much I have no idea what to do. I just want to flunk out and kill myself.

I honestly just want to end my life. The only reason I am still alive is because of my best friend. She has been through so much with me. I want to just do it but I know she wouldn't ever forgive me. I love her so much. She is honestly maybe one of the only people I actually love.

I feel like I am going to end it soon. I just can't take it anymore. I can't even formulate a thought to talk here. I am literally just rambling. Please, someone just help me. 
I feel so alone. I know she is there for me but we now both go to different universities and she is so happy at her new school. She also didn't have the best time with mental health. But I can tell, she is genuinely happy right now and I don't want to ruin that for her by calling and telling her how I feel. 

Reddit, please, tell me something. Anything. I am going to kill myself if I don't get anything.
