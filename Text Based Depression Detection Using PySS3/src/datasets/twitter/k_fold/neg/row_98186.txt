How can I help my friend who's suicidal?I don't know what to do and its worrying me. Something happened to them that's irreversible and they feel like they have to reason to live anymore. Its preventing them from doing what they wanted in life, they're lifes purpose. Now they don't have any options to help with that. I'm terrible at trying to console someone so I feel helpless. They've only told me about it.
