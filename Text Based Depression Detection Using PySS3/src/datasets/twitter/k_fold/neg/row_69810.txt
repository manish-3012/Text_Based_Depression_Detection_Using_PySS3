My lifeMy life.
It really is a mess huh..? Ever since freshman year of high school, you've been skipping school consistently and you dropped out. But you found that drive to get your GED and you succeeded. I was so proud of you! But then you went into college, and you repeated what you did in high school. Youre a piece of shit. Why the fuck would you do that to yourself when you've promised that you would never do that ever again? Now look at you. You fucking promised. You fucking said you would better yourself but you can't. What the fuck have you done right? All you do is take shit. You're a fucking pushover. You can't even hold a job for longer than 4 months. And your co-workers didn't even like you. Even your girlfriend talks shit about you. And when you go to your best friend to talk about it, he leaves because you're a boring piece of shit. You aren't even close to your family are you? You look at your parents like they are your wallet. Fucking trash. Just end yourself. You really don't deserve anybodies attention. You're a freeloader. A person noone likes and you cant even talk right.

Tonight is when I'm really going to disconnect from everything. What am I doing. I don't feel like I belong here. I don't feel good. I feel so down. 

I want help. I don't wanna go. But it hasn't been getting better and I don't think it will. My life. This is what it is.
