What stops you from suicide when you feel all out of options?I'm trying to self soothe, I feel so alone. I watched some YouTube videos on suicide and started crying. I feel like I'm going to vomit from these emotions. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't want to continue living this way, I really dug myself a hole
