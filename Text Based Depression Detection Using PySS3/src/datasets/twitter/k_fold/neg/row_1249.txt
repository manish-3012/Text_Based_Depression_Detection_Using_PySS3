not having a good nighti hate myself. the thought burns through my mind every time i accidentally glance at myself in the bathroom mirror.

its there when i lie in bed waiting for my sleeping pills to kick in. its in the replays of the interactions of the day. the hours i spent doing nothing. the friends i blew off, the experiences i could have had. i hate myself and a person like me isn't allowed to go do those things. i'm fat and ugly and shy and its not my place. and i realize that those thoughts come from stupid childhood bullying and how ridiculous it is to still let such ancient trash confine me and I hate myself a little more because i'm such a fucking coward.

its stupid that i'm even here. i can't kill myself. i can't do that to my parents. i've been such a fuck up of a daughter that it seems the least i can do is not kill myself while they're still around. my boyfriend had one fiancee die, it would be cruel for me to die on him too. those thoughts usually keep me strong against it but some nights they're just pathetic words.
