Schizoaffective depression and Iâ€™m over it.I have schizoaffective depression subtype. I suffer from deep, long term severe depression and schizophrenic / depressive symptoms as well as rapid cycling moods. Iâ€™m on mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and see a therapist weekly. 
â€”

Iâ€™m so done with life. Iâ€™m beyond depressed 24/7 and I just donâ€™t want to do it anymore. :â€™( 

Iâ€™ve been researching how to die, but itâ€™s all so complicated and I donâ€™t want to fail, which makes me think Iâ€™m stuck in this misery forever. 

My therapist is out of town and Iâ€™m just so fucking over this shit and donâ€™t really have anyone to talk to. 

So Iâ€™ve been researching. 

The hardest and shittiest thing is that my best friend went from suicide and Iâ€™m like ready to use his method. But heâ€™s smarter and braver than me. 

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even writing this. Iâ€™m never going to follow through. I guess I just need to vent. 

Iâ€™ve seen what suicide does to friends and families for times than I can count, and I believe everyone, under the right circumstances, deserves the right to die. However, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m one of them. He had terminal liver failure with no chance at an organ transplant because of other health issues, so he was given a death sentence by his doctors. My other friend had MS and was also given a death sentence at 33 years old. They both passed in the exact same way, which feeds into bravery for me. 

Anyway. I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m just so tired of being alive and having to struggle through every since day of my deep depression. Nothing helps. Iâ€™m on lots of meds and see a therapist weekly. Iâ€™ve been in and out of inpatient, PHP, and IOP, and nothing helps. Nothing. 

Iâ€™d truly love any advice on how to get through my almost 9 months of deep, unending, severe depression (with one single week of sanity) without considering ending my stupid, boring, pointless life. 

Please do NOT suggest that 9 months of depression isnâ€™t â€œas badâ€ as yours or someone elseâ€™s. Until you suffer for schizoaffective that wonâ€™t help me as advice or â€œit could be worse.â€ Iâ€™ve suffered from severe depression since age 12 and itâ€™s a miracle Iâ€™m still even here. 

Iâ€™m unpopular, have few friends, and nobody would really miss me if I was gone. Nobody. 

My best friend never had a funeral or even a memorial service, and Iâ€™m guessing it would be the same for me. Nobody cares. My parents would, but thatâ€™s about it. Nobody at work would probably even notice if I disappeared. 

Fuck. I donâ€™t know. 

Any advice here would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.  I hope I didnâ€™t break any rules. If I did, please let me know. 

Thanks. 

Tldr; Iâ€™m tired of my life, know how I want to die, etc.
