I tried hanging myself but feel happieri tried hanging myself a couple hours ago. i had planned it all day. i even asked for help for the first time ever. but still up until the hanging i felt hopeless. 
it didnâ€™t work because i hung it too low and i was able to push myself out before i could breath my last breath. 
i took down the rope, got into bed, finished homework due today i guess and here i am. 
i feel happy though. not happy to be alive but just happy that a part of me is still fighting to live. iâ€™m not sure how long this feeling will last but i do still intend on getting help because iâ€™m worried that one day, when iâ€™m not ready for it, iâ€™ll just give up. 
iâ€™m not sure where to go from here or how to hide the burning red mark across my neck but i do know iâ€™m the happiest iâ€™ve been in a while.
