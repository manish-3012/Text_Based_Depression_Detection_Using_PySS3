I just keep going in circles.One hour I feel like "WTF man, why would you ever want to leave this world," and the next hour I'm plotting my suicide, writing a note, scheming in my head. It's been like this my whole life and I can't take it anymore. I just wish I never existed. That would be peaceful.
