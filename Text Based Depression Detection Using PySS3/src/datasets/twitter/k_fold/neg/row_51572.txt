Im out on my own, away from my family, and my depression is getting worse.So I've battled with depression ever since I hit puberty, it was really bad in highschool, I attempted once, and only survived because my parents came home. Since then I've been to counseling, but I recently changed cities. I dont really have any friends anymore due to an unfortunate incident that occurred that oeft myself and my best friend on very bad terms, I didnt want to be in the same city, hence, the move.

Tonight I just cant seem to get it off my mind. And sure I dont really socialize and life isnt just great right now, and Im involved in some complicated emotional shit, but thats always been the case, I've never been particularly happy. Normally I just dont think about it this much, its been building. Im worried about what happens if I cant fall asleep soon.
