every morningEvery morning I wish I didn't wake up.  Every day, I wish it would be my last.  I keep going because of my family and friends.  I actually don't seem or look depressed and it would most likely be a surprise if I did end my own life.

I am still here.  I probably will still be here for awhile.  I am depressed and suicidal.  

I read other posts about near death experiences or of when people were considered "clinically dead," and they made it sound peaceful.  It's sleeping without dreams.  Sleeping and not waking up.  No more thinking and no more depression or anxiety.  

I was done awhile ago but if I keep going, it's to work until I retire, get my pension and just grow old and have a natural death.  I'm still young but I really feel done.  I am turning 30 this year.  I am single but I don't want to be with anyone.  I'm mentally not strong enough to be in a relationship so I see myself living the rest of my life alone.  

When I write about this, it actually calms me down.  This morning I was having a panic attack about going into work and but expressing this helps me to just feel numb and get through life.  

I still really want it all to just end though.
