I want to die, and I would love to know why.This is going to be long, but I'll try to keep it to the point. The point is: 

* **I don't understand what is happening to me**
* **I am scared**
* I am pretty sure that somebody has felt the same way before me and that I genuinely think that, **if I understand this, I will feel better, or at least I will learn to be able to live with it**.

My situation is good. Not perfect, but I am not *super* poor, I have a good life, a job, a SO, and friends. That said, I am under a *lot* of pressure lately, but that is by choice, and the event that causes it should be over in a year or two, tops.

I have been feeling bad for months now. I can't even remember when it started. Some days I wake up angry, some days I wake up sad. But also some days I wake up fine. I want to say again that there is no reason for me to feel this way, my life is not bad and many people have it worse.

The wanting to die is... Weird. I don't know how to describe it really, it's like, if my life was a TV series, I would stop watching it. I just want to disappear, but instead I keep doing my work and my chores and hope that next day is going to be better.

I know I am not the only one. Yesterday I spent several hours reading this subreddit, the one about depression and the one about suicidology. I am also not in danger, I am not going to kill myself. I have thought about it, but as others have said, in my head is like a "backup plan". I am also not sure if I have depression because I have never been diagnosed and I don't think it is right to say you have something if a doctor hasn't told you before, so I don't want to say I have it. As far as I know, I am just sad.

And now I arrive to the thing that made me write this post. Yesterday, when I was walking home alone (after a pretty good day) I felt **super sad**. As if I was going to start crying right there, on the street. And it was the first time that it happened to me. That genuinely scared the shit out of me.

I come to you today because it is clear that I can't keep it under control by myself. I would like to know if somebody felt like this and why it happens. I don't have a reason for it. **I don't plan on killing myself anytime soon** despite thinking about it, but I am scared that I feel that sad again and I change my mind.

I have been looking for info about depression. I am not a doctor, and I haven't found anything useful, really. I mean, aside of facebook articles and the like, the only texts with real scientific value (thanks, Google Scholar) I have found were really outdated. I would like to have something to read, to understand what the hell is happening in my mind and how to fix it or cope with it.

I don't mind if the texts are boring, or difficult to understand, or really technical or super long. Please, if any of you has any real info on why this is happening, I need to now.

Thank you for reading this.
