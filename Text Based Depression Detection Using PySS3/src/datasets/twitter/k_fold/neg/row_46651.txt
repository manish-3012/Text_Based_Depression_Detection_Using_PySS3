I take 100 mg of melatonin to sleep at night.My mind doesn't stop. I replay things that have happened as long as a decade ago in my head, but not by choice. I take so much melatonin and benadryl each night that eventually everything is quiet. I have no thoughts. No feelings. In my mind, that's what death must feel like. And sleep is the closest I've been able to get myself to death. It's the only time I feel okay. 

But lately I haven't been sleeping. My mind has been working against what I've been taking, and keeping me awake. I tried killing myself over 10 years ago, and had I known what my life would become, the constant feelings of loss, self loathing, and failure, i would've made sure I'd succeeded. I'm at the lowest I've ever been. I made my first attempt in years last week a day after calling the hotline. And failed. I don't want to use a gun. I don't want to scar whoever ends up finding me more than they already will be. But I'm starting to see when I have a way to back out I always take it, so I'm running out of options. I'm told suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but if you have clinical depression it is a permanent problem. And even when I do feel better, I know in the back of my mind I'm going to stumble again. I'm going to be this low again. I try to focus on the good to outweigh the bad, and it doesn't. It just doesn't. It never has.
