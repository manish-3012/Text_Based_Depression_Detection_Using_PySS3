I'm too fucking tiredI can't keep doing this anymore. I don't have the energy to do anything. every day I come home from work and all I want to do is fall to the ground until one of my roommates scrapes me up to get ready for work again. I can't sleep or I over sleep. I'm so exhausted all the time but the second I lay in bed all I can do is stare at the wall. I can't eat anymore because I don't have the energy and I don't wanna put in the effort, and if I do it upsets me cause it's just MORE stuff that I have to clean up and put away, and when I eat I just feel so disgusting. im trying to keep showering, I know I smell, I know I look greasy, but it's just so much effort and I feel so anxious when I'm spending any "me time," which also includes sleeping. I don't know what I can do anymore that will get me over this but it's just been so fucking long since I can remember being content and at peace.
