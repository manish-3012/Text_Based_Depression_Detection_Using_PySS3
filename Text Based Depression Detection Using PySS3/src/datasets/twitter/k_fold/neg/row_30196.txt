I want to stop feeling suicidal but I don't know where to startSo the title is a little misleading. I know where to start but I don't know how to act on the ideas. I understand that I need a support network, however I only have two friends and I've already lost friends because of how much i dump on people and I'm scared to open up.

I drink too much and I'm not gonna stop frankly, I'm not an alcoholic by any means but I drink to cope with suicidal thoughts because nothing else I do takes away the pain. Even alcohol doesn't help but it just makes time go by a little quicker.

I just don't know how to cope and I wanna get better and make an effort because I'm coming to my wit's end and I'm so close to actually giving in. I don't have the energy to try something new, i don't have the social skills to meet new people nor do I really want to. I don't know how to make it better but I have to and soon.
