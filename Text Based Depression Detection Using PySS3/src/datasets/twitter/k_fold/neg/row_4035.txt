Don't want to die but don't want to live eitherKinda stuck in the middle. Not necessarily looking to kill myself but wouldn't fight to save myself either. Even if I tried to off myself I'd probably screw it up, only to become a burden on my family. I think they would be better off with me gone. I don't think anyone would lose a minute of sleep if I was.
