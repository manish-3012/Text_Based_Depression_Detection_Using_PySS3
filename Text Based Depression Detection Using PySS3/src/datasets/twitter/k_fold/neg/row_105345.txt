Help, creating my anchorI've been dead for once. They could revive me...
I want to create an anchor that keeps me here, things I can come back to that remind me of myself and what "me" means.
I've already 'collected' positive things friends say I am.
Maybe you guys have ideas which things I shall add to this anchor.
What can keep somebody, wipe his mind, let him think clearer and all this.
I'm open for every idea.
