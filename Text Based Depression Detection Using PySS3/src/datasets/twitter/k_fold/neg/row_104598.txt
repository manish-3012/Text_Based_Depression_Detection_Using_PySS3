I'm depressed and don't know what to do now.Let me start by saying that I've talked to a few strangers about this problem, but nothing seemed to matter, although my lifestyle is slowly changing.
The main reason why I'm depressed is that I can't get anything done correctly, or I'm not good enough at most things. I've started at the gym, and the other day I went with a friend, and he was taking weights so much heavier than mine, and I felt really weak. It used to be a confidence boost, but even 6 months in the gym hasn't accomplished anything at all.
I'm in a group of friends, we're 6 mostly cause one of them is on a boarding school at the moment. They all have success, they do well in school most of the time, get great marks and they get girls and are tall and handsome. For the record, I am a small guy with glasses, I look like a nerd and I haven't held hands with a girl yet, despite what my looks might indicate, I am not by any means smart. I usually get a C in math, and a D in danish (I'm from Denmark), and a D in english. My friends usually gets A's and B's.
As I said, my friends have success with girls and I'm invited to my friends birthday party where there will be girls, but I'm afraid to go cause they might reject me (Stand and laugh at me), and my self esteem will drop lower than it is at the moment.
These are some of my current problems that I am having at the moment, but one of the problems I suffer from the most, is that I can't talk normally to my mum and dad. I have no idea why, it's like when I'm with my mum/dad (they are divorced) I'm a different person. I want to like them, but at the same time they sorta make me want to kill someone. I know what you're thinking, this isn't a big deal cause everyone hates their parents, but I just feel so bad about myself when I after a family dinner haven't said a word or has been negative to my parents. I can't get myself to tell them I love them, and they think that I hate them, they've told me.
My brother is a mess, I won't even start. He's not social and he's aggressive, he is a massive wreck and I decided long ago that I would let him sail his own ship. Whenever I try and talk to him he either answers back or punches me, and he refuses to take commands from our parents. He once left home cause he had to do the dishes.

TL;DR: My friends have success, I don't therefore I feel bad about my life and wants to kill myself.

PS: A year ago (Almost) I had really bad suicide thoughts and I've kind of started a suicide letter, cause if I'm going to leave this world I want to give everyone my two cents, bad idea or not?
