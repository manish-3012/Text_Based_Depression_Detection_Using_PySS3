Once I'm done with this quarter pound I think I'm done with this.The last thing I want is my quarter pound of weed. 
The only thinh that can make me happy and a ton of it. 

That's the last thing I wanna experience and then I'm done. I don't care about anything anymore, people around me have shown there true colors (more specifically my best friend and only friend for 7 years) 
I'm so sick of being lonely I'm so sick of dreading work I'm sick of feeling invalidated and sad and I hate that everyday it gets fucking worse. There are no breaks 
Just day by day it gets worse and worse. 
I don't wanna wake up anymore and I don't even want to go to bed anymore because that means tomorrow is coming

All my emotions have been replaced with heart ache and misery. 
Day by day I become more depressed unmotivated and hateful. I just want this to be over 
I do not care what happens to me after I die I don't fucking care I just want to be fucking dead 

And now after being ditched for the fourteenth day in a row, i sit here all alone. 
Alone. 

Happy sad or in the middle 

This shit is useless anyway. 
I'm as important as video game NPC.
