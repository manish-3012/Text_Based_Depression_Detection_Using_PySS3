I got nobody want life to endEverybody has fucked me over and given me fake love. Everytime Life starts to get better fucked shit happens. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore I been wanting to kill my self since 2015. I give people love just to get stabbed in the back. Iâ€™m gonna be homeless in a few months the pain is just gonna keep coming life is only gonna get worse. Think I might as well just end it now , finally no more pain. Sucks thereâ€™s no easy way out. Wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up. Itâ€™s my life I should be able to decide when to leave. Life ainâ€™t worth living when I get no happy days only pain
