Help please itâ€™s urgentIâ€™m in a really rocky spot right now. Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression for years now and the urges keep getting stronger to end things. I donâ€™t know what you can say to help but if you can give me any possible hope. Right now I have none. I think Iâ€™ve just lost my best friend of 11 years, my mom died, Iâ€™m still in the closet, and I keep getting in the way of things, I see no up and Iâ€™m only 18 so it just seems like it will only get worse. Everyone says being this young are your best years but if this is my best then I donâ€™t want to see the future. I need a reason to stay and I canâ€™t find one on my own so here I am turning to the void we call the internet.
