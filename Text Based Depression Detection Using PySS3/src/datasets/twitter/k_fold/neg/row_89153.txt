Looked for helpI am very depressive and finally looked for help. My boyfriend broke up with me and i feel even more worse than ever. He said he would like to take a break with me. So it be. But in my mind i remember how he said he would support me and help me. Now he is isn't by my side anymore. Idk how to feel about it... Yeah.... But this is not the point. 

My sisters looked for help for my. Finally. I couldn't reach out alone for help. I am grateful for having them. Cheering me up and pulling me out of my bed. I want to write how my theapy goes one. Starting tomorrow i will be taking some medicine. Antidepressiva.
I really scared but i hope for the best outcome. I shouldn't be alone for the first few weeks... Idk what that mean... Okay maybe those pills could kill me if i wanted to and i have more pills.... 
Did you knew that overdosis can't kill pepole? Most of them are not that harmful. Just vomitting and having an arching belly...
Nothing more, nothing less.
Lets see if i am getting better after this whole thing 
Wish me luck please
