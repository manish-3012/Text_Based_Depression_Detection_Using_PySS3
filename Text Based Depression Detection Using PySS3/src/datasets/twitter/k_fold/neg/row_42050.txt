im at school and i cant focus.all my life ive done nothing but sit down, listen to lecturers, take tests. all my life ive tried to get good grades but when your parents threaten to take away your lifeline to the outside world daily, along witht he endless bullies who tell me to hurt myself and killmysef because im worthless, you start loosing hope in some stuff. Honestly the only thing keeping me alive is My boyfriend, but ive been having some strange thoughts. I know that if i were to kill myself he would too, and than a lot more people. I want to do it... We can all move on and be happy in a place that isnt this one. What ever happends after we die, i know ill see them there. So... i think i should... Im gonna kill msyelf so that i and everyone i love can finally be happy and out of this shit whole of a world.
