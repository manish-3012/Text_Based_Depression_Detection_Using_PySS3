I'm out of timeI don't know how many more times I can keep doing this.  I want to die!  Is that so fucking complicated?  The people around me, the job I have, the life I live, the Gender I have; all these things depress me(what does that even mean)

Called the suicide hotline(what a waste of effort), spoke(texted) friends, called my mother(no answer)   so I guess it's just you guys.  We should just buy some guns and end it all.  It's all fucking worthless, we are fucking worthless.

Even my alcohol doesn't work anymore, anyone have any good ideas?  is the answer at the bottem of this bottle?  Are some of us just born broken?  

Ignore this post, I'm drunk.  So one of two things will happen, either this is my last post ever(fucking finally done w/ life), or I'll be back in a week crying over myself pathetically
