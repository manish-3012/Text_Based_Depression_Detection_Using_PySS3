I donâ€™t know anymoreI just canâ€™t figure out what to do anymore. I can feel my life going down and crashing and I donâ€™t know how to take it anymore. Iâ€™ve been so tempted to hang myself or OD on something but I canâ€™t bring myself to do it. I was 8 months clean of self harming and I just went and fucked that up by getting drunk and cutting myself. I just canâ€™t anymore. This life wasnâ€™t me for me. Nothing positive has happened and anytime I try to change myself or anything around me it never works. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
