I wish I could talk to suiciders who are happy with their decisionIâ€™ve read plenty about failed attempts and how people regret jumping immediately after, but I wish I could talk to the ones who suicided and found peace. I wish I could speak with them and hear them say â€œyes - stop fighting and embrace eternal rest - your suffering isnâ€™t worth it and youâ€™ll see soon enoughâ€.
