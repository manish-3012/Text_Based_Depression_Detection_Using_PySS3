Iâ€™m so close to killing myself I donâ€™t know what to do.I have been on the verge of killing myself since 7th grade. A few years back I came out about the situation and my dad ridiculed me for it and grounded me. Ever since then Iâ€™ve been on the verge. Since then Iâ€™ve found a woman who makes me very happy. Currently Iâ€™m out of town age will be with my family for all of Christmas break since Iâ€™m a minor. Which is causing me to struggle. Iâ€™m just scared of losing her because then Iâ€™ll have no reason to live. I feel like I have no one to talk to. I canâ€™t talk to family since Iâ€™ll just get in trouble, I canâ€™t talk to my girlfriend since sheâ€™s already struggling mentally as it is. I just donâ€™t know what to do.
