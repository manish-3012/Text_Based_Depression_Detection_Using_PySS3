Plastic surgery is my only hope of ever finding any affection from anyoneI've been mocked my whole life for a deformity on my face that isn't my fault and I'm a GIRL so nothing but my face matters and I know this from studying society and just general experience and all that inner beauty blah blah blah makes me want to murder people. It's like rich people saying the material doesn't matter meanwhile it's worse because affectionate touch is a human need. yeah yeah i know get a dog or whatever if that helped i wouldn't be writing this.
i don't even know, i want to live and to love but maxillofacial surgery is expensive i should've had it when i was a kid but my country was in the soviet union then and the so-called doctors didn't give a crap if i looked like a circus freak all they cared about was if i could breathe and eat then insurance wouldn't pay for any surgeries.
worst is i am not religious so i don't get to find comfort in some sky daddy that loves me despite my dna. there is no such thing as love without the right dna if you're a woman.
