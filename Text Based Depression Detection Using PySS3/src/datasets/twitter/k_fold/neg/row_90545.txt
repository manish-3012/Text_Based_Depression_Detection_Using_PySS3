Help me save my friend.I'll call him Johnny.

I met Johnny two years ago in school. He seems like those troublemakers in school, and funny enough, he is. He smokes weed (nothing wrong with that but he does it to the point he doesn't do or spend on much else), makes fun of people, and gets failing grades.

But I know he can change.

You see, the more I got to know him, the more I realized he was forced into this. His parents divorced when he was very young, and still meet from time to time just to fight. His mother works hard but she really feels like he doesn't amount to anything. 

But he's a bright kid. Even got him to join the chess team. You could see that while he was playing, he was different, he was kind, he was gentle. He likes reading (especially Harry Potter) and playing video games. But outside of it, he breaks things, swears and generally causes trouble. I realized he liked one girl in the chess team because when she started flirting with someone else, he said the most horrible things to her just to make her cry.

Recently things took a turn for the worst and he began taking more potent drugs like Vicodin and Heroin. I'll leave the rest of it out but it ended up with him in psychiatric care. 

Anyways there are a lots of kids out there like this, but when I talk to this guy, when there's no one else, you can see the pain, and the hurt, the feeling of inadequacy. If I don't do something soon, it's a horrible thought but he could end it any second as we speak.

I just need to know what to do because the occasional Facebook poke or text message isn't enough to show this bro the love and attention he deserves. 

Sorry for the long text but I really hope you guys can help. Thanks.
