I just don't want to be alive. (Stupid title, fuck off)I matter to nobody. I can't stick to the things I promise myself. I've made too many mistakes, and in spite of having gone through so much shit because of those mistakes I still end up repeating them over and over again. 

I cannot do this anymore. I just want to quit. I just want this to end. 

Cyanide seems to be the best way, but it's a bitch to get a hold of. There isn't enough place or space to hang myself. Idk maybe I'll jump off of a tall building or something. 

I want to vent and scream and just.. express.. but there's nothing left in me. 
A part of me wants to get better, but the other part of me wants to quit life. I'm in a constant battle with myself and I just can't seem to win. 

FUCK THIS SHIT. FUCK IT ALL.
