hihello. I'm a transgender boy in high school and I hate everything. I hate my family, my life, the place that I live, everything. I can't take this anymore. I told my girlfriend but I know she doesn't want me to do HRT. I can't just force her to be a lesbian. Also, I don't feel like I'll ever be a real girl. I'll still have my extra Y chromosome. I hate looking in the mirror. I hate my hair, body, skin, adam's apple, eyes, face, all of it. I hate everything. I've been contemplating suicide since I was 11. I can't do this anymore.
