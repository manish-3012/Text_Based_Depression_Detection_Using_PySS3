It's all too muchOne of my only redeeming traits is a philosophic type of mind and a hunger for knowledge. But my ego is such that I give up, or I think I'm better than something, or someone. My standards are uniformed and impossible. My effort is near non existent. I know this could be a great time in life given the opportunities and resources but I've made it a negative time.

I don't really know how to be a regular person and just shrug off something after actually trying and move on. I just recently alienated a friend because as a bisexual I sent him a wall of text and he said it was a misunderstanding. But for normal people that means I won't contact you or hang out anymore. So fuck. I'm alone and I've made myself that way.

How can I be a normal 20 year old when I have shitty social skills, no sense of style, a pretentious ego and I'm stuck at home with no driver's license or job (nor experience)?

I don't know what I'm looking for, where to start or what. I have therapy. I have pills for bipolar disorder. But I'm stuck catching up as people have good times. Do you know what I mean?

Sorry for this rambling wall of text, I Just feel like shit and am thinking about suicide.
