Well hello thereI'm 14 and it might seem like I'm just trying to be edgy, but please listen. So basically I always had some bad days and that's alright I get that, but these past two years have been really rough for me since I suddenly started really hating myself and then I realized no one actually likes me. Not my family or school because I don't have any friends. I'm shy so talking to girls is a nono and I'm fat, ugly, untalented and just boring. I just feel like I'm just a background character but somehow I was cut from the story. And especially this past week or so, I've been just crying at night quietly so no one can hear me because if I was heard I'd be told to stop or be yelled at. They might ask me but what would I say? It be awkward. Also I found that I really want to die and when I feel extremely stressed I just hit myself in the head or choke myself really violently in hopes that I would just die. Idk I just feel like everytime I try, I just get hurt and fall down. I get up and retry I get hurt and fall down. If I just kept laying down I keep on suffering. How much can I take of this? Am I just doomed to live like this while other have it much better? If I died would anyone REALLY care? No one cares now so why would they? Does it get any better? I make jokes but so unfunny. Is it just a phase? Am I supposed to just walk it off and ignore it? I'm just confused.

Also English isn't my main language I'm so sorry for any mistake.
