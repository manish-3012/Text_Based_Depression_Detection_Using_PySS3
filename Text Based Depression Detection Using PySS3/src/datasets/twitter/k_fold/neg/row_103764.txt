Iâ€™m sorryIâ€™m sorry to my mother, who will never accept my apologies.

Iâ€™m sorry to my father, that I canâ€™t stand to live with you.

Iâ€™m sorry to all of my friends who found out that I was hospitalized for attempted suicide.

Iâ€™m sorry to my boyfriend, I want to stay with you  but I just hate being alive.

Iâ€™m sorry to my boyfriendâ€™s parents, who care about me like Iâ€™m their own daughter. You showed me a bit of what itâ€™s like to have parents.

Iâ€™m sorry to my grandparents, for making you think I was manipulating my boyfriend with suicide. Iâ€™m sorry you didnâ€™t think I was serious. Iâ€™m sorry that now itâ€™s all I can do to keep lying about how well Iâ€™m doing until one day youâ€™re planning my funeral wondering when you stopped noticing things.

Iâ€™m sorry to the people of reddit, reading this late at night. Listening to the ramblings of a dumb bitch who no longer has the courage to kick the bucket. Who is, and always will be, tied down by guilt.

And Iâ€™m sorry to myself. For letting you be weak once and letting it get the best of you. Iâ€™m sorry that I couldnâ€™t take care of you. Iâ€™m sorry that you will continue to suffer for an indeterminate amount of time.
