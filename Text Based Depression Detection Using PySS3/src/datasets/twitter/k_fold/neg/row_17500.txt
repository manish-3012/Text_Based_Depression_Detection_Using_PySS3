I cant get over my ex after 3 years, friends think I'm crazy, I see no future.I want to share details of our relationship, but I've become so broken and fragile to the point that if anyone defends her and her new boyfriend, I'll have another breakdown. So to protect myself I'm not going to share the details of our relationship. I'm on thin ice.

&amp;nbsp;

I just turned 20 recently, I broke up with my ex when I was 17 and have not been able to get over it. She was my first love and we had an on and off relationship for a year, We were very much in love. Eventually I became nothing to her, not even a friend, so I removed her from my life. I'd probably be in more pain had I stuck around my ex as a friend. The nasty ending has altered all the strong energy that was once love, into hate.

&amp;nbsp;

It's been 3 years since we broke up. I have no faith in my future, I was social in high school and university has made me a shut in. All my irl friends from highschool are out of the city and I can't see them, no luck with making friends in university. I have online friends which are the only thing keeping me relatively sane. I have brought up my issues with my ex to them before, and they all don't understand. It seems everyone understands that breakups hurt, but once the pain extends beyond a few months it becomes un-relatable. I've been called crazy for being so illogical and stuck on the past. They might not be wrong, my logic has been skewed after what happened. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
The issue is, I want to confide in my good online friend, but I fear I might scare them away this time. If they think I'm crazy, avoid me, and I loose them. Then there goes the last but of sanity I had left. I don't know if it's better I hold it in, and keep it to myself, or be honest with my friends.

&amp;nbsp;

I was doing fine, getting better, and then I checked my ex's facebook profile. Once again, I'm not going to share details in order to protect myself, but it's brought me back to ground zero. I see no future for myself. 

&amp;nbsp;

What I saw on that profile has made me snap. I started smashing everything in the room, the mirror, the computer. I grabbed a knife but didn't have it in me to do it. My dad threatened to call the cops on me, and then I realized he wasn't on my side anymore. It's me and my issues on my own. I had a good loving relationship with my dad until now.

&amp;nbsp;

I have lost all sense of pride, and dignity I ever had. I was doing so well until I checked that profile. Now I'm at the point where I'll have to buy a prostitute to feel loved, and then end everything.

&amp;nbsp;

I was a normal person before I left my ex, everything just fell apart. I wish I never met her so I could be a normal person living a normal life.
