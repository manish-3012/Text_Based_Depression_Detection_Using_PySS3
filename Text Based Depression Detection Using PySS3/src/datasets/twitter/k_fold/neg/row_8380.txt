I just donâ€™t know anymoreHello everyone, Iâ€™m a 19 yo male that has been having suicidal thoughts lately . Iâ€™ve been depressed and stress these past 6 months and Iâ€™m getting to the point where the depression is just taking over. There are nights where I lay on my bed and think about the pain Iâ€™ll endure if I tried ending it all and I list in order what way would be easier and less painful. Iâ€™m starting to hate my life and how I try to express myself but then get called bipolar and then brushed off . Iâ€™ve been crying for help but no one seems to take me serious like if I was born with no emotions. We all have our ups and downs flaws and perfections but people think I have it good but in reality Iâ€™m close to finding a way to relieve this pain.  I think about how Iâ€™ll be better off not knowing where I am or how I feel because Iâ€™ll disappear the only thing left will be my body that brings up my problem I have now knowing how the pain Iâ€™m going through will be passed to others. I have thoughts of going to an isolated location so that people just think I disappeared or ran away. That might be the only way for my loved ones to not know what I have done. 
That really is the only reason why Iâ€™m still here and you are reading this but everyday itâ€™s seems like ending it will free me. I just canâ€™t take this feeling anymore. Trust me though Iâ€™m trying.
