Waiting around to dieAnother day at work, crippling pain in my glimpsed ass leg from working here, no love in my life and so deep into drug addiction there's no turning back. Some of us weren't made for this earth, I'm so over it. I see flickers like the streamer Ice Poseidon who grew up rich, had a nice family life with friends through adolescence, and now gets to ball out basically doing nothing. I can't help but think, why even try to catch up when I'm handicapped this fucking hard. Just waiting for my check Friday so I can grab some dope and some needles and pretend I'm happy for a night.
