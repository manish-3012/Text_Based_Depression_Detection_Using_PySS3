Is a six story tall fall enough to kill me?I'll be honest I wanna kill myself, I've missed months of schoolwork and my parents wanna kill me. I'm scared I'd survive the fall and make everything even worse. Thanks. A park is beside the building so I might fall onto grass instead of concrete. Please do not comment anything besides an answer to the question. I've already made up my mind. Thanks.
