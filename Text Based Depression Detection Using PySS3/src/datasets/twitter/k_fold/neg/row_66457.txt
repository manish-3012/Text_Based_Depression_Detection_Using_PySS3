Catch 22If Iâ€™ll get medicated to treat my depression I get kicked from my position Iâ€™m in. Therefore get even more depressed.

If i donâ€™t medicate myself and numb myself Iâ€™ll get more and more depressed. 

I wish my brain wasnâ€™t fucked up. I wish I didnâ€™t have to numb myself. I wish I wouldnâ€™t go to sleep crying every night. I wish I didnâ€™t have this voice in my head telling me to harm myself. I wish I could go for one quiet night without having to drink a couple of glasses. I wish I wasnâ€™t this weak. 

I wish I wouldnâ€™t relate to you all so much.
