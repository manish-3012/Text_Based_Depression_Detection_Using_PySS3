Ruined my reputation in my family. I can't see how this ever ends well.Short story: I viciously attacked my adult niece via Facebook PM a few nights ago over the way she treats her kid and her family. I am nw shunned and hated by my wife's family.

Long story: My uncle died around 10 days ago, not too unexpectedly, but my mom and dad found his corpse. My mom is obviously upset. My uncle's life was deeply troubled from abuse, drugs and various other things. I have been emotional about this as well. And I drink. A lot.

Saturday night my wife goes to her sister's house (grandmother to the kid in question, mother to the niece) for the little kid's birthday party. I stay home as I have been helping my mom and dad a lot. So I drank. And I stewed about my niece. She has abandoned one side of her family as she thinks they have chosen her ex-husband over her. She's using the child as an emotional tool. She's caused all kinds of issues, and has made my MIL cry a few times as she has just cut contact: drops the kid off, won't leave the car, etc.

So I had the genius idea to call her out about it on Facebook. I got really, really mean. Now my wife's side of the family is immensely angry and betrayed by me. My wife is barely talking to me, and has told me several times how bad the situation is. She's been getting an earful from everyone. I have made sincere apologies to the family members I have contacts to (it's a big family, not everyone is on social media).

I cannot see a way out of this. I know I ruined the lives of others and I have ruined mine. I have been researching where to get a gun, and have been planning suicide. This will take some doing for logistical reasons, but I have had a rocky relationship with my wife recently, my parents are grieving and I have other problems. I've been unemployed for almost a year and I drink too much.

I guess I'm asking for help. I just can't live like this.
