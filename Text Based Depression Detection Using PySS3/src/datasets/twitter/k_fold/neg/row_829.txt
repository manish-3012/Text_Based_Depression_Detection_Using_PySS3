It feels like I have no purpose in livingI feel like my life has lost all meaning, and while I have purpose within my family and friends, I donâ€™t believe that itâ€™s worth it to stay if I have no reasons of my own. The only reason I canâ€™t do anything is the guilt I would have in hurting my family and friends, but in the end, I feel like I am empty inside. The days are passing so quickly and it feels like I am wasting my time on Earth dying slowly, so might as well get it over with for the sake of time. I wish I could stop feeling this way, but it has been so long with no change, and I just donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold out feeling so low and meaningless.
