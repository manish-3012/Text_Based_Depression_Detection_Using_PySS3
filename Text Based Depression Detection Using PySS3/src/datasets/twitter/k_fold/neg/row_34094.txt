Forbidden SuicideI want to die so so so badly. I am codeoendent and have been in therapy, on (wrong) medication for a year. I have tried so hard to better my life but I can not do it. I suffer so much every single day. I have never eyperienced an actual friendship. I've been abused literally all my life.

I just want my life to be over. I wish to have some illness so I can die.
I can't commit suicide because it would make my family (especially my little cousin) so sad. I can't do it to them...

Anyone want to shoot me or kill me some other way?
