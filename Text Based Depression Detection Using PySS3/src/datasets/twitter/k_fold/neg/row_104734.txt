Last night, I tried to kill myself in front of my brother and my mother.It is not easy for me to do this. I do not like sharing too much about my personal life. But I am filled to the brim and I can't take it anymore.

I will not diagnose myself as depressed. That is beyond my qualifications. I can, however, say that I am tired. It is not a secret to me, friends, and family that I have a physical problem. I have an enlarged heart that leaves me susceptible to complications like stress and heart attacks. 

But I can count on one hand the people that know AND understand the psychological, emotional, and spiritual beating that I go through every single day. I have kept it hidden when I should've known much better. I am sure you guys have your own problems, worse or otherwise. A lot of you have talked about it, probably.

And that is what set us apart till now. You talk about your problems. 

I don't.

So for the sake of my own life, I will do so now because I need help. I feel so helpless.

There are 3 of us brothers. We could always relate. But for a year now, one hasn't been living with us. He has a kid now. A very handsome kid at that. He's a little bundle of joy. The other one is still here but it's not the same. He's supportive but he doesn't listen the same. I need to let things out. 

I'm tired because my laptop was stolen. I'm tired because my phone was stolen. I needed those because I was always required to deal with editing, writing, consultation, project initiatives, and the like. I am tired of being judged. I am tired of no one listening.

These are things I love. I love going to school, I love being a student leader, I love being in love. When I'm anywhere but home, I am in a happy place and in a happy state. When I'm home, it's different. I am blessed to have been financially provided for and... that's that. I never had familial support that I see on TV, in other families, or what people tell me as normal. No pep talk, no personal stories of inspiration, no "you can do it!"

I survive college being a good person and I am reminded every day that I have to split the bill immediately when I get a job.

No "congratulations, you're almost there" or "I'm proud of you".

I do get the usual "We'll need help financially when you get a job" which is REASONABLE. I mean that. But immediately after that I get the "worthless, useless, and UNGRATEFUL" line. I help around the house when I can, I ask permission to study, I try not to be an ass.

I am not allowed to have friends. This is serious. If you are a known close friend of mine and my mom sees you coming to our house with a good heart and just wanna hang-out/talk to me, she'd hurt you. 

One time I had a defense for a paper in my 3rd year. I had my group mates with me after the defense and my mom was waiting outside the school (because she didn't believe I was having a defense so she went to school with me).

We have specific displays of respect in my country and my friends were kind enough to approach my mom first and she just went off on them. Calling them sluts for hanging out with me. WHILE I'M RIGHT THERE.

Why would I need friends, she asks. When I can talk to her. Problem with that is every thing I say is judged, refuted, or if I'm lucky, she'd just ignore it. For my problems, wrongs, I explain. Same thing. Brick wall.

If I go home too early or too late, I get scolded. Even if my parent's in a good mood, I can't sleep early because it is somehow suspicious and I get shit for it. So I study, and things being right now, I have to use a laptop. That's wrong because in their age they didn't need laptops. That's fine, I will understand that.

Now none of the things I have said so far relates to the title. I'm getting there. I'm sorry.

I go to school almost every day. I learn, I interact, and I have had fun. But of course, I get tired, right? That's the first part. I'm physically tired. Easily remedied with a good night's sleep.

I go home to eat, I do that. I try to get some rest, I usually can't. Especially if there's something my mom's angry about. 

So I go to school the next day, tired. I become even more tired. And I go home, and the cycle goes like that. I try to understand because this is my parent we're talking about. I have to respect them. And I honestly do but I can't take that anymore.

Because for this entire school year, I feel the problems coming from that. I get exhausted, my heart starts to signal for brakes and I need to rest. I can't so I stay out of home and do things that could give me some relief. 

I do volunteer work, I work as a student leader, whatever works.

But as the cycle goes on and on, I am exhausted. I feel it seep in to my work. The same work that has been giving me the love and support I have always wanted and I feel like I let everyone down. In school, I hear a lot of things. Whispers and words that people don't think I hear. People I don't even know and I go on because dammit I am too tired to care about this when I have my own problems at home.

I am coming to terms to the fact that I am not fit to continue doing anything because I have so much baggage. 

Last night, I got home late because I hung out with friends for a bit. It wasn't even close to midnight and I had a hard time going home because of the rain.

I'm soaking wet, and emotionally, physically, and spiritually drained I went inside the house.

I get screamed at, berated, explanations ignored, and my brother is just trying his best to calm me down.

I broke. I went to the kitchen and got our knife. I know not to cut sideways but through the veins. 

Before I tried to do it, I talked to my mom as she's looking at me with that knife. I poured myself out, my problems, my grievances.

And... she talked to me. Calmly.

She said "Think of me when you do this. I am old, I am sensitive..." and I just blanked out after hearing that. I heard something about her own anger.

I put the knife down, because then and there I knew that I could never reach this person. None of what I said was ever addressed. My hardships, my hurt, my helplessness. None. What we talked about afterwards are the same things we talked about before I tried to kill myself.

It's as if nothing happened. 

It was about 2am before things cooled down but I was blank long before that. It turned to a normal routine. I had to massage and while I was doing it, she's telling me of how I don't massage her properly. How she can't go anywhere nice like Rome because she spends too much on us. How she wasn't able to go to a nice massage place because I got home late and, of course, she wasn't able to go to the clinic to get checked up because I wasn't there.

Fuck. I never felt so worthless.

I asked for help. I put myself out to my own family. MY PAMILEE.

I just shut up. I went out today, I will study. I will distract myself, maybe watch a movie because I can't deal with anything today. I don't know what I can't deal with today but I just can't.

Today I settle businesses that need to be done but after that, I will take a break. 

I'm sorry if you had to read this. I just had to get it out.
