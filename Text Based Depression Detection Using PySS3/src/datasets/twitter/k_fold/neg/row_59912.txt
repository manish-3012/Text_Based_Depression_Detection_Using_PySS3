birthday gift to me (grateful for self-love) - Day 17On August 4, I tested out the Williams, Suicide Technique,

&amp;#x200B;

On December 17, In a dark spiral of despair, I had written the letters.

&amp;#x200B;

On the 1st day of 2019... well, there was not meant to be a 2019 for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Today the 17th of January, I'm having another birthday.

&amp;#x200B;

and for 17 days, I've been on a pilgrimage of self-healing and self-love through a personal daily project.

&amp;#x200B;

What are you grateful for?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm grateful for gratitude bridge as a way to self-love.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an inner group of people who are aware of this project and the depths of depression that I have been in.

&amp;#x200B;

In sharing this particular video, I will be sharing this message with people I know, who are not aware of this darkness that I've been in.

&amp;#x200B;

In putting myself out like this, I am risking opportunities around, employment, business and other types of relationships based on peoples personal judgments.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting this project was a last-ditch attempt to find closure around a series of events over many years that have ripped me to pieces and left me with a total lack of trust in people and the integrity of humanity in general.

&amp;#x200B;

Each assault, theft, lie or betrayal has had a stacking effect on me, and the damage has meant that I have been making less and less rational decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

This project is about taking an intimate look into my coping mechanisms around expectation, caregiving, trust, perfectionism and the inner turmoil that shatters me through betrayal.

&amp;#x200B;

The primary purpose of "Gratitude Bridge" is to provide a way for me to heal and also to expose the inner thinking of people with Major Depression so that other people might heal or support them.

&amp;#x200B;

The central theme of this project is the simple spiritual principle of "Gratitude."

&amp;#x200B;

The other principal I am employing is mindfulness via journaling, daily reflection, storytelling and videography of this amazing Sydney Harbour Bridge.

&amp;#x200B;

today, I am grateful for project "Gratitude Bridge"

&amp;#x200B;

What are you grateful for?
