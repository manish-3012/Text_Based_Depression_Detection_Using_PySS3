I really want to fucking escape (bullying and shit.)let me start from the beginning
i was neglected and abused for the first 12 years of my life. 
i came to live with my father when i was 12.
i was raped when i was 10.
and since i came to live with my father i argued, struggled, was made fun of by the other kids, etc. for my mental illnesses and the behaviour it produced.


but im ok. that shit fest is done with. im ok ish now.

until then. i hit sophmore year of High school.


i have a stepbrother, i consider us semi close, but some things push me away from him. hes best friends with the girl thats bullying me, ruining my life and pushing me back into depression and self harming behaviours. he knows im suicidal over it, but he wants everybody to like him and refuses to ask her to stop, despite family bonds. it triggers my PTSD from the years of bullying i faced through in middle school, and even worse, she convinced one of my trusted boyfriend to send her photos of me which she spread. it fucked me up bad. shes consistently at me nonstop and hell, my brothers even in a group chat she has specifically just to have people make fun of me. shes spread false rumors about me to my closest friends so theyll abandon me, and its fucked. i dont know what to do. i know my brother talks about me behind my back, making straight up lies and accusations of me to people just to make himself likeable because he cant stand people not liking him, but obviously doesnt mind fucking me over like that. im sorry, this really needs to be in a venting subreddit, but im at my wits end and dont know what to do. ive attempted multiple times, and i think a hopefully succesful attempt is soon.
