I've always been on the sadder side of life but never seriously considered suicide because of the pain. Now I have a way of doing it in a pain free way and I'm seriously contemplating it...It's hard sometimes when you've got a perfect life on paper but inside you're a wreck. You've got no real reason to be sad yet you dont wamna live anymore.

I've never been serious about suicide. I always just took it one sad day at a time flying under the radar. The idea of shooting myself or jumping of a building is just too much for me to handle.. Now I've got a way out if I really wanted to do it. And the scary thing is a part of me does  wanna do it so fucking badly.. I feel like such a shit for wanting this. So many people would kill to have my life and here I am wanting it gone.. I don't know what to do anymore or what to say or think or anything.. And the thing is I don't have anyone I can talk to about this because I'm not close with my parents at all. It's part of the reason why I feel like this. And all my friends would think I'm fucking crazy. I don't know what to do...
