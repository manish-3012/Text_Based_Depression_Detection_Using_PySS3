HELPUm...well this is my first time writing on this site so I'm kinda nervous but i need someone to hear me before die, at least someone know who i am and what i'm going through, so yeah. well im on school holidays and all my friends have decided to ignore me again. no one answers my messages or calls me or wants to hang out with. And i was supposed to go camping with my some of my friends but they said they couldn't go anymore, but i found out they are still going but their taking someone else. and i can't talk to anyone about it, my dad left when i was 1 and my mum is at work all the time while i have to take care of my 3 year old brother so i guess i writing on this site really just to talk to someone without feeling like im crazy or worthless. i don't know if that was too long im sorry if it was but i doubt anyone will even read this or if they do they probably wont care, but im doing it anyway cause this is my last opinion before i give up...
