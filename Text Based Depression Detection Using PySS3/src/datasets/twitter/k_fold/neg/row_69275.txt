What could go wrongMy life is all about me thinking what could go wrong and taking wrong decisions.
Decisions that I have been taking since the past three years, each exactly positioned me into my current state, its like one step at a time towards the shitty me today. 
Every time I made a choice, I asked my self what could go wrong, I wanted to be someone I was not, I was greedy, I was raging with repressed emotions, all while taking poor life decisions.
God, I ask for a miracle to keep me alive. I am in despair, a light of hope is all I need to keep my self running.
