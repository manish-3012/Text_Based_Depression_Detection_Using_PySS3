Worst I've felt, in a long time.About a 6 weeks ago I started sertraline for my depression and it has worked very well, after about 2 weeks all suicidal thoughts had gone, up until 3 days ago. 3 days ago my grandmother, whom I am very close to, tell out with me as I made a joke about where she lived. She did not see the funny side. Anyway since I received her phone call from her saying she hadn't eaten her dinner because she was so upset by what I said, I haven't been able to get through to her via phone and appologized again. Ever since that phone call I felt the immense sadness that 2 months ago had caused my second suicide attempt. I tried to tell myself that I was just sad about what happened but I think I knew this sadness. Its not nice, I haven't felt like this for so long. Thoughts of suicide regularly cross my brain. Although I do think it is passive suicidal ideation as I haven't actually considered suicide seriously yet. But never the less its horrible, for six weeks I felt I could go far in life and succeed. But now I see no future for myself, just a black wall. I regularly think to myself the only way out is to end my life. As I can't get a hold of my grandmother. This numbness is crushing.
