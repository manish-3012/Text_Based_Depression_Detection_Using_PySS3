Life has come to a screeching haltEverything in my life was perfect, but everything I love is falling apart. I have never had emotional stress like this. There isnâ€™t a single photo of me where Iâ€™m not smiling and Iâ€™ve never not been happy. I can tell my girlfriend of 5 years doesnâ€™t really love me anymore, my entire family decided to leave town a day before my birthday and just told me today (my birthday is Saturday), my job is becoming uncontrollably stressful, and school is overwhelming me. My teachers have assignments posted on canvas, but have literally told me nothing about what Iâ€™m supposed to be doing, my family clearly doesnâ€™t care about me, my girlfriend hasnâ€™t even saved a photo of me on her phone in 6 months, and my job expects me to do everything that I wasnâ€™t trained on. Iâ€™m literally the only night shift maintenance guy at my factory and Iâ€™m trained on 50% of my work. I feel like nothing is the same as it used to be and it will never be the way it was. I attempted suicide last year, but I loaded the cartridge in the wrong chamber. My biggest fear is that I know not to make the same mistake again. I donâ€™t know what to do.
