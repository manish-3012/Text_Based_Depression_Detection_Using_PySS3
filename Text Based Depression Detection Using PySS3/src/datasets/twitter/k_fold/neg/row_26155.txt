I just want a hug one last time before I goI can't leave. I can't bathe myself. I have no clothing to wear. I can't leave. I have no tampons. I'm trapped. I'm so trapped. I just want peace. I'm covered in psoriasis. I look like a beast. My life is over. Everything I touch becomes dirty. I can't leave. I'm trapped.
