i got caught for SH but lied about it, now i want to die much more
14 f. at school i had health screenings, i had to take off my hoodie. the school saw SH scars, and i had to go to the counselors. 

I told them that i scratched myself, because of a panic attack. because i knew that if i said that they were from razors and from being suicidal that it would become a very large deal. 

and i didnâ€™t want anyone knowing i am. they made me tell my mom or they would call her. so i told my mom, it was because of anxiety, she knows i have it, sheâ€™s didnâ€™t know i scratched because of it. which i did use to do, but the scars are definitely not because of that.

i know i shouldnt have lied about it, but iâ€™m already very stressed out because they found out. i canâ€™t imagine how i would feel if they knew about the real reason.

It sounds bad, but i donâ€™t want help. it makes me feel  much worse . i was totally fine with how i was before they found out, i was content with that. 

But now they know and i have to go to therapy and my mom is checking my arm.

all i want to do is SH, mainly because of this right now. i donâ€™t want any if this, i wish no one found out. i would be so much happier.

but i canâ€™t go back, and i donâ€™t know what to do. I only want to SH and die more because of this.

i know people want to help me, but i only feel worse. i donâ€™t want to sound ungrateful, but i donâ€™t want any of this. i feel worse then before, this â€œhelpâ€ is making me feel so much worse. I feel 10x more suicidal now than before. i really just want to die right now, but i donâ€™t have an accessible way of doing it. 

what do i do? has  anyone else gone through  something similar? honestly any feedback is appreciated. (i didnâ€™t proof read this, there may be many typos iâ€™m on mobile)
