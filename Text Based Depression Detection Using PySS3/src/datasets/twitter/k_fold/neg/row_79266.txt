I took a bunch of my sleep aid. Hereâ€™s hoping I donâ€™t wake up.I guess itâ€™s been a long time coming. Nothing in my life makes sense and my life is absolutely shitty. From the day I was born until now Iâ€™ve had to fight battles no one should have to face. Itâ€™s a living nightmare. Some people arenâ€™t meant to be alive. Some want to yeet out when they no longer find a purpose or drive to do so. My eyes are open to how awful life really is. And I have had to have been born with the worst luck ever. I donâ€™t understand what I did to be Raped, molested, jobless for almost 2 years, dumped to be homeless by an ex,abused by a parent, disowned by my family, abused by a narcissistic ex and coerced into sex with the same man, ghosted by a lover, be told I canâ€™t have a job because I have a medical marijuana card.

Iâ€™m looking at possible homelessness in the future or inability to move. Me and my roommate were supposed to move to Boulder Colorado next year but I havenâ€™t been able to find work and trying to doesnâ€™t seem to be helping at all. Iâ€™m in a lose lose situation. 

I can feel the meds working. Iâ€™m so tired. And my brain keeps â€œshudderingâ€ like flickering when I read and type this text. Thereâ€™s pressure behind my eyes and I think Iâ€™m getting a headache. 

I donâ€™t understand how the universe thinks one person should endure all this. 

Note: I really donâ€™t want any â€œgodâ€ this or that comments. Just leave god out of this. I donâ€™t believe in that so donâ€™t put it here. 

Thanks for reading this. Maybe I wonâ€™t be forgotten afterall.
