I've been thinking of killing myself latelyGrowing up I've been very religious and had a supportive family, so suicide was kind of out of the picture for me. But recently, it's seemed like my only option. I'm so tired of trying anything. Anyone that loves me either wants something from me or gets bored of me. I've longed to be special or unique in at least one person's eyes and have yet to have that feeling. Despite recent efforts to actually put myself out there and talk to and even flirt with people, I still feel lonely as ever and exhausted from any interaction. I often find myself fantasizing about killing myself, or at the very least, dying in some tragic accident because those seem like the only things that would make people hear my cry for help. I don't feel like I'm cut out for life, and rather than destroying myself with substances or drawing anything out, I feel like the best choice is to stop living.
