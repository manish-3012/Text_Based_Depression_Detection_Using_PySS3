Can't waitI was gonna wait until my birthday in a couple weeks to kill myself, but I don't think I can wait any longer. I've been abandoned by too many people this year. They're all happier without me too and that is proof enough of how shitty I am. I tried so damn hard to be the best person I could be for people even if it wasn't really me, but of course that is my mistake in the end. So much money I wasted on people who never cared for me except in a superficial manner. I've been so mentally fucked my whole life and I don't think I can take it anymore. So yknow! Goodbye! Goodbye world! I hope I succeed today! If not then God is playing a cruel joke and I am begging to get to the punchline already. Goodbye
