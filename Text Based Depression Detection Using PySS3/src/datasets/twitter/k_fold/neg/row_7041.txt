Omegle chat with suicidal manI was on omegle screwing around, and avoiding the asl kids as best I could, when a man asking for help came up. He began by telling me he was going to kill himself and he didn't have any reason to live. Now it might have just been bullshit but I tried to help out. I told him to call his therapist (he did a few times but refused) I told him to call a suicide hotline (he already had 3 times and they said they would send an ambulance if he called again.) He didn't want to go to a hospital or clinic because he said he would lose his job.
He also told me he was developing korsakoff's syndrome, he couldn't see his son anymore because he plead guilty to beating him (even though he said he didn't actually do it), his mom has Alzheimer's and doesn't recognize him, he's divorced, alone, and by the end of it I couldn't think of a single thing to say to the man that would in any way help him. 
I got a bit angry and depressed (seriously, I just wanted to screw around on Omegle during my work shift) and told him once again to call the suicide hotline because I couldn't help. The last thing he said before logging off was "I think I'm ready to die now." That's kind of stuck in my head right now.

Anyways, was there anything I could have done differently? What could I do if this situation comes up again either online or in the real world?

Also, I feel responsible somewhat. Some random guy put this burden in my hands and i didn't respond as well as I could. Am I right to feel this way?

Much love, SW
