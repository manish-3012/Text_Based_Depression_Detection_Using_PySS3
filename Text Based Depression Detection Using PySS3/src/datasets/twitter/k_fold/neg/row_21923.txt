today itâ€™s 3:32 pm and iâ€™m sitting in bed playing with the noose iï¸ made.my grandmother that iï¸ love so much is visiting downstairs and i canâ€™t bring myself to go downstairs because my dadâ€™s wife turned everyone to fucking hate me. no exaggeration, theyâ€™re all against me. iâ€™m eighteen and going to be homeless and itâ€™s cold. iï¸ have no other family. and iï¸ can hear them talking about me and how iï¸ â€œsleep until 4 pmâ€ and how concerning that is. iï¸ went downstairs and said â€œiâ€™m not sleeping. iâ€™m avoiding dad because he smacks me around and tells me what garbage iï¸ am every dayâ€. a day doesnâ€™t go by without my dad yelling at me. he completely shits on me every day and makes me want to fucking kill myself. iï¸ wouldnâ€™t want to die if iï¸ just had money to afford college or a place to stay. iï¸ have no money, financial aid screwed me, and iâ€™m gonna be fucking homeless. iâ€™m done. goodbye.
