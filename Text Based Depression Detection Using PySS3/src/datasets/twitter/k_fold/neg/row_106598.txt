Need some advice, or someone to talk toGuess the title should have been more about venting than needing advice.

I've been depressed for about a year and a half now when it first started I became bored of a few things but it never really affected my life. But now it's bad, I'm tired of school, my grades have tanked, I've stopped finding enjoyment in most things, I'll play games and shit like that not cause it's fun but to pass the time until I can sleep and repeat it the next day. It doesn't help now that I'm taking summer classes, I dread having to wake up in the morning and feel worse with everyday. I had always thought of cutting my wrists and going to sleep, recently I bought a knife and the urge went away I guess cause now I have an actual way of harming myself I don't feel like doing it. I've never really been normal compared to the rest of my family, i have anger issues and horrible anxiety. I have a girlfriend of a year and a half, she thinks I have a lot of friends but I only really talk to her and one other person I'll call her KC. I've talked to both of them about my problems, my girlfriend seems to understand it less than KC. I think she might be cheating on me with I guess you would call him a friend of ours I'll call him DB. With the classes I've failed it's not likely for me to attend prom next year, DB had asked my girlfriend to be his date since I wouldn't be able to go. They decided that was the plan a few months ago and I'm only hearing about it now, and she won't answer my questions. 

I'd keep writing but i don't think anyone would take a look at it now let alone with more text. If no one responds this helped me a bit anyways, guess I just needed to get some of it out for the night.
