I donâ€™t want to existIâ€™ve struggled with my mental health since I was 11. Iâ€™m now 22, and still struggling. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with all sorts of things and I donâ€™t know which diagnosis is correct. To top it all off, Iâ€™m transgender, FTM. Definitely not a bonus.

I dislike myself, inside and out. I am literally useless. Iâ€™m not even being dramatic. Iâ€™m incapable of so many things. The only people I interact with are my small family unit, and I had a falling out with my brother just a few days ago. 

I have self-harmed before and had suicidal ideation, but never made an actual attempt. 

I just want it all to end. I want to have not been born. I want to not exist. Why canâ€™t there just be a goddamn erase button? Seriously. If I believed in a god I would be disappointed in them for not thinking this through. 

I love my family and I love my dog, but fucking hell I donâ€™t want to be here any more.
