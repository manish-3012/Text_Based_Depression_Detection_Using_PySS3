Iâ€™m going through a mental hell, Iâ€™ve nearly killed myself a couple times, my boyfriend and family both have no idea.Iâ€™m going through my own personal hell, Iâ€™ve been getting awful derealization which means reality doesnâ€™t feel real and Iâ€™ve gotten terrible anxiety that has escalated to the point of paranoia like thinking my dog is going to kill me. At some points it seems like the only way out is death, and all this happening feels like my own fault because it all started after a bad drug trip and has been going on for almost 3 months now. 
Iâ€™m spiraling out of control and the worst part is we have no idea why this is happening, Iâ€™ve been trying super har for get help for my derealization and anxiety but itâ€™s still here and Iâ€™m terrified of living in reality sometimes. My boyfriend knows things havenâ€™t been good but doesnâ€™t know how bad, itâ€™s been hard for him to support me through this hell because he doesnâ€™t know what to do. My family knows Iâ€™ve been going through hell derealization and anxiety wise but have no idea Iâ€™ve tried to die. 
What do I do? Please help Iâ€™m terrified of dying but also terrified of admitting any of this because Iâ€™m not sure what will happen.
