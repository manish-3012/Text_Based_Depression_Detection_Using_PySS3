Who else wants to get out of here? [F/17] (RANT)Note: Just because I'm 17, doesn't mean that my life will simply "get better". No, that just simply doesn't happen for everyone.

Its very disappointing when your whole childhood is a lie. That illusion you had where you thought life was this mystical, amazing place. Where you could say "I want to be a Pokemon master" and actually believe with all your heart you could be one. Oh boy, that was me as a naive 5 year old.

I wish I was never born. I don't blame my parents for this, but I hate them for bringing me into existence. This reason alone makes me frown upon expecting mothers, despite them not doing anything really wrong. I don't know how to go out without them getting sad. The only reason I bother staying alive is because my death affects others. I wish people didn't care so I could disappear. I just wish I knew how to get access to those euthanasia drugs, or how to overdose with 100% accuracy of death.

Is there a way for someone to swap lives with me, and in return I get to be euthanized? I wish it were so. I would undergo a heart transplant to save another life if it meant I would die. Heck, I'd give my D cup boobs to a breast cancer patient if it meant death. I get so jealous of people who die in car accidents or die in their sleep. Its always the people who don't want to die too. I just want to give up my life to someone.

The only thing that would be remotely interesting before I die is losing my virginity. That might actually make me happy for a while.

Okay, my rant in over
