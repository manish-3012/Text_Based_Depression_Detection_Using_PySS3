Game over.Iâ€™m going through grief from losing a family member and heartbreak all at once and I canâ€™t take it any longer. Iâ€™ve been wanting to kill myself since 3 years but I think this is gonna be it for me. I already wrote my suicide letter and I know how Iâ€™ll do it. Iâ€™m just trying to muster up enough courage to actually go through with it.
