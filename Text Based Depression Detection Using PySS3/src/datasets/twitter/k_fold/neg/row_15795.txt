I already feel dead and maybe I amI just keep fucking up. I got out of a 5 day stay in a psychiatric facility and Iâ€™m already fucking up. People are so mean to me. And I just disappoint the people who are nice to me. I just want to lay in the dirt and fucking decay. Every time I make an effort I get kicked down again. Iâ€™m ready to be done. It just gets harder, right? Iâ€™m only 21 and I know I canâ€™t even handle being alive at this stage. I know I canâ€™t make it. 

Might try to start procuring my materials, writing my letters, and setting my affairs in order. Because I canâ€™t do it. I just canâ€™t handle anything and I know that means Iâ€™m too weak to live. 

I just donâ€™t want to be too weak to die.
