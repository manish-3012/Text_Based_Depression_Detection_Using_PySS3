I lost Â£150I know it's not a lot but as a teenager with a unemployed mother and a father who dosen't give us any money and lives in a different flat, it is a lot. I lost it because of a few things that happened online. I did not get scammed but I feel like I wanna die because I can't get it off my mind at school and other kids at school are really annoying me a lot and being mean to me mentally and physically.
