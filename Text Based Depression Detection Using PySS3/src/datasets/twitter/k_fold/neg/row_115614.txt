I want to wish you all the best.I've been using Reddit for one year and this is one of the subs i appreciate the most. Everyone is supportive, everyone gives some advise, everyone asks if we'd like to talk...
Ppl can be nice and this place can remind it to you.

It's been hard times for me and it's been hard for you all, and i know you've read it many times, but those who say nice words are genuine. I'm sure because my words here are genuine too.

I really really hope things get better. It's been a tough year because of the pandemic and many had it rough before so i hope things get better for everyone.

Hugs and love to y'all  &lt;3
