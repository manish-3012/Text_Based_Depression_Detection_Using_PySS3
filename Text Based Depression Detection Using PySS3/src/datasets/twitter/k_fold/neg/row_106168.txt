Please, just someone explain this.I have an amazing girlfriend, she is actually perfect, and we have no troubles at all. 

I just wanted to clear that out before someone says "Just go to her" or "Maybe it's your relationship" Because I know it's not her, she is flawless. And I don't want to go to her, because I really don't want to worry her or give her things to worry about.


But anyway, onto the matter at hand. I'm a 17 year old guy, living in a middle class house in the countryside. I've lived in the countryside all my life, so I've always lived on my own, but lately I've been trying to go out and socialise more.  I feel very lucky to have what I have, i.e all my possessions, friends, family... But here's the problem.  I'm doing completely terrible at school (6th form), I'm failing all my classes, and by a large amount, I physically can't do the homework, so it just gets me into more and more trouble which I blame myself for. I've tried speaking to the teachers but they say there's no reason why I can't do it, so they are no help. Parents say the same thing.  I feel like there isn't anything I can do, because I know that I won't be able to finish the workload by the deadlines, which means failing my courses.  I don't have an idea of if I want to go to university, and I don't know what the hell I could ever get a job doing, so my future looks pretty damn bleak.  Something happened lately that brought back terrible memories of what my life was like when my sister died a few years ago, so I've noticed myself reverting back to that stage.. having the same attitude, listening to the same music, crying when I have nothing to cry about, drawing in my old book of depression (was a mix between a journal and a sketch pad just writing or drawing everything that was in my head, and writing about everything I hate about myself) and finding that nothing has changed.. I still hate all the same things about myself and more, still have the same insecurities and more.. I can't talk to my close friends about my depression, because they either won't take me seriously or I just don't have that kind of friendship with them.  I can't talk to my parents as they tell me I'm just acting ridiculous about it all. I've stopped eating lately (even though I only weigh 9 stone) and I'm really desperately fighting urges to self harm, I've done it before in my past, and I can't help but look at the scars I have, I don't want to self harm because I don't want to upset anyone, even if it hurts so damn much inside, I don't want them hurting because of me.  I have the option to go to a councellor, but I know from past experience if I do, I will completely open up to them, which means I will get incredibly depressed for a very long time, and I don't want to do that because i'm seriously worried what effect it will have on my friends and girlfriend, because I don't even want to think about losing either of them. 

So what the hell can I do? I'm finding it harder and harder to enjoy life, I'm finding myself getting more and more stressed and snapping at people I care about, I find it harder and harder to keep up with school, and I'm finding it harder and harder to express myself, which is why I came on here, because it's anonymous. 

I'm quickly running out of options, I don't want to hurt anyone, that's my biggest fear.
