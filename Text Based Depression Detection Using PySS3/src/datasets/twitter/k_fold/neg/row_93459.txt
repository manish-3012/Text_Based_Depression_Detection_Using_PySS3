Why delay?I'm not entirely sure what I hope to achieve by writing this. In fact, it's probably a waste of time. I don't even have the energy to care any more. If it wasn't for "fear", I would have ended it by now. 

In fact, I have a carefully detailed plan AND have written several suicide notes in the past few months. 

Here's the story, in a nutshell:

I have suffered with anxiety and depression (and other issues) for as long as I could remember. I have been tried on various medicines since I was 8 and stopped at 20. I haven't been on any since. I have made great improvements in many areas, but as far as depression and anxiety, it has only gotten much worse. 

I just absolutely abhor myself. I was that idiot teenager that went around talking about suicide just to be "noticed". Now it's "real" and I feel "trapped" in it. 

I have NO insurance, so I could not reach out to "professionals" even if I wanted to. The only way I could get insurance is if I took a job, which I can not handle in my current state of mind.

I can't speak to my family (for reasons I'd rather not go into). I can not speak to the one and only person that could possibly help me because, quite frankly, what would I be hoping to achieve? I feel so far beyond repair, that it's pointless. 

Recently, I have known of 3 people close to me that have taken ill. It's quite ironic, isn't it? Here are 3 people that enjoy life, and could possibly be on the brink of losing it. And me? I'm healthy with no physical issues to speak of and I have no desire to live on this earth any more. Why couldn't I be the one to take ill instead of them? Doesn't that make me awful? I DESERVE TO DIE.... LIKE NOW!

Again, maybe I am just wasting my time writing this. Maybe I should just "bite the bullet", so to speak. 

WHY am I delaying?
