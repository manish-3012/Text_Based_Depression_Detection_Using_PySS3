Enough is enough, need helpBeen battling with depression and suicidal thoughts for over 10 years now (turning 28 soon) and have just reached all I can take. I need help to end this miserable life. Would choose gun but I'm too broke to afford one, so I figure hanging is the best option. What common household items will get the job done? Need to do this soon
