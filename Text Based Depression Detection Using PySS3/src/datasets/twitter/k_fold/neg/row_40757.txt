I want to end my life.I have finished to end my life.
I told my grandmother what I went through with my life.
She was the only person who understands me and loves my son.
When I am gone, I'd want to take my son with me. I know im a bad mother.
But No one cares and loves him like I do
His father is really terrible. He hurt my feelings so much. 
My son doesn't have anyone without me. 

 I'm just broken and I was so hurt by people.
I still don't know why i was born in this world..
My life was awful and so far from being happy. Maybe I'm too stupid. But i always did my best to be happy, to get a better life..
Soon I want to be gone. I hate this world. I hate everyone.
