It never stopsThoughts of suicide are always in the back of my head and I just wish they would go away. I know that people care about me and would be devastated, but I can't stop thinking about it. If I really wanted to do it I should've been dead by now, but I don't know anymore. I don't know if I trust myself to stay alive much longer. Everything would've been better if I were never born at all. I only stop myself from following through by thinking about the people that matter to me, but then it hits me that they'll be gone one day too so what does it matter. I'm sick of this never ending cycle. Why am I so emotional, everybody else is handling life just fine, but here I am seriously considering pussying out despite how good life should be for me right now. It's a constant battle of thoughts between everything matters and nothing matters. I hate myself so much, I shouldn't be feeling like this. 
I have people who I can trust to talk to about anything, but I feel so bad for being such a burden. I know they don't mind, but I still can't stop thinking that I'm such a waste. They shouldn't have to hear such depressing shit all the time, I'm such a drag. I could try therapy again, but honestly what difference does it make. Life's just about coping, but I'm sick of putting the effort into anything. My whole life will be a constant battle with these thoughts until I die. I realize I could still have good moments, but god I don't know. I don't know what to do, I just want everything to stop.
