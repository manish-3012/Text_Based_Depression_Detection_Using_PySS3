Very bad friday nightI'm not sure how to start this but here it goes. I work in a hospital and had 2 patients crash on me today for the first time since working at the hospital. To make matters even worst a hour after that my best friend tells me that she's going to kill herself by taking pills and showed me via text message on what and how she was going to do it. With her being in a different state I couldn't get to her in time. So I did the very next best thing by calling the local police department and forwarding screenshots of the text that were sent to me so that they could admit her against her will to the hospital. I don't know how to feel right now. Not sure if she was serious or not. Most places teach how to prevent or attempt to read the signs of someone that may need help. But no one ever explains what how you may feel about helping someone that may not want help. I keep replaying everything in my head but not sure if I did every thing I could. I'm unsure of her condition right now but I feel that if I could have been there I could have possibly prevented it. 

Sorry if the format is crap doing all of this on my phone.
