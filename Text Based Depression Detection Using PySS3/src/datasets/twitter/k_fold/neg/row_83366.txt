Really just want to be out of hereI donâ€™t like talking about these issues in my life to people around me because nobody knows how to react and my younger cousin just committed suicide so i need to stay strong but... fuck. I genuinely feel like life is never going to get better. Iâ€™ve been depressed since i was like 12-13 years old and Iâ€™m fucking 19 now. I was let down by my mom my entire life and suffered through various types of abuse i wonâ€™t get into but shit. Now i canâ€™t have a normal relationship with anybody and Iâ€™m stuck in my fucking head and have recently averted my attention to drugs. I donâ€™t have a job i dropped out of college and now Iâ€™m alone in a shitty town by myself in this god damn apartment. I just think maybe today is the day Iâ€™ll actually just do it. I hate to admit it but i donâ€™t care about how it makes my family feel. I feel genuinely uncomfortable being alive and being here. A week before my cousin killer himself i told myself i would and now i wish i did it first. He would have seen what i saw and he would have reconsidered. I would rather him be here rather than me because at least he had good things going for him. Iâ€™m literally just a failure. Therapy did help me in the past but Iâ€™m fucking broke as fuck and canâ€™t afford those types of things. Another thing thatâ€™s important to mention is i have borderline personality disorder so idk if that has anything to do with this but thereâ€™s that. I donâ€™t even want to ask you guys to help me out because i genuinely think that whatever is said wonâ€™t help me. 
My entire life has been sadness and pain and confusion. I donâ€™t want to be here. I really donâ€™t. 
Sorry
