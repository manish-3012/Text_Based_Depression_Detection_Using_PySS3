My fiancÃ© killed herself. I donâ€™t know what to do.I was always the one with thoughts. I talked about it a few times a week. I thought about it a lot. She never mentioned anything like it. One day I got back from work, and the bedroom door was locked. I had to break down the door, and I found her in our closet. No note. No anything. Just her. I donâ€™t know why. I donâ€™t know what happened. And now my entire life is gone. She didnâ€™t sign her will, so everything that we owned is going to her parents. Everything we bought together is gone. I had to move out because I canâ€™t be there anymore. I now live at my moms house with some random bed and a few things her family didnâ€™t take out of the apartment. Theyâ€™re blaming me, and are doing everything they can to cut me out of their lives. Theyâ€™re even trying to sue me for her engagement ring. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can do this. I need some help. I have a trauma therapist next week. I still have our dog. But Iâ€™m gone. The me who I was is gone, other than the feelings I had before.
