I think I might be unconsciously be trying to kill myself.I don't really want to kill myself.  I'm not "actively" trying or anything.  However, lately, I've noticed a lot of changes in my behavior and I'm a little concerned.  I never wear my seatbelt and I often drive drunk, as I am often drunk.  I do not like sobriety.  I usually don't take drugs but the other day I managed to put myself down cold for about 20 hours with a mix of drugs and alcohol.  That worries me a little.  I act, and feel, like I have lost all concern for my personal safety.  I don't hate myself, I'm just bored out of my mind lately because I don't have a job out of school.  My girlfriend also dumped me for her abusive ex.  Kind of been a shitty month.  I am usually a very happy and safe person, but lately I just feel like I really, really do not give a single fuck.  Something is off.  I'm not being myself and I think I am putting myself in danger.
