My dog died todayOne of the neighbors dog got out and killed him. The way he screamed for help and the way I got to him after what the dog did to him will forever be etched into my memory and honest I canâ€™t cope with that and Iâ€™m gonna kill myself. 
On top of all of that I have to deal with two drunk people. On the day that my dog died. Itâ€™s just honestly disrespectful that they have to rely on me to watch them while Iâ€™m going through. Iâ€™m honestly canâ€™t fucking do this. Iâ€™m gonna have to stay up for over 24hours to watch two people and make sure they donâ€™t do something stupid. Plus I have work tomorrow after. I honestly canâ€™t handle all of this. Iâ€™m not made to take so much stress.
