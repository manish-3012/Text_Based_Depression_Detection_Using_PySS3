Everything is falling apart around me and I canâ€™t find a way out of the collapseIâ€™m a college student studying biology. Have had 7 concussions which dropped my IQ from literal genius level to definitely not. I go to a top tier school where I am drowning in my coursework and Iâ€™m only barely halfway through. Iâ€™m gay and have been intentionally in the closet to my hyper religious homophobic parents but my brother outed me. 

I canâ€™t keep up with school, Iâ€™m cutting again, my parents hate me and my friends are nowhere to be found.

I have a noose hanging up in my room, so whatâ€™s the point?
