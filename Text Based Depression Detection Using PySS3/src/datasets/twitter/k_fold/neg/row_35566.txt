It's weird talking to someone not suicidal...It's so odd. I forgot what it felt like, not wanting to die. In a way, it made me feel better. In a way, I'm glad not everyone is struggling the way I do, because how can they be so successful and happy while being so depressed like I am?

But also, in a way, I'm glad there are other people I can relate to. That know what it's like to be depressed.
