A Friend of mine killed himself yesterday.I'm just having a hard time understanding. I wasn't particularly close to the guy, not since high school anyway. I was a few years older than him too. I met him in our high school debate team. I have a lot of great memories interacting and working with him, and I just can't believe that he's gone. He was the smartest, kindest man I ever met and he had so much potential. He was apparently set up with a great summer job, he was going to be an engineer I think and everything. And just like that he's gone. 

I dunno what else to say. It just doesn't make any sense to me, I guess.
