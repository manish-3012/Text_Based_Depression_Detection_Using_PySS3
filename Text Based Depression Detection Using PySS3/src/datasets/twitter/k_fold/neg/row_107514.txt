Sometimes I casually contemplate ending it.Life is shit. Nobody cares or likes me and thereâ€™s no point in waiting for them to catch on. Too many people around me are trying to compete with me how suicidal they are. They donâ€™t know what living like a worthless piece of shit is like.

 Everyone and everything sucks and Iâ€™m treated like an accessory every day. Iâ€™m too scared to die but Iâ€™m too fucking depressed to live. Iâ€™m not expecting to end it anytime soon and I can tolerate this awful routine I follow but i just sometimes casually think about dying and waiting for it to just happen already.
