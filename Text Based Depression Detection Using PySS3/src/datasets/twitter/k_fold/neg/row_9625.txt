I don't feel goodSo I am 17 and have been appearing for a lot of entrance tests for various colleges right now. In my country, India one exam particularly \(JEE\) the 2nd most "prestigious" exams to get into some national level colleges and also to qualify for writing the most prestigious exam of our country \(IIT\). 

&amp;nbsp;

So I \(and almost 1 million other people\) have been preparing for this exam from the past 2 years. In my first year, after 3 months I was put in a "toppers only class" kind of thing. That is when it all went downhill, I couldn't cope up, I lost interest and pretty much flunked my first year. I was shifted to the normal class for the 2nd year and I again started performing good. There were ups and downs but it was satisfactory to say the least.

&amp;nbsp;

Then it was around Jan'2018 when the classes stopped so everyone was doing self\-study for the next 3\-4 months. It was during these months that I tried to learn my first year matter because this exam \(jEE\) has the course spreading over grade 11 and 12. So I tried, but I started loosing interest and just got distracted every time i sat down to study. My mum, goes to work so I was o=pretty much alone at home for near about 12 hours and could not study anything even when I tried to. It got to the point that I invited my grandparents so there would be someone at home to monitor me but I just couldn't study.

&amp;nbsp;

My mum was pretty supporting and used to tell me not to get tensed and that if everything goes bad she would get me a seat in her companies University \(The company she works for is in the education industry\). I somehow studied for the last month and was feeling okayish about this exam. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then the exam came and it wasn't good, but I expected I would qualify for the main exam and kind of knew I wouldn't be getting a good college that were given based on the scores of this exam. My mum, checked my paper that night, despite both of us agreeing that we would wait for the results. I then gave an examination for a private university 4 days later which is kinda easier than the other paper. 10 days after that I gave 2 more entrance exams which were okayish but I was never gonna go to those 2.

&amp;nbsp;

The results came for the first private exam and I did bad \(got 20k rank out of 200,000\) then  the \(JEE\) results came and I absolutely shit the bed. I couldn't even qualify for the main exam \(74 was the cut\-off and I got 70\) . My three other friends \(we foour studied together in my 2nd year and were very good students, not the best but still very good\) had bad performances as well but 1 qualified due to reserved seats and other qualified by 2 marks \(76\).

&amp;nbsp;

I still have 2 major exams left but I am just not finding in me the guy who used to study religiously. I resort to staring at the wall for hours rather than studying from the book kept in front of me. I have lost all hope and am unable to do anything. My mum, is pissed at me all the time and i get scoldings everyday. No\-one understands how hard it is for me to study and I seriously try to do it. My dad \( lives in other state, due to job\) doesn't help my case either. He just blames me for not studying and I can't say anything. I am like that happy, friendly and comic\-relief guy in your friends group who is always happy but nowadays i am just sad all the time and don't feel like living.

&amp;nbsp;

P.S. Sorry, for the long post but I needed to get it out. Any help/motivation to study \(I have 25 days before my last major exam and have the ability to do good\) would be appreciated.
