school is ruining my mental health and i want to dieevery night before i go to sleep i pray to god to be sick to not go to school because its pushing me to the edge of suicide. being judged at school because im the quiet kid and an outcast really hurts emotionally and has ruined my self esteem. dying is starting to look like a good idea to me because at least in heaven i wont feel pain or have to go to school anymore.
