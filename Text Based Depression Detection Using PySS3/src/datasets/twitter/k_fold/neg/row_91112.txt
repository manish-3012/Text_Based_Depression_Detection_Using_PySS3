My day is tomorrow and I wonâ€™t see itI turn 33 tomorrow. I donâ€™t want to live this life anymore. I have accomplished nothing. Iâ€™m a horrible human who is just sad and takes resources away from the happy. Iâ€™m ending my life tonight. 
For over 15 years Iâ€™ve been doing everything I have been told. Hobbies, eating right, pets, flowers, journaling, coloring, working out, being outside, medication, a few tried at therapy when I was able to see someone who took my insurance. Nothing has worked. Every year itâ€™s the same thing, Iâ€™ll give it one more year and I know I can get better! Then April comes and things have just become worse. 
People are nice and say they love you on here and that there is so much to live for. I msgs from a stranger once isnâ€™t going to change my life. Iâ€™ve tried everything that is out there for me to try that the government will allow me to. Maybe I just havenâ€™t found the right therapist? Well America sucks and health care is for the rich and I am broke ass poor. 
I give up. I just wanted to say thank you to all who have msged me in the past. You distracted me for a little and it was nice.
