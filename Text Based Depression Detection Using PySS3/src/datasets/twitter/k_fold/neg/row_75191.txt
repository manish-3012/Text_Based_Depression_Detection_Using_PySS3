idk if i should go to a mental hospital or not(15f) iâ€™ve felt suicidal since march. iâ€™ve been through some IOP and PHP programs, but i still donâ€™t feel good. iâ€™m still kind of scared of what i might do to myself, but at the same time the mental hospital sounds terrifying. iâ€™d have to go to a public one and probably stay in the ER for about three days before i even got into the real psych ward. part of me just wants to let myself get worse until i finally commit, but the other part wants me to try all my options before doing anything irreversible. any advice would be nice, thanks
