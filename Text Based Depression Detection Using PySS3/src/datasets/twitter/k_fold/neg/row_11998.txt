(15M) please helpim so alone. i cant stop thinking about killing myself. im not enjoying anything anymore and i have no friends and i hate school. i dont have any talents and im useless to everyone. i cant find the answer to living. every time i get professional help i lie to them to get out of it because i get too much anxiety talking to them. only one thing in life keeps me going and thats the fact that one day i want to have a family and be a dad, but what if i never find love, my heart keeps getting broke anyway. i dont see the point. im putting this here for the possibility that someone might help and save me. I have a belt ready, but i dont want to fuck up and become a braindead vegetable for the rest of my life. i just wanna be gone. i just dont know what to do. i dont know what to think
