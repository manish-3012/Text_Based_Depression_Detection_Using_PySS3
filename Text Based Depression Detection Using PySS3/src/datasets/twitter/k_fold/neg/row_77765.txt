Goodbye everybodyI no longer feel like my life has worth so imma end it first thing tommorrow. Im all alone, got social anxiety and feel deserted in my own mind.I'm 21, I dont have a girlfriend and everyone keeps pressuring me to get one. I faked the fact that I'm going to college and dont have any dreams goals or aspirations so I said to my self, fuck it. Im just wasting my time here so might as well end it. My family doesn't understand so I decided to tell a bunch of internet strangers. Im worthless so im gonna give my space on this earth to someone that needs it. Thank you and goodbye forever :)
