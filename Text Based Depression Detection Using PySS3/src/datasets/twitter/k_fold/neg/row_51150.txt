I donâ€™t know why canâ€™t just do it; I have everything I need to. And I donâ€™t hate myself; Iâ€™m just scared shitless of my life.I feel like a little more oxy might make me give considerably less of a shit about finishing the bottle, and the Merlot. 


I donâ€™t want to live to see my prognosis unfold. Itâ€™s incurable. Painful. Scary. 



Honestly, I think Iâ€™m just hanging on for my grandmother because she co-signed my student loans. And I havenâ€™t finished because of many things, so the debt is insane. Iâ€™ve said to myself for a while now that when her time comes, so will mine.
