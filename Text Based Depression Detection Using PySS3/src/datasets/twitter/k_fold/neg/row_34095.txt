Iâ€™m so fucking doneEveryone around me is in a relationship/engaged and Iâ€™m forever alone because nobody wants to deal with my crazy controlling parents. I get that nobody owes me anything and Iâ€™m not entitled to a relationship. Iâ€™m not an incel/femcel just to clear that up. I have a healthy sex life/friendships with both men and women. I just feel lonely at times about my relationship status and feel like mean people get nice things.

Then Iâ€™m not exactly thriving career/studies wise. I got bullied out of taking the ADHD meds I needed while in college and my transcript is shit. Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to find post bac programs that arenâ€™t pre med, and to find relevant work experience. I keep getting rejected from ideal jobs too. Again, I understand nobody owes me a spot for any of these things. Simply just voicing frustration. 

All of this just bounces back to my parents rugsweeping my mental health from day 1. I will just get accused of wallowing in self pity but every time I wanted to get help early on, I was accused of  â€œthreatening suicideâ€ and wanting attention, for voicing how I felt, and begging to get help for these issues. 

 now Iâ€™m just knocked down, and can only do so much and â€œkeep tryingâ€ and getting rejected for jobs/further studies. Why bother? Iâ€™ll never be happily committed either because nobody wants to deal with the crazy in my family.
