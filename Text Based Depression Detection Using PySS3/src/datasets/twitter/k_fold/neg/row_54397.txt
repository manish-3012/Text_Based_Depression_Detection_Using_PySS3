I'm so scaredI think my husband wants me to die so he won't have to deal with me anymore. I really want to end everything, but I can't leave my oldest (the other is only a baby, so she'd be fine). I'm terrified of ruining his life. How do I hold on and stay sane enough to be a mommy? I'm terrified. I'm going to ruin my baby boy's life.
