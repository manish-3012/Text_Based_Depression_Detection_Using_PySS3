18,need somthing,not advice,maybe a miracleI'm 18 years old and in the army,turning 19 in a few days.I can't say I have ever fit in anywhere,I've always been the odd ball and the target for criticism. I can barley maintain myself,so I joined the army to fix it.I hate the millitary,the worst decision in my life.i would like to leave but I have too much riding on it,also my whole family has made careers out of it.I've always been the disappointment in my family, and when I joined it was the first time I've ever felt like someone was proud of me.I can't do it though.this lifestyle is killing me.I haven't had a decent nights sleep since I've joined and every day all I can think about is ending my own life.I've tried on a few occasions.I want help but I'm too scared to ask,soldiers aren't supposed to be like this.I'm in tears as I right this.please give me somthing,if nothing else tell me a painless way out that will work.I'm sorry I couldn't be more of a man,but Im not ment to live on this earth.
