If this next procedure turns up nothing I'm killing myselfI don't care I don't care I don't care I'm tired of people treating me like I don't know if I'm in pain or not I don't care 

I've got a bottle of opiate painkillers leftover from my last procedure so I'll take that and some over-the counter stuff. I don't care.
