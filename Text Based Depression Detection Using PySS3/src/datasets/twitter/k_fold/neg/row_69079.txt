Everyone's doing something with their life except for me?My mom and sister go to church every Wednesday and Sunday and to the doctor and therapist. My brother goes to school everyday and hangs out with his friends. I'm left home alone with nothing to do. I could go with them but it's hard for me to leave the house because of my anxiety. When I reach out for help to my family and professionals for my anxiety I just get shut down. I don't know what to do. I don't have anything to do. I don't know where to go. I don't have any friends.  I look around and everyone's doing something with their life except for me. It makes me really depressed. I'm thinking about just taking my life. My life is a waste anyway.
