I might kill myself soonIâ€™ve already been struggling with suicidal thoughts &amp; ideation, but now I really do feel as if Iâ€™m gonna go through with it. Iâ€™m ugly, fat, stupid and worthless, and it wouldnâ€™t matter if I died anyway. I donâ€™t even care about the future anymore, ik it wonâ€™t get better, so that wonâ€™t convince me to stay. I tried talking to one of my online friends about how I feel, but they were no help, not everyoneâ€™s a therapist so ofc it didnâ€™t help. Other ppl say that theyâ€™re â€œhere for meâ€ but it just doesnâ€™t feel like it, like they only say that so they wonâ€™t feel bad about not doing anything. My irl friends barely even talk to me since Iâ€™ve been isolating myself from them. They donâ€™t even try to text me at all. I just feel so alone. I donâ€™t think hereâ€™s anything to help me, and at this point idk if I even want help. I just want to die. Last night I attempted hanging myself but ig survival instincts stopped me, but I plan on trying again. Sorry if this post makes no sense either.
