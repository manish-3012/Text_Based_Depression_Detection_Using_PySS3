I was an abuser, I donâ€™t deserve lifeMy ex of one year broke up with me for someone else last December. We were an LDR for the final few months after she went back to her country. 

She tried to give me healthy closure, but I was completely overtaken by my emotions and repeatedly got drunk when talking to her, going between saying things like â€œnever speak to me againâ€ and begging for another chance. I am now getting help, because I realise my mental problems are severe and impacting others. Now, she doesnâ€™t want me to contact her, or meet up for closure like she initially offered when sheâ€™s back in the country. 

I want to send her this so badly. Feedback is welcome. 


Dear (XYZ)

With this letter, I am writing with no expectations of a reply, because I respect completely what you told me in our last conversations. The purpose of this is to send out a final message to you, now there is some distance from what happened between us.

I want to get some thoughts off my chest in a healthy and mature way, now that we are on different paths.

You have made it clear to me that you no longer want anything to do with me, and I accept that. I will make no effort to break that boundary with this letter.

I will get the most difficult part out of the way first.

When I realised what had happened in the last few weeks of our relationship, I was completely devastated. I am gradually processing what happened through meditation, counselling, and reading. It is painful to reflect on it all, but also necessary.

I deserved what happened. I had it coming to me.

You were incredibly patient with me. You tried to bring out the good in me, but I was totally self absorbed. I acted as if I was the only person in the world with â€œproblemsâ€, or, more healthily, â€œchallengesâ€, to face.

When you would bring this to my attention, I would despair and allow myself to fall into self pity, as if it was my â€œrightâ€ to do so. I behaved as if other people would have to alter their reality to suit me. I stopped any kind of self improvement; instead I hid behind a laundry list of labels and excuses. I was making no real efforts to get better.

This is called Narcissism, and there is never an excuse for it.

To be totally honest, I felt anger and devastation when I realised what had happened in those last few weeks. However, it didnâ€™t take me long to put a stop to that. I shouldnâ€™t even have been surprised. You tried your absolute best to make our relationship work, you gave me everything and more.

In return, I gave you nothing.

I made the same mistakes, and did the same awful things, over and over again. I ignored and even belittled your warnings (you gave me plenty). Every time we â€œwent round in circlesâ€, as I put it, I would find a new way to let you down. I was the one who was â€œgoing round in circlesâ€.

The relationship became toxic, your voice was silenced by me, and eventually, you found someone who you could breathe freely around, without constant fear of setting them off. That is what you deserved from me from the very beginning, but did not get. I brought chaos to your life when you deserved order. I mistreated you severely, and continually wore down your patience and trust in me.

I remember you once told me:

â€œEvery time you do these things, itâ€™s like youâ€™re an earthquake and Iâ€™m japanâ€

Even you saying that didnâ€™t wake me up to what I was doing to you. I was making you suffer and putting you through Hell. You put up with a tremendous amount of pain to try to make us work. I can only make peace with the knowledge of what you did, because the truth is that I made you do it.

I drove you away with my selfishness. I was abusive, and you had to save yourself from that. I was dragging you down to my level, and causing you misery.

The New Year period woke me up to a lot of things. My Auntie (ABC) passed away on January 9th - in her final moments, we all surrounded her and said our goodbyes. She was in a lot of pain, but I never once heard her complain about the deck of cards sheâ€™d been dealt. I was lucky enough to spend Christmas Day with her, and even then, in the late stages, she was offering me comfort and wise words. She loved children, and always looked for the good in people - I am trying to bring these traits into my everyday life. I once said to you â€œbeing nice doesnâ€™t come naturally to meâ€ during one of our arguments. That was a disgusting thing to say, especially to someone you love. You did not deserve that. You were a sweetheart in return, I said something as ugly as that to you. That is unacceptable.

It was â€œâ€˜never my faultâ€, it was always â€œsomeone elseâ€, or an illness â€œbeyond my controlâ€.

Even during the breakup, when you tried to tell me how much crap you had dealt with, I refused to honestly take the blame.

Iâ€™m sorry, in a way that I wasnâ€™t before.

Iâ€™m sorry for betraying your trust by lying about sending you something on our anniversary. Iâ€™m sorry for all the times I made childish jokes and invalidated your feelings during our arguments. I still think back to the time I made you scream down the phone at me in anguish at me a lot and wish Iâ€™d been nicer. More than anything, I wish Iâ€™d been nicer. I want you to know that I was never laughing at your pain, although I was trivialising it. I would just shut down any â€œscaryâ€ conversations at any cost, because I refused to deal with them in a way that any couple should. That is unacceptable, and not an excuse for my actions. It was wrong.

When it came to arguing, I was a coward. I still think about that night in Dorset most days. I am so, so sorry for the trauma I put you through that night. I wouldnâ€™t listen to you, and refused to take the initial cause of the argument seriously. I treated you like a bad person for questioning my cruel words and selfishness. What you were really doing was putting my character to the test, and I failed.

I should have been a better man - the good man you tried to bring out from beneath all the layers of bullshit. I should have talked things out like you wanted, rather than run and and cower from any â€œscaryâ€ conversation. When we went LDR, I became so afraid of losing you that I became bitter, single-minded, and arrogant.

Iâ€™m sorry for all the times I accused any expression of upset from you as â€œpassive aggressionâ€. Again, it was totally unacceptable, and wicked of me. But you already know all of this.

I should have woken up when you asked me how Iâ€™d feel about you going travelling with your guy friend. Instead, I avoided confronting it. You were the centre of my world, and I never showed it. I never made you feel wanted or appreciated, like you did for me.

Iâ€™m sorry for treating you like an unreasonable person when you confronted me about spending time with a girl flatmate one-on-one. I should have reassured you and made you feel safe, like you always did for me when I needed it. There were so many times that you made me feel protected. Thank you.

Iâ€™m sorry for going out and getting drunk and not letting you know til the next day. All of these things were abuses of your trust - there is no excuse. But you already know this.

And I think most of all, I want to apologise for the way I treated you during the breakup. I will carry the guilt of that with me for a very long time. I let my terror get the best of me in those last few weeks. I am doing my best now to learn to control my emotions, so that nothing like that *ever* happens again.

I was desperate, afraid, and pathetic. You should never have had to have dealt with what I subjected you to. I ignored and disrespected your free will, as well as your boundaries, repeatedly. It was the worst mistake of my life to keep the camera on while I screamed and self harmed. I made the situation collapse into chaos and terror. This is the moment I am focusing on the most in my meditation and counselling, because I gave you a glimpse of Hell itself that morning. I am ashamed behind words at that. You did not deserve to be treated like you were responsible for my mental health. That isnâ€™t a fair relationship, it is an abusive one. I hurt you so much.

As for when we were together in person, I am sorry for all the times I was â€œhot and coldâ€ towards you. Iâ€™m sorry for my bad manners and unappreciative attitude. Iâ€™m sorry for tainting your memories of Community Festival - thank you for a lovely afternoon.

Iâ€™m sorry for leaving you when you were being sick. Iâ€™m sorry for dodging all the responsibilities I had to you as a boyfriend, while also treating you like my carer. I think of these key moments most days during my meditation, and reflect on the person I was, and still am.

I am learning to be more in control of myself, and to face, rather than run away from difficult or â€œscaryâ€ situations. The image of you, sick and vulnerable on New Yearsâ€™ 2018, stays with me as a reminder to *always* do my best, even if the situation is new or unpredictable. It is not worth the pain if can cause others when you are cowardly or lazy.

There is no excuse. You already know all of this.

Lots of people have â€œbaggageâ€. Nearly everyone, in fact. Some come from abusive families, like I did. Others have physical illnesses, or lack of opportunities in life. Most people have obstacles to overcome. And we can only do our best. I *never* did my best. I took from you, took and took, as if I was entitled to your love, and never gave back. Iâ€™m sorry for causing a year of Hell for you. No one is entitled to anything - we give things to each other because we want to. You already know all of this.

I want to thank you for the time we had together. You made me feel loved, warm, and safe, like I had never felt before in my life.

Losing you gave me the shock of my life. I will not be dating for a very long time, if I ever do again. I do not want to inflict the pain and anguish you felt in someone I love ever again.

Losing you gave me the wake-up call I needed to turn my life around, because I never want to make someone go through this again. I wish I woke up in time.

I am so grateful to you. I will be grateful to you for the rest of my life. You woke me up to the damage I am capable of, and the darkness I can bring to peopleâ€™s lives if I donâ€™t become stronger, more responsible, and empathetic.

Thank you for setting me on the path to growing up and becoming a better human being. I am much more serious a person now, and think very carefully about the impact my words and actions have on others. I am learning to be stronger and sturdier with my emotions, and less fearful of expressing them (healthily). I am learning to realise that really Iâ€™m not special, and â€œthe worldâ€ doesnâ€™t owe me anything A I must work for the good things life has to offer, and the connections with people you can make.

I have a lot of work to do. It will be a very long time before I will be satisfied with who I am, and my morality.

Thank you for making me take my life seriously.

Iâ€™ll be honest, I wish so badly that Iâ€™d met you at a better time in my life ; at a time when I was more mature and stable, and a positive influence rather than a toxic one. I think I will always regret that I didnâ€™t, and that I had to learn the hard and painful way. I brought it all on myself.

I had to lose you in order to be put on the path of becoming a better person. It was necessary; it was a life-changing event. I had to lose the person who meant the most to me in the world to realise I had to change. No more excuses for putting off that change can be made.

I will *never* do what I did to you to another person again. You are a beautiful soul, and you were always many steps ahead of me in knowing what was best, such as warning me that it would not be healthy to end things on such a sour note. It took me a very long time to understand that.

I wish Iâ€™d written you letters like this when we were together. You deserved it.

Thank you for showing me love, and how important it is to appreciate and value people. You are a beautiful soul, and I was privileged to have met you, even though you deserved better.

You will always be inspiring me to be a better person, even in your absence. I am very serious about all this. Iâ€™m sorry for all the â€œsorrysâ€.

Have a wonderful life. Thank you.

Thank you for touching my life.

She doesnâ€™t want anything to do with me. She tried to make the breakup healthy and I was ten steps behind her. I just lie in bed and canâ€™t eat or wash anymore. I feel dead. Iâ€™m in chronic pain emotionally. I need her permission to carry on living.
