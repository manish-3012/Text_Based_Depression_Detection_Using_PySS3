No job, 40k of student debt, just got word one collection agency is taking me to court. I'm so done with life.I was depressed all though college, and the only thing that kept me going was "I should get my degree". It was a very obvious and easy to see end goal, so I kept going to classes, got my degree, and then thought about killing myself.

It's been 5 years, and in that time, I've made almost 0 progress. I briefly had a job at Starbucks but I quit that. I'm at home, eating myself into obesity, making no payments on any of my loans, and generally feeling like shit 24/7. Now it's gotten to the point where I just got served court papers for one of my loans.

It's not that I'm afraid about that, I literally have no money, no bank account, nothing they can take from me. I don't care about my credit (which must be at 0 after 5 years of delinquency on loans), I guess the court papers just made me remember what a fuck up I've been since 2012.

I've been sitting on my computer pretty much exclusively for the last 5 years, trying to entertain myself with YouTube and music and stuff, to keep away from the dark thoughts, but maybe this is a sign it's been long enough putting it off.
