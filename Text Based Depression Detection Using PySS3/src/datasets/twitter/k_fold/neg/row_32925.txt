xpost from /r/stopdrinking - sorry for the wall of textA week from today I'll go back into the court system due to my drinking. Any single time I've been in cuffs has been related directly or indirectly to alcohol. Every single time. When I'm sober I'm a typical contributing member of society. I have a good job, I pay my taxes on time, I have children and a wife, I volunteer weekly and get a great deal of satisfaction from that. But when I drink I have a darker side, like many others.  
&amp;nbsp;  
When I drink any semblance of logic or reason leaves my mind. I tell myself over and over "just don't drive and you'll be okay" and before I know it I'm sitting in the back of a cop car for a third time, facing felony charges. Every single ounce of me is so thankful I never hurt anyone, never damaged any property. Alcohol makes me do stupid things - driving when I shouldn't, having the kind of sex with the kind of people I shouldn't, getting arrested for things I shouldn't be doing. It's like I'm a marionette and some hidden hand is controlling me while I silently scream at myself to stop.  
&amp;nbsp;  
So I get in some trouble and have to deal with the courts for a year, stick it out then go right back to it once no one is breathing down my neck. I get drunk 3-4 times a week, not every day and not in the morning or during work. I never forget to show up to family functions and never ruin holidays. I never left my kid at the curb after school and I never lost a job from my drinking. My wife still loves me, and honestly I'm not sure why but she does. I'm still every inch an alcoholic. I didn't get in trouble every time I drank, but every time I was in trouble I had been drinking.  
&amp;nbsp;  
So here we go again. A week from today I'll learn my fate. Since my arrest I've been attending AA meetings, not because I have to but because I need to, want to. I've found a great group of really smart people who like me have that incontrollable demonic alter ego that they cannot subdue alone. I've been the happiest in a long long time since I've been sober and attending AA. My wife has complimented me on how much nicer it is to have me back around, instead of being holed up in the office by myself firing off silver bullets into my veins or turning into the incredible (asshole) hulk.  
&amp;nbsp;  
That means the world to me, but it means nothing to the courts. 7 days from now I could stand before the judge and tell him with all earnestness I've accepted that I have a very real problem and are doing everything I can to get help. He could look me right in the face and brand me a felon for the rest of my life and send me to prison for 5 years, utterly destroying anything I am and anything I could become - and taking my family with me.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I'm not a religious man but I do believe in a higher power. For once in my life I've realized that I'm not the center of the universe and this is certainly not The Truman Show. I'm not sure what happens when you die, I'm just here, right now in this moment trying to live it the best I can one day at a time. I just honestly don't know if it will be enough....  
&amp;nbsp;  
And this is terribly hard to type, but if things go horrible in court, if I become a felon or I go away to prison, I'm not going to make it. I know this because if those things happen I have decided to take my own life by committing suicide. This isn't something I ever thought I would say and it's certainly not anything I've ever entertained before but here it is, the big ugly elephant in the room.  
&amp;nbsp;  
People who do commit suicide I'm sure do so for a variety of reasons and in varying mental states. I'm sure there are people who succeed who maybe really didn't want to die, but did. The last 5 weeks of my life have been some of the most profound, enlightening and moving weeks of my life wrought with a clarity I can't ever remember having. I guess that goes hand in hand with spending the last decade getting drunk every other night.  
&amp;nbsp;  
The hardest thing of all is the impact I know it will have on my wife and children but this decision I've made has not come lightly. I've sat in quiet contemplation and meditation about this, asking that higher power to guide me to the best possible decision. This situation will undoubtedly be extremely hard for my family but all things considered, the lives of the many outweigh the lives of the few.  
&amp;nbsp;  
How could I know this? Well, honestly I can't. I can't control the outcome any more than I can't control the weather or my drinking but what I can do is analyze which scenario and its elements are more likely to produce desirable results. Being a felon means I lose my job and along with it any chance of working in my field again. In fact, finding work as a convicted felon for even minimum wage is near impossible. I'm no rocket scientist and I'm certainly not getting down on people, but even if I found a minimum wage job that kind of menial work would slowly kill me inside. Once a cat experiences a laser pointer, there just ain't no going back to the ball of yarn. That might be a bad analogy....  
&amp;nbsp;  
So as a felon my professional career would be over and with it my middle class income. Next we lose the house. Then we lose our retirement. We lose the kids college fund. We lose the savings and in time we lose each other. 20-50 years of extreme marital strain at the hands of my addictions as a young adult erode away the love my wife and I have for each other today.  
&amp;nbsp;  
It is hard but she will endure. It might take her some time but she is a strong woman and she'll find someone who "makes her dance" as she said about me 8 years ago. My family will be well taken care of financially as my particular life insurance policy has matured to cover suicide by this term. I've made some other financial moves in preparation for this eventuality as well. Most importantly, my children will still have good memories of the fun they had with me, not the shell of a broken man I would become.  
&amp;nbsp;  
So there it is, my long winded justification for a "selfish act". My therapist asked me "what moved inside you this time that was different from before?â€. It's simple really, I'm on a precipice. My life is on the edge of two very different paradigms and this is the fulcrum of that moment. My only regret is not pursuing recovery sooner because as someone once told me "you are always one drink away from your next DUI."  
&amp;nbsp;  
Sobriety is a wonderful, beautiful thing. For anyone still reading this, I want you to know that. Sobriety is wonderful and you can do it. If you think you have a problem, embrace recovery with every single ounce of strength you have because by the time you find it, it might just be too late for you.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I certainly hope it's not too late for me.
