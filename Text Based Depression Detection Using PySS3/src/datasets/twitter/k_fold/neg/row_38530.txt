I need helpHi. I am a very depressed human being with chronic pain. I hate waking up every day. I hate my job. I work with my mother in law and my husband-We do medical billing out of her home. I work very hard, despite my constant pain. I get to bring my dog to work everyday. That is literally the only reason I am still here at this job. I feel like I am underpaid and unappreciated. I want to leave my job, but my husband says he would quit this job if I quit. I feel stuck. I would rather be unappreciated by someone who isn't my "family member", but I stay bc I know I can't bring my dog to work anywhere else...  I want to fucking die but I won't bc of my dog... She is the reason I stay alive. I got her almost 2 years ago, and before her, I wanted to die all day every day. I hated everything. She makes life better. Working with my husband is hard though bc he doesn't take initiative to learn this business like I have. Then we go home and he plays his video games and I usually just go to sleep. We are together all the time but have no quality time.  I feel like I can't make it anywhere else due to my fibromyalgia and RA. I am in pain so much, I just want it to end..
