Do hotlines really help?Iâ€™ve attempted suicide 2 times, once when I was 12 and once when I was 16 or 17. 

Iâ€™m currently 19, and I go to a University that has a suicide every year. 

As of recently, Iâ€™ve been having the worst suicidal thoughts and breakdowns, primarily from the things my dad/family says to me. It just triggers something in my mind telling myself that Iâ€™m â€œnot good enough, that Iâ€™m a LOSER to my family name, plus a collective gathering of experiences in my past that have contributed into leading myself into what I personally believe to be, â€œa dark pathâ€. Either Iâ€™m a snowflake, or my parents donâ€™t believe in mental health.

I donâ€™t want to have myself convinced that I need to truly commit suicide, and increase my attempt count if it fails. 

Therefore, Iâ€™m asking those who have contacted helplines, do they actually help or are they going to be like a shitty high-school counsellor?
