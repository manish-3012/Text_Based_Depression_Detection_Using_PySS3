Disappointed with the worldFirst of all Iâ€™m not suicidal. I just want a secret place to complain without letting anyone in real life knows.

I think I have been extremely disappointed with everything since teenage years. When I was a kid, I was strongly influenced by childrenâ€™s books written by Andersen and Wilde, etc. I think I completely believed in the morality that those books encourage. But ever since I tried to become a responsible adult, I have been feeling like why is the world so fucked up? The love stories in the childrenâ€™s literature are so pure and beautiful, whereas in real life I havenâ€™t fucking even seen any happy marriage. My parentsâ€™ marriage, my grandparentsâ€™s marriage and my aunt and uncleâ€™s marriage are all fucked up. None of them divorced but everyoneâ€™s marriage is ugly. People are all selfish and had all sorts of bad qualities in their nature, such as cheating, bullying the weaker people (usually women) in the family. Some are egoistic, some are control freaks, and some are lazy as fuck and doesnâ€™t want to be responsible even at the age of 40.

Other aspects of life are also fucked up. Why are some people so poor? And no matter how hard I work, I will never be as rich as those lazy idiots who have rich parents. Iâ€™m female and why the fuck do I feel unsafe all the time, like people literally stalk me on the street? I wanted to fucking shout at him and tell him to have some respect but I was worried he would become more aggressive. I really wish that I have never been born so I donâ€™t have to fucking face these questions.

No matter how, Iâ€™m still going to live. And no matter what happens, tomorrowâ€™s sun will always rise and shine. I will do work like a donkey and have fun whenever I can. Fuck everyone. Fuck everything. Fuck you all. You are very welcome.
