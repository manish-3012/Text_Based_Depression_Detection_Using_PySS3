Other nurse hurt my feelings. Iâ€™m 28, sheâ€™s 65I am a nurse at a very busy hospice. I was with 3 nurses. Nurse 1 said I look young with my hair like that. I said thank you! Then nurse 2 said â€œyeah but she has bags under her eyes â€œ the other 2 nurses were dead silent. I just said â€œyeah these are my designer bagsâ€ and laughed and made a joke but I was very hurt. Also the same nurse today refused to co sign my â€œdidnâ€™t take a full lunch todayâ€ form because she said I didnâ€™t take a lunch yesterday, and that me chatting with my patient for 20 min counts as a lunch. She then later apologized for it and signed the paper. She does this to me a lot. Just random hurtful things. She always makes sure that Iâ€™m aware that Iâ€™m â€œcrazyâ€ and she knows my mother is a homeless schizophrenic so being called crazy kinda hurts me too. Am I just sensitive? I feel like my nurse co worker is abusing me lol.
