I think about killing myself a lot and think I may actually do it.The only thing that keeps me from doing it, as I imagine is the same for most, is my family. Especially my young son and parents. I think about taking my seat belt off and driving into a ditch or taking enough pills to kill a horse, or the old stand-by hose in the tailpipe of my car. My only problem is I do not want to do it in a place that may cause painful memories for my family when they pass by it. 

To be honest I was really surprised at how useless suicide hotlines are, they do not seem to give a flying fuck.

So in conclusion, I am tired of being around most people, I am tired of sucking at everything I do, and I just do not give a shit anymore.

Thanks for reading.
