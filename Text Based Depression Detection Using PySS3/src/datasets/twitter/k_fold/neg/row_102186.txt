Lost my cousin yesterday to suicide. Have some questions about the difference between ideation and intent.I lost my cousin to suicide yesterday. I wasn't aware that he had been having any issues that might lead to this, but I guess I wasn't close enough to really know. I cared for him a lot though. He was a good guy, especially towards me. 

That having been said, I've had a lot of suicidal ideation throughout my entire life. Like, as far back as I can remember. At one point, a few months ago, I had been seeing a therapist at my college's Behavioral Medicine center (which was free), but once I graduated in December, that ended, so I haven't been on any antidepressants since then. I've only ever gone on them for those maybe 3 months, but they were a massive help. To be honest, I didn't think I needed them as badly since the stress of school was gone, and I didn't have the giant issues of living with my family like when I was a kid. 

Any way, the point is, that therapist had asked me if I had any plans to actually kill myself. I told her no, which was mostly true. But her asking me that, of course, prompted me to think "If I were to do it, specifically how would I?" I had dumb plans when I was a kid about jumping out a window that I was too afraid to go through with, and now I know how I'd do it if I were to.
I want to know if that crosses the line past suicidal ideation into intent. Like, I don't have any plans to go through with it at any time, I just know how I'd do it if I was ever driven to that point.

tl:dr: is having an idea of how you would kill yourself if you ever got to that point intent, or still in the range of ideation?
