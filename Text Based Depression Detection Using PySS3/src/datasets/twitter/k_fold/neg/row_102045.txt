Every day I feel less like myself and Iâ€™m at the point where I donâ€™t even recognise myself anymoreI just feel like Iâ€™m such a different person because I canâ€™t even enjoy the things I used to enjoy a canâ€™t feel things I used to feel and I lost people that were really close to me and it didnâ€™t affect me like I thought it would I thought Iâ€™d feel pain or Iâ€™d miss them but I was just indifferent. I feel like I donâ€™t have the energy to get out of bed let alone live. Iâ€™ve been in a dark place recently and I just want to feel something because Iâ€™m so tired of feeling nothing and emptiness
