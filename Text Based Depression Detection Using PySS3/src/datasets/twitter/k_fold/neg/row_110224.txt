I don't feel anythingI don't know why but I feel so empty. Yesterday I felt very bad and I was thinking of ways to kill myself without having my body be found and places to do it. I literally spent hours and hours thinking about how much I hate myself and how pathetic I am and telling myself I should kill myself and then thinking of ways to do so, but now I just don't really feel any emotion. I'm so devoid of emotion I don't even know how I feel about not feeling any emotion. I think I feel nothing about it. Everyone says feeling nothing is really bad but I think I feel nothing about feeling nothing. I think I might go back to planning my suicide after I post this because it's something to keep my brain occupied. That's not I think I might want to go back to planning my suicide after I'm done doing this and that's not I kinda wanna go back to planning my suicide when I'm done but I'm undecided. I don't think I want anything really either. I don't think I really wanna finish this post even I think I'm just doing it because it's something to keep my brain occupied and I'm already doing it so might as well keep doing so, and when I'm doing something I'll find something else to occupy myself and one of the only things that could do that is planning my suicide maybe. I don't know if this made any sense but I don't really feel any emotion and I don't really want anything other than to keep my brain occupied, but I think probably everyone always wants to do that. 

What is this?
