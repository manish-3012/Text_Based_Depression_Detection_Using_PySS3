So I did something stupid and I think suicide is the only way out...I've had low self esteem and anxiety for as long as I can remember. It developed into depression in my teens. Like every other person that's tried to feel normal, I graduated high school and enrolled in a university that cost around $25k to attend after scholarships and financial aid. I have no confidence in my decisions so when I tried to tell my dad that I should take a gap year a few months before starting, he urged me to just do it. He probably thought my hesitation was momentary instead of something that I've been agonizing over for months. 

Anyway, I finally enroll and apply for a private loan with my dad as a cosigner which will forever be the most stressful thing I've ever done. Finish the first year and still don't know what I really want to do. My mother has always told me that I'd  be a good nurse because of my personality (she's a nurse) but I know deep down that nursing is stressful and I kind of blank out when stressed. I said I'd become a psychologist as a cover for not knowing what the fuck I want to do.

Second year rolls around. Need another private loan. Stress. Third semester done. I tried to take more nursing oriented courses just in case I decided one day yo switch majors. Fourth semester rolls around. In the middle of it, COVID. I go home and am the least motivated sack of shit I have ever had the displeasure of seeing in the mirror. Fail a class. Don't tell my parents. My therapist that I found at school at the beginning of Year 2 says I should tell my parents I need a gap year. My dad tells me I should stop seeing her and talk to him instead if I'm troubled but he doesn't understand that he is one of my primary stressors. 

I finish my second semester and finally think of relaxing. My mother can get veeery angry and agitated about bills and money so my dad tells me that I either have to drop out of school to go to a nursing school or make sure I find a job for this "psychology you're taking" or else they'll be stuck paying my monthly payments for the student loans into their 90's. He leaves. I break down. My therapist left the university's program so I have no one to unpack with. I'm left with depressive and suicidal thoughts. My mom needs me to forge a recommendation letter for a master's program. I don't do it. She's about to argue with me when it suddenly comes out that I want to kill myself constantly. My dad gets involved. We talk. I cry. We hug. But I don't bring up any of my actual problems or concerns because it's stressful and my mom doesn't do very well when stress and money are concerned. 

It's time to think about the third year of college. I can't bring myself to even ask my dad to fill out another loan for me. So I lie and say all my classes are online and I make up a fake schedule and everything to fool everyone. I fuck around for two months, secretly going on about "trying to find myself and what I truly want to do with my life" but really I'm just fucking around and wasting precious time. Then, about a week ago, my dad gets a letter from the private loan provider that he'll have to start paying monthly bills from my second year. We set up my second year loan so  that I wouldn't have to start paying until I graduated. Does stopping school count as graduating? I don't know but it becomes veeery stressful because the implication is there and I haven't told anyone.

So I start to seriously think about killing myself. Tried to strangle myself; too uncomfortable. Thought about stabbing myself in the heart but was afraid I wouldn't be strong enough to do it so I start working out. Not sure what feel good chemical is at work after a workout but I start to think logically (at least as logically as I can muster). "I don't have to die, I just have to take responsibility for the loan by 'dropping out of school' and getting a few jobs. It won't make everyone happy but at least my parents don't have to be burdened by the fuck up of a daughter that doesn't know what they want to do with their life and will consequently cost them thousands of dollars." But with COVID around I'm not sure how many people are hiring people with little to no experience in my suburban town. 

So that's how I went from mildly suicidal to very suicidal to suicidal with a goal in mind in less than a week. I don't know if I'll ever tell my parents the truth but I can at least start by finding a job or two. Who knows if I'll be a lazy sack in a week or so...
