Lol, told a guy I'm suicidal and now he's ghosting me.Basically the title. 

Been hanging out with this guy a lot. I kind of implied that I'm suicidal aaaand I have not heard back from him for a few weeks. I guess this is a good way of knowing who your real friends are, not that I recommend it or anything.
