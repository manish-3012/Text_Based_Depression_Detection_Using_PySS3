I think Iâ€™m going to kill myselfI literally am going to lose my $22/hour job because of a survey not related to me or my department because the shitty company I work for doesnâ€™t care that the comments arenâ€™t even about me and someone else is listed by name. Iâ€™m meeting my surveys year to date but they donâ€™t care because Iâ€™m not consistent aka I have some months I meet and some I donâ€™t. 

I canâ€™t survive financially on less and I donâ€™t have a college degree. Iâ€™m not even paying my student loans for the community college degree I never finished. 

Iâ€™m pregnant and Iâ€™m going to lose all my healthcare for me and this baby. I donâ€™t think I can go on anymore because my mental health is so poor and Iâ€™ve contemplated suicide since I was 13 and Iâ€™m 30 . 

Iâ€™ve tried to kill my self multiple times in my life but never succeeded. I know itâ€™s selfish and wrong and Iâ€™m going to go to hell per my beliefs. I am so down Iâ€™m just sobbing in the toilet cubicle at work trying to pull it together because I work til after midnight pst. 

I wish some drunk driver would just hit me so it wouldnâ€™t be my fault.
