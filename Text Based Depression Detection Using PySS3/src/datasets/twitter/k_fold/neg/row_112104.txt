I'm going to end my life in 3 monthsNo one cares. I have no one. I'm constantly filled with rage. I'm crying. No ones listening. Or caring or being good. My life will never get better

No one understands. No one. I'm shaking from rage because of how much I fucking hate everyone and everything. Fuck my life. I'm never ever venting to anyone ever again. I'm going to keep it inside and never open up again because no one fucking understands or listens.
