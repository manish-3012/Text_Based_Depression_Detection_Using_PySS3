Someone to talk toHey, this isn't really a suicidepost but I'm pretty involved with SW so I thought I'd rather post here. I tried to kill myself about 5 months ago and since then, I've sworn to never do it again because it hurt my friends and family. I've dedicated myself to stopping as many people from feeling the way I do, and so, since I'm pretty young, the only thing I can do is try to help people over the Internet like on SW. I've been sending PM's to people (despite the rules) and have been helping them but I just feel like I want someone to help me. Despite the fact that I swore I would never try to kill myself again, I really fucking want to so badly but I can't and that feeling of wanting to so bad but not being able to is just driving me bat shit crazy.
