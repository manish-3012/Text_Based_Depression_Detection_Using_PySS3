I think being rich is killing me I know for many people what I am writing is just the complaints of a rich and spoiled white girl.

I grew up between the family home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the beach house in the Hamptons and my grandparents' mansion in the countryside. All my life I lived in a bubble that led me to think it was normal to live in multi-million dollar homes, spend thousands of dollars on designer clothes and have a chauffeur drive you around the city. I had access to the best schools and universities in the US. By the time I was 10 I had already visited more than 20 countries around the world. On paper, my life is a dream.

IT'S A NIGHTMARE

I'm a good looking girl but I'm actually a tomboy. During high school, I remember making excuses not to go out with my so-called friends because I felt so uncomfortable with them. My 16th birthday was such a disaster that my mom forced me into therapy to understand why I was so antisocial.

In college I met people from different backgrounds. It felt comfortable at first, but when they found out I come from such a wealthy family, they either parted ways with me or, including my boyfriend of nearly three years, tried to exploit me for money. In the end I was left with just one friend.

I have so much more to tell you but I'm zooming with my therapist in 15 so the only thing I want to tell you is DON'T THINK that money can buy happiness because IT CAN'T. I would give all my money away if I could have a normal life in return.

Sorry for my outburst.
