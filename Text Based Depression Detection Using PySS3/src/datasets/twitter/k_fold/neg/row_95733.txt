Every day is a struggle to not go through with itI dont know where else to turn. I dont know where to start. I just know I want nothing more than to be in a horrific accident that kills me almost instantaneously. I don't know why I feel like this. I don't know how to fix it. I just don't know. Hell, I don't know who I am anymore. I feel like I'm completely losing myself in an empty void, and no matter how much I reach for help from my SO, I still feel alone. 

Why can't I just die already? It's not as if anyone in my life notices, appreciates, or even truly cares about me. I'm no one. I'm the live-in maid to my family. I'm worthless. I am completely unnecessary. They don't need me whatsoever. So why do I continue with this life?  I've even dubbed my own theme song to be "Mr. Cellophane" from *Chicago: the musical*. I find myself singing the chorus a lot lately. "Cellophane, Mr. Cellophane shoulda been my name. Mr. Cellophane, cuz you look right through me, walk right by me, and never know I'm there."
