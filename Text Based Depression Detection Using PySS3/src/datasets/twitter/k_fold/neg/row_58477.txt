I always feels depressedI fake being happy and having fun. I canâ€™t be happy and feel positive. I wanted to commit suicide. I ask parents if I could talk to someone about my depression and they said no. They always to forget about and try to be happy. When me and my family go some where and I donâ€™t appear to be having fun they say Iâ€™m being rude. They say depression isnâ€™t real and that it goes away. I donâ€™t know what to do.
