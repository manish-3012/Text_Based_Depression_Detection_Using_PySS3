I can't wake up tomorrowI start my junior year of college tomorrow and everything is wrong. My degree program changed without my knowledge and it's put me in a situation where I'm taking 20 credit hours but am in class from 11am to 6pm daily. I'm fucking exhausted and I haven't done anything. I had a really good life when I was home over the summer. I worked full time and I had a very good friend who I cared for very much and made me feel like I didn't have to die. But now they won't talk to me and I don't know why. Everything in my life has rapidly deteriorated in the last seven days and I just have nothing good left. I just don't understand how every shred of good left me. I just don't want to wake up tomorrow.
