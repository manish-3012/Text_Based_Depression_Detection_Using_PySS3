Was waiting till January first but realised I cant hold out longer. Tonights the night.This will be my fourth and hopefully last attempt. Its going to be messy and gorey andni fucking dont want to do that to my parents but Im done fighting. They unplug those with illness right? So that they dont suffer long? Well I'm allowing my illness to take me. Im stopping all meds. 

Im not worth shit to anyone. Not because anyones told ke so, but I know it. Im bound for a life of being sedated or high on meds all the time. Thats not me thats not ever going to be me. Im done. 

Please please please god let me return to my grandma and grandpa and my pets. If not and im in hell i deserve it.
