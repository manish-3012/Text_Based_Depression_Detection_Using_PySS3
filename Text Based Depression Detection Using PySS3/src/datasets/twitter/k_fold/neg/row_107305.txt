Physically unable to ever have sex/be in a relationship...should I keep going?Due to a series of medical conditions and birth defects, this is not a possibility for me. I am tired of feeling cripplingly lonely and unable to relate to others. It is getting increasingly difficult to find reasons to keep myself motivated to get through each day. I don't know what to do anymore.
