I taste tested a bit of bleach today. Wanted to see how badly it tasted in case I ever decided for that to be my method.Lol. You know it's a sad day when you don't even get sad at the idea of suicide anymore. Instead you just laugh. 

I don't have anyone to talk to... As usual. So I posted my thoughts here instead. Honestly, just ignore this. Just a random Redditor slowly feeling like they're losing their sanity.  There's not much of a reason to bother talking to me. It just feels nice to be able to get my thoughts out. Lmao I really wanna die right now.
