I am inconsolably upset all the timeI hate myself SO much. I have zero skills at all besides doing well in school, which is useless in life. I'm awkward. I'm clueless. I take everything personal and blow up every little thing out of proportion. But most of all, I am incompetent. I can't be successful the way I am. I am just not a successful person no matter how hard I try and how much I work on myself. 

I (20) just totaled my car. My boyfriend (21) who has his own business that is the most successful of its kind in the city, is in the market for a fancy new car. And is able to just GIVE me his old one. HOW COULD I NOT BE HUMILIATED?

I have not cooled down for four days of hating myself and wanting desperately to be anyone else with anyone else's brain, and I don't even get any help at all for another week. I've been trying to schedule appointments for months and finally I have one, but I can't wait any longer and I don't know what to do.
