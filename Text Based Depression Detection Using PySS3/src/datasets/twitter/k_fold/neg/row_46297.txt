I'm thinking about it.I've been told that suicide is selfish and is a cowards way out, honestly I believe that but it's all I want now, just an easy way to get out of this.

The most recent thoughts about suicide I've had is when I was 6-7 (I'm 15 now) I never took any action on them, though I knew what it meant, lately it's gotten worse, I've been trying to hurt myself (sometimes severely sometimes minor) I started cutting my wrists and writing degrading phrases about myself and other people in my blood on paper which I hide in my desk.

I asked my mom to book me a psychiatric appointment, she told me "I was full of it" and I didn't need to go.

I know there's something wrong, it's quite obvious but I'm considering taking actions to kill myself. I don't really talk with parents nor do they listen when I try to, I think it would just be better for everyone if I left.
