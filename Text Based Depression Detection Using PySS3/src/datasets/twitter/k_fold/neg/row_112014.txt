I have given myself an ultimatumI have given myself an ultimatum if i am not able to fix my life and get everything back on track by the next 6 months I AM GONNA FUCKING END MYSELF 

I AM FUCKING TIRED OF THIS SHIT IT'S BEEN 3 FUCKING YEARS OF PAIN PAIN AND MORE PAIN.

EVERYTIME I TRY TO FIX SOMETHING IT JUST GETS WORSE I TRY TO MAKE MORE FRIENDS I LOOSE THE FEW FRIENDS I HAD , I TRY  TO MAKE A GOOD RELATION WITH MY PARENTS UT GETS FUCKING WORSE , I TRY TO GET GOOD GRADES IT GETS FUCKING WORSE EVERY YEAR AND COPYING IN EXAMS PAINS ME .

MY EXISTENCE IS A FUCKING PAIN FOR ME AND EVERYONE WHO HAS MET ME , my dad is having financial problems since i started going to school i have an elder sister and she was really good and my dad could have handled her financial stuff BUT WHY DID THEY FUCK AGAIN I AM LIVING PROOF OF A BROKEN CONDOM

i had a best friend but my dumbass introduced him to games , memes and anime AND NOW HE IS DOING POORLY ACADEMICALLY  BECAUSE OF THAT so i cut him off and since then he is doing well

The only thing i like about myself is that my ability to draw and animate is slightly more than an average human being and i actually enjoy it  

I DON'T FUCKING WANNA LIVE ANYMORE OK SINCE I WAS FUCKING 12 TO 15 THINGS HAVE JUST GOTTEN WORSE I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIX ANYTHING 

call me weak but i am gonna end it if i am not able to fix shit by the end of 6 months i am most probably gonna kill myself
