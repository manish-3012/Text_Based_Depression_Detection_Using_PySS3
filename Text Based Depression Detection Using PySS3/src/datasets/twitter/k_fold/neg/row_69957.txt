I messed up...a lot[https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ji5tw2/secret\_debts\_are\_overshadowing\_my\_life\_what/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ji5tw2/secret_debts_are_overshadowing_my_life_what/)

I came to reddit hoping someone could see a solution I had overlooked, but instead I'm just realising I've painted myself into an awful corner. It feels like all my options lead to bad places and I feel trapped. I've made such a mess, the thought of being here when they find out is too much to bear, but the thought of what me leaving would do hurts more. Why doesn't life have a mulligan? :/
