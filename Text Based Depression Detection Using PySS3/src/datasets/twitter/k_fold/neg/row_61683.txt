Living with too much regretSo much fucking regret, I can't deal with it. My life is a misery, so many years spent as a shut in, so many years spent depersonalized, so much fucking wasted time that I'll never get back

I just can't deal with this shit, I'm so abnormal I'm so fucked I'm so fucked I can't believe what I've done to myself
