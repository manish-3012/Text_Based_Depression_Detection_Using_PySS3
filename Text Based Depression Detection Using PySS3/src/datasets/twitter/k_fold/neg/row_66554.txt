I just want the pain to stopIâ€™m so tired. Life has been hell for so long I canâ€™t find any damn joy of happiness because every time i feel the slightest bit of relief my mental illness comes in and reminds me of all the mistakes I did.

I regret those mistakes !! Iâ€™m living in constant guilt over them !!! I was a stupid teenager, I didnâ€™t know that stuff was bad but it doesnâ€™t matter because it is bad !!! Iâ€™m a horrible person, I donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m even alive right now, I just wish i could die in my sleep or something. But when I have these thoughts I feel bad because my parents will get sad. I wish I could go to therapy but we canâ€™t afford that... and Iâ€™m scared if I go to a therapist or a counselor and tell them what I did Iâ€™ll get in trouble... 

I donâ€™t make the same mistakes I used to make, I know itâ€™s bad now and I havenâ€™t made these mistakes in 2 years and I never will. So why canâ€™t this guilt and pain just go away ?? I donâ€™t deserve to be alive, Iâ€™m disgusting.
