I feel like I need to dieNot sure why Iâ€™m posting this as my mind is made up. I will die by suicide. Not yet though. Thereâ€™s a couple more things Iâ€™d like to do and then Iâ€™ll end up life.

I have just fucked up too many times. There are no major life events to look forward to. Iâ€™ve gotten married, had kids, been to uni etc. I just think life would be better without me in it and Iâ€™ve already taken up the NHS time trying to cure me from this depressive episode.

Has anyone else felt like this?
