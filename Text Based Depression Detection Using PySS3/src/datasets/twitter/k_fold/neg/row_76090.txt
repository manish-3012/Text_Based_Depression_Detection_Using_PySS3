People Don't Care And That's OkEveryone thinks they're not the bad guy. One question. If everyone is not a bad guy, then why is the world so fucked if we all are good? It's like the telephone game(Chinese whisper), someone's lying.

They say Treat others how you would want to be treated (the golden rule).
I say bullshit. Treat others as how they have treated you. Many people have treated me like shit and I sure as fuck don't want to be treated like that. (It's kinda funny but true)

Most people don't care, they have their own responsibilities and I understand that. After all well are all responsible for ourselves. 
But I have a question: if they have not shown any care for my well being and mental state and left me deal with my suffering on my own (because it's my own choice and responsibility) then why should I care for theirs? After all aren't we all responsible for ourselves? I have no reason to show them any care, they haven't shown me any.


Just my thoughts after 24 + hours of no sleep.
Always get philosophical when I don't sleep.

Just my way of looking at the world, with proof of action. Not religious but there's this Bible verse:
Faith without works is dead - James 2: 14 - 26
Sums up how I see the world

Hope you all feel better. Get well soon.
