Wish I could cease to exist.Here is an in depth article on my personal experience of depression and anxiety and how it came to be - [here.](https://kayderella.co.uk/2017/08/11/dread/)

tl;dr - I started with panic attacks due to phobia of vomiting, it escalated to general anxiety and OCD, then had my son which caused post-natal depression on top of the other mental health issues.

I feel like recently it is one bad thing after another and I can't seem to pick myself up. I made the decision to hand over primary care of my son to my Mum come January so he could attend nursery and be a little more normal but my friends have expressed great distaste for this and think it best he remains under my care.


I have had three mental break downs in as many weeks and considered suicide but have always stopped myself because I can't imagine someone having to explain to my three year old why he would never see me again. This breaks my heart to write but I just want him to be happy and I can't help but feel I will some how mess him up.


I just feel like I'm not enough for him. I barely get by and because of my anxiety and depression I don't have great prospects for work. I'd like to work from home but I don't have any talents that stand out or I can afford to work on.
Every time I speak with friends or my Mum it comes across as though I'll somehow be cured and things will go back to normal but I can't see myself ever being normal again. I can't imagine not living in fear of germs.


I wasn't ready to be a Mum. I love my little boy but he deserves a good life which I can't see me being able to provide.
