Am I destined for failure?Expressing your thoughts and emotions is believed to be healthy, so forgive my ranting. I'm terrible at pacing and organizing my thoughts correctly.

Even though it's been two months since i've left a psychiatric hospital from a failed attempt. I don't feel any different. There's still this laziness factor that doesn't want me to be productive. I still believe that I am destined to die, because of my weakness as a human being. The weak perish, while the strong prevail, right?

 I'm attending weekly therapy sessions, and trying to look for a job, so that I don't become a freeloader to my parents. Though poor academic performance is one of the reasons that drove me to my first attempt, I guess I'll cut my gap year short to try and go back to a different university in state. Perhaps I'll have better luck staying on track.

Regardless, I think i'll resume making my plans for my next(and hopefully my last) suicide attempt. Perhaps this could be added to the revison of my suicide letter?

I lost the very few friends I had, because of my introversion. Social anxiety has caused me to appear unapproachable; however, I am quite friendly. Don't even get me started on my foul-smelling breath conundrum..

My parents are still supporting me, however I feel as if i'm being rushed to move on(perhaps this is an overreaction).
I am tired of everything.
I still feel okay with dying.
I don't care about the future.
If for some unknown reason, I were to die at this very moment, I wouldn't mind in the slightest.


Tl;dr: Life sucks.

Anyways, how is your day going? I hope you're doing better than I am.
