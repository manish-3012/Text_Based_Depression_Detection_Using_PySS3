I'm right on the edge of killing myselfI'm sick of this life where I'm seen as a worthless "failed abortion" or subhuman by many people for having mental disorder. I'm sick of living in this world where I'm hated for it. I've lost a lot of friends because they found out I have it. Some staff at my school hate me for it, my parents don't see me as normal either and are constantly putting me down. I've felt like this for years, always ashamed of my disorder, but never have I wanted to die this much until this week. I would probably try to commit suicide via suffocation, but immediately chicken out, I just hate living in this hateful world.
