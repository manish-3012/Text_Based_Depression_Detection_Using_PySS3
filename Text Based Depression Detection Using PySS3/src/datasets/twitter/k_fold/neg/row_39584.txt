I feel like shit at work but can't afford to leaveI know I should leave but it's really hard to. I pay bills for my family and we don't even have our own house. In a few months time we will be moving and start paying for a house that's as big as my salary already. My mom doesn't even have her own death plan. None of us have insurance and dying is too expensive. I really don't know what to do. I keep thinking maybe I should just change my job. My peer constantly makes me feel like she's better than me because she's from a private university, makes me feel like I make stupid decisions and that I am useless. Our HR manager recently spread the fact that I have anxiety at work and bad mouthed me. She went on to text me if I was okay out of "concern". (She doesn't know I know what she's saying behind my back.) I really want to end it all.
