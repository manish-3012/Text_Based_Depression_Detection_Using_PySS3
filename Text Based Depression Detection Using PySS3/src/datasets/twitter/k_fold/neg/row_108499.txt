Iâ€™m losing it all...Cheated on my wife of 10 years. Have three small children. My wife knows. Sheâ€™s being a supportive as possible. We are going to counselling. Have always had lots of anxiety. Feeling worthless. Why would I do such a thing? Having lots of doubts as to who I am. Feeling empty. Hopeless. Lots of dark thoughts over the last few months since the truth came out. Have a plan to either hang myself in the basement or use a plastic bag with helium. Need help and guidance to make the dark thoughts disappear. Iâ€™ve become a recluse. Would rather live my life in a cabin in the woods. Alone. Possibly end my life there at some point. Thatâ€™s all I have to say really. Need help. Please.
