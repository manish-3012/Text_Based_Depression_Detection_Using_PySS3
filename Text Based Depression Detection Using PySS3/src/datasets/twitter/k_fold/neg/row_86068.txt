Been feeling teally lonely and vulnerable nowadays.I've gotten really depressed, somethings happened in my life and now I feel totally useless. My parents have stopped talking to me, I dont have any siblings, my girlfriend broke up with me because I couldnt be with her because of my depression and now I just sit around in my empty house all alone. Nothings been going my way, I've been lacking in College, I'm doing a non paid internship and I hate my job which requires long hours but pays shit. Suicide has become a real option for me now. You know when we were kids and we would have a nap after playing all day, that nap would be THE most soothing and relaxing rest you could ever have and then when you wake up you'd be totally refreshed. I wish I could have that kind of nap just one more time right now. Nowadays, I cant sleep till 3 or 4 in the morning and then I have to wake up at 6 to get ready for College. And during the weekends its much worse. I just want to be at peace. Would really like someone to talk to, its been a long time since I've had a heart to heart with someone.
