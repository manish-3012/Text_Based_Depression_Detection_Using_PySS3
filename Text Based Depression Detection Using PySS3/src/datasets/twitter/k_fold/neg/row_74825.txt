What do you live for? What makes you want to stay?Schools have been shut and im quarantined with my abusive parents. Usually i hold out until school but this could be for the foreseeable future. I barely made it through six weeks of holidays.

 i think about everything good and beautiful that happens outside of home. Its not as the as living it. Its not,, helping me escape much when it seems so far away.

I havent made hard plans but thats just today. Sometimes i go out to the balcony and i see peoples houses, where the lights are on. I think about how im not really alone. It just feels like i am. 

I cant really call people because my parents can hear.
