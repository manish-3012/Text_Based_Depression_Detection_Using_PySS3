Today's political climate is horrendous.And, worst of all, I've been swept up in it. I say horrible things to people online because the tone of almost every political post or comment has a seriously hostile undertone (or overtone)

I'm from the US, BTW.

Furthermore, I don't know what the hell is going to happen in the next few days. I feel like we're on the verge of a civil war, that we're near the point of no return. I don't know what the fuck is going to happen to this country, and I can't afford to move out of it.

I just want it all to stop.
