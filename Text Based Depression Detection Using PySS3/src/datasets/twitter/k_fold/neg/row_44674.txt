Fighting the good fight, but I'm not winning.I'm really really desperate.  Two attempts so far.  Last attempt put me in the hospital.  I'm a 48 year old guy in the U.S.  I know I'm genetically predisposed to be like this.  Lost a brother to suicide.  Lost two more in a car wreck a year later.
I know I'm on borrowed time.  I know there's no cure, nothing to help me feel normal.
I just need to connect with other folks that can relate.
