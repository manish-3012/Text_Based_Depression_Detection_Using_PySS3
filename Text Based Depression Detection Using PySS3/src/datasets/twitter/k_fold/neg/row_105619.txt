I hope i have the courage to do it tonight.I might finally commit suicide tonight. Iâ€™ve been thinking about it for various reasons but never had the courage too. Tomorrow i have an oral presentation that iâ€™m once again going to fail and embarrass myself. I was too depressed to study.

Iâ€™m a college failure and i have no future. I donâ€™t want to take my finals, iâ€™m feeling sick. Today i took a final and it went really bad.

It might sound exaggerating but iâ€™ve been doing this shit for 3 years and continuously failing + my mom that reminding me that i never study, that iâ€™m going to have an awful future and all doesnâ€™t help.
