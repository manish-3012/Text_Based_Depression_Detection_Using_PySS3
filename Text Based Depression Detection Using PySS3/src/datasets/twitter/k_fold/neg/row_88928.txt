I know it's bad when I can't stop thinking of suicide even in the daytime.It's most likely not going to get better. After 12+ years of depression. After 14+ years of anxiety. I've tried nearly all the meds. I've seen countless therapists. I'm even in therapy now. Nothing works. I've pushed away my friends. I've quit school. I can't fucking take care of myself. My family is ultra Christian let-us-shove-Jesus-down-your-throat. I can't tell them I that I don't believe. If I try to talk about my depression, I'm told that I just need to be more committed to prayer or that I'm possessed. I'm caring less and less. My hope is flying out the window. What a waste. I'm a waste of potential.
