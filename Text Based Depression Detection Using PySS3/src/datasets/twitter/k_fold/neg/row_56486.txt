cannot go on any longeri honestly dont know how i can make it one more day. my heart is tortured and i cant even genuinely smile anymore. i know all i do is bring other people down and create problems for them. i rarely have solutions. im at peace with the decision to end my life because i know once the dust settles, everyone will be okay. I know one day they will join me. G-d, please take me.
