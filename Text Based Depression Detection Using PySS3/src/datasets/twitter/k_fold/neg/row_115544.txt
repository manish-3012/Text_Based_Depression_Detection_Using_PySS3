generic title and generic rantafter my partner got done saying "you're the problem" I decided that I was going to kill myself tonight.

I know he's not going to come back down here to make sure I'm okay. maybe if he came back before I did it it would be okay

but he won't, an hour is too long but I'll probably wait that long, and I'll still be alone, and then I'll do it

"you're the problem" is hardly the worst thing he's said

but fuck

I was sad and I wanted a hug, and then the next thing I know he's telling me why he fucking hates me so much

and that's it

I don't have anyone, any family, anything, I needed him but he's right

I'm just alone with a person who hates me

I'll always be the problem, I always deserved to be hated

and now I won't be a problem anymore

he'll still hate me but at least it won't hurt cuz I'll be fucking dead
