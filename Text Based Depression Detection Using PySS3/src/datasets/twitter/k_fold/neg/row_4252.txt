help14 year old Asian kid here. Having severe suicidal thoughts from about a year now. Came to the realisation that my parents have been gaslighting me for all my life (After reading many articles). Cant think of anything except that. Found out that I have ADHD but didn't bother telling my parents cuz I know they'll just dismiss it. I remember telling my sister when I was dunno 10 or 11 that I wished an arrow came from the window and hit my head. As of now I have no self esteem. My sister is the "star kid" aiming to become a doctor. I cry myself to sleep almost every night cuz I feel like I'm a failure. Pretty sure my parents are happy with my sister and wish that I wasn't in this family at all. Please help me I just want to escape all this.
