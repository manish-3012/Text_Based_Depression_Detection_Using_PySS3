Recurring urgesIâ€™ve been feeling useless for quite some time now. I havenâ€™t done anything with my life. I always do something wrong, but itâ€™s never something I can fix. Iâ€™m just ultimately a fuck up. No one I know genuinely likes me. Everyone around me only acts through pity. I have a razor blade in my dresser that I think about using everyday. I tried to help change a friends tire and while I was out there on the highway I couldnâ€™t help but think how easy it would be for me to just walk forward a few steps and be gone. The only thing that stopped me was the fact that my sister was present. No one knows I have these urges, and I want to get help so that when I do it my family can at least know they tried to help. I owe them that. I canâ€™t show anyone affection so all I do is push everyone away. And when I do open up and become vulnerable Iâ€™m always hurt because of it. Those few instances of vulnerability have only ever happened when Iâ€™m drunk. I try to open up. I have one friend that cares about me deeply and was there for me last night when I wasnâ€™t in the best place. But he has no idea about my suicidal tendencies. I tried to open up to another friend last night and she blew me off. Made jokes and laughed. Itâ€™s just that everything I do is pointless now. I donâ€™t know where to go with my life and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Thereâ€™s no point in my life, because I know Iâ€™ll never amount to anything. I try to picture myself 5 years down the road but I canâ€™t even do that. I honestly canâ€™t even see myself alive for five more years because I know that Iâ€™ll act on my urges. Itâ€™s just a matter of when now.
