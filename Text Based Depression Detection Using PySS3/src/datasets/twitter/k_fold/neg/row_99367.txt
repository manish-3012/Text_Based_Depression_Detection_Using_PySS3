I am an ingrateI donâ€™t deserve my parents, they waste their precious time on me.  They still love me, but I am still somehow ungrateful of that.  I am a parasite.  If I die, they might care, but I donâ€™t.  Someone else out there deserves a better life that I donâ€™t deserve.  I should have been grateful of them years ago.  There is no future ahead for me if Iâ€™m like this.  What am I supposed to do?  I canâ€™t keep being like this.
