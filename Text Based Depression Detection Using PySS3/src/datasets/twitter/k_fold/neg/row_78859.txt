Deeper and deeper it goes..Shits been though the past couple months... A person who I thought was my best friend dissappeared from my life...

I have been depressed for so long for reasons I don't even remember, she brightened up my life so much more so than anyone I've ever met. Perhaps I shouldn't have confided in her.. She was the only person who knew I was depressed... 

Sometimes I think that is not the reason why I'm feeling this way.. But I honestly don't know why. Many people have walked out of my life before, so have I walked out of others. 

I cannot mantain friendships, the closer I get to someone, the harder I subconsciously push them away. This time something just felt different, I pushed her away and regretted it.. But it was too late.. 

Sometimes I think about running across the road on a busy street to end it all... 

My family is the only reason why I have not done it yet.. For I know my mom will not be able to take it and follow suit.. 

I'm trying so hard but these thoughts get darker and darker... 

I'm getting tired... Feels like a balloon getting deflated.. But so much more so that I'm already almost totally deflated... 

Im sorry if I don't make sense, nothing else does to me anyways...
