Iâ€™m trying so hard to get betterTo start off, if I could only receive constructive comments and no â€œI relate to thatâ€, â€œI feel the same wayâ€ etc because I canâ€™t handle the weight of other peopleâ€™s struggles right now, because I canâ€™t even handle my own. Thank you

Iâ€™ve deal with mental health struggles for as long as I can remember. My mom told me I had my first anxiety attack at age 3. Thereâ€™s never really been anything bad happening in my life. Itâ€™s always been within me. Which makes it even harder sometimes, because unlike a certain event or situation, you will always be with yourself and your thoughts. Iâ€™ve been in therapy since 7th grade (Iâ€™m now in 10th), but I definitely couldâ€™ve used it sooner. 

Iâ€™ve been through many ups and downs in the past 2 years, and I recently came out as transgender (female to male) which has made my life so much more complicated. I lost my friends since childhood, and then another group of friends. I stopped going to traditional public school this year. Iâ€™ve self harmed, been clean, and relapsed. I thought I was doing better until a few months after I left outpatient at the start of the summer. 

Everyone says Iâ€™ve been making really good progress over the years, but Iâ€™ve never been this close to suicide on a daily basis. I canâ€™t deal with my gender identity, Iâ€™m constantly doubting wether Iâ€™m trans but simultaneously experiencing crippling gender dysphoria. Iâ€™m disassociating really hard every day (Iâ€™ve experienced disassociation since middle school but never for this long or this intense), I donâ€™t even recognize my face, body, voice, or even the things I say or the way I act. I feel like a shell of the person I last remember being. Even taking a step back to analyze my thinking I canâ€™t even comprehend whoâ€™s thoughts they are. Iâ€™ve stopped talking to people about the fact that I no longer experience a will to live because no one can do anything about it, it just hurts others and makes me feel more hopeless. Iâ€™ve always felt like thereâ€™s something else wrong with me that hasnâ€™t been diagnosed, but maybe thatâ€™s the hypochondria. Thus far Iâ€™ve only been diagnosed with Anxiety, OCD, and Depression. I havenâ€™t self harmed in awhile, but itâ€™s just because I know it doesnâ€™t really help and hurts those around me. 

The only way I can describe it is that Iâ€™m a cicada. I have a shell on the outside that Iâ€™ve shed a few times, but now Iâ€™m stuck in one shell. I no longer exist to the outside world, just the shell of whatever state of being I felt connected to last. I donâ€™t even feel like a person anymore. I have no idea who I am even on the deepest level. Iâ€™ve been on autopilot for so long. Iâ€™ve tried to get better for so long. I canâ€™t remember a time that I wasnâ€™t mentally struggling. It feels like life will never be different for me, itâ€™s like thatâ€™s just how god designed me. 

Iâ€™m tired of people telling me â€œitâ€™ll get betterâ€, â€œit wonâ€™t be like this foreverâ€, â€œyou can keep goingâ€. This is all Iâ€™ve ever known. Mental turmoil with short periods of feeling ok. And I canâ€™t see any possible way out. No matter where I go, or where I run, the problem is in my head. I canâ€™t escape it. I can only distract from it for a short amount of time. I canâ€™t even remember to eat sometimes now. I forget to do the most basic things. I can never make decisions, so Iâ€™m probably not gonna kill myself anyway. Itâ€™s too much to plan and I know Iâ€™ll probably forget something important. Itâ€™s permanent and drastic, and I donâ€™t do well with making permanent drastic decisions. 

Iâ€™m just hoping someone will finally say something that clicks for more than a few days, or Iâ€™ll suddenly realize something, or Iâ€™ll find something that lets me see the light at the end of the tunnel. Feel free to ask questions, even if theyâ€™re personal. Iâ€™m desperate.
