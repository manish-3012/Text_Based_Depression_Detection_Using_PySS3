Psychiatrist keeps trying to give me ssriIâ€™ve been dealing with depression ever since I was in first grade and I jus canâ€™t help it. I donâ€™t have motivation in life last July I discovered some Clonazapam in medicine Cabniet. And I started takin it and for the first time in a while I didnâ€™t cry myself to sleep and I didnâ€™t have thoughts of suicide every night I started bein talkative and fun with my family and friends. And really started to enjoy my life and I tried to get my own prescription but the doctor wants to give me Zoloft or lexapro. And they make my stomach hurt and my make my mind hazy and now itâ€™s may and it just feels like nothings changed in a whole year I donâ€™t know how long I can tolerate the way I am.
