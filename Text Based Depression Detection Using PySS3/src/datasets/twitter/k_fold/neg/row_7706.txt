I opened up but things didn't go wellI thought telling my friends would help me to get all my pain away but the thing is to all the people I told my problems they some how made it about then 

I told 2 of my friends about my family problems and them were like even then have family problems and I kind of acted like a trigger for them 

I told one friend smtg personal about me and to my superise they r a victim of the same and stopped texting me 

And few friends of mine tell me problem to their life and I listen give them support when it comes to me them some how make me feel like the bad guy 

It is hard to explain all this and when I finally told about my sucical thought to a friend they said they said it is normal just chill 

I don't know how explain but I hope u understand what I tried to say
