planning on ending it all after new yearsi'll venture off to the top of my favourite mountain and slits my wrists and look at the stars before eventually passing away.

you see, i've always hated my stupid life, im sick of waking up and having to deal with these thoughts, my entire fucking life i've only had 1 true best friend that never left and i have a huge crush on him, not that he loves me back anyways since i get so hyperactive and happy around him and im pretty sure he thinks im a weird emotional dumbass and we stopped talking recently :D, proms coming up as well and guess who is gonna stay home and play video games cause he is so fucking lonely? ME :D ,no one will care anyways :), people think im weird for being so quiet and stupid all the time, no wonder im so goddamn alone.  fuck the world, everyone is just assholes and i dont see the point anymore.

i hope i get the courage to do it :D
