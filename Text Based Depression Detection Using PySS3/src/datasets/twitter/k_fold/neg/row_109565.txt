It's always at 6 amWhenever I can't sleep and I feel in my body, when everything comes to mind and nothing to distract me. That's when I start drafting up notes and deleting them, and muting people on my phone on the off-chance they'll text me. They won't, but then at least I can let myself imagine I haven't completely ruined everyone's image of me.

Now all I am is a suicidal depressed killjoy of a person.
