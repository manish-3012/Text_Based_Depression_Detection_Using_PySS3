I don't know how to stop the intrusive thoughts - advice?I've had anxiety since I was about 11, because of the usual violence in the family stuff. Fast forward many years, I've been trying to hold on to jobs, but my anxiety just completely shuts me down. I'm about to get fired while on sick leave, and I keep having recurring and insistant thoughts about the best and most non-traumatizing ways (for my partner) to kill myself.

I can't shut them out. They come when I'm in bed late at night and they just latch on. I keep thinking how easy it would be in the dead of night to just do it. Most attempts of shutting them out have been to take a walk, listen to music, watch a film or pester my dogs.

They're right back when the film stops or I get a moment of silence.

Years and years of fighting my anxiety with medication and therapy and yet here I am. I have no friends, no family. The thoughts have been especially terrible these past two weeks. Maybe it doesn't help that I have mild tourettes, so keeping thoughts in check in general is difficult for me.

Any advice for how to deal with the thoughts? Do you engage them?

If it isn't allowed here I'm sorry.
