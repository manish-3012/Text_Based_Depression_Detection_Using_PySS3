Whenever a change happens I feel like killing myself again.Hey all,

I've been thinking over this for so long now and the fact my mom gets to pay the debt i have now, is keeping me from suiciding.
I just now had a thingy happen with my mom, she brought me groceries and I ask her to bring me X product, she couldnt find it and brought alternative. I don't like the alternative, so I don't want it anymore. X product was going to be mixed with Martini, which she brought, but she had to take it with her because I didn't want that either, because its useless without the energy in my opinion. 
I was going to have a fun night tonight but that all kinda fucked up now. I know, I know, its such a small problem but stupid and small things will get me furious and as soon as I realise its there again, I feel like ending again. I've actually been going to a psychologist for about a year now and they redirected me to a mental health institute where I am being diagnosed now. For now they suspect autism and a depression disorder. At the start of all this I was happy that it all happened and I was going in a positive direction, but its only gotten worse.

They gave me medicines for my depression and I am taking 60mg of cymbalta per day. I ain't feeling shit. People around me say I am a little bit more open and outgoing but I don't see the difference. 
It also gets me bills I cannot afford. So its such a complicated situation that I don't want to continue. It just feels easier to end it all. 

I just don't know what to do, I've been told that im going into the right direction for so long now, and I haven't noticed or felt anything nice. Like my whatsapp status; Where did my genuine happiness go?
