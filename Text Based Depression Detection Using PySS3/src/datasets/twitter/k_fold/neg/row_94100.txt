Started shooting, I've lost hope.Hello. I remember posting here more than 2 years ago to which I deleted it and sought help.
Now I am back but worse. I lost the one I care about so much. I no longer have family to fall back on. I live by myself and I am miserable everyday. I've started shooting up heroin and I amdrunk currently. If I don't have heroin I drink. My parents kicked me out at 17 to my grandmas and then I got kicked out at 18. I used to sell drugs and make money until my ex who told me to stop told me. Then I stopped and she dumped me. We were together for 2 years. She untied me for a noose when hanging from the bed. Around July I talked to her again and we talked for a week before a falling out with her and her brother happened and we stopped talking. I got a new job driving a forklift shortly after but I feel unfulfilled.

I am close to the brink of killing my self. The only way I can contact her is from tumblr AMA and an old account on twitter which she hasn't blocked and I need to time it well to use it. I've tried looking for others to no avail. None interest me only her. That and coupled with everything I gave up just to be here today drinking and Inkecting heroin. I have no other hope.
