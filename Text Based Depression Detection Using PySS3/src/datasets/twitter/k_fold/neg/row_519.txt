I Survived but...after several tries, i came the closest that i ever did. I OD on a shit load of pills, and was dead by the time i made it to the ER. I was revived and placed in a coma and woke about 5 days later. 

I am mixed about making it. I find that it is still a battle day to day, sometimes I am happy I made, sometimes not so much.

However there is one thing, I feel like i have fundamentally changed. It is really hard to explain but its like a part of me didn't come back. But rather is just sitting there dead. My feelings all seem very superficial, I can laugh, smile, cry, yell, but nothing seems to truly move me. 

I am hoping that maybe there is someone else out there that has gone through this, or can help.

thanks
