I'm alive - now what?A few years ago I confronted myself with several suicide "situations", but never went through with any of them (I basically stood on a bridge and didn't jump). After I finally opened up to my friend, I started going to therapy, talking about it, developing a social life. I stopped going to therapy because I was - in the eyes of my mother - healed. Since I'm a minor I couldn't really do anything about it. I still have the occasional thought then and there but haven't danced with death, so to say, for several months now. But, now I face something I didn't think about in the past years - living. I never thought I'd be as old as I am, and actually have to live. So now I'm stuck in a dilemma: I know suicide isn't an option, but living doesn't seem that great either.
