Over itI just donâ€™t feel like I matter. I have a few good days but the bad days are awful. Schools going awful. I feel like when people say they care or always there it seems like itâ€™s only in the time of hurt and donâ€™t just always check in. Iâ€™m burnt out, I try to make everyone happy over me. I donâ€™t want this life.
