I have a good life but I want it to endI have a job that billions would envy, and the work fulfills me. I bought a brand new car last month, and I bought my own place, and I'm 24. My 401k is growing and growing, savings practically overflowing, my credit is pristine, my health is good, and I've no reason to worry about anything material. Don't get me wrong though, I've stumbled upon this by luck, maybe a bit by effort but mostly luck. I don't deserve what I have.

I've never had a close group of friends. I've never had a kiss. I've never touched another man, I've never acted on any urge. I'm nobody. I'm alone in a crowd. I'll never be like any of you. And I have my life together objectively. And I still want to kill myself.

Edit: Idk, see last post for details. I'm not some lonely dude from the bowels of /r/incels but I might as well be. I'll never find someone. I will always be alone. And I can never be myself.
