I donâ€™t want to kill myself, because my family would be mad. But I wish something would kill me.I feel like Iâ€™m an observer, not participant in my life. Iâ€™m just watching myself fall deeper and deeper into a black hole...and before that scared me. Now Iâ€™m scared to climb out of the hole. I just want to retreat further into the darkness of the hole. But I donâ€™t want people to know I jumped into the hole, I want them to think I tripped.
