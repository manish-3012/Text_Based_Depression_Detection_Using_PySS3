I'd like to stop existing.I don't know, I guess it's that weird phenomenon where I don't necessarily want to die, but I want to just stop existing. I think I'd like to die if I knew that it would be painless and no one would have to find my body, but no one could tell you that, and I'm scared. So I guess it'd be nice if everything just... Stopped. Full stop. 

I'm pretty much just venting at this point. I'll probably never actually commit suicide, but I hate that I think about it so much. It's so awful. I'm in a toxic environment that I can't really leave yet, so at this point I'm just living from deadline to deadline. I keep on telling myself that it'll be better in a week, or two weeks, or a year, but then I keep on blowing past those dates and nothing really gets better.
