I post a lot on here myself. But it's my time now.I've spent a lot of time trying to give people advice on here on various different accounts. But it's my time now. I'm drunk. At the end and fed up. There is a bridge above a road near my house and I am all to close to going up there and throwing myself off. I have drug and drink issues, never got over my last relationships, regret all my mistakes. My family is a mess. My mum's leaving the country. I hate myself.
