i'm so tired of never knowing self worthi have it good compared to a lot of people, and i feel like a piece of shit for even getting to this point, but i've been suicidal in and out for so long that i don't know how to gague it.

i'm constantly dealing with PTSD symptoms from being sexually/emotionally/physically abused as a child and abused in relationships prior to the one i'm in now. i still feel like i'm overreacting about what happened to me and i shouldve never said anything to anyone about it. 

i never feel even partially adequate at my job no matter how hard i try or how much my coworkers/boss praise me. i can never be where i wish i was. there will always be someone better than me.

i feel so empty. i love my work, but at this point i use it as a tool to overwork myself so i don't have the energy to think about everything else bothering me. nothing other than my partner and my job bring me any sort of joy, and i don't feel good enough for either. i just drink and get high to fill the gaps and avoid moments like these.

my partner is the best thing that's ever happened to me, but i can't help but feel i'm nothing but a burden. as much as i'm terrified of being left, i know i don't deserve them. it makes me physically nauseous. i could see myself marrying them and having a life together if only i weren't so disgusting. it's only a matter of time before they leave me for any of the millions of people that are better than me.

the industry i work in is rife with substance abuse and suicide. i'm just waiting to become a statistic.
