I'm done trying to be someoneI tried to end my life four years ago and for awhile I thought that it was a really dumb idea. But after a series of unsuccessful tries to pull me up from my depression, I just get sucked back down again. 

Every time I get a job, I quit shortly thereafter because I begin to resent my job and I can't get out of bed or start to call in too often.

When I got into college, I was excited to hopefully start my art career but no one wanted to help me sign for loans and so I had to leave school because I couldn't afford to go to a four-year university.

I thought maybe I could start a career but selling my art but no one is interested in hiring me or buying my paintings. I know I'm not the best but I was hoping that I could still sell some art and gradually get better. 

I have no family or friends to talk to. My SO is too busy with his career to be bothered by my problems.

My life hasn't changed at all since I tried to end my life. There is no point for me to be alive. I offer nothing of value to no one. I'm worthless. I'm just wasted space. Like a piece of shitty furniture. 

I don't have any specific plan to kill myself but I know that's how I'm going to die and I don't think I can carry on living this worthless existence.
