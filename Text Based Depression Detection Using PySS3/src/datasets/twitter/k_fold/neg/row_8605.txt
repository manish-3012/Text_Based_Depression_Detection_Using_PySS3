Possible brain damage after suicide attempts ?Hi, in the past months I tried to kill myself on two instances by taking huge doses (half a box each time) of antidepressants with alcohol. 

I blacked out for hours and somehow survived both times but ever since I feel like Iâ€™ve lost a lot of memories and canâ€™t recall a lot of things and details from events from before and after the attempts.

Iâ€™m 22 and my memory used to be okay before that, is it possible consequence that was caused by some brain damage?

Thanks in advance
