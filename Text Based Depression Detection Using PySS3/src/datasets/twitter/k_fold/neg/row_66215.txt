Do hotlines help?I've been on the verge of ending it the past few days. I managed to find some courage and spoke to my best-friend about it and decided to hold off for a while, but the thought of dying cannot escape my mind. I'm now considering calling a hotline (I live in the UK) to try and help cope with the barrage of these thoughts. I can't stop planning how to do it. I can't stop writing messages for people to find after I have passed. This won't be my first try. At the age of 25, it would've been my 4th attempt at ending my life.

Even at my most serene moments, that dark shadow that is clouding my brain is trying to convince me that my life is not mine to live. I no longer find any joy in the activities I used to love nor do I find any comfort in the people closest to me. I have let them all down. All I feel comfortable speaking to are strangers.
