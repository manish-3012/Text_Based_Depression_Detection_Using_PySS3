Anyone here suffer from trichotillomania?I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, but the suicidal thoughts started some 8 years ago n anxiety followed soon. I've never seen a therapist cz it's a taboo here and I can't see one without my parents knowing. Since the last 4-5 years (I guess) I've been pulling my hair out from my scalp. Trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder where a person feels compelled to pull their hair out. For some people it's so bad that you can actually see bald patches. It's not so bad for me, not yet at least. I feel a great sense of relief after pulling my hair out. And this urge increases whenever I'm stressed, which I am most of the time. A couple of times it has been so bad that I compulsively pull my hair out and after a while I come back to my senses, look at the huge bunch of hair lying on the floor, which is followed by a panic attack and uncontrollable weeping. 
Just wanted to know if anyone is going through the same thing. I don't know how to stop myself from doing this over and over again so any suggestions are welcome.
