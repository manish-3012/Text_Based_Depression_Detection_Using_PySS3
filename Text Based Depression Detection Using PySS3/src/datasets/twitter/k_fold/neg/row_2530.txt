Suicide LetterThis isn't going to be easy and frankly, I have no idea where to start. My life hasn't been that bad. Not really. Compared to other people's misery, my life has been a fucking cake walk but that doesn't make it worth living. I can't do this anymore, I really fucking can't. My heart hurts to much. My vision is getting blurry with confusion and my brain... it's fuzzy from all the drug use and I just can't think properly anymore. I used to love myself. And other you. And everyone else on this planet but I stopped quite some time ago. I don't even feel alive anymore.. I'm just walking back and forth with no energy left. No energy left to even write a proper goodbye letter.. I just see no point. I am so tired. Thank you for reading. Goodbye.
