Iâ€™m so sorry.Iâ€™m sorry for every last thing I have ever done to anyone. 

Iâ€™m sorry for all the hurtful things Iâ€™ve ever said. 

Iâ€™m sorry for always being such a difficult and irritating person.

Iâ€™m sorry for being me.

Thereâ€™s nothing I can do anymore. Iâ€™m trapped. Itâ€™s hopeless. Nothing will ever improve. 

I just so desperately want someone to just help me but thatâ€™s impossible. Iâ€™m never getting better.

Iâ€™m so tired of all the self sabotage. So tired of having breakdowns over nothing at all. So tired of being tired. So tired of everything.

Iâ€™m so sorry for ever existing. 

Iâ€™m so sorry that I canâ€™t stand living anymore.
