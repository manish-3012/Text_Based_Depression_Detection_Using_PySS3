Failed attempt, still not sure it was the wrong choice.I attempted to OD, but my body wasnâ€™t having it I guess. After popping the pills I felt amazing and was very glad I did what I did. But I somehow lived. I ended up going to the er 12 hours later and they monitored my liver for a while, but I was all okay in the end they didnâ€™t even have to do a pump. I honestly think Iâ€™m immortal at this point. I took over 50 634mg tablets and did not die (but the side effects are terrible, please donâ€™t do that to yourself, it sucks if you fail, like really really sucks. Not worse than the depression, but some of the worst physical pain I have had). Worst thing is, I still donâ€™t wanna live. Nothing significant is wrong, I just donâ€™t see a future that Iâ€™m happy with and the notion of heaven sounds amazing. Even if I am wrong and itâ€™s just nothing, that sounds better than life. So Iâ€™m not sure where to go from here. I should go see help, because trying and failing sucked, but maybe I should just try something more guaranteed? I guess Iâ€™m posting here as a last resort. The people at the hospital are nice, but the stuff they say is just nothingness to me. What you say probably will be too? But who knows, maybe that one person is reading this whoâ€™s words will somehow mean something to me. Or you can just ignore me, either way Iâ€™ll be gone soon either someone will find a way to save me, or Iâ€™ll save myself from this nothingness of a life I lead. 

Maybe I can try and help you out if your going to try and help me. Where I am at:
I do t feel unloved or anything like that
I have not experienced some major loss recently
I canâ€™t remember a time when I was truly happy 
I am Christian, but religion or not, death sounds like a solution (either the start of a new try or the end of a failed one). 
I have made several plans before, this was my first official attempt (other than doing all the prep but not the execution, thatâ€™s been done a few times, my faith is the only thing that stopped me).
