What can I do to improve the suicide hotlines in my city?Had a bad episode tonight and in a last ditch attempt called a bunch of the top result numbers on Google listing suicide hotlines in my city (Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India) for the first time and not a single one of them picked up. I felt incredibly let down by a support system that I was told all my life I could depend on in my time of need only to find out that they are non existent. Every call/org number that didn't pick up made me feel incrementally worse than when I had started out.
I had thankfully physically exhausted myself, passed out and am now on a better place and state of mind to consider this more clearly. I would like to do whatever I can to change this and appreciate any and all help/ advice. Whom should I write/ call/ petition or talk to?
