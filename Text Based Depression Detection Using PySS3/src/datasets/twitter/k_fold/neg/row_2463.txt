Feel like a fish without a schoolLone. Lonely. Loner. I have no energy. I don't feel like I have friends. I don't know if I have autism. I'm trying to find people in my hometown to talk to but no one is interested. I hate living with mom at 28. I hate the fact I have to work tomorrow. Why even show up. Only to be treated like a child and not appreciated. Invisible. When I went out to eat today, I shared a table with myself when others shared a table with a date. Drifting. I want to fall in the ocean and let the waves take me away from civilization, the civilization that has forsaken me. Disappear and biodegrade. At least the Earth will be able to use my waste of space. My heart. My brain. My intestines. Everything that makes up this pathetic lump of flesh called a human being.
