It never gets any betterI never liked elementary school

I never liked middle school

I never liked high school

I sorta liked the military, but always wanted to leave

College was better, but not great

My first job sucked most of the time

Moving across the country (for the 3rd time) still sucks

My next job, where I doubled my salary is awful too


I'm also very unattractive, I've had girlfriends before, but it's honestly pretty exhausting because I know I'm unattractive so I wonder why they stay with me.

I've basically abandoned most of my friends because I moved away from them, and also I don't understand why they would want to hang out with me.

There is no hobby or anything I enjoy. Even if I did I don't know when I'd be able to get good at anything, I'm away from the house like 10-12 hours a day for work.

I somehow miss the past even though it sucked too, I just see things getting worse.

I'll spend this Christmas with the family, but I'm out after the new years.

Thanks for listening. I wish I could've made my life better, I know I tried.
