Every night I think about killing myself.Iâ€™m too scared to do it, but Iâ€™ll put my face in my pillow and try to suffocate myself knowing it wonâ€™t work. Iâ€™ll think about cutting my wrist open and bleeding out. 

Iâ€™m always so fucking sad and I donâ€™t know why. Iâ€™m so lazy, I donâ€™t do my schoolwork, I procrastinate everything. My life is completely fine though Iâ€™m just a piece of shit. 

My family all loves me, i have decent friends, I have a girlfriend, nothing in my life is wrong. 

I just want to switch lives with a kid with cancer or some shit. 

I cry almost every night I donâ€™t even know why. Iâ€™m just tired of life.
