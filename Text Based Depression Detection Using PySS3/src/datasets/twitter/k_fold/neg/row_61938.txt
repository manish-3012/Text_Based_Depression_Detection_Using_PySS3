I am in a dream and can't wake upI don't know how to start this but, for thr past 8 years of my life (and maybe more) I have been dissociating most of the time, felt I was in a weird movie/dream, disconnecting from the world, from myself, from all the details of life. It's been a nightmare. I am 21yo and, up until recently, I thought that's what life was. Like yeah, I am late to everything because time speeds when you keep zoning out. Life is having breakdowns three times a day because you hate yourself so much. It's about obsessing over junkfood that you will throw up in the shower later on. 

*I have been dedicating my life to distract myself from the pain and avoid it*. I have been on medication but they didn't do anything. I have tried therapy but they can't seem to fully comprehend. I have had different diagnosis but I believe I have complex ptsd. 

I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm just *fucking* tired. I'm tired to have spend almost every single days in the last 8 years wanting to die. I'm tired of all the hatred towards myself. I'm tired of not being able to connect with others. I'm tired to be excluded. I'm tired of people telling me I shouldn't have problem because I am pretty. I am tired of being an object, of being used. I'm tired of not caring. I'm tired to be a disappointment to my family. I'm tired of letting people down and hurting the ones who try to love me. 

But most of all I am tired of watching my life from far away and being stuck in this parallel universe. I feel lonely and exhausted. 

I'm done. Show's over. You can go home. 

Edit; I can't English
