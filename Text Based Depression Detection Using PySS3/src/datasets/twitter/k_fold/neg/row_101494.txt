Population Reference Bureau estimates that about 107 billion people have ever lived.Population Reference Bureau estimates that about 107 billion people have ever lived. Thats a lot of people and how many of those people do you remember? We think are lives are special, so did billions of people and where are they now?  No one remembers them, who will remember you? People who remember you will also be forgotten. So at the end no one will know you ever existed. So why should I keep living if im only going to suffer. I know I will hurt my family but at the end of the day we are just a bunch of chemicals. Killing yourself goes against millions of years of evolution thats why it's so hard to end it, so I kinda admire people that actually end it. IDK just rambling.
