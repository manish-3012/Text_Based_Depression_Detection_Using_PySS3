Mega millionsI'd do anything to win this mega millions lottery. I've already sold my soul to satan. Which is stupid because I don't even know if the devil exists or if he'd even want my pathetic life in the first place. I'll gladly burn in eternal flames for him if I can just have a decent life on earth. I want to give money to my best friends and make sure my mom has everything she wants. I'm tired of waking up bitter and pissed off at my past and my current path. I'm tired of life in general. I just want some fuck you money. I'll probably buy a solid gold deagle I'll use to blow my brains out when I'm 40. It'll be a great life.
