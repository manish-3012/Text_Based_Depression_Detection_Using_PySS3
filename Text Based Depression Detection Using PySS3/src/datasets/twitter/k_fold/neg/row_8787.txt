Life's gone to shit 14 MI've been contemplating it for the past few months but whenever I'm about to I just can't it's like there's a barrier between my knife and my throat,  my family problems don't help it, drinking problems, lies, the only thing I can't name are drugs and abuse on that list. But I'm at the age where I understand what's going on around me and I know I need to let my moms problems be hers and not mine. I need to let go and stop trying to protect her. And her promises mean nothing to me, it's like "I'll prove to you I can change" is just words that are trying to please me. I hear it as "I'm saying this to try to make you trust me again" and it's getting older and older I'm stuck with 3 options 

1. Live life through this hell until I can live by myself

2. End it all with a knife to the jugular

3. Leave my current life behind and just get my long board my clothes, parents gun, emergency money, and food...then skate away until problems just fade away

I have my notes for 2 &amp;amp; 3 written out and I'm ready to place them on our fridge any day.

I've just been ready to end it all for a while now
