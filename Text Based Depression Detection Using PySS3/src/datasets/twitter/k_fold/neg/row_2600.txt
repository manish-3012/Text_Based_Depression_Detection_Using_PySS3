I'll kill myself today.Can't live anymore. I've been battling with my "second" mind that opposes me. It has ruined me and it clouded the real me. I've been stuck in terrible situations unable to notice what the real me wanted because of my messed up "second" mind. It has confused me, deluded me, made me fearful and I can't think straight anymore. It's terrible to live this way. I went to therapy, of course that didn't help, talked to my family but only upset them and made them depressed. I don't have friends of course, haven't had friends in forever. I sadly existed.
