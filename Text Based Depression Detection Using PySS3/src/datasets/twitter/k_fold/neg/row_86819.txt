I dont know what to do anymore, I feel so lost, and I have no happiness in living anymoreI just feel so alone constantly, even when Iâ€™m with people I know. I dont feel happiness for anything anymore, and I feel that my life isnt worth living anymore, but I dont feel like dying yet, but I fear those feelings might be around the corner. I feel like Iâ€™m so far behind in life than all the people I know, like Iâ€™ve never had intimacy with anyone, and I feel like Iâ€™m not wanted by society as a whole. I also feel like I should be happy because others say Iâ€™m in a good place in life, but Iâ€™m not. I donâ€™t know if I have any friends at all, and that hurts, it hurts even more when I think about that Iâ€™ve never had a bestfriend, and I feel like I never fit in, with anyone, or anything, Iâ€™m so tired of faking that Iâ€™m fine when Iâ€™m so obviously not, and itâ€™s so exhausting, all I ever do is go through my day at uni before I come home and just lie in bed and hate myself, I see absolutely nothing good about myself, Iâ€™m ugly, dumb and a waste of space, I feel like Iâ€™m evil against everyone I meet, even though I never mean to be. I donâ€™t know what to do, and Iâ€™m afraid I might be in a to dark place already...
