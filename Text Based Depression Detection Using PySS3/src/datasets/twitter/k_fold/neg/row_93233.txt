My girlfriend just save my lifeI told her that I'm sure that I'm trans.  She didn't believe it and reminded me of all the things I've done that made me happy as a man.  We both cried and I'm feeling so much better right now.  She assured me that I can beat my feelings of being transgender and that they're all in my head.  I think it's just TOCD right now or I could just be wrong about what is causing it.  She really believes that I'm wrong about being trans.  She did say that she has no idea what she would do if I am trans, but she couldn't stay with me. It was upsetting.

I want everyone to know that I'm safe now.  I feel a lot better.
