Intrusive are now more prominant than ever (20M)Burner ofc  

I've been having suicidal/Intrusive thoughts for near 2 years now  

This starts with my Girlfriend of 4 years breaking up with me, because she's never had a chance to be alone and she wanted to experiance that, ontop of I wasn' the greatest but we never argued and she never told me I did anything wrong, she didn't know about these thoughts, I never told her because being around her repressed them to a point where they managable, but now she's gone it's super hard, we're still friends, we're still talking but this is where things get worse  

I spoke to her best friend last night, said she was in favour of us getting back together, poured my heart out to her, she sees her, tells her I said she has no chance of getting with anyone again, spun my words, things spark into an argument, she super mad, I don't think i'm ever going to see her again, I explained what I said would is completely illogical since I want her back, this would never help me  

Since I think our reunion is completely off the table now  

How should I deal with these?  

Do I tell her about these? I feel like if I did it would come across as a sympathy grab  

What should or shouldn't I do?  

Sorry if this rambley, i'm in quite the state.
