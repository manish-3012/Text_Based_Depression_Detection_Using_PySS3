i disappointed my parentsmy father keeps hating me more and more because of my failures in engineering college. they make the family look bad. my mother loves me and she has been putting up with my fathers dumb shit troughout her life. life was unfair and hard for both of them for different reasons. i dont think he realizes i would kill myself over this, thing is, i cant take it anymore. they're the only thing i have and i love them so much, i dont care about anything else, i dont want to live without their love and i lost my dad's already. He used to be so proud of me for the dumbest reasons and Now that i need him the most he just kicks me down. i've been taking a hard look at my life and i want it to be over. i cant stop crying while writing this, goodbye everyone, its been good while it lasted
