Just wondering if it's all lip serviceSo many people (myself included) can't cope with poverty and a quality of life that is so substandard that death is actually a better option than living (surviving, it's not a life). Has anyone ever been prevented from killing themselves by an actual opportunity to better themselves, to get off a filthy floor and wear clean clothes with no holes in them?

I know the argument: homeless people WANT to live in the streets. They're "mentally ill", they're drug addicts, blah, blah. Forget them, just for argument's sake. Is lip service all there is for intelligent, non-criminal, moral people who are just down on their luck?

Let's talk? Really?

The father who has had everything taken in a one-sided divorce, falsely accused, separated from his children, no job, reputation and career and the house that he's paid for gone in a flash. The woman who has no family, but has spent 6 months in traction after getting sideswiped by a drunk driver, only to find everything lost. No job, no car, no place to live.

I always wonder how many lives would be saved by a simple kindness; a small opportunity...and since there appears to be no such thing to unlucky people, why are there no "Suicide Centers", like in the movie "Soylent Green"? Can people who live unlucky lives really be blamed for not wanting to just survive? Who's life is it anyway?
