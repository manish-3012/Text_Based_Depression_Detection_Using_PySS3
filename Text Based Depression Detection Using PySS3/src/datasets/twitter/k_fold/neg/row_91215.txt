I'm going to do it hopefully in the next 3 months.I am about to turn 18. I've made posts about it before, but I absolutely hate the idea of legally becoming an "adult" it's seriously depressing me to think about. I don't want to grow up and I feel like none of us are physically adults till our 20's, sometimes later. I'm always depressed about the way I look, my parents and people around me are all miserable, I try to talk to people about my suicidal tendencies and it's almost like they just say "oh that's bad" and that's it. I want to end it so badly, I really need help. Please. Because at the same time, I want someone to tell me something that will make me feel better. Also, my neighbors are a nightmare, and things are going to crap all over. I lost someone really close to my heart this year and have been ill for most of the year.

Sorry this is a jumbled up post, but I'm just a scared young man who feels like he needs to die and some part of me wants to, but I want to make it through for my family. Please help me...

Josh.
