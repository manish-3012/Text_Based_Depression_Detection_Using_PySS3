Probably going to do it once Christmas season is over.For at least a decade now I've had suicidal thoughts and given some real thought on how I would do it.  I've run out of reasons not to do it now though other than "I don't want to do it around Christmas"
   
I literally have nothing in my life.  No friends and most of my family is horrible. I'm in massive student loan debt but have no degree because I'm a dropout.  I've got a shit job but can't find anything better with my non-existent skillset.  Because of my shit job and student loans I can't afford to move out of my parents house.  
  
I literally hate every single aspect of my life and I have for as long as I can remember. I'm not sure what to do other than to just end it.
