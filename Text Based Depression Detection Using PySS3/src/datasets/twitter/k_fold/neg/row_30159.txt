Im still rational, Im afraid I will go into crisis and fuck up...Things keep getting out of hand in my head, been recovering for almost a year now after being in crisis for about 2 straight fucken years of my life. At this point the problems keep accumulating again and I getting a sense of what I use to feel some months back. Im scare, I dont think i can handle again. I dont know what to do...feel very helpless.
