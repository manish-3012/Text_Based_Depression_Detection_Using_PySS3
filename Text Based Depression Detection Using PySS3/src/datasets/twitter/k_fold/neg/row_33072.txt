Telling my counselor I want to die?I've been extremely suicidal for three weeks, I wanted to die today but my mom kept me from being alone. I have a counseling appointment and I dont know if I can tell him or if I want to. Its gotten to the point where I only think of how to kill myself and how I'm going to say goodbye to my friends and family and other people who know me. Its not like its only at night, I could be in a car on the way to a movie, all happy and everything, and then see a car going really fast and think "wow it'd be pretty nice if i was them and could just yank the wheel". I've never felt like this before, not this bad. The last time I told someone about this, I was sent to the hospital for a week. I dont think people will believe me this Time, since its like I just cried wolf last time.
