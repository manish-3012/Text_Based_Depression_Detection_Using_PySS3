always wondered when Iâ€™m going to finally kill myself. And now I knowNo one usually responded to my posts so I will write everything here because I have no one to talk to anyways. Maybe someone will read this.

My parents are downstairs in the living room talking and watching tv. Iâ€™m in my room planning my suicide. 
I was taking Zoloft for the past three months and nothing was better. The same anger and sadness. I was taking four pills everyday and nothing was better. I was supposed to go to a concert and I canâ€™t now because my dad lost his job. Fucking stupid reason to kill myself over right? But in reality this was the last safety line keeping me alive. Last year I was on verge of killing myself but then I got tickets for a concert of my favorite band and when I was there I was the happiest Iâ€™ve ever been. Iâ€™ve been thinking about that day everyday. My memories are foggy from all that adrenaline and excitement, but I still love to think about it. This was a recharge I needed; it gave me life and now I feel the battery is going to die soon. I was hoping for another recharge but that day wonâ€™t come.
I read once about suicide from crushed cherry seeds and I have a bag of frozen cherries with seeds in my freezer right now. I will probably do it tonight when everyoneâ€™s gone to sleep. I will hug my dogs. I will give my hamster lots of treats. And then I will crush 20 cherries and I will eat them mixed with some peanut butter that I love. I havenâ€™t eaten anything in 3 days so I hope it will be quick. Ahrriwederrchi ðŸ˜‰
