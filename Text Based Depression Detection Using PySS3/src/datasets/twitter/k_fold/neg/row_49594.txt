Why wait till I die ? Why not I just do this right now and escape the matrix ?We are slaves. We are slaves to slave masters a.k.a elites. We work so we can let goverment makes money on us. Once we born they gave us a name, and ID. They told us this is tree, this is a car, this is a school where u will go and waste most of your whole and this is a job where you will work for us for every second of your life till u get old than u can finally be free . Lol. They've been programming us since we born. Everything is made to destroy us.

After spending some time on conspracies you will see what kind of f*cked up things going on behind the media. World isn't just all about rainbows and la la land.

Why not just I do it right now and escape from this place ?
