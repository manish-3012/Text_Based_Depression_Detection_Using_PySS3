Just found out my dog is dying and I want to go with herNothing has been going right. Its been a year of living back with parents. Meds, therapy, it all doesnt work. I just accepted a job today thats a decent job but i dont know if i even have what it takes. 

I hate myself so much. I got my dog 1.5months ago, shes 7. We bonded so well, we do everything together, shes helped me so much, i get exercise, im not lonely anymore etc. It was the one thing i really had going for me, she makes me so happy. 

I took her to the vet today regarding a quickly growing lump. Turns out she has malignant tumours throughout, im bringing her to surgery tmr but its likely shell only have a month or a few months to live. I dont know if i can start this new job next week the way i am. I am tired of the bullshit. Im never going to be ok, i hate living. My stomach feels so bad and im crying. I dont even think i truly care because im a bad person. I want to wait and enjoy our time together, and then i want to end my life afterwards. Part of me just wants to end it this week before starting the new job. I just want to be done. 

I dont care about anything, dying is permanent and scary but enough wasting time.
