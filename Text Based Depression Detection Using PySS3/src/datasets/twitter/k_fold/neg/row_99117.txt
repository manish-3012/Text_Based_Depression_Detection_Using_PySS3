The only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my dogNot only that, my OG plan won't even work, because I've moved into a home where it's near impossible to carry it out without collateral damage (it involved a small, sealed room and co2 poisoning). I don't want to slit my wrists or hang myself. It looks like it hurts. I want to go in peace and quiet.

I haven't wanted to kill myself since last October. I thought I was getting better.

I wish my dog knew how much I loved him. He's the only living being I actually care about and feel safe around. He's laying next to me and he's falling asleep. I love him very much.
