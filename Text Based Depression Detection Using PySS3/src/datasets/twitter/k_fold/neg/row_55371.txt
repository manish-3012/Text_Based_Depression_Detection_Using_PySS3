The EU Referendum result was the last straw (x-post r/MMFB)I'm 23, male, English (not proud of it), and 2016 has been the worst year of my life.

I graduated from University in 2015, I managed to get a decent grade but barely tried. After leaving I got a call centre job, but left after a month due to the pressure from customers/employers causing numerous panic attacks a day.

A few months later, I got a temp job doing basic admin, but middle management fired me 2 weeks later after I had 1 panic attack.

That was in November 2015. Since then my self confidence has hit rock bottom, meaning during the few job interviews I could manage (or be bothered) to get I come across as a terrible candidate (and they're not wrong). I have become partially dependant on cannabis, I'm on an anti-depressant which doesn't do shit, and I broke my arm.

Now the UK has ''democratically decided'' to leave the EU, I can't see a future for myself. Suicide has been on my mind for the past few months, but now I'm starting to seriously consider it. I'm aware many people are in worse positions, and have stronger depression and suicidal thoughts. I'm not on the verge of suicide, I'm just thinking about it a lot. 

TL;DR: Got a degree in 2015, then tried 2 different Jobs and failed both. Now I've got no confidence, a cannabis dependence, a broken arm, useless anti-depressants (which should cause insomnia if I go off them) and now the UK has ''decided'' to leave to EU based on bigotry, fear and blind patriotism. I don't want to live anymore.
