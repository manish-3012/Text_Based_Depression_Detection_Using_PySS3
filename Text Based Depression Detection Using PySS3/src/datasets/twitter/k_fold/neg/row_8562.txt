Considering doing it in a few daysI just feel so alone. I think my emotional need can never be fulfilled. I went to visit my parents for a month, i'm still at their place. I just feel so far away from them. We have nothing to talk about, when i'm with them it feels awkward. I hate my sister and her girlfriend (not really her girlfriend but considering the amount of time she is at my parent's house it might as well be her girlfriend), and they hate me back. I never go out with friends, the only people i get to talk to, its only written. Sometimes when I try to see people it's only awkward
I hate living alone and being alone, yet i have to stay alone most of the time...
I don't think i have the courage to go back to school next week
