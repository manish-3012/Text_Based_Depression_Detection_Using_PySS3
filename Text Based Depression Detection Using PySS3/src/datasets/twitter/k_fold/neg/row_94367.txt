Can't stop hurting.I can't stop the pain inside. I turned to self harming to help deal with my depression and low moods, but that's turned unhealthy as now I can't stop self harming. I find it pleasurable and I'm fixated on going harder and deeper. I can't stop. I don't know what to do. What's the point after all? Life is shit. Maybe I should just cut deeper. Or find another way to relieve the pain.
