Every night I pray I won't wake up.I don't know, I felt like I had to put this somewhere, as a small monument to the life of an angsty man child who never had anything left to look forward to. 

Back story for those of you who care to know; I've always been more of an introvert, hadn't had friends for years until recently when I started to mingle with a group of people at my (now former) workplace. They were some of the happiest days of my life, and I honestly thought things were changing for the better. Well shit happened and I ended up getting dumped in my first real relationship and now I've irrevocably pushed them all away. I'm 26. Jobless. Live with parents. And to revert back to what I used to be kills me. I miss my friends, the relationships. I gave it all a chance and somehow or another everything went south. I don't want to wake up anymore. I used to be so active, getting fit, going out, making friends both outside and on the internet. I hate what happened. I hate myself. The only thing that keeps me going are my dogs and (laugh if you want) video games. This is me in a nutshell.

So, I tried. I tried life. But life was all like nope and here I am. I  can't do it anymore.
