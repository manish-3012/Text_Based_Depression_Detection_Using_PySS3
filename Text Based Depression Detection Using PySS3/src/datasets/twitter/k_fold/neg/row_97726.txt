Well fuck, two days and two postsIâ€™m on my last fucking straw here and I hoped Iâ€™d get some decent support last night but I guess I didnâ€™t word my post good enough for yâ€™all! On the plus side Iâ€™m actually feeling an emotion now instead of the usual lack of all emotions, but idrk if itâ€™s better to feel stressed-as-fuck than nothing 

I couldnâ€™t bring myself to actually open up to the one friend I have in the past for whatever reason and now itâ€™s spiralling out of control, I guess Iâ€™m just desperate for semblance of care/love/support that Iâ€™d go make _two fucking posts in two days_ even though I know I donâ€™t have the guts to really kill myself no matter how much I want to
