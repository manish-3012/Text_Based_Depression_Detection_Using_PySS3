Lost the girl, lost my job. Maybe I can do something right this time and just go.Lost everything ive worked for the past 7 years in 24hrs. If there is a God, he must just wake up some days and decide â€œdamn. His life is going a little to well, letâ€™s see if I can fix thatâ€ Giving it a week or 2 to decide but it really doesnâ€™t matter. Itâ€™s funny. You reach out to everyone and theyâ€™re all to busy. But if you died; they would be the same people at your funeral pretending they ever gave a fuck.
