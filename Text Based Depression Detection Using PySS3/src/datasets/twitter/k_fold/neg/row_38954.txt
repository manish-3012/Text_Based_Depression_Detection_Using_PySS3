A Crossroads and One YearMy birthday is very close to New Years Day, and next year I'll be frickin 30.  I'm not really willing to continue living the same way I've been living, basically wasting precious time.  A few months ago, on an impulse I took forty sleeping pills and still woke up in the morning.  My 30s have got to be different, far more intentional.

So anyway, all that means I'm at a crossroads right now.  I have one year to push myself firmly down the right path, or else.  I really think that I can and will do it, and that this time next year I will have begun living life the way I want to live it.  I really think I will do it this time, so that's good probably!
