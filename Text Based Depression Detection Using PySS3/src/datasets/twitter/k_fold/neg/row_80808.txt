I Can't Connect With AnybodyFriends, family, girlfriends, strangers, anyone it's the same story over and over. I always just have people come and go, everytime they find a way to hurt me badly. Overtime I've built a wall around myself because I've only learned to not trust people on a deeper level. I feel really numb to things anymore, I just am tired of the constant hurting from everything people have done to me. I don't know how long I can take it, my feelings resurface whenever it's really bad and I have had a few times I've almost committed suicide. I don't have a place in the world and no matter how much I try to escape it, nothing changes. I can only cope because of music and getting high. I don't know why I even exist if I only suffer, I wish I could have one person that loved me and cared about me.
