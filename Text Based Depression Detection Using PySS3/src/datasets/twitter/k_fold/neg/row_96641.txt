I don't know how to title this. I just need to talk.Every day seems to get more and more humilating for me in some way. I can't get a job in my field because I'm straight up being discriminated for being disabled, and the more I reach out the more I get taken advantage of by people wanting a good laugh at my expense. I don't see a way forward that isn't humilating to me. Plus, I'm constantly being into things I don't want to be involved in just so I can be there for people I care about. 

There's nothing I can really do. I have to lie to my doctors about how I'm feeling or my fantasies of putting a handgun in my mouth because I don't get taken away against my will just for wishing to die. Talking to anyone that cares about me about how I feel just leads to judgement and lectures they're doing to make themselves feel better. I can't even cry because I don't like how tears burn my face. 

I'm sorry if I'm posting too much on this account, but I just want to be heard and acknowledged. Also, sorry for rambling and practically saying nothing. I can't formulate a complete thought right now because of how shitty I feel. I just want to get this out to people that might understand and might have answers on how to get over it.
