What is the pointIâ€™m 15 and a freshmen in high school. I am probably going to kill myself soon. I have no potential to be anything and no real friends. Iâ€™m trapped in a endless cycle of just waking up hating myself then going back to sleep. All my â€œfriendsâ€  are starting to not talk to me and I always have to make an effort to hangout with them and even when I do They donâ€™t seem to enjoy me.My brother is the perfect son of my family and I have to live in his footsteps always hearing about his perfect grades and how he is such a good person and athlete.Im chained to what his legacy is. I feel no need to live because all I would be is a waste in my family and society.
