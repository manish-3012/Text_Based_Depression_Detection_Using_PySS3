Why can't I feel anything? Don't even want to eat anymoreI'm sorry for this long post, but I just feel like I can't cope anymore. I'm struggling with feeling this sense of complete hollowness. I've felt this deep sadness for years and it just won't go away. But it's not sadness where I can cry, it's just this consuming emptiness. I'm so so tired and numb and it makes me lash out at others just to feel something. I hate myself for hurting those around me but I just can't stop. I'm always so irritable and easily set off. I don't know why I overreact and make small issues so much bigger than they need to be. I just feel this immense build-up of pressure inside of me and it's like I'm going to explode if I don't let it out on someone. It's pushing people away from me because I just can't apologise. 

My family thinks I don't apologise because I think I'm perfect or something, but that's so wrong. I know how imperfect I am, I think about my faults constantly and I can recognise when I've done something wrong but I just can't bring myself to say sorry, but then the guilt eats me up. 

Just feel so numb and empty all the time. It's been so long since I could genuinely feel something. It hurts so much to think back to when I was happy because I can't see myself feeling like that again. I don't find happiness in the things that used to make happy. I don't even enjoy music anymore despite it being the thing that used to be my favourite. I don't feel like listening to it, I just skip through my Spotify playlist because I don't feel interested in any of it. Not even going out with my friends makes me happy. I know objectively I should be happy with my friends, but I feel like I'm behind a glass wall and I can see their happiness but I can't reach it. I don't even feel like eating. Eating feels like a chore to me - nothing sounds or tastes appealing. 

The future just feels so hopeless for me.
