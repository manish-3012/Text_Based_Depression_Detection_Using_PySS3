Bought some rope and shaved my face so my beard would not get caught in my nooseCurrently at work right now with some tears building up. I'm just tired of it, guys. I pushed away everyone that tried to care for me and I just can't sleep until I am fucking wasted. I am too afraid to seek professional help and I have never been to any kind of hospital. I shouldn't feel this way at 20 but what choice do I have? I do not have any family that I know of except for my brother and father, but I truly hate them for who they are. So I am pretty much done. This life just is not worth it to me and I know that it is selfish to clock out early but, again, what choice do I have?
