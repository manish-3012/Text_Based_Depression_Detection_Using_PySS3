Sliding down the hole againIâ€™m a 40yo male. I suffer depression since I was 15, and thought the worse was over by the time I got married in 2015. Well, I was very wrong.  Started a business in 2014 and went broke in 2017. All my savings evaporated, went on a downward spiral, got separated on 2018 and divorced last year.  Attempted suicide in 1997 and in 2018. Took a lot of pills both times and was treated almost immediately so I survived both times. I have a 4yo son that right now is the main motivation for me to fight. It an exhausting fight, every day, every minute. A lonesome fight. I have left but maybe 2 real friends that still listen to me every now and then. Medicine helps me to not hit rock bottom but also makes me just a piece of meat that breaths by default.  Iâ€™m unemployed, living in a country full of violence, corruption and hunger.  No opportunities for me since Iâ€™m in terrible debt, with not a single penny in bank account.  With a bachelors and an associate degree I feel the most useless human being on earth. Worthless. Deep down in my heart I really donâ€™t want to die, but I canâ€™t withstand any more suffering, Iâ€™m tired. I really didnâ€™t want to bothered those few around me with all my crap anymore so maybe someone hear wanted to share some time with me. Maybe someone can share some hope
