If I can just survive till friday, ill live. please help meI'm going to drop out of college. I don't know what I'm going to do, but I have proved to myself that I can't handle it. If I can just survive three more days of classes, I'll be able to drop out over the weekend.

The only problem is I have impulsively tried to kill myself 4 times this week without even thinking. I'm worried that I'll succeed within the next two days. I really don't want to die, but I'm so weary that the smallest things are setting me off. Please, what is something I can do to make sure I hold together till the weekend.

I dont know what I'm going to do after I drop out. I almost feel like Ill just kill myself afterwards, but somehow I feel like I should drop out first and live a little longer. maybe thats a good sign, maybe Ill get through it.
