They won't shut up.They won't shut up. They keep going on and on and on and make me feel like murdering everything living and non living so that they shut up and I can finally get some peace and quiet.

Rationally speaking, I know that the voices aren't real things or people who are bugging me. There's no one there just voices in my head that continue to make me want to cease to exist. How the fuck do I escape them? I just want to rip my brain out of my skull or bash my head against a wall until they shut up. I don't honestly know how much longer i can take them shouting till rationality escapes me. All I want is some peace and quiet. I need to study for an exam next week and I just can't concentrate on anything.
