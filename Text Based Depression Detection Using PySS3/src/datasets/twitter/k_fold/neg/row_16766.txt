I never thought I could get this low.I've been commenting on Suicide Watch for a long time. I know other than the few trolls that are far and few in between, there are a lot of good people here. Today was the day I finally snapped. I relapsed. I've been dealing with depression for the last 2 years. Between self medication with video games,  caffeine, sleep deprivation, and self harm, today is the day I finally relapsed. My suicidal thoughts about how easy it would to just grab a rope and tie a noose around my neck and string it from my banister right outside my room keep coming. I'm scared to sleep, they all come at me. My dad doesn't understand, he simply claims, I'm 62 I've gone through worse shit than you. I can't live with my mom (Schizo), and I'm just lost now. My cutting has gone from simple cuts on the wrist to 5cm long gashes with my pocket knife on my arm. I don't know what to do anymore.
