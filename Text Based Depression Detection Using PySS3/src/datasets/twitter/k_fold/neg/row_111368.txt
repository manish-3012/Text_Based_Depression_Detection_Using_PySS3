This actually hurts.I'm so alone right now that it hurts to live. I'm tired of this agony. I have no one.

Every day I see everyone else with their happy, smiling friends, and I sit alone in my house and live my life, with nobody speaking to me, and every day the anger and agony build and build until the day it all bursts, and for the better or worse ends my life. 

I'm too impatient to "find friends" or "build a relationship". I don't have a counselor or therapist. This is agony.
