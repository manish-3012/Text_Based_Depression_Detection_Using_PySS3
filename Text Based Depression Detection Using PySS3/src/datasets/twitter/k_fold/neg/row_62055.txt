Few questions before leaving..Ok guys i am new in this thread, I am thinking to end my life soon. This may look joke to you because of how i said this but a long 10 year of depression perfectly tought me how to act normal. I dont want to bore you with my whole life story of 'how i bacame like this' here.

Before leaving i have few question to which i want answers.

"They say suicide is sin", but why if it helps me to get rid of my pains and no ones around me to worry.

"They say its against gods will", how? God may have already decided that someday in my life i am gonna die like this.

I have few more but i will ask those later in comments.
