Fuck "mental healthcare"There's a pandemic, I can't meet anyone. I'm linked to a clinic that runs a crisiscare. After my last attempt I was admitted to the crisiscare, but not moved up on priority for a therapist AT THEIR OWN CLINIC. Their crisiscare worker forgot I existed after 2 weeks. He missed our appointment, I called, he was busy "he'll call you when he's done". It's been 3 weeks.

My GP linked me through someone who isn't a doctor or a licensed therapist but apparently they're licensed to tell people "hey, go see a sun, do something, don't kill yourself, family be big sad." Currently she's the only person I talk to because everyone else is in a pandemic. I tell her "yo, telling me to go outside and do stuff isn't helping, I despise my family, that isn't helping. It's getting really frustrating and it makes me feel worse." Her fucking response? "Yo start taking anti-depressants. Like I'm not a doctor so maybe like call a doctor about this first, but I'm sure it'll help. I can't diagnose anything so idk if you even have depression and it might make you want to kill yourself even more for 2 weeks DURING A PANDEMIC, but go for it. Also yeah I'll keep telling you to go outside cuss maybe after 11 years of mental care me repeating it will maybe help."

Fucking fuck this woman. IF I FUCKING TELL YOU IT'S NOT HELPING IT'S NOT HELPING. I'VE BEEN IN AND OUT OF THERAPY FOR 11 YEARS FUCK YOU FOR THINKING I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOESN'T WORK.
