I never got the reason why people are so against suicideEvery time I see someone trying to talk someone out of suicide, it always usually boils down to "think about the people you leave behind". It drives me crazy, because in cases such as mine, there is nobody to leave behind. "Hey, you might be miserable, angry and depressed for the rest of your life, but at least people who you are close to won't have to be!". If a person finds no enjoyment in life, they should be able to kill themselves. 

I'm 26 myself, and I honestly would rather prefer death than being forced to stay alive to make everyone else happy. I'm not happy and I never have been happy, so it should be my right to leave this world. I didn't want to be a part of it anyways. I've seen enough of the world and experience enough. All that I have to look forward to is a lonely old and middle age, which doesn't seem all too appealing. 

We all die in the end, and if I'm never going to marry or reproduce, what's my biological purpose? There's already 7 billion people on this planet, useless morons like me don't need to stick around. I get that some people want to save teenagers from these sorts of things, but what happens when you're no longer young anymore? When the promise "it gets better" never happened? I'm looking forward to my suicide, but I'd just like to say that I don't think it's wrong. If you sit through 30-40% of a shitty movie, it's perfectly reasonable to assume that it won't get better.
