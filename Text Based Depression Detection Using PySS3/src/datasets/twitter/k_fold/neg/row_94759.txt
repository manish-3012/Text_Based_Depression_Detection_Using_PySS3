overwhelmedim having an attack and need to get my feelings out

i cant breathe  
voices in my head over and  over  
their words hurt  
stabbing me, more and more pain

'kill yourself'  
'no one cares'  
'no one would miss you'  
'all you do is bother others'  
'you take up space'  
'don't hurt them too'  
'cut the pain away'  
'worthless'  
'they would be better without you'  
'everyone would be happier if you disappeared'  
'useless'  
'too scared to hurt yourself?'  
'pathetic'  
'burden'  
'hurry up'  
'do it, you know you want to'
