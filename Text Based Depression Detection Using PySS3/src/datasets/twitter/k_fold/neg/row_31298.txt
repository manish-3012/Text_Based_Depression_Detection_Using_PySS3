I can't tolerate another day with this temptation to end it all.I have a massive phobia of people because I can't help but think I'm a burden to them, no matter what I say or do.

I work flat out with jobs and creative hobbies 24/7 because they are my safe place. However, I feel lonely to the point where it is so unbearable, and I want to confront my anxiety to make my friendships stronger. I'm trying so, so hard to talk to people more and build them up again, despite the fear and anxiety, but nobody seems interested in talking. The rare person that actually has a genuine interest in who I am, eventually backs away and disappears a few days later. Whenever this happens, I get so crushed.

Maybe it's because I work too much that I rarely get the energy to talk to people. Productivity used to be, and still is, my coping mechanism for depression. I'm trying to change this now and incorporate more people in my life, but I think I'm too late. I've lost my place in people's lives.

The loneliness makes me want to die more and more each day, and I can't bear it anymore.
