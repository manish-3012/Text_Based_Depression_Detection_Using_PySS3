Intrusive thoughts getting the best of meItâ€™s getting harder and harder to push them back. I keep leaving the apartment to drive, wanting to just slam my car into a tree or barrier hurling myself through the windshield. But because I donâ€™t want my body to be found or anyone injured I just drive for hours fighting back tears and thoughts of pending death. I thought about going and buying a hand gun today but Iâ€™ve pushed that off knowing that if I did, when the thoughts became to much Iâ€™d have an out in an instant with the pull of the hammer. I just want them stop. They donâ€™t get anymore manageable with medicine either or therapy. I canâ€™t talk to anyone about it without causing alarm and maybe they should be, but I just want it to stop. My mom lost my brother just last year due to an overdose and I donâ€™t want to hurt her but I donâ€™t want to live. I just wish it had been me and not him. He was the better person and didnâ€™t deserve to die. I donâ€™t have any friends other than my mom and my girlfriend. I donâ€™t want to hurt her either but honestly she deserves better than me.
