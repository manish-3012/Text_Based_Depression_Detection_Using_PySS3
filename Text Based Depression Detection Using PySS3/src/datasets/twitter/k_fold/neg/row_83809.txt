A friend's mother just tried to kill herself, how can I help them?An online friend of mine just came into the channel asking for a bit of support, I PM'd them to see what was the matter, how I could help, and that's when she informed me about her mom. 

I'm not the best with words, unfortunately. I told her that I'm here for her, that we all are in our group, and whatever I can do to help, I will. I tried comforting her, saying it would be ok, that it was going to be alright, those platitudes you spout when you don't know what to say. 

I called her on the chat, talked to her briefly before she broke off to call other (real-life) friends. Her mother is currently in the hospital, but alive. As of right now, I'm the only one in the group who knows, but she said that if she's gone for a while, I can tell the others what's going on. She's hurt, confused.

What else can I do? I'm usually on top of being there for those I care about, but I froze right then. What can I say, do, to help her? I don't like feeling lost, and I like not being able to help even less.
