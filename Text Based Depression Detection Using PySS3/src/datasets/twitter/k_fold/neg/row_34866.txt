I am about to hang myself, are there any steps I missed?Okay so I tied a noose, found a place to anchor the rope to, wrote my girlfriend a note telling her I'm sorry and would like for her to start dating again, my parents don't need a note, my friends will understand, hung a note on my door saying to call the police before coming in, is there anything I forgot?

Hope someone can reply quickly because the noose is already grasping my neck and I have the balls to do it at the moment
