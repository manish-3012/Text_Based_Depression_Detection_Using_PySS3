Death is a win-win situation for me.Now that I come to think of it...

If the Athiest's are right and "God" is a complete fucking hoax, then I will be able to rest in eternal oblivion, where there is no pain, and I can simply sleep forever.

If the Christians and Muslims are right, then I will hopefully go to "heaven" where I will be free from the misery that is life itself. And if there is a "hell", than it surely can't be that terrible, as I've came to a point where pain means nothing to me.

As for the Hindu and Buddhists, if such a phenomenon like reincarnation is real, then I will be given a new opportunity at life, one that will hopefully be better than the one I put myself into.

I just wanted to share my thoughts on death to somebody, that's all. While I am corrupted with thoughts of suicide, I simply don't have the strength to do it, and probably never will.

I decided to put this on r/suicidewatch just because I felt it would get the most attention here. Feel free to forward it to another sub... if you want.

Again, just wanted to share my thoughts with somebody, and thank you for taking the time out of your life to read such morbid philosophy.
