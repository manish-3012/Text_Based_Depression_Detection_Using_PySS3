February 3, 2015It's on a Tuesday. It's a ho-hum day that no one really gives a second thought to. No one I know has a birthday or an anniversary on February the 3rd. It's not a holiday. It's just a regular day. That's why I picked it. I don't want the date to correspond to anything special so no one would feel guilty or generally remember it. I will slip away, quietly. I've kicked and shouted and screamed for help. Thanks to being bipolar everyone assumes I'm just throwing a tantrum and goes along with their busy days. I've been on every medicine they could throw at me with no results. I hate hurting the people I love over and over. Everyone that knows me is sick of my shit. I'm sick of my own shit. I have been for years. There was always a reason to put it off. I'll graduate high school. I've got small children. I will go to college. I'll start a career. Now all those things have long passed I've got no more excuses. For as long as I can remember I've battled this more or less on my own. How much longer do I have to fight just to keep those around me from feeling bad? I understand my passing will hurt a few. I feel bad for that, I really do. I want those people to understand that I've fought to live for them. Just one more year, one more month, one more day. I don't have it left in me. So, February 3, 2015 is my day. My day of freedom. 37 years of pure hell and torture is plenty enough. More than enough. This is not a cry for help. Not from me. Sometimes people just get tired of the battle. No one should fault them for that. It's been gray for so many, many years. Soon it will be black. Soon I can finally have peace.
