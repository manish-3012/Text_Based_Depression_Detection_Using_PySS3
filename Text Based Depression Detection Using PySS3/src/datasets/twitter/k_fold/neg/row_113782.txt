Want to blow my fucking brains out!So fucking angry, I see literally no point in living at all. People have told me life isnt supposed to be easy which I agree with but fuck off!

Do you really think I signed up for a shithole of a world to be born into? I didn't yet I'm still forced to be here because I'd make others feel bad. Fucking punching myself in the head to numb the urge to cut my arms because I'm so fucking filled with rage at myself and others.

I'm so tired of the sleepless nights, feeling so sick from not eating yet I still don't eat. FUCKING THERAPY IS 200 DOLLARS PER A 1 WEEK LESSON FOR ME!

I'm so fucking tired of this, i want to blow my brains out and get out of this hell! I'm going to make a plan to kill myself even if the death is painful. nothing gets better. Ive waited and waited but nothing improves, effort or not.
