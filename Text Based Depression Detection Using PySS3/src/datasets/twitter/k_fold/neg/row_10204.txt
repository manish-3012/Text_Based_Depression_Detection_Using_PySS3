i wrote this bc it felt good not asking for helphey

I feel like i have no friends even though Im sorrounded by "friends". 

I always had issues with the feeling of not belonging in a friend group.

I just feel like like they hang out with me because they are good people like they know Im fucked in the head. like if you know someone is suicidal, you hang out with him because of the goodness of your heart not necessarily because you like them as a friend

i just feel like a leech that ruins the moment. 

I have so many instances/memories that I overthink that kinda connects that they just hang out with me outta their goodness.

I really got nothing going on for me, lost passion in everything, and don't know what to do with life. I feel like no one understands and I got no one to go to. Im just fucking scared dude

I dont know who to talk to, i dont want my family worrying about me.

I did open up to my brother a few years ago because i wanted to die and he said it would get better

I feel like it just got harder and I'm starting to think something is wrong with me.
