Tested my method today. Might give it a go tonight.Almost passed out today trying my method. It seems like it will work. Skipped my classes, will call in to work, and dipping on plans with my girlfriend tonight. I plan on leaving a little note for my housemate to find tonight when she wakes up, it will ask her to check on the heater in my room. She is a therapist so I'd rather her find me rather than my girlfriend who just lost her sister to suicide in Feb. I feel terrible about the hurt I will leave behind, but I'm just so tired. I can't do it anymore and I'm powerless to change myself or my situation. I hope they heal from this quickly.
