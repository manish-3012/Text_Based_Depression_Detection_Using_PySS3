Staying alive for othersEvery aspect of my life is miserable. However, as the date draws nearer, I get scared hurting my mom. My dad died from an OD when I was 12 and it devastated her. However, despite how bad I feel about hurting her, she has never been an emotional support for me. Why do I owe her my life? Why do I have to live in eternal suffering just to make others happy. I've been trying to commit suicide since I was 16, but I've always been interupted. I really want to die (for reasons I won't disclose). I'm worried about the immediate pain of the act and also damage if I survive yet again. I cut off all contact with everyone I know the last 3 weeks, and that's helped me getting over my friends. My mom is the only obstacle in the way. I wish she could understand how much I suffer everyday. Why would someone want someone to live in eternal misery. One thing I hate is "a permanent solution to a temporary problem". I've been wanting to die for the past few months, and even though this seems "temporary", my happiness is temporary too. I fall back into suicidal thoughts again. What's the point of living if I only feel happiness sometimes and at any moment it could be taken away from me. It wasn't my choice to be born, why can't I choose to die?
