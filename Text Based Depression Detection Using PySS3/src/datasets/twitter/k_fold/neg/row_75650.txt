Same Song and DanceRecently I (M17) have realized that life is just a repeating cycle of misery, and the only things that are consistent in life are the bad things.

Consistencies:

Parents are disappointment in me

I will get stressed over school

I won't be close with anyone

I will be alone

I am unattractive

I will be paranoid over everything

&amp;#x200B;

Cycles:

get stressed, push people away, get depressed, try to get back relationships, fail and get stressed again, repeat.

try to do well in school, get stressed and do worse, get yelled at by parents, get more stressed and do even worse, repeat.

&amp;#x200B;

Moral of the story, life is bad and I'm going to hang myself.
