It's not getting betterEveryone tells me pain and being at a low point is temporary and it just isn't true. It happens every day, multiple times a day that I feel insecure, talentless, disgusted with myself, unhappy with my past, horrified and convinced that I'll never succeed. I'm 20 and feel too old to change my bad draw in life, but too young that I'm scared to kill myself. I just don't know any other way to get away from the daily pain of going through the dread, feeling like shit and crying because I don't feel like I've gotten a chance to be happy to begin with. My parents abused me, my ex abused me, my closest friends ended up using and leaving me. I'm scared to make new friendships and believe my new friends will turn on me like the others or secretly hate me. I'm just really unhappy with life and I don't think anyone near me understands how exhausted I am. The joys of life are too short lived to combat the negative. I'm scared I'm going to live the rest of my life feeling this way whether I die young or old. I do go to therapy and love my therapist but its not doing enough and I've taken all SSRIs that are an option without success. I don't think things will get better and am ready to make an attempt on my life again. I wish technology was at a point where I could wake up in a new body and start over.
