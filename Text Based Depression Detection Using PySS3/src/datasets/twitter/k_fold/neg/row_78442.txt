Every time I go outEvery time I go out it seems to reinforce my feelings of how alone I truly am. I can be in a room of people I know and still feel like I'm by myself in a dark room. 

**edit** probably should mention I stopped taking my meds because I didnt feel like they were doing anything anymore and wanted to get the withdrawal out of the way
