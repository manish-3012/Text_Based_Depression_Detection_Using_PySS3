Coming closer to 30 and nothing to showIf I don't do a damn thing with myself by the time I'm 30. I'm ending it all. I've endured so much and taken in so much with return in so little. People are falling apart all around me and I can't do much about that. People are disappointing me equally the same, forcing me to do things I may regret later but didn't do sooner when they got really bad on me.

I'm living with a parent approaching 27 this year. I'm working at a job for piss squirt of money I know is just desperation that got me in there because life has kicked my ass four years ago. Nobody and nothing is helping me with my predicament to get me out of these problems. Whenever they do, though, it's for the wrong reasons and for themselves. Like, I turned down an opportunity for a career at an IT job out of spite for him and because I was completely inexperienced and unfit for the job. But he only gave a fuck about how my decision will impact HIS credibility and HIS prestige. Yeah, some help.

But everything is on my shoulders now, with everything. I've got no car, I've got no source to go to that's stress free. I've been fat most of my life and I'm experiencing health issues that will take thousands of dollars to fix and treat properly. I don't have much of a legacy tied to my name, except for being online for twenty years but that amounts to dick. I don't have a very supporting family, because the bottom line is that they're only covering their own asses by making themselves look good incase something goes south between me and them.

I am under so much unbearable pressure and my endurance reaching it's limit that I'll have no qualms throwing it all away by that age. I refuse to be like some of my friends who are 30 and complacent living in their problematic situations with no will to improve. I simply refuse that lifestyle and if I don't do something about it, then I'm done. They say that when the one who has a tough hide or a strong demeanor starts breaking down, then everything starts breaking down. Such is the case that is me.

Life is a cruel joke in of itself with what's provided for people to live under. No more.
