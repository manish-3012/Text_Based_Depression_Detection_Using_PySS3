Everything has just come crashing downI just got results back from uni and anything I hoped to do after graduation is now impossible. I haven't made any plans for post graduation because I believed in myself. Lol. 

I'm now sat very quietly next to my boyfriend, I can't tell him how I'm really feeling. I've had depression since I was 12, now 20, diagnosed bipolar and I've never wanted to kill myself as much as I do in this moment. I can't see a way out. I know that life goes on, but I don't want to live a life where I can't do what I dreamed of doing. The dream wasn't even unattainable, it was a perfectly regular job and I've fucked my degree so I have no hopes of doing that anymore. 

I want to drop out and disappear. My family are going to be so disappointed in me. I came to uni because I wanted to prove everyone wrong. I missed so much school as a teenager that I barely finished my GCSEs, but I got good a levels and into a good uni. For what? To graduate with an average degree and continue hating life with a low level job because I have nothing special to offer? Just because life goes on doesn't mean I want any part of it. 

I don't know what to do. The only thing stopping me from doing anything right now is my bf who won't let me leave his side. I just can't do this anymore.
