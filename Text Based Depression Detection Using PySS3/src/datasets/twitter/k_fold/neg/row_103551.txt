Iâ€™d kill myself but I am so scared of living with permanent damageI donâ€™t want to risk brain damage. Iâ€™m so passionate about so many things and I need to be able think about them if I survive. Iâ€™m already chronically ill and constantly in pain. I donâ€™t want to add to that. I wish there were an easy, accessible, full-proof method to suicide. If I had a gun, Iâ€™d do it. Too inaccessible. I canâ€™t run a car in my garage. I donâ€™t want to risk carbon monoxide getting in my house and hurting my family while they sleep. There is nothing for me to do but live miserably or risk ending up worse off. Maybe I should go to the hospital, but Iâ€™m a college student and poor. I canâ€™t fucking afford that and Iâ€™m not gonna reach out to my parents to help pay for a lost cause.
