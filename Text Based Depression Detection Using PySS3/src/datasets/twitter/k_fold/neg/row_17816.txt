Tired of being aloneMan, people always told me that you don't find love, that love finds you. Well I've been waiting for a long time. People also told me to make myself look better, yeah, bought some nice clothes, lost some weight, still exercising but it doesn't make me feel better. I'm just tired from being alone. My life feels like its not worth it. I just want to kill myself. I feel like I'd be better off dead anyway.
