What is the point of living if I am not happy?I'm not entirely sure this belongs here, but I've been meaning to ask someone, I'll be asking my counselor when I see them next, but figured I'd ask you all since I may be considered 'suicidal.' I'm not too sure though.

So my question is as the title states: what is the point? I have never been happy, the only times I remember being happy is when I imagine I am someone else. THe first reaction to this may be 'you can change yourself, there's nothing about your situation that can't be changed' and it is true, but god damn is it hard. I've attempted numerous times to lose weight, but I just can;t seem to stick to it, I hate myself because I eat and I eat because I hate myself. If I can't find a job before February 1st, 2017 I will be homeless. I will have also let my sister, who is my roommate down, we will both be evicted, her credit score ruined and it will become unreasonably difficult for her to find another apartment after that.

I just got kicked out of school this past semester. I really don't feel like writing anymore, but life just gets harder and harder, at no point in my life have I thought to myself 'it was worth it.' 

Every decision leads to more pain and trouble. Even if I find some dead end job, what's the point of going to work to fund a life you don't want. I don't have the energy to change. I don't have the motivation, the drive. I have never been happy, there really is no reason to believe I ever will be. 

This is not a practical question but a philosophical one: what is the point of living if I am not happy?
