Today I am proud to say I will be leaving this groupTwo months ago I was heavily suicidal, waking up in a panic every hour or so each night, looking at each pole on my drive to work, thinking of how tempting it would be to drive into each one, slightly swerving off the road before quickly getting a grip of myself. Broken relationships, broken work ethic, surrounded by depressed people, self harming for the first time in my life, bottling up my emotions until Iâ€™d bleed them out. Time really does heal all wounds, my mind is clear nowadays and I have an appreciation towards this weird life thing Iâ€™ve been given, I love listening to music, working out, playing games, hanging out with friends, making money, etc itâ€™s all a blessing. Thank-you all who helped me in times of need, I will stay in touch with some of you.
