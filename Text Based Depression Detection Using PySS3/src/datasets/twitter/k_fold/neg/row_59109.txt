I've been feeling lonely for all my adult life. Even when being in relationships.I don't even know where to begin. There's so much deep deep sadness within me, I haven't truly felt normall for any significant amount of time in the past few years.
I currently have a partner who I have been telling for months that he doesn't support me. Yesterday I had an insanely bad evening and night and I cried in bed most of the night next to him. He didn't even say anything, I feel so lonely.
I haven't had a proper connection or even a friend for over years now, they always come and go. I feel like in general no one wants to be around me.
I just feel like I'm to damaged to keep going and I hoesntly can't go on feeling like this anymore.
