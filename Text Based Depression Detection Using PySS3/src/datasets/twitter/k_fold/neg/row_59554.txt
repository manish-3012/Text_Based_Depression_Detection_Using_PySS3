Is there a word for what I describe here, and what would it be?People always ask "do you have any thoughts of harming yourself" and I say "no", but then they stop talking about it because they assume I "want" to live just because I don't want to die. That's like saying I want to vote for one candidate just because I don't want to vote for the other candidate.

It strikes me as comedic, honestly. Like they're only asking what they're mandated to ask. They're machines. The system is a machine. But I don't want to be one. In the event that it comes up in full, is there a word in the dictionary whose known existence would make me prepared, or one someone made up, that means "indifferent/welcoming of fate but not seeking fate"?

To elaborate, we make little decisions everyday that ward away possible death, like looking at the stairs when you walk downstairs so you don't fall, eating so you don't starve, shooing away bees that fly around you, or leaving a shower during a thunderstorm, but I think to myself "ah, forget it, whatever happens happens, if I live I live and if I die I die".

What *is* a non-compound word for this that isn't synonymous with "suicidal"?
