Iâ€™ve lost it allI am 40 years old and Iâ€™ve lost everything in my life because of bad choice after bad choice since I was 30. I donâ€™t do drugs, itâ€™s just bad choices in relationships, with money, battling crippling major depression. I am filling my bathtub now and found a box cutter from my last move. Not leaving a note. Iâ€™m scared, I know this is going to hurt, physically. And Iâ€™m a wuss. But the emotional pain I cannot endure. I feel like my daughters will be better off with a dead mom than the alive mother they have.
