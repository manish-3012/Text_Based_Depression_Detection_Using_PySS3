I need a friend right now. Someone to talk toI just want to feel home again. I want to feel comfort. I want to feel safe in my own skin. I am scared of death, you know? Yet, I donâ€™t want to keep living in this world.

I take walks occasionally. I listen to music. I feel the warmth of the sun, cool breeze on my skin. It keeps me grounded to this world. But it doesnâ€™t last. It never lasts. I come back to reality and I find my nightmares no longer wait for sleep. 

Iâ€™ve tried to turn to my friends, even my family, but no oneâ€™s listening. No one hearâ€™s my cries. Please know Iâ€™m trying. I need someone to know that Iâ€™m trying. Even if it doesnâ€™t seem like it, and even if itâ€™s not enough, Iâ€™m trying. 

But Iâ€™m terrified. I canâ€™t even trust myself. I want to find purpose again. Find meaning. Itâ€™s not easy when itâ€™s hard to breathe. 

I just need to know someone hears me. Someone is there and Iâ€™m not all alone.
Please.
