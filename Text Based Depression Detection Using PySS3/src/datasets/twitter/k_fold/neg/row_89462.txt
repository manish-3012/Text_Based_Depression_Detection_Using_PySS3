Life sucksI have been diagnosed with mild depression about 2 weeks ago. I am taking Lexapro 10 mg now and it has been 2 weeks since i started my meditations . I feel slightly better(at least i can focus in the office now). My gf that i loved dearly cheated about a month ago and it affected my self esteem a lot( I have a history of anxiety and not liking the way i look). I am also broke as fuck. And now my 2 best friends are slowly starting to ignore me. My best friend of 10 years is not replying to my texts and never texts first to hang out. It has been like this ever since he got into a relationship recently. I don't know what to do i cant seem to enjoy anything anymore and i dont have anyone to vent to my social circle is really small. I am having suicidal thoughts occasionally too(it starts by thinking that life is meaninglessness and my death doesn't matter much) . I am really desperate to get better but i dont know how. I have this strange strong urge to change my social circle and meet new people but my social skills suck and i dont know how to meet new people. I really afraid that i will never get rid of depression and live my life regularly
