The Pain of HopeI've been having a hard time for a long time and yesterday I did something I'd been putting off for a while because I thought it wouldn't work out. I applied for graduation from college, with the provision that I finished some incomplete courses. I felt confident and so much lighter when I turned that in and felt that things might be going better. I had some excitement and motivation that I've been lacking. 

Today I was told I was not approved to graduate, despite having all I needed to do so, provided I finish those classes. 

This was the only thing I had to hope for. And I won't get it. I worked so hard and suffered for so long for nothing. 

I'm in terrible pain. 

I've written to them about this, but I don't have hope of it turning out in my favor, nothing ever does. 

This is what I get for feeling good.
