I think I'm finally going to kill myselfI feel empty. I dont fit into this world and im a burdan to everyone. I don't think there is literally any reason for me not to commit suicide at this point. my life is very little other than sadness pain and emptieness. I feel like I dont belong in society and I have no purpose. I think im going to kill myself. I have had daily thoughts of suicide for 5 years now but I always just thought "I can kill myself tomorrow, I can't be completely sure things wont get better. If I can just get through college. get a good job, a house, a girlfreind then I will be happy." But I finally realized, any of those things that are possible wont actually make me happy. I now no that I will always be alone and empty and there is nothing I can do. The pain is just too much for me to deal with anymore.
