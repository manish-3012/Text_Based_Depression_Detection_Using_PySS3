I've Given Up.I hate my life. I do. But I don't know why, people always tell me I shouldn't. I'm only 16, my parents are still together and my father is a rich business executive. But I want to die. They don't care about me. I have zero people to talk to. My medications stopped helping, as did therapy. I ruin everything. I'm not good at anything and nobody needs me. Tonight may be the night.. No one would notice...
