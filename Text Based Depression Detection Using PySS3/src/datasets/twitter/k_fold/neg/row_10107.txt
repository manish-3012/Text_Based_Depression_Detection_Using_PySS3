i feel pointlessKarma got me a couple months back, i used a guy to steer attention from a guy I've been chasing. My parents found out about my sexuality; shocked at first now they make fun of me every chance they get. I have online friends but that's pretty much it. Im social but not with any particular group. Had a friend but reconsidering if it's sincere. Im ugly and i know it, waiting for a glow up. Im just the gay one nothing else really. I can't talk to many people and feel limited as people think im hitting on them. Only reason im here us for the guy i was chasing things went well and it's a friends with benefits kinda thing. I just feel like dying won't have much if he leaves me o only have one year left of school with him as we are both leaving not sure what to do
