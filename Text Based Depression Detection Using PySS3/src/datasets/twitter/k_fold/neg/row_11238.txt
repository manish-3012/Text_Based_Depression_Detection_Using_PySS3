Suicide When the Money Runs OutThrowaway here. It's been a real rocky road. I realize now I can't do the 9-5 slave wage job anymore. Lost my job and am on unemployment. I got student loans 80k and upwards for a dubious degree. Landlord's foreclosing in 2 months and I'm going to be losing a favorable rent rate. Also in 2 months unemployment ends too, yay! Claiming disability would take a year... a year I don't have. I couldn't survive homeless here, the winters' chill can kill. 

Other people can fall back on parents to support them while I can't. I've felt always envious since they could pursue their dreams with a safe island to swim back to. I've got my own dreams of becoming an indie game developer. Even when beyond exhaustion coming home from work, I'd put a little into it each day. It moved at a snails pace and it feels I could have had a full game if I had made it my full time job and if I had parents to back me up in order to do so. I flip between belief in my skills and my project, to self destructive doubt that makes me think I'm a worthless hack. I've just completed the demo though. Shown it to a few folks, they liked it, but I think they just might be being polite. 

Thanks to my no life and no friends work that has hallowed me out. I've saved up a little money in those years. I won't immediately be homeless when unemployment ends but the waters are going to start rushing by. Some idiot hope of mine is that my Video Game Project's patreon might kick off before then. I haven't been promoting since the self doubt thing. There's a convention coming up, where I got accept. Maybe I'll sell enough demos and get donations to make up for the bloody entry fee. 

I'm going to swim out now. If/when the energy or money runs out, then I'll sink into that forever deep. At least I'll have died dreaming of that shore on the other side.
