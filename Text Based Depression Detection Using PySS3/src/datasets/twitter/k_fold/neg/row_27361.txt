I give upEvery mediocre day just eats at my soul. I feel like this world is literal hell. I was in an abusive household. I was molested. When I was 16 I was raped. All my siblings became bullies. Im the youngest so got tormented by them plenty. I don't blame them though I blame my father. He's such a destructive force. Living with him was a nightmare. He would also abandon us for years which was always a welcome reprieve, but it came with guilt because I hated my own father. He used religion against us. He had my sister completely brainwashed. I can't even believe it and I saw it with my own eyes. But I had my own type of mental abuse. I've done things I regret, but is it really my fault? I never wanted to hurt anyone and I just want to be a good person.  I lost my passion for my craft. They never wanted me to succeed anyway. I wasnt even supposed to be a pianist and now I feel like I've proved them right. I'm incredibly talented but I lost my love for it. even the professors wanted me to fail and the whole time I had to prove them wrong over and over but I quit. Fuck it. I've attempted suicide 3 times now. I don't think I'm going to attempt again but I just want to quit. I don't want heaven, I don't want  anything. If I could just cease to exist that would be amazing. I used to fight back. But it's pointless.  I was madly in love once but my past drove us apart. Every other relationship has ended in disappointment and now I don't even want it. Fuck love. I'm plagued by mental health problems and if I take my meds I don't feel as shitty but there's a ceiling. Everything is just mediocre. So I'm off my meds now, and I'm trying to use psychadelics to help but I keep having underwhelming trips. The good ones are more rare it seems. It might sound entitled but I can't deal with things being "ok" anymore. It's fucking maddening.
