I almost did itSunday night I was up all night, couldn't sleep. I felt myself having so much anxiety because I knew I was seriously considering just getting it done already. I had planned everything out in my head - what exactly I was going to do. I was going to go to the pawn shop on my lunch break, sell the engagement ring and buy a gun from the same shop. 

After work I was going to just start driving, e-mail the suicide letter I already wrote and turn off my phone.

Then I was just going to drive, for as long as it took - either until I ran out of money or until I was really ready to pull the trigger. 

That morning I was still firm on just getting to the pawn shop and getting the process started, I knew it was what I wanted to do. Fuck this ring, fuck everything it ever meant - exchange it for a weapon to take my life away.

Then, I get to the pawn shop and I give them the ring. I'm looking at their pistols while they look it over. They come back, offer me $130. Hell, I knew I wasn't going to get much - I figured $500 and that would be fine - maybe even $400. I spent $2,500 so I figured at least $500 right? Wrong. I just walked out, I was so frustrated. Another hit, I would have thought this would have taken me over the edge....but for some reason it didn't.

I went home, filed my taxes that I've been putting off(extension expired that day and I owe money.) Finished work, had a couple of drinks, sat around. 

I guess it's not a great story, I just wanted to tell someone without freaking out any of my friends or family. It's strange how something so simple, something that normally would break my heart even further can just stop you dead in your tracks. 

I still feel empty, even more-so now that I got so close to what I wanted to do..but now I don't know what I'm going to do.

Anyways, thanks to anyone who read. Maybe this will help someone, maybe this will help me. Who knows.
