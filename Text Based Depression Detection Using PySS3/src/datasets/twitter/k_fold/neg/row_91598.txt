Hello SW, this is meHello Reddit,

You guys are sort of my last hope.

I have no idea where to start, but here it goes. I apologize in advance for possible mistakes, English is not my first language.

On the day I was born, my real dad left my family. Soon after, my mother got together with another man (who I thought was my real dad all this time). That man was in jail 90% of my childhood due to drugs. When he got out, he had to take care of me and my younger brother because my mother was in the hospital, I was 12 at that time.

The next morning, I woke up, only to find him dead in the living room due to an OD on drugs.

After he died, my mother got together with another man, who had a drinking problem and he would hit us pretty much every night. At the age of 14, she asked me if I "wanted to be with daddy". I refused, so she dropped me off at the house of my oldest sister.

She tried to kill herself and my youngest brother by ODing on pills. She failed. My youngest brother spent weeks in a coma, while she got sent to jail.

My youngest brother eventually got out of that coma, and came to live with my oldest sister as well. He only stayed for about 2 years though, because he sexually assaulted the two daughters of my sister.

A few months ago, my older brother tried to commit suicide as well, by ODing on pills, but luckily my sister could call the ambulance in time. My oldest brother committed suicide when I was 8, by hanging himself due to a failed marriage.


Now I never talked to anyone about this, and everyone thinks I'm doing just fine. I cannot complain, as I have the opportunity to go to college (currently in my second year) and I have no complaints about living with my sisters family.

I still have very frequent suicidal thoughts though, lately I have been crying every single night, and I'm scaring myself as I've been checking up time schedules of trains, looking at what pills we got in the house, etc.

I just have no one to go to. My first (and only) girlfriend broke up with me 2 years ago and told me "you don't deserve anyone in your life at all, with your fucked up history". After that, I had (even worse) commitment issues with people. A few weeks ago, I finally decided to open up to a close friend of mine, and told her parts of what happened.

She was very supportive the night I told her, but the next day, she cut all contact with me by not returning calls, deleting me from Facebook, ignoring me at college, etc.

I made an appointment with the college counselor a few days ago, and he suggested a therapist, but it's still going to take a few weeks before I can go talk to him/her.

I'm currently in tears again, and I honestly have no idea what to do.

I'm sorry for the long post, and I would understand if you cannot be bothered reading it all, I just had to tell someone.

**edit** I didn't expect so many helpful replies. Thanks a lot Reddit.

**edit 2** therapist appointment keeps getting pushed back. I have to do some college group project all alone as well, as the person I worked with, dropped out. Ah well, a few weeks left I suppose.
