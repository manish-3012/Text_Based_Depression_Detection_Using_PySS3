If i had one wish i would turn back time.To start my whole life I have been told by society that a man shouldn't talk about his feelings because it will make him seem weak and until now I've bottled it up because it's been hard to talk about.
I do not want to go into to much detail but the reason I would turn back time is because I loved being a care free smart child who had tons of good friends and had an amazing life until I was around 10. This is the period of time where my life began to go down hill because I was involved in a serious accident in which I was hit by a car and almost died. I like to say this was like a needle injecting me with a virus that would slowly eat away at my life. My grades dropped in school and although my friends stuck by me all through high school I drove them away because I thought it was a good decision for some reason. 
My pride dose not allow me to talk to anyone either because I don't want to hurt them or I don't want to know the truth about them caring or not. This virus has now spread through me and in the past I would try to fight it but it seems like I have no fight left in me.
On top of this I can tell my dad is disappointed in me because I have not lived up to my potential if only he knew why but as I said nothing can make me tell him.

This might not make much sense when it is read but this is the only way my brain will allow me to get it off my chest.

I am not sure if a can delete this later on but if someone could tell me how it would be much appreciated thanks.
