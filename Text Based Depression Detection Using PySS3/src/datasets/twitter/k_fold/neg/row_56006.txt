Nearing the end.Recently realised I really and truly have no one. When I say no one I mean no one to talk to. I have a boyfriend but heâ€™s not in the greatest of places mentally and he tries to stay strong for me so I fear that by telling him the thoughts I have will set him off. He knows what happens in my head (or atleast the basics of it) but I think saying it out loud will ruin him. I am stuck and and nearing the end.
