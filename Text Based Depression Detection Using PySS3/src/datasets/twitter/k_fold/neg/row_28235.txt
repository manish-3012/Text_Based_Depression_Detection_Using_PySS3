If you were abused at a 'troubled teen' program or youth residential treatment facility, know that you are not aloneThese facilities are often called therapeutic boarding schools, wilderness camps, teen boot camps, residential treatment centers and behavior modification centers.

Some of their programs are so intense and torturous they leave kids with a lifetime of issues, such as: PTSD, suicidal thoughts, self-harm, nightmares, panic attacks, flashbacks, social anxiety, night terrors and depression.

Were you not believed when you tried to tell your parents about the abuse? **We believe you.** Were you forced to abuse other kids to gain levels? **It was not your fault.** You didn't deserve to go through that, the program was systematically designed to "break" you.
