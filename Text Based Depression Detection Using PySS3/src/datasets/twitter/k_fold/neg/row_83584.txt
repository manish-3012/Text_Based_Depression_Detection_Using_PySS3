No goals for my lifeTrying to find goals from my life but...i realize that i haven't got any, it is not worth to try and it is not worth to find some new as well because of all this obstacles i meet up. I study nursing and i need one subject to finish but...i don't want to do this job in the future, it doesn't fits me. I used to do drawings but...i can't be happy with this! It has no future, i can't do lessons and i can't afford a tablet so as to do digital art that i want. I used to do martial arts but...i haven't got the same interest for this now. I thing i get lost, i feel unworthy, i feel like a trash live a life without goals. Sometimes i wonder why i am alive...
