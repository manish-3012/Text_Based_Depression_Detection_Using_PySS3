People around me hate me.Iâ€™m annoying. My jokes are awful. Iâ€™m loud. Iâ€™m brash. I go overboard. If I killed myself over the weekend then maybe for once the people around me would have some peace and quiet instead of me yelling and trying to tell jokes. I just want to kill myself. It wouldnâ€™t be that bad for everyone, because theyâ€™d get over it quickly and their lives would be better. Iâ€™m an easy loss to forget.
