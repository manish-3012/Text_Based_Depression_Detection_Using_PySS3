SurvivorA few weeks ago I ingested a poison alongside slitting my wrists. 

 I ended up in hospital (intensive care) unit for a good while. 
They say that I am lucky to be alive, and that I barely escaped death.

But to me, itâ€™s torture.
I wanted to die.
I still do.

Some people say that once they have a near death experience, they realise that they want to live. 
Well, not me.
Iâ€™m still the same.
Still in my sunken place, and Iâ€™ll never leave. Nor do I ever want to.

I deserve to die.
I know that and I wish others would accept that. 
I am nothing more than a burden. 

Iâ€™ve been dealing with so much pain and have tried everything over the years to get better.
But nothing works.
Nothing ever will.

No institution.
No medication.
No hobby or interest.
No friend, pet or family member.
No fresh start or job.
Nothing helps and no one cares.

Iâ€™ve lost all hope. 
I just no longer care about anything. Only death.

When people talk to me about how much my attempt affected them, I feel numb, I feel nothing. 
I know I should feel sorry or bad, or maybe that I shouldnâ€™t have even done it.
But no.
I feel nothing.

My mind is too set on death.
Itâ€™s like Iâ€™ve got this 4 steel walls around me that deflect everything other than darkness. 

Since my attempt Iâ€™ve been once again planning my death. 
I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting here.
I guess to vent. 

I just know that Iâ€™m once again running out of time.

I appreciate you taking the time to read my story.
