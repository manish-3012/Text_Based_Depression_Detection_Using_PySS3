Someone posted in another subreddit about committing suicide. Here is a link to it.https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/3p0q4r/i_want_to_commit_suicide_to_be_with_god/

This person really seems like they need help.  Maybe some of the people here can offer help.  I'm not sure if I should be linking, but I don't see it to be a problem considering what this subreddit is.
