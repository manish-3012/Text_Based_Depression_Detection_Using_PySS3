HelpHey guys I need you input on this. A few months ago I was living with my friend because I was going through a very hard time, parents kicked me out once I told them my feelings about my sexuality &amp; I was homeless so she took me in but she was doing it out of â€œthe kindness of her heartâ€ &amp; after a few months go by she kicks me out because she tried to bully me out of something that belongs to me. 

I come home to all my clothes &amp; shit outside. (Fast forward) we stop being friends but she doesnâ€™t apologize so I let it go, then she tells me that I still owe her money but I really donâ€™t know what for. Today she was supposed to put me on her phone plan but bullshitted &amp; now sheâ€™s telling me I owe her a MOTHERS DAY GIFT!!! Do you guys think I should just cut ties? She acting like I owe her something when I really donâ€™t.

But let me also tell you guys that when we lived together we literally worked together at every job, her mom was addicted to drugs &amp; spent all the money I gave her for rent at the casino or on drugs. But she always told me I never paid rent which was true because I stopped but you guys understand why right? Or am I just wrong for not giving my money to a tweak? We got fired from a job but she got another &amp; I couldnâ€™t work at that cause of school so she goes off calling me a bum &amp; shit. What do you guys think I should do? Like honestly
