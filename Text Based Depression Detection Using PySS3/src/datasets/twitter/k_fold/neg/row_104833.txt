Getting help feels like a waste of timeI bought a rope on Amazon earlier this week and it just came today. Iâ€™m not that smart, so  having trouble figuring out how to tie the right kind of knot. I knew that I wouldnâ€™t do anything with the rope right away because I need to practice first... and Iâ€™m really caught between feeling like Iâ€™ve wanted to die for so long, and this is the first time that Iâ€™ve come close to reaching a goal that Iâ€™ve set for myself, and the part of me that wants to know what people that want to live feel like. 

Iâ€™ve been depressed since childhood, and donâ€™t recall wanting to live. Whenever I get a new therapist, I tell them that I want to die, I know how I want to do it, and I think about it every day. None of my therapists have made a safety plan with me, maybe because I try to assure them that I donâ€™t have attempts because Iâ€™m a perfectionist and I know that there are high chances I donâ€™t get things right. Iâ€™ve never felt like anyone would really care if I died. I really donâ€™t get the sense that my current therapist cares. I hate doing everything Iâ€™m supposed to and still being so unhappy. 

Iâ€™ll probably delete this post as Iâ€™m embarrassed at even thinking itâ€™s worthwhile to share my purchases.... I just donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m scared because I know that should be, but I also just want to go in peace.
