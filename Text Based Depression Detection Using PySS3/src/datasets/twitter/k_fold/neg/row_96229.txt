I feel like I have it in me to commit suicide and it really scares me.I should preface by stating that I'm not suicidal. I'm not even really depressed. But I think I have some rudimentary signs of social anxiety and confidence issues. Recently, I've been having a rough time at work and I feel like they are thinking of demoting me. I've got school loans to pay off, my friends don't talk to me much anymore since graduation, and I feel like I'm stuck in a rut. 

Well anyway, the thing is -- and this has happened before -- when life gets a bit hard like it is right now, for what seems like a millisecond, in the back of my mind, I get this tiny feeling of considering killing myself because it's too hard. It usually happens when my problems are fresh and my mind begins to focus on all the negativity, at all the unrelated ways my life sucks. I have to try hard not to let my mind torture me like that and I force myself to take a rational view and to offer myself perspective by thinking of the positives. 

But what bothers me is that I feel like if I'm not careful, I could very well impulsively kill myself if my life (inevitably) has a really low point which at first glance seems impossible to recover from. The consideration pops into my head uncontrollably and I have to push it out. I don't want to ever hurt myself so I am concerned that my brain even thinks of it as an option. Should I be worried or is this a common behavior?
