I've reached a breaking point and I'm sure I'll eventually kill myselfContext: Im a 14 year old trans girl who hates life. 

Being trans in an extremely conservative and transphobic country fucking sucks. I will have to endure male puberty and then be affected by the low chances of passing after puberty. I'm even scared I might not even be able to afford surgeries or hrt. Everything is so expensive and being trans is so costly. I might be stuck like a guy for the rest of my life. I feel depressed as I feel being trans will take parts from my life I will never get back. Like a normal female teenage years, I'll never have those. I will never get them back. I can't cut anymore as I might end up just cutting open a vein if i lose control. I also feel like im a complete and utter failure and don't even deserve to live. Maybe I should just kill myself after I get home from school.
