I've never felt thos way before I'm usually the type of person where nothing can get me down and I have never posted on reddit before so if this shouldn't be here feel free to take it down. Just didnt know where else to turn. For starters I have a wonderful girlfriend that is my world. She helped me get my life back on track after highschool. But then I made a mistake and I have no friends to talk to about this. Which made me realise that I am literally nothing without her. You see the mistake was i made this huge elaborate lie up to her because i didnt want to tell her the truth which would hurt her even more. I didnt cheat on her or anything crazy like that. But she found out and is almost certainly gonna break up with me over it. And I continuously disappoint my family, and like I previously said I have no friends. So really who would miss a useless fuck like me anyways right?
