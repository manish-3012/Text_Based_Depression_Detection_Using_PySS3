Mom doesnâ€™t careI once got in a pretty huge fight w my mom &amp; I accidentally said that nothing matters &amp; Iâ€™d rather die anyways which just made things worse. She wasnâ€™t concerned at all, instead she kind of laughed it off, which made me threaten to actually kill myself. Still nothing. I have attempted before &amp; I still have suicidal urges but I donâ€™t think I would go through with it. It just kinda hurts that she didnâ€™t care and wasnâ€™t concerned enough to ask about it or pause the fight to learn more
