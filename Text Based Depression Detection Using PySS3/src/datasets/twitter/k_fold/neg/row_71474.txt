I feel like my suicidal thoughts are becoming something strong and concrete planIâ€™ve been thinking about how to die, when to die, and what sort of things I should do before I die (how getting rid of things in the house, and maybe when to tell my landlord that Iâ€™m leaving). And these days especially Iâ€™ve been looking up lists on things to do before I die, or look up pictures of people who have committed suicide. 
I was thinking maybe I can travel around the world, or give out free food/water to homeless people just before I die, but,, those plans arenâ€™t something i can do instantly because I barely have savings.
