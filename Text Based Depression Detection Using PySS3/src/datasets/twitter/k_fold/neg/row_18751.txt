New Dawn FadesOur relationship was never meant to be. I'm sure both of us knew that.

We tried - different colours, different shapes. But WE are different, so it was meaningless.

You saw me failing being a father to your daughter, you saw my depression, my flaws, my silence, you saw how directionless our relationship have become. I know it's hard to assume a suicidal guy.

We're floating. We do not have any structure. Our families are torn apart, hate is everywhere.

We're too young, too dumb - and hurt (life has already done it's job on us). After my suicide attempt you took me as an obligation. As a burden to take care. Don't know why, but it was a mistake.

You're never going to cure me, neither I'm going to cure you. We're no going anywhere togheter.

And I know it's painfull to live in my gradpa house. I don't know if you do this only because u don't have other option, cause you had to leave your home.

So we've become emotionally dependent of one another. Other pain. We've become abusive, but we closed our eyes.

You never know if I'm going to arrive home after work, being a suicidal burden. 

And the guilt of my suicide will be put on u. It's hard, I'm sorry.

I know soon it will all be over. Our structures are too fragile, something bad will happen soon. I can barely take the pain of living like that. You're fading and as you fade I fade too. I can't live with you but can't live without u. 

This whole situation is so morbid.

I know you'll find this. I wrote this just to show u I was aware, I knew what you were going trought.

But it was me. It's me. I'm nothing more than that. That's all I could offer.

I'm sorry.
