Why is suicide such a taboo topic and no one wants to talk about it?Everytime I hear someone say that they want to kill them selfs, others respond angry and start to be mad.
I can understand that they don't  want to lose that person, but why are they not trying help them. Instead of that they make them feel worse and want it even fucking more.
What the fuck is wrong with them?
