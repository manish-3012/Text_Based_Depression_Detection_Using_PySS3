I need advice.I'd really like to talk to someone about my depression. Therapy isn't an option. I'm just a poor college dropout living with her boyfriend. Suicide hotlines, although Ive considered them, aren't really a good idea either. Talking on the phone gives me anxiety attacks. I just need someone consistent to talk to, you know? 

My boyfriend of 3.5 years is currently sleeping - although he'd probably tell me the usual of the "If you're going to do it, move back home with your parents, so I don't have to deal with it." or "Stop acting like a 14 year old emo." Not that he doesn't love me or anything, I know he does. He just gets really frustrated when I try to talk about my depression with him, he feels he cant do anything about it.

I just need advice on how I can bring it up and talk about it with him. I really want to work through this depression with him, but when he says those things it just pushes me closer to the edge. Please help.

Hopefully this post is coherent. &gt;.&lt; Lack of sleep + 3 am = rambling. =(
