Im 15 and i already know how I will turn outIf you are going to make fun of me in this post I don't care. 

I have been useless all my life. I never really had friends and most people just chuckled at me then left, funny haha. I never had a talent, or any skill at all. I am not smart, I am so unathletic the people at my school used to make fun of me and ask the teacher if they can find someone else. Even the teacher sometimes would crack a joke about me. Every time I try something new I get made fun of and bullied until I leave. I tried to play soccer but then the kids started to make fun of me so I left. I wanted to play basketball too but now I know whats going to happen. I usually just shoot hoops by myself when nobody is around in my local park so nobody can laugh if they see me playing because I probably suck. Mostly nowadays I just sit at home playing csgo but im silver 3 and get kicked from all the games I play in that game and ive been playing for 500 hrs since last year. Just shows how worthless I am haha. I left my old school because of bullying and now im too scared to talk to anyone. Its too late in the year anyway there is 2 months left. They probably think I am a creep haha. I tried once but I think I offended someone since they told me to shut up the next time I tried to talk to them. Never trying that again haha. Well I don't think I can do anything useful in my life and will just be a worthless piece of garbage at the end of the day so I will just take my life now. My rant is over. Goodbye.
