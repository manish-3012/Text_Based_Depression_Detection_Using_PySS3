I canâ€™t take it anymore.I tried to kill myself yesterday. Wrote a suicide note and overdosed on a bunch of pills. I remember feeling really dizzy and smiling as I closed my eyes. 

But I woke up in the middle of the night. And I cried. I cried because I was still here. I cried because I couldnâ€™t do anything right. I cried because everything just kept on betraying me. 

Right now, Iâ€™m still dealing with the aftermaths of the overdose. I feel dizzy every time I sit up, so Iâ€™m laying down in my bed. I feel sick every time I try to eat, so I just drink water. The only times Iâ€™ve gotten up was to go to the bathroom. 

I canâ€™t deal with this life anymore. It is unfair and cruel and I canâ€™t take one more second of it.
