I feel like its coming to an end soonI just felt like sharing my feelings bc i have nobody else to do so. I feel like i'm at the end of my line i don't even have enough energy anymore to write a goodbye letter. Drugs are the reason that i had the energy to atleast get this far i've been a huge disappointment to my family and friends to the point where even they don't care anymore i just want to rest i don't want to wake up anymore. I just don't know if i should OD or take a bullet i'm just so tired.
