Started thinking about how easy it would br to just take all of my meds at once and slip away.I feel so fucking trapped here. I cant drive due to seizure and that makes me feel even worse. I feel like such a burden on everyone. Ive been trying to stop smoking weed but inevitably have relapsed, i suppose its a psychological addiction. I realized i have enough meds to actually kill me and started almost laughing about it in a way. Debating calling my therapist but i dont want to burden people (even tho she said she's available pretty much 24/7). I cant help but feel like a god damn failure and burden.
