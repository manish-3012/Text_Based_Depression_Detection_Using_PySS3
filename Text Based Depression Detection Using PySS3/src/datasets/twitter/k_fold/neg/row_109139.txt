It is never getting better(I would first like to apologize for my english as it's not my first language and I just hope that this is something that belongs in this subreddit)

I live a great life and I think about committing suicide every day. 

My childhood was great, filled with travel and encouragement towards whatever activity I was into for the moment. I have supportive parents who love one another and who loves my sister and I dearly and would do anything for us. I did exceptionally well in school and received high grades throughout all mandatory education. I got the first job I applied for after school and could pick whatever university degree due to my high grades. Wrapped up my degree at 25 and somehow due to dumb luck landed a job that I am nowhere qualified enough for and itâ€™s going great. I have been in supportive and healthy relationships since I was 17 and my current partner loves me so very much.  

And still I think about dying every single day. So I just canâ€™t help but to think that it wonâ€™t actually get better. This is just how it is. And I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. All my life I have thought to myself â€œoh when I have accomplished â€œthis or thatâ€ I will finally be happyâ€. And so I finish task after task thinking it will bring me happiness but it just never does.
