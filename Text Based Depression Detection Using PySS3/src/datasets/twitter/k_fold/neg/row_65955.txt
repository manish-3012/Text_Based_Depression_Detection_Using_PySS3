...How long does it take for cutting your wrist to work? I mean how long would it take for you to completely pass away by doing that? I donâ€™t like the idea of hanging.

I hope you wonâ€™t tell me to talk to someone I am close with about this because if I knew someone who could actually help, I ainâ€™t doing this sh*t and suffering from it until now.
