Should I stay here?I lost my son to suicide 15 months ago. I came here to help others. And, as I read the posts, Iâ€™m evaluating whether I should be here. 

It seems like 99.9% of the posts are looking for permission to die by suicide. Iâ€™m not going to give that. 

Stay or not? Iâ€™m on the fence...
