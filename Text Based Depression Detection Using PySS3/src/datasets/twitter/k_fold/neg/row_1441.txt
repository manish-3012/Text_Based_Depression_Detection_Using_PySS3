Scar tissueIâ€™m suicidal. I had things happen to me as a child that unknowingly shaped the way I transitioned into manhood. When I realized I had problems and was tired of being a person impaired by their own toxic mindset, Iâ€™d tell myself Iâ€™d change but couldnâ€™t do it. Mental block. They werenâ€™t just words to me, but words to a woman I loved dearly. After I lost her â€“ the kindest, most loving woman I have ever had in my life â€“ I figured that if I couldnâ€™t fix myself for the greatest thing to every happen to me, then I was never going to change. The only solution was to kill myself. And not just to end my own depression, but as punishment for the pain I was causing myself.

I was getting better. I found some help here and decided that the precursors to who I am are not my fault, and who I became was uncontrollable. But who I can become in the future is my choice. I detached my mind from my emotions and inspected myself, found things I simply wasnâ€™t going to do anymore. Not only was I going to do it for myself, I was going to do it for the woman I love. My actions would speak louder than words and she could return to the man she fell in love with but without the toxicity of secrets and demons.

They say you shouldnâ€™t dwell on the past, but I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s always true. I wanted to use the scar tissue of new and old wounds to remind myself of a path Iâ€™d never go down again.

Tonight, I met her for the second time after I told her I was bettering myself â€“ the revelation that led to her to start communicating with me again. We went out, had a few drinks. She probed me and I let loose. I answered her questions, told her about the things that happened to me as a kid. Then when she pushed me on what I was doing and how deep my problems go, I told her about suicide. How seeds have been planted in my head and while I donâ€™t want to do it now, I know I will later. I know how things begin, but Iâ€™ve stopped that now. And Iâ€™m a million times better already, even if my journey has only started.

She clammed up. The revelation made her freeze. She didnâ€™t say anything else. I got emotional. I sat down and reassured her that I was OK â€“ Iâ€™m getting help. Iâ€™m getting better. She still said nothing. I poured my heart out, revealed my dreams and aspirations of showing her my change, that I loved her and understood why she left me. 

The love of my life asked me to explain how I understood herâ€¦ how Iâ€™d understand putting everything in and getting nothing back would make me feel the other person doesnâ€™t love me. 

Right after that, she said she had to go and off she went into the sunset. No response, no nothing. Here I am, back to square one. Itâ€™s like no matter what I do, no matter what positive path I try to take, no matter how fucking hard I battle with myself and try my hardest to kill the monsters inside me, somehow, regardless of how far I go, I end up where I fucking started.
