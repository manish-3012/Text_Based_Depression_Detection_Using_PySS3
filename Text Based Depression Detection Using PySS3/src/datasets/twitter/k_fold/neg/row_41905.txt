Everything Just Gets WorseIt seems that the more I understand and the more progress I make, the more utterly fucked I feel.

I can't seem to find a reason to go on. I have nothing to look forward to.

I'm just sick of it all.  I've been trying to keep myself going while feeling like this for a while, but its just not worth it anymore. The longer I wait the worse I feel.

I'm not very useful when I'm so preoccupied with my problems, and not very happy either. I don't have any friends and my family hates me; better just kill myself. I've wanted to kill myself for a few years now, and every quarter I tell myself it will be better than the last and that I just need to hold on a little longer.

Please tell me to kill myself. Please tell me there is nothing left for me.

Everyone would be better off without me.
