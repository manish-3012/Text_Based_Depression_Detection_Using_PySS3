Just a BurdenI've been battling Manic Depression ever since I was in kindergarten. My father didn't help, all he did was just make me worse by adding PTSD onto that list. I feel like I'm a burden. I have a will to live, it's just that I feel like people don't take me seriously. Everyone either says I'm a clown or I'm joking or I'm fake. They say all of this when I get upset because my mood is NEVER stabilized. No, I am not on any mood stabilizers, I'm on 60mg Prozac, 5mg Tenex, 25mg Prazasin, and 10mg Trazedone. I feel as if my meds do not help me. I tried talking to my doctor about it, but she said that all she can do is up my Prozac. I don't know how to manage my Manic Depression and I don't think I'll ever learn.
