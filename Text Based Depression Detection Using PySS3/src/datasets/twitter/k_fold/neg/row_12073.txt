How do I carry on?I've been with this woman for 6 years... We've been married for 2...more than likely not much longer. The last 6 years I went from independent to very dependent on her because she insisted on taking care of me. She wanted to be a good wife... She was the perfect wife. 

Now she's gone... My addiction pushed her away for the last time. Now I'm lost without her. I'm alone in this state, my family lives elsewhere. I'm running out of money, I can't work, I can't sleep, I just can't function. I'm trying to be a better man and be strong. But I'm failing. It's been a month and I'm at the point where there's no hope anymore. I just want to die. She doesn't love me anymore....she says she doesn't care about me...so why should I care about me anymore?
