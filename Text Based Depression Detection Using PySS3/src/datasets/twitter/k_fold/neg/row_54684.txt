I feel like I dont belongI'm 24 years old. I have no will power for anything, I can't keep a job, I don't feel real happiness in anything, nothing amuses me, I am in a relationship I don't want to be in that I can't leave because she goes bat shit crazy and makes me feel like shit. My mindset at the moment is why try if we're all going to die anyways, like everything we achieve won't matter after we're gone. I have 2 kids but honestly they don't matter to me, I'm just being a father because that's what they expect of me. At the moment where I'm at I currently don't want to live, I can't run away, I can't take this useless cycle anymore. The only thing I look forward to everyday is going to sleep, I wonder that if I end it all that my afterlife will be me in a constant slumber.
