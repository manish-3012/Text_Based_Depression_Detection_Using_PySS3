Iâ€™m so close to ending it all and nobody caresTW: r*pe, s*xual assualt/abuse,s*lf harm.

I just need to get this out

Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was about 6-7 years old. Iâ€™ve had years of trauma and suffering from family and peers.
Half of my family wonâ€™t talk to me because of r*pe and s*xual abuse/ assualt from my cousin when I was 6-10 years old. Everyone turned on me when my r*pist said I r*ped her. My friendships are falling apart.
Iâ€™ve been venting to my friends and my s/o but they seem to not care at all. Iâ€™ve been s*lf harming for weeks and no one cares.
My s/o already seems interested in one of my friends and Iâ€™m just so stuck and overwhelmed. Nobody cares about me and no one ever will. I donâ€™t want to suffer anymore. why doesnâ€™t anyone care about me. I just need someone there for me and Iâ€™ll never have that.
