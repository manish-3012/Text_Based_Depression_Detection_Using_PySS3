Please help, completely at a loss.I have been depressed for a long time, almost all of my life. I am at the lowest I've ever been. I reached out to a friend who said they were there for me and he ended up completely shitting all over me. I'm completely distraught and starting to take drastic measures (I just shaved my head for instance, idk why) I just spent some time with the prevention hotline but it didn't help too much other than getting the knife out of my hand, it was too dull to draw blood anyway. Please anyone out there? PM to talk please? something? I need some help and I'm at a complete loss.
