Friend has recently opened up to me about suicidal thoughtsI have just come back from a weekend away in Ireland with two of my close friends. On the final night we had a bit of a heavy session and did not leave the pub until the early hours of the morning. We were drinking with 3 or 4 local lads and towards the end of the night my friend said that his cousin (from near the area we were staying) had recently committed suicide. We were all very drunk but it opened up a conversation between us all on our own battles with mental health. 

Walking home I told my mate in more depth about how I had struggled in the past but was able to go to a counselor, which really helped. I knew my friend had also had troubles in the past, but he basically said that he has never really understood why he was alive and was waiting for his parents to did so he could kill himself knowing that they would never know. 

He said that he questions life and it's meaning virtually every waking hour and it really worries me that he seems to have rationalised a plan for suicide already. I had no idea that he was suffering that bad. I said that he should go to a counselor (as I did) but he did not think there was any point.

My memory of the incident is pretty hazy, we were very drunk, and anytime it has ever come up in conversation between us we have been drunk. Which is bad I know.

From what I recall, even when I asked him to think about the pain he would cause the people around him if he killed himself, he said that it made him feel even more guilty because he was already aware of the pain he would cause and was still willing to do it.

I will speak to him sober about this and advise councelling again. I also know his brother very well so think it would be a good idea to make him aware of this. 

Does anyone have any other advise? Has anyone else faced a situation like this with a close friend? 

Thanks
