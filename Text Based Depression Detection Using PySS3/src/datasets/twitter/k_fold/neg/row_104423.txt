Please, help...I don't even really know how to talk about this, I was never given an outlet for this when I struggled with it before. 

The past few months have been really hard, I don't want to explain it all. I'm getting ever closer to complete adulthood. Every dream I have pursued out of high school  have caved in. I've either been too scared or busy to accomplish them. I realize that it is in fact my fault, because I've given up on them myself. The crushing feeling of responsibility towards myself has crept into my mind and heart and is busy at work tearing both apart. I have a gorgeous and miraculous angel that I call the love of my life, she's honestly a blessing. But she's the only reason I'm hanging on right now. I have a great job, and get paid close to double minimum wage. But it's not what I wanted to do, I'm doing it for my family and her. I've had multiple bad dreams the past few days and they have all been about suicide. In the past I attempted suicide twice, one of those times I just barely scraped by. I'm starting to feel the same way I did in the weeks leading up to those attempts. I like to believe I'd never do it again, but I guess I never really know for sure. I know my family would be devastated and my angel would have to say goodbye forever... It hurts to think about. I just want the thoughts to go away, I want to stop having the dreams, I guess I'm losing faith in myself. I just need reassurance right now, and not from people who have an obligation, like family. I'm going to look for help.
