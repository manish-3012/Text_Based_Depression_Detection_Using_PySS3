Feeling really close to the end.The biggest thing that's stopping me is knowing how depressed my dog would be with losing me. Other than that I could care less about anything. 2 years ago I had everything I wanted. I moved because of a Hurricane. I had a job I really liked and lost it.  My roommate who was helping me get back on my feet passed right before Christmas. I don't have a car. I don't have a job. And I'm in a town where I don't have any friends or anyone. My mom doesn't want me back home because she likes to choose her boyfriends over me.  I have 1.37 in my account. I've already sold most things. All my bills are behind and I have no other options right now. I'm borderline homeless again. Except this time I don't even have a vehicle to sleep in. I have meds I have rope and other things. It wouldn't be hard for me to do. I'm very ready to end it. Maybe some people here can encourage me not to.
