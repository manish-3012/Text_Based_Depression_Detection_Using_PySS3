before suicide, read this
OK, let's face it. You just want to kill yourself, right? Then, why don't you haven't done it yet? If you truly wanted to you would be dead right now, but something stopped you and its been keeping you alive since then, which is what matters now. Y-o-u a-r-e a-l-i-v-e, because you are reading this right now, and because your time on earth hasn't finished yet. What is it the thing that keeps you away from not committing suicide right now? You can only know.

To commit a rational suicide, your number of reasons for doing it must be way higher of ones that keeps alive, so, are they? It's important because humans tend to focus more on what they don't like rather what they like. Your brain works this way, but you could change it. 

I bet your life is not as bad as you think it is now that you think on suicide, but the perspective you are on is what makes you feel this way. 

To see it shortly, the perspective is everything. If you think about suicide, most probably there's a perspective behind focusing on the negative aspects of your life. When was the last day you focused on the positive aspects? 

I am 99% sure you are not the only one facing the same issues as other people around the world, still thousands of them have choose life. Why didn't they all kill themselves? Due to perspective. Some had the right perspective, while others simply choose to leave. It's all of perspective. 

You honestly need to understand this, because thousands of people kill themselves because of something simple. I bet hundreds of them would have not killed themselves if they had let more time to pass. 

If suicide is your option, do it rationally. Remember: Time in life is really short, it won't repeat again so make really sure to do it with a real purpos. Thanks
