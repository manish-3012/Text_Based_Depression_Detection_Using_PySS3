Birthdaytoday I turned 17 but yet I'm not happy i feel disgusting thinkin years of full constant rape the constant abuse how can i be happy my whole teenage years was just me being pimp by my mom and just getting used by guys. I feel so disgusting horrible a disgrace even. It's hard to look at myself I'm not happy I made it past 17 years of failed attempt I don't know how to feel it's hard to think there's hope for me. Every time I think something good happens something always got to ruin it. Is it just selfish that for once that I can just feel safe everyday. It's crazy to think how when I turned 13 and I had to celebrate it with my r*pist I thought to myself will things ever be different can I find my happiness. Years of spending my birthdays with him I hate it I hate it I hate it. I doubt my birthday will be any different but yet deep down I just wanted something to happen I'm so selfish I hate everything that happened to me I I genuinely just wished I ceased to exist I'm so pitiful and such a crybaby.
