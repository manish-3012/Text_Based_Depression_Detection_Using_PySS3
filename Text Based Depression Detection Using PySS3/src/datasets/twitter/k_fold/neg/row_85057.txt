I feel like Iâ€™ve been mentally asleep for the past week, and Iâ€™ve had intrusive thoughts surrounding self harm and suicide.Iâ€™ve dealt with suicidal for a couple of years now, but this is the oddest mental state itâ€™s gotten me in. Thankfully I donâ€™t have to deal with school for the next week (Iâ€™m a junior in high school) so I can recharge and be with people. 

I havenâ€™t really been suicidal in six months, and itâ€™s just come back in the past couple weeks. I took a shower the other day, and I couldnâ€™t shave because I didnâ€™t trust myself with a razor. I havenâ€™t been processing anything which has made school especially tough, and Iâ€™ve had a really hard time not constantly zoned out. Iâ€™ve never had to deal with any of those specific things before, and Iâ€™m really not sure how to handle it. My go to solution is to hang out with my friends and possibly talk to them about it, so Iâ€™m hoping that at least helps, but if someone actually has experience with this sort of situation or can really say anything at all on it, that would be super helpful. I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m in a bad mental space, because my mind hasnâ€™t been awake all week.
