Screwed up another job interview after a year of unemploymentI canâ€™t take it anymore. I still donâ€™t have a job. I had an interview on Wednesday, but I fucked up when I got tripped up by questions I didnâ€™t prepare for. They want to hire soon and said theyâ€™d be in touch Friday and I heard nothing, so I know I didnâ€™t get it. 

Iâ€™m tired of being rejected and fucking things up. I canâ€™t survive anymore. I donâ€™t have the money. 

I canâ€™t see this situation getting any better. I was going to kill myself on the 11th if I hadnâ€™t gotten hired by someone. I regret that I didnâ€™t. 

Iâ€™ll give it until Tuesday.
