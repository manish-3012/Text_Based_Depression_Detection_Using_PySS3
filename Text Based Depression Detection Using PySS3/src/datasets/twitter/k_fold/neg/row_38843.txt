I'm worthless and i will kill myself depending on my gradesSorry if this is long.

Everyone here just looks at me like a number. My value are my grades. This year has been one of the worst. I've been battling with depression, I tried to kill myself once. But my family still expect that I pass everything with good grades. I have no friends, the only person I have is my boyfriend who lives almost 2000kms away and I haven't seen never irl. He's going to come this summer for a week, but the thing is if I still alive. I can't anymore. I checked my latest grades and I failed biology. Biology is my best subject, this the first time I fail it. I can't even believe it. I had an anxiety attack, so bad I puked. My mom only told me to shut up and go to study to my room.

No one values my feelings. No one takes into account that I'm s human being, that I'm 16 and I'm a fucking child in the end. I've always been a good grades girl, and now I'm failing everything. I'm afraid nobody is never going to love me but my boyfriend, but I also need to see him, to hug him. I miss hugs. I miss kisses. I miss friends. I miss comprehension. I feel like I'm better of dead. I tried to die once and I'm not afraid anymore
