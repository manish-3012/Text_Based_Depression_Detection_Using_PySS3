I am considering a being aloneWith my fiance we had scandal and we had to marry in a week or so but we delayed. He ended up saying not nice things and blcoked me. Later he unblocked me after he calmed down. He still talks to me after he got mad but his last message is from 5 a.m saying this: I am disappointed in you hence using the orwelian way for me

and he hasn't texted more. We fought over fiancial matter. Yeah we were LDR but we really clicked.


So I guess he most likely ghosted me. Since I have abusive household and my mother actively sabotaged my relationships I figured it's the best way to let the poor guy alone. No reason he should deal with my mother that's not right in the head. Thoughts?
