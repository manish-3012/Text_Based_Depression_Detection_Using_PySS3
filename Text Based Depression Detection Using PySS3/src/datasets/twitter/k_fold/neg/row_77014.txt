I hope I die before I turn 21Life fucking sucks. Everybody says "it gets better" but no, it doesn't. 
My past 8 years have been total shit. No one has ever loved me. Fucking no one. I haven't been hugged or even touched by someone else except to greet me. Every night I cry and hope I don't wake up. The next morning I cry because I woke up. I don't have any emotions I just feel empty. Just this static image in my head. Before I turn 21 I'm gonna kill myself and make it look like an accident so my family doesn't worries too much. 
Thanks for listening to this ugly worthless cunt.
Bye.
