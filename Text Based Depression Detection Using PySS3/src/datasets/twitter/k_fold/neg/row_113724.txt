I'm at my limitI feel trapped. I've got no control over anything that's going on around me. A month ago I had a breakdown that resulted in me misusing medication. That's when I realized I don't want to die, I simply want to live a different life. Since then I've been afraid I can't control my actions and I will end up doing stuff I don't want to do. The things I most feared happened in the span of a few months. I'm stressed and exhausted, and all I want is to stop thinking and just sleep. No one except for one person knows what's going on with my life right now. I am supposed to solve everything on my own, I'm supposed to be an adult and just take it all in and grow. But I've been keeping things to myself for years that I feel I'm close to my breaking point. I want my friends to believe everything is alright, I don't want to look like a weak person begging for attention. I don't want to share what's troubling me and get a 'that's life' reply. I feel like I live in a lie, putting on a happy face and that frustrates me so much because I'm unable to change anything.
