I'm still alive for a friendI have a friend who I recently met. She has had so many terrible things happen in her life. She has been raped, beaten by her family, psychologically tortured by her ex-boyfriend, has had most of her friends kill themselves, and has hallucination problems. 

Compared to me she has gone through hell. The only reason I'm still alive is I want to be there for her. Not romantically everything but as a close friend. It feels so selfish to want to kill myself when I have a perfectly good life.
