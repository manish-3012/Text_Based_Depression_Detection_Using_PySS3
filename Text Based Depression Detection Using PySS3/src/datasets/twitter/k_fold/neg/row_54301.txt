The thoughts in my head are begging me to leaveI don't remember a single moment where I didn't remember what an utter and complete failure I am.

Life is a prison, death is escape. Life is a boiling pot of water, I am a lobster trying to get out of the pot. The rest of the lobsters with thick shells hold me down because they don't know any better, they can resist life's pain. I am too disgusting and weak to resist.

A quick death is better than the slow burn of knowing that you will never feel happiness and pleasure in any capacity. I don't remember if I've ever felt either. It's all suffering, it's all pain, and I will do anything to make it stop because it hurts so fucking much. I'm crying as I write this because I know that it's either dying by my own hand soon or suffering like this for all eternity.

I have been dealt the worst hand in life. I hate everything and everyone, I hate God for creating such a mistake like me. I don't deserve to exist. I deserve to be tortured and mutilated.
