FOR MY FRIEND (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE)Buddy,

Thank you for all the support you gave me.  I really did appreciate it. You felt like a brother to me! Now know that I'm gonna be in a better place. (non existent) I saved the Nyquil bottle from last night for you to remember me.  It's in the cabinet lower left.  I signed it for you!  Goodbye my good friend!  I will miss you.  Please do me one thing.  Don't kill yourself!

Love,

Matthew
