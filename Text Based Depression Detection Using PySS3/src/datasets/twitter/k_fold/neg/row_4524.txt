Suicidal but not? Word vomit.Idk if I'm "suicidal" but I have a lot of suicidal thoughts rn. I keep thinking about relapsing. It's been like this for a few days. I've been dealing with some derealization, too.

I feel like I'm driving everyone away by accident. I think it's because I might be clingy, idk if I'm actually clingy or not. I don't know how to start conversations with people either. I'm likeable but not at the same time. One of my close friends got into a fight with her boyfriend because of me, we talked it out, but I still feel like there's something else going on. I started talking to another friend I had in middle school, but I'm afraid I'm driving her away too.

This boy in my class has a crush on me, he talked to me for a bit in October and I made it obvious I wasn't interested. He kind of sexualized me, but I miss the attention. It made me feel gross and anxious but at least somebody cared/wanted me.

I've tried to distract myself by reaching out to friends (they were all busy, I didn't want to tell them what was going on), playing video games, playing with my dog, and art. I don't want to mention this to my parents because it's always a hard conversation to have.

This has been happening at least once every 2 weeks. Not bad enough to go inpatient, and I don't want to go IOP because they're all online. The one that isn't I went to in March and I hated the staff and the NP didn't recognize my very obvious mania. They did some things right, though, I'll give them that. I don't want to go inpatient either because my parents have paid a lot of money for the sport I play and if I'm hospitalized, they'll be wasting money.

Typing this out has made me feel a lot better. I think I'm gonna take a shower and try to calm down more.
