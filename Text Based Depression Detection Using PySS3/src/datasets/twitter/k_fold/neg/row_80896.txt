Again, and again, and again, and again...I'm feelin' suicidal again. I barely started work and the stress makes me look like a raving madman... good thing I live alone.  
I don't have time to find another job. I'm not qualitifed for anything else.  
I don't have time to "seek help", and the last few times I did made me wish I'd burn the building with every asshole in it.  
I don't have time to stay healthy, cook for myself. I have a bunch of veggies in my fridge that is rotting because I have no time to prep them. And eating them raw all the time makes me feel like some cavemen.  


And I want to bash the next asshole that will tell me that "It'll get better" in the head with a rock.   


I'm so done... I'm manic from stress... I should have been working but all I can thing of is killing myself... I can't look at a fucking book without thinking "Hmm... if I ate the fucking thing I could poison myself with ink and it will all be over". I have a box cutter on my desk, taunting me. I really, really feel like I'm going completely mad, dangerously.  


There is no hope. Nothing is worth any of this. Not snkae like "loved ones" who care only about themselves. Not society. Not humanity. Not "self improvement", the most useless thing in existence...  


I feel like I could go screaming at any point....
