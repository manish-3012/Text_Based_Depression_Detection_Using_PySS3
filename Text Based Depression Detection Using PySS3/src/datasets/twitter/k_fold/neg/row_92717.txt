Please help for my parents sake... (big scary wall of text)Hey. I'm a guy, turning 20 next week, and I want to die. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 13, and they keep getting worse and worse. I've never been happy, and I dont think I ever will be. Here's my life in a nutshell:

&gt; I was born in western new york, just a few miles from the Canadian boarder. When I was 3, my sister was born, and when I was five, just about to start kindergarten, we moved cross-country to Denver Colorado, leaving all my friends and family behind. My parents divorced when I was 6, and I spent the next few years keeping secrets and lying on their behalf and listening to them badmouth each other. When I was 8, my mom got re-married to my least favorite person in the world, my stepdad. A year later they had my half sister. A year after that, we moved back to new york. (my dad too)

&gt; I didnt have many friends growing up. Kids picked on me and bullied me relentlessly. Most of middle and high school was just me trying to get through the day. I dont have any fond memories of my time at either school.

&gt; After high school, I spent a semester at culinary school. I hated it so very much. I didnt have any friends there either, and had zero skill. I couldnt take head chefs throwing my food around calling it garbage. I dropped out.

&gt; After that, I went back home and started attending a local community college, which is where I am now.


&gt; My mom knows how much I wanted the college experience, and how much I hate my stepdad. She's been paying for me to have an apartment right across the street. She pays for everything, so that I can focus on school. The thing is, I dont. I get crap grades. I hardly ever go to class because it all seems... pointless. Last semester, I totally gave up at the end because I honestly thought I'd be dead by Christmas break. After explaining to my mom, she said she understood because of the depression. She told me that when she was in college, she felt depressed too, and that she used to cut herself. She would keep paying for my apartment, but I had to do better next semester.

&gt; Which brings us to now. I started out this semester alright, doing well in all my classes. But then, I fell off the wagon. I'm still in the pit I was in last semester. I'm doing poorly in all my classes, and was administratively dropped from one of them.

Long story short, I think I'm shit. I've spent my entire life alone, and feel like a leech on everyone who does nothing but take. There's never been a time where I've truly been happy. I have no goals, no dreams, no ambition, no skills. Nothing. The only time I've ever been kissed was by some random drunk girl at a new years party. I just feel like... I dont know, I have nothing to look forward to. The world would be a better place without me, or at the very least, it wouldnt make a difference.

Honestly, the only thing stopping me is what my parents would think. I dont want to put my parents through it. They've both worked so hard and sacrificed so much for me and my sisters. But I have a feeling that any day now I'm going to hit a particularly low point and in that moment, I wont be worried about it. If it says anything, I decided that if I do do it, it's going to be by pill overdose, so they dont have to discover a mutilated body. Sorry this was so poorly written, I'm just spewing everything on my mind right now...
