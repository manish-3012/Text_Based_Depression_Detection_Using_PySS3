Gambler's fallacy?I don't think I want to live. I don't think I'm depressed exactly, nor am I walking around sad all of the time. I just have had enough.


I'm not enjoying life. There are minor things I can see the point of, but I would much rather not. I can't help but see reasons to continue to live as a gambler's fallacy. Nothing has gone as hoped for, I'm not content with life as it has been, so surely I'm 'exhausting' that 'bad luck', right? Surely things will change and I'll start to want to live soon, right? That seems to me like what most reasons NOT to commit suicide come down to. But take it out of the domain of 'life and death' and you see that that is gambler's fallacy. 


There's always the thoughts that life is what you make it, and so gambler's fallacy doesn't apply, but that doesn't change the root cause. I'm bored of this life. I once read that successful people are successful because they know when to quit. They know when to cut their losses. I think this is my time to quit.


By posting I'm not looking for anything other than to be able to put my thoughts out there without being 'worried about'. There are people who love me, and people I love. But I refuse to be the centre of anyone's universe, and it would be unfair to make them the centre of mine. But that takes away the possibility of anyone calling me out on my bullshit. So I guess I just want to be called out on it? Or maybe not. 


Shit, I dunno.
