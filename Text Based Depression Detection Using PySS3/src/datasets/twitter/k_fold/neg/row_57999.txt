I am hopeless. Only one optionMy existence is shit. It is hard work, without any reward or relief; no companionship or friendship; no sunshine, just shit; and it sucks any of the enjoyment that might otherwise be derived from life.

I go to the beach, to watch the sunset and feel the sand between my toes, and I feel no contentment or pleasure. I find it almost impossible still my mind, and forget my problems, to be in the present.

I have no friends, since moving back from abroad, and I have been unable to find meaningful work. My finances have been depleted, and I have sold my property and assets and I have nothing. Every day is stressful looking for work, knowing I am out of money.

I have had enough of struggling, I'm so sick and tired of struggle, every moment of every day. Not a thing has gone my way in so long. I have no optimism left.

Life here does not agree with me. I miss my life abroad, yet there is no possibility in the foreseeable future to escape this place. I went from having a successful career in China to being an unemployable bum, and I am not taking it well at all.

I am too prideful to go on employment benefits, I have never been unemployed in my life for an extended period. I have eaten enough shit and humble pie recently, and I'd rather starve.

I am trapped, and I can't see a way out.

I am out of money.

Tomorrow, I will spend my remaining money on some beer and rope. I am studying videos of tying a noose now.

What difference does it make? I'm just a poor, broken down, middle aged, joyless loser; with not a fucking thing going for him. I keep trying to tell myself that things will get better, but the words are hollow because I haven't believed it in a long time.

Hope is a commodity that I do not possess anymore. Without hope, the outcome is inevitable.
