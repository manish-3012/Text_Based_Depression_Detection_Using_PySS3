Dead aspieAllow me to say that having Asperger's &lt;b&gt;**FUCKING SUCKS.**&lt;/b&gt;

It's not worth the enhanced memory, intellect, or intuition that everyone keeps telling me I have. You become a fucking walking computer obssessed with details, facts, trivialities, and other meaningless bullshit. You don't have the mental faculties to understand social cues. You might come across as creepy or weird to everyone you meet without realizing, no matter how well-versed socially you are and how hard you try.

My manager told me that a few customers were uncomfortable with how I approached them at work because "I was too friendly." She was kind and understanding to me about it, but I still felt like shit. How friendly is too friendly? I never asked personal questions, cracked jokes or made remarks with them.

I wish I was legitimately retarded. As in, helmet-wearing, crayon-eating retarded. I wouldn't have to function in society and maybe I wouldn't feel like killing myself. People would feel sorry for me and move on, instead of fucking trying to talk to me like they always do, and mocking me when I try to communicate with them.

I'm defective. I was never meant for this world. I'm fucking sick of having to breathe, having to wake up, having to eat. Having to pray that no one tries to talk to me in public. I've tried antidepressants and they didn't work. 

As soon as I get my shotgun next month, I'm going to let go.  
I'd rather not live if it means having to fuck up on a constant basis.
