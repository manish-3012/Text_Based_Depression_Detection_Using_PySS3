This will be my final birthdayMy 31st birthday is coming up in 2 weeks and my family is going out of city the next day which presents an excellent opportunity to do it. They wanted me to come too, but I made-up a work related excuse to stay. Its been over a decade I have suffered from depression which I've kept hidden from everyone. Planned a way out years ago but didn't go through with it because of the pain it would cause to my loved ones, especially to my mom.
But the depression has gone so worse that I'll have to take this step. I don't even enjoy playing video games anymore which has been my most passionate hobby since childhood.
Bought all the equipment needed to go the most painless way. I now feel relieved that I'll finally be saved from this pointless miserable existence.

p.s. This is a throwaway account as my real account could be tied to me.
