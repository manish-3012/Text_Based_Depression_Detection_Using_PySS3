I genuinely hate myselfI have many reasons, but one is because of who I was in middle school. I'm a sophomore in high school right now, and some of the things I've done were just awful. I was pretty much a stereotypical middle school bully, but people thought I was hilarious for it. I ruined great friendships just to get others to laugh. While I'm not like that anymore whatsoever, I can't help but think that I'm still that person somewhere inside, and it terrifies me. I can't even step on an ant without regret now, but I used to be the opposite. Ever since I wasn't like that though, I've wanted to kill myself. Hell, I don't know.
