How do u tell my parents I want to kill myself when they are the problem?I been having intense life threatening thoughts lately, not as extreme in the past, but I'm to the dangerous point of not just saying, "I want to kill myself." But rather I'm at the point of thinking how I'm going to do it. I need help but I don't know how to attack the situation. Their pressure to be perfect is whats killing me and I couldn't imagine disappointing them more by telling them that they are the problem. The only thing keeping me alive is my girlfriend that I've been dating for 2 months, but I move out of state for school in 2 weeks. I'm scared to be alone.
