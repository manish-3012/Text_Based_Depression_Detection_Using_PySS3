The worst is feeling good for months and then suddenly getting overbearing suicidal thoughtsHaving an awful day today. It makes me feel so worthless when Iâ€™ve been doing good for so long and suddenly Iâ€™m depressed again. I hate this cycle so much and would rather die than continue to bear it any longer.
