I posted this elsewhere and was told it would be more appropriate here.In just over 11 hours, I'm going to take a massive overdose of insulin.

To make it clear, I intend to die.

I tried once before but got drunk beforehand and chickened out. I chose the date and time two weeks ago and have been working myself up for it. I'll be going in sober and clear headed.

I'm 36(M). I haven't had friends for years and am isolated from family. Not that we hate each other, we just hardly talk, and that's mostly due to me. I've messed up every chance at a decent relationship that's ever crossed my path. I've watched my peers go on to lead happy successful lives. All I do is go to work, come home, and have thoughts of sadness and profound regret circle through my head.

But this evening I'm feeling not happy, but at least relieved. I'm not sure what comes next, but I am sure I'm done with this.

I've also taken medication, talked to doctors, etc. Talked to Samaritans. This isn't a sudden decision taken without trying alternatives.
