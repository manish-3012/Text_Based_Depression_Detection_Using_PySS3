Gonna hold off until I go to universityBeen seriously depressed and had suicidal thoughts recently over this summer (not exactly a change from since the last few years).  But right this moment I've decided that as I am meant to be going to university in September, I'm gonna wait and see how my life turns out then.  If it is as shitty as it is now, then there's no hope in hell that I'm  not gonna end my life.   Anyone else in a similar situation where there life is about to drastically change and could potentially improve? Are you guys also holding off the suicide plan?
