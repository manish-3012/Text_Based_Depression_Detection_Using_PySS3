Anyone that cut wrists and went to erWill I be treated and sent home or will I have to go to psych unit?  If itâ€™s bad enough to need stitches will I just go to hospital then go home? Or will I have to go to psych ward, Iâ€™ve been before and it was the worst and most unhelpful thing ever! I just wanna get the care from Regular hospital then be on my way back to my home  is that at all possible???
