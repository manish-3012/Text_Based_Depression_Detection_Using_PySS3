I wish I could scream until all the air left my lungs and I disappearedI'm lying in bed alone coming down from a high that I shouldn't have done on a school night. I'm a garbage Person doesn't deserve anything. My freinds are like 3 metres away from me rn getting high and having fun and im alone in bed wishing I was dead. Why can't I just be happy with what I have why is it that I always want more more more. I'm never satisfied every time I achieve a goal or give up it has the exact same effect on me I just want to go on to the next thing to distract me from the torment my mind puts me through. I wish i could make a clone of myself and beat it to death. I'm the only person in the world I want to hurt but people still say I can't like a pychopath because I struggle to express emotion and I never think before I speak so my worst instincts always get exposed. And when I'm on my own I'm worse. I steal for no reason when I don't need stuff I just take it because I can and I can't explain why. I'm a terrible person and I hope I meet the reaper tonight because killing me would not only be a mercy for me but it would be a good thing for the rest of the world.

I'm a peice of shit who takes the opportunities of better people and I don't deserve a single one.
