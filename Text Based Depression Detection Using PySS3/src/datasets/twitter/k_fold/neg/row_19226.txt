Alone, without family.I don't know what to do anymore. Ever since I was a teenager, I've had this extremely debilitating depression. I never saw myself in the future. Every night for what seemed like years I'd have vivid dreams of suicide: sometimes frightening, sometimes "happy". But, like most, I never had the balls to actually commit to it. I was a good student, I did pretty well and graduated high school with honors and took AP courses (7 of them) and passed them all (not so well on the tests though) but I never saw myself living past the highschool stage. After graduation I felt better. I attended a small community college for a year but then My mother (single mom since I was 1) got scammed out of all of her money , she also got my family and her boss scammed as well (It was a good scam, was even backed by bank workers who "vouched" for the guys legitimacy) this basically forced my mom and I to be homeless for a few months. She's a type-1 diabetic and she's dying, she's been dying for years now but now it's bad. She's going to die soon and she's literally all the family I have left. The rest of my "family" disowned us when they found out that they lost their money. All the while here I am, faking my way through a college town, pretending to attend college so my mother doesn't feel bad that she ruined any chance of me going to college. But I've run out of money (and food) and my mom can't afford the treatments she needs to live. At this point in my life I've found that I've run out of options. I can't do anything about my mom, she's going to die and there's literally nothing I can do about it and once she's gone I have no ties to this world. I have no job experience, barely anything you can call an education, no money. Nothing. Hell, I BS my way through this town on what little I know. I just don't know what to do.
