Does anyone else feel like it's their destiny to commit suicide?Please hear me out, I want to know if anyone else feels this way. 

I am turning 27 in June, and I always believed that I would be a member of the 27 Club. I see no other alternatives, I can't imagine my life going anywhere else. If I look to the future all I see is the abrupt self-inflicted end to a timeline that only spans 27 years. 

I keep saying to myself that this is it. I know that this is how it's meant to be. I'm not a musician or an actor or an artist, I haven't made a name for myself. I have to kill myself at 27. There is nothing afterwards. It won't carry on, it only lasts 27 years. 

It's getting closer all the time and I can't imagine anyone will take me seriously, but I'm burning from the core and I'm going to go out. 27 is the end. I tattooed 27 tally marks on my wrist, right over the radial artery. It was decided for me, before I even existed. 

When I kill myself, everything will cease to exist. Everything and everyone will disappear. I know there isn't any other option.
