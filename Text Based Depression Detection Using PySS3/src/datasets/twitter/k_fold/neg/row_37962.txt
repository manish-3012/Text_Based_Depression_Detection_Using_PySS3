I Was Going to Kill Myself on June 24thI'm sorry if this is too long. But if it is, then don't read it!

I chose that date because it was 3 weeks and one day after I graduated high school, and clearly anyone who would have missed me after I died would have contacted at some point in that 3 weeks. When that day rolled around, I told myself that if anyone besides my family (who I live with) tries to communicate with me personally (I.e. no group chats) I would call it off. My friend texted me at some point in the afternoon just asking about if a color dye would show up in her hair (don't know why she asked me, I have never dyed my or anyone elses hair). And while it was just a quick interaction, it made me realize that I must be important enough to her.

But ever since then I've felt like I'm in limbo, with no real goal. That date was in my head for 10 or so months beforehand, and now I don't have any real end goal in my life. There is a master's program I would like to get into, but that's more than 4 years in the future, and I doubt that I'll get into it; they only accept 20 or so students per year. 

Since that day, I started going to college. I have yet to make any real friends; I feel like everyone who has been nice to me there so far just feels sorry for me. I honestly feel like I will try again soon. And because of this, it makes me try less in school because I know in the back of my head it won't matter when I'm gone.

I don't know what any of you will do with this information. I feel though that posting this might help me in some way relieve some of my inner stress.

tl;dr I was going to kill myself this past June and didn't and now I feel like I'm in some sort of limbo.
