miserablei got into a fight today with some family members and i got really overwhelmed and could feel a panic attack coming on so i got in my car and drove. i didn't know where i was driving but i just kept going. i was on a highway that is sort of in the middle of nowhere so there weren't many cars but i remember watching all the semi trailers pass me on the other side of the road and how fast they were passing me. all i could think about is how i would die in an instant if i were to swerve in front of them. my small car and myself would have just disintegrated in only one second. i probably wouldn't feel anything either. everything would just go dark. i wouldn't even know that i've died. i wouldn't have to worry about anything ever again. i wouldn't have to think about how much i hate myself. i would just not exist anymore. i'm not gonna lie, i also want to do it just to stick it up some people. i want people to think they did this to me. i want them to feel bad because i died. because thats how much of a horrible person i am. mainly i just want to die because i hate myself and i am sick of being a useless member of society. i just want to die.


instead i'm now sitting in my room feeling sorry for myself and regretting my decision to stay on my side of the road. how was your day?
