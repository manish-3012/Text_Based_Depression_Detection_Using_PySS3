To my lost daughter and never exsisted wifeI know you are not here maybe you will be never exist.  But i can feel you in somewhere and i can feel a little hope , a little grief or a teardrop 
Iam sorry that iam such a loser , i am sorry that iam so weak ...
Iam sorry that iam not enough , iam sorry 
Atleast i will not bring you in this cruel world , because i will be dead .  I don't think i would be a good father but i would try my best and would work hard to give you a happy future .
And for my never exsisted wife yeah i would be failure , iam glad you will never meet with me.
I hope that you will find someone better than me 
Because you know how things are messed up i didn't made for this world and iam not belong here .  I love you all and wish your best ...
Iam your never exsisted husband .
