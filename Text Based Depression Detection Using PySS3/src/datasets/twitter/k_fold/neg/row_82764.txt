I want and feel that I need to be admitted to a mental hospital. How do I go about this as a teenager?Hi I suffer from severe anxiety and depression and possibly something else, don't know what though(? just my own speculation but I may be wrong and probably am). I think about suicide a lot and try to form plans for it but can't finish doing so for some reason. However I cannot function in day-to-day life, it's incredibly hard there is no way out other than death to me, or going to a mental hospital for a break and constant watching so I can really know what's wrong with me and really get help instead of just going to a therapist every other week or so for only 30 limited, quick minutes. Every time I get a chance I imagine the different ways I might kill myself in my current environment, but I don't know if I could really do it. But I really want this treatment because I am sick of going on meds and waiting weeks to see if they really work, it's such a slow and faulty process I want fast results and I want a break. However I am only a teenager and in high school, and I don't want to destroy my grades plus my parents care about me I don't know if they would want me to go, they would miss me a lot if I did and I would miss them, but I really feel like I need the help. Will it cost them a lot of money? Is my situation serious enough to get admitted if I can't finish anything I start and don't want to hurt my family? Will I miss out on a lot of schoolwork?

I'm sorry if this post is a mess but I need answers; my problem is getting out of hand and I don't know how much longer I can go waiting to see my therapist again and I don't know how many more days of inescapable torture I can bear. I know this post sounds aggressive but this is in a way my last cry for serious help, I am really serious about this. I have no other options it's too much to bear. Help?
