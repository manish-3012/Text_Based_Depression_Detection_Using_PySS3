"At least he's not suffering anymore"I was just thinking about this. It's interesting how, whenever someone passes from a long term physical illness like cancer or heart disease or something, and they've been in pain for awhile, people will say this to comfort their loved ones. "At least his/her suffering is over."

And yet, nobody ever says this when someone with depression decides to take their own life. Instead, they're a coward. Even though many people that are suffering from these physical illnesses would choose to take their own lives if they could (and in some places they can and do), somehow that is okay, but a person choosing to relieve their own emotional pain is wrong for doing so, or selfish, or a coward.

I guess it's because as much as people pretend to be sympathetic to mental illness now, they still don't really get it. They think it's something you can just snap out of when you hear the right combination of words, or that there's a magic pill that will just make it all go away and make you more positive and happy. 

I wish people would actually just be empathetic to people like me, and that I could just choose to die without it being a bunch of drama for everyone involved.
