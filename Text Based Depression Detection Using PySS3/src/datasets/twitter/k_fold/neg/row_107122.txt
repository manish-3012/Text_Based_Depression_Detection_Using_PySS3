It Kinda Feel Good NowI have been in a long legal battle with my ex. It looks like itâ€™s not gonna end soon. Yet for some reason, today I have a peace in realizing that the only way out is to end it. And now most of the stress has gone away. I am actually at peace in knowing that the end is near. No more worrying about legal issues, no more falsely attacking my character. It all means nothing now.
