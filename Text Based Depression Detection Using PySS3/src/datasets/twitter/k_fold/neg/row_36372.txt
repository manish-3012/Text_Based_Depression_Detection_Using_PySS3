I just want to vent!I have shit insurance so Iâ€™ve had a hard time getting referred to psychologist and psychiatrist so a pcp has been giving me my meds today she said she was done and didnâ€™t know what to do for me anymore and told me to stop meds and just put in another referral for the 5th?!? Time! I tried to take matters into my own hands and went to the hospital and that got me a week long psych stay in January! Iâ€™m â€œdepressedâ€ although Iâ€™m waiting to see if Iâ€™m actually bipolar and I have anxiety and ocd and I just canâ€™t take it anymore I want it all to end itâ€™s not even about dying itâ€™s just about wanting it all to stop and be okay! I keep having this visual image that wonâ€™t go away of me cutting open my wrist just because I canâ€™t anymore I donâ€™t actually wanna die I just want to let it all out! 
If I could slit my wrist (not to die) and go to the er and get the care needed and to get appointments for what I need then go home I 100 percent would! I just canâ€™t go to psych ward again I canâ€™t it was the worst week ever and only made it worse! In anyoneâ€™s experience if I cut my wrist can I go home or will they make me go to psych ward?!?
