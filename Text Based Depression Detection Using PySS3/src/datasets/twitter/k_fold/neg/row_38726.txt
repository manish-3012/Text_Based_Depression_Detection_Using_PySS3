I can't do it anymoreHave you ever just felt your self slip away? Like just slip from the grasp of reality. Or that your just stuck on auto pilot and can't get away. Like you just feel so numb to everything that you forget to breathe. Or that you just want to die because pain isn't relevant anymore. I've been stable for about a month, but all of a sudden I've just been spiraling down. I dont know whats wrong with me. And I have no one to turn to because they think I just want attention.
