I almost killed myself last night.I was so close. Suicide note written, favorite music playing, completely alone and a necktie around the neck. I chose the partial hanging method off my doorknob. 

I leaned forward, putting pretty much my whole body weight on the tie, testing the waters I guess. The method works by cutting off blood to the brain and essentially you're supposed to just pass out under a minute and die not too long after. I knew what was coming, but nothing quite prepares you for the feeling of literally feeling your life slip away. I could _feel_ my eyes blurring, I could _feel_ my head getting warmer and fuzzier, and I could _feel_ my body getting weak. 

On the way down, I thought of my family. I live at home, studying at uni, with a younger brother and three cats. I thought of who would find me in the morning. My mother has her own share of mental health problems (even though she would never admit to that). She's hard on us, especially my younger brother. My brother is 15. Even if I was going to be dead, I couldn't bare to think of him being the first to see my dead, lifeless corpse. I loosened the tie and sat up, gasping since I'd almost passed out. 

I realised then that it's not my time yet. I feel like I'm destined to kill myself eventually, but not yet. I can't do that to them. I have a therapist appointment that I booked a week ago, and I didn't think I'd make it that far. We'll see. It's funny, I've always been against the idea that suicide is a 'selfish' act, but at that moment, when my life was literally drifting away from me, I felt selfish. Maybe things will get better, though I doubt it, but for now, I'm alive now. Whether that's a good or bad thing remains to be decided.
