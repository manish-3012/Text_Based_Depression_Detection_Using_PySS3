I just need to put this into the universe.When I rolled into bed about an hour ago (9:30pm CT) all I could say was â€œwhy wonâ€™t you let me go? I want to go. I havenâ€™t done it myself, so why wonâ€™t you just let me go?â€

I know a lot of you probably arenâ€™t religious, but I am. And I wish that I could experience mercy in the way I so desperately want. I want to be let go. I want to die.
