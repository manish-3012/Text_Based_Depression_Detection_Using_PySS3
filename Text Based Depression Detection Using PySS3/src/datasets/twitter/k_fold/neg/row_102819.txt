I really need help guys. M13My parents got a divorce like in June
My whole life turned upside down. I got depression, my grades were failing, and have been very suicidal recently. I just found out that my dad has been cheating on my mom for about a year before their divorce. It really messed me up. I just want someone to talk to. Please PM. I want to talk. Not about this just a normal conversation. Please! Someone
