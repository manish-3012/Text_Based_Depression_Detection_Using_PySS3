I have nothing left to give.Are any of you guys religious? I am. Catholic. Recently, I went to my local Church. Confession. I wanted to say all Iâ€™d done wrong and Iâ€™d then go home to dump my toaster in the bath. But when I got there, there was a wedding taking place. And I genuinely think it was a sign. From God, The Universe, I donâ€™t know. But I thought that god told me of everything else I had left to fight for. But frankly I donâ€™t want to fight. I donâ€™t want to move into the world Iâ€™m in. I hate it. I hate being me, I hate breathing the air I breathe and occupying the space I currently lie in. I have nothing to move toward. Iâ€™m fucking tired. Of all of it. My cbt just makes me more sad and I just canâ€™t do it anymore. I want someone. A girl, anyone. Not even from a perspective of seeking true intimacy, I just want someone I can cuddle and know that I wonâ€™t resent the sun when it shines through my window.

And I donâ€™t expect you to care. I just want to be heard. Genuinely heard. One time. Whatever. Iâ€™m going to commit suicide at some point this week, as soon as my house is free basically. Iâ€™m just done with everything. Iâ€™ve spent the better part of my adolescence like this and Iâ€™m finished. Believe me I fought. I took my meds went to my counselling and I employed my cbt techniques to the best of my ability but I just donâ€™t care anymore. I donâ€™t want to be alive.

My name is Brian. This is my note I guess. Iâ€™ve only been here a bit but I want everyone else to do what I failed to do and find a reason to keep going.
