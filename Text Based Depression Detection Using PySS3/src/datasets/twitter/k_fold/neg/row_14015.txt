I feel like I died a week agoI woke up to a laud ringing in my head out of nowhere about 5 days ago and I'm at wits end. I've seen a Dr, but no one seems to know that's causing it and my hearing is fine. I can't concentrat or sleep more than a few hours at a time. It seems to have gotten a little better with steroids and there a fleeting moments where I have hope that it will pass (statistically it most likely will, bit it could be months) but I'm mentally and physically exhausted. This feels like the death of everything I've ever loved. The only thing keeping me here right now is the effect that my death would have on my mother and my friend, but I don't know how much longer I can take this.
