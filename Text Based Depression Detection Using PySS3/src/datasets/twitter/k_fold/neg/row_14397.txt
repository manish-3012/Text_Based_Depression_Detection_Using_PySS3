I want to end my life, so I won't be an adultAdulting seems hard, depressing, and miserable. I'm only 16 yet I don't know the basics of being an adult (i don't even know how to drive, I don't even work, or use the public transport, or cook)

I just don't wanna live anymore. My future is not bright and I would rather die than suffer in this world.
