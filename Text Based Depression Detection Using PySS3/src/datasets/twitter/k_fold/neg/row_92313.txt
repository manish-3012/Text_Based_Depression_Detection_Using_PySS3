How can I tell if I have actual suicidal thoughts?Iâ€™ve wondered about it.  About how people would feel if I did it.  About if people other than my family and like one or two other people would miss me.  And then thinking stuff like.  â€œMy parents would get a divorce if I did it.â€  Because they donâ€™t really get along well I think and maybe they would if I wasnâ€™t around.  Iâ€™ve thought about how it would make people sad, and felt bad, but hey, Iâ€™d be gone anyway.  Besides, I ruined everything with the person I care about most besides family because Iâ€™m toxic.  I ADMIT that.  And I learned and Iâ€™m sorry and I wanna make it up to them and try again but they donâ€™t care and I fucking love them in an alterous way and I just wanna meet them irl and just hold them and talk and share my feelings and emotions and memories and secrets and everything but they donâ€™t care and just hate me.  They mean the world to me but they wouldnâ€™t even care if I was gone.  I donâ€™t even know if these actually count as suicidal thoughts though, or if Iâ€™m just being ridiculous and dramatic and attention seeking and just wondering.
