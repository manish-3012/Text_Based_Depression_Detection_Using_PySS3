By they I mean my demons (what a fucking stupid cliched phrase) whoâ€™re killing me. Som eone please help I just want someone anyone to talk to but itâ€™s not going to happen Iâ€™m alone and drinking but not dunk enough to forget where I am. Itâ€™s such a catch22 that when Iâ€™m not drunk enough I cry (either outside or inside) but the only level of drink that makes me happy also makes me vomit Iâ€™m pathetic and have failed at everything and I know Iâ€™ll die alone in some cheap room having done nothing with no one to miss me . I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ve done wrong I always do something wrong whatâ€™s wrong with me please plese
