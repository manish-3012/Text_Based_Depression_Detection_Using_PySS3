Want an honest answerShould I kill myself (or is it at least understandable) and donâ€™t just say no because of preconceived ideas about suicide. Iâ€™m 19, I have a baby I barely know. I just recently got out of couple month stint in jail itâ€™s not my first stint in jail. I have no job, no high school diploma, slight drug and alcohol problem, diagnosed as bipolar but i am no longer taking meds or participating in therapy and I can go on but I digress. If you HONESTLY feel I shouldnâ€™t kill my self then how can I solve my problems? Thank you
