No kids(?)I am constantly in limbo of whether or not I'll kill myself. I can imagine ordering what I need to die today and imagine living a long life within hours of each other. 

One thing that has changed is my plans of having kids. When I think of the future they are no longer present.

What if I finally decide to die and I have a kid or two? Knowing I'd hurt my current family and bf is enough. I don't want to fuck up who I brought into the world. 

Has anyone else decided kids aren't a part of their future plans?
