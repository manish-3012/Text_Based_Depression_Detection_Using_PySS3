What's the point of living when no one wants you anyway?I've been here enough times before but i want to try this time...  School is crap, home is crap, LDR Girlfriend says we have to meet or its done, college applications aren't done, my counselor makes me feel worse, I can't eat without throwing up because I'm so sick with myself rn, I only sleep every third night, and I have a constant migrane for the last month.

There is nothing happy left I have no friends, my family has basically disowned me, and living just hurts too much...  I've powered through before but this time wanting to live isn't enough...   It's not worth it anymore...
