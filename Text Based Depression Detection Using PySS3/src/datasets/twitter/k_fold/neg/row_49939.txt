100 ft drop.....My childhood was pretty messy...divorce..abuse religious nuttiness ie Jehovah witness stuff...I got Into drugs...its kinda a typical story...nothing special..I've basically been isolated for the paest 25 years battling addiction..anyway recently my sisters sexual abuse by my stepfather has come to light..itto happened as and adult..groping and stuff..I believe my sister my mother doesn't and had chosen him over us. I went on a big binge and tried to hang myself...that didn't work so I climbed over a barrier at the multistory carpark..I guess I was about 100ft up on the ledge for about 20 mins before the cops came...I'm now in hospital..I'm in the UK so it's pretty bleak with cutbacks and stuff..I just want to use again and forget but I might complete next time..we went to the police about the abuse which they said off the record was horrendous. I could just put a bunch of bags in a spoon and od...no pain..or I  an try to work through this...sorry for the rant I guess I need to vent..they dont talk much in here.
