How do I offer support to someone who is suicidal while also suicidal myself?I've recently moved in with two of my closest friends and their 2 year old aon. I was in a situation where my mental health was being destroyed and these guys brought me into their family with the warmest embrace I have ever known.

I am suicidal. I have been more often than not in my life. They know this but its not something I like to talk about often nor am I a risk right now.

But I don't know how to handle this next bit appropriately.

See, one of them is also suicidal right now. Heavily abused growing up, he's never quite recovered - he's for the most part suppressed his feelings and worked his ass off like a boss. A total technology wizard. Blows my mind all the time with his creativity and the works.

He's been lashing out at his wife lately. Like, outbursts of emotion - accusing her of not giving him a honest answer because her tone was off, or that she is secretly laughing at him for being stupid.

It is recognizable as projecting and not being able to make certain connections in his mind right now. Both me and her know this.

But I lost my temper the other day as he was berating the most patient woman I have ever seen. I told him that it wasn't okay to speak to her like that. The night progressed and as we know dark spirals do - his words were of despair, self loathing, hopelessness and us being better off if he died. 

And nothing we said brought him peace.

And I probably said all the exact wrong things than suggested when talking to a suicidal person. I was and am at a lost.

I relate to his pain. With therapy I now recognize that those dark truths aren't the only truths for us yet I am also feeling those feelings of self hate and worthlessness. All my words of support feel hallow and untrue and we both know it.

So how do I go about giving the best support I can to this human who wants to die while also being suicidal myself?
