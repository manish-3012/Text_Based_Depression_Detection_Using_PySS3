I have to do it this weekendfatherâ€™s day is on sunday and if that werenâ€™t enough already, my father has invited my sister and her family over for a bbq. my sister sexually abused me my entire childhood and iâ€™ve been NC with her for about a year, but none of that matters to the rest of my family. it feels like her and my father are both against me together. the thought of her coming back to the house i live in and touching my things makes me feel absolutely sick. i canâ€™t be here but i have nowhere to go because iâ€™ve burned every other bridge in my life. today the person i loved for 2 years told me to kill myself. everyoneâ€™s lives would be so much easier without me here, so it doesnâ€™t even feel like an option at this point, just what needs to be done. i donâ€™t know how iâ€™m going to do it yet and the thought of failing (like i usually do in life) is filling me with anxiety. i just had to get all of this out because i have no one else to talk to.
