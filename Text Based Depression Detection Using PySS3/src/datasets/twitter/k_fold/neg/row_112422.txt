I'm ending it22 years old and I already ruined my life, I have a long history of anxiety and depression that I never told anyone, 4 years have passed since I enter university and I developed a huge social anxiety that stops me from attending classes, my results are really bad, I feel a huge burn because I know I'm the family's disappointment, my mom don't know what to do with me because I engaged in a sequence of lies and more lies to hide all this situation, she doesn't trust me anymore. I have a sadness inside me I know it will never cure. And it hurts so fucking much too watch all my friends moving on with they're life's and I'm stuck in time. Suicide is the only way out, Im not made for this stupid world. I know you will not kill yourself after mom I love you a lot but there's no hope for me
