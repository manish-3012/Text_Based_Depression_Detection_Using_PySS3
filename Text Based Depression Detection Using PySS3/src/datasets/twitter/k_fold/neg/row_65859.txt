DAE feel useless when they seek out comradery for an abusive past but get ignored or upstaged?Does anyone else feel useless when they see someone else get support for their traumatic past, so you brave online social anxiety and post hoping for some support of comradery and instead get ignored or downvoted?

Makes me feel useless. Sometimes I feel like I only live to get my story out there and when I just scream into the void it makes me feel pointless and truly alone.
