Anybody who can help at all?I donâ€™t think i know completely myself&gt; I want somebody to make this easy for me. I want somebody to know everything and pull me out of the hole, but that is impossible. I cycle around into depressive dips so intensely that I donâ€™t know how to stop them before they are already here... I feel confused. I am in love intensely but I still feel like I could be pansexual or bisexual or transgender but i am intensely in love with a girl. I have depressed feelings all the time. I get suiciadal. I donâ€™t know. I feel confused and strange and fucked up and suicidal. Some of my treatment is for bipolar. ]
Somebody please offer some insight? Am I dealing with gay feelings? Am i just fucked up? Is it both?

My dad is gay and that messed me up for a long time
