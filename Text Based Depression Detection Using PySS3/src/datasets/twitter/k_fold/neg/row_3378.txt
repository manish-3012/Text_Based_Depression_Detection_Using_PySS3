Help me make this easyLet me start by saying that ive already made my mind up that im going to leave this planet. Ive already decided how as well. My concern i not how to make it painless or anything of the sort. I want to take this action immediately but my parents would not be able to take the pain. Should i distance myself completely from the few people i do have to make this easier on them? Other people are the only reason I havent taken my life yet but i cant keep this perpetual sadness going at my expense to appease someone else. Will distancing myself from them ease the initial pain or is time not relevant? Also, I would like suggestions so that a loved one would not have to discover me if you will. I need help picking a location so that i may not do anymore damage to the people i do care about than i already have. At this point, this is not something that is up for debate. I just want help making this as easy on everyone else as i can. Should I leave a note to try and explain myself in hopes that it will help them understand that the suffering is finally over? Should i write individual notes to individual loved ones? Does any of that matter if im going to cause them pain? Should i just do it for myself with no regard to how it will effect others? I love you all and i would really appreciate some help making this easier on those around me. I guess its time to learn to tie a knot...
