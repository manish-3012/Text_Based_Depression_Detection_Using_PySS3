I just want to end itNothing brings me joy anymore, I used to be able to distract myself from the misery with video games but that doesn't work either now. I'm 21 and most likely have aspergers or bpd or both. People only talked to me at university either to make fun of me or when they needed help with something. I dropped out at the start of the second year. I spent most of my life so far playing video games which helped me escape from my anxiety ridden reality. Parents were neglectful and abusive, was bullied throughout all my school years. I have no social skills and I have memory problems. I live alone and don't talk to anyone. I'll have to find a job by the end of the year or I'll have to move back in my parents house. I'm basically a social cripple and even getting out of bed is a chore, theres no way I'll be able to hold even a minimum wage job if I can even get hired in the first place. I feel like theres no place for people like me in this world. I've never been happy in my whole life. I'm either numb or anxious and irritated. There is no hope for me to ever lead a normal life. I just want to rest.
