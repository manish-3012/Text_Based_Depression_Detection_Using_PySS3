video games are not the reason of suicidal thoughtsa lot of people say video games are the main cause of suicide but its really not... if anything, its preventing most people from killing themselves. its basically their haven. id say school is the main reason of suicidal thoughts in todays world.

i cant handle school anymore and have been considering suicide since the 4th grade. im 8th grade now and my thoughts havent changed. i know im still young but if i cant handle school trying my best, whats gonna make me think i can survive the future, where its more difficult? im a bit of a twat so ive been avoiding hanging myself but at this point, i honestly feel comfortable hanging myself while my parents watch me die, they deserve it.

i just wanted to get that off my shoulder... just change the school system already, we dont need half of the things we are learning right now. at least dont make everything mandatory. teach something useful for once. that we can use in the real world.
