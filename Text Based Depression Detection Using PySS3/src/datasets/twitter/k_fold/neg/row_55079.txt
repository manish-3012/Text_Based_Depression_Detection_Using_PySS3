Time to throw in the towelYet another best friend has decided they don't want to know me, despite me caring about them more than anything in the world. I can't change their mind and not for lack of trying.

I got a shot at my dream job only to find out it's not enough to live on. And that it'll take two years before I start to earn anywhere near enough.

I have PTSD from my childhood of abuse.

I have spent my whole life fighting to try and achieve things, yet I'm all alone and nobody wants to help, except professionals.

Those professionals say it will get better. But they've been telling me that for about 10 years and it hasn't.

I want the hurt to go away.

What else is there?

Edit: and I rang my dad, who just told me "you just need to harden up and get through it."
