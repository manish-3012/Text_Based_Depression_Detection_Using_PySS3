that didn't last longso 9 days ago i felt like ending it and that whole week was easily one of the worst in my life for my depression, i go maybe 7 days with a minute amount emotion (not including smiling as a result of humor), which really sucks because i now find it ridiculously hard to enjoy anything (i got so little out of Captain America: Civil War the other day and i'm a massive superhero fan; i watch repeatedly all the time; a full marvel movie run through every three or so weeks and i'ts never lost it's luster). i go to sleep yesterday feeling relatively good; all things considered, i woke up today at 3:45 am and i felt like i just wanted to die.

anyone else out there who thinks the universe is screwing with us,   using the good times, only to throw us back into the darkness for shits and giggles?
