Getting on disabilityIâ€™m 18 and live with parents but Iâ€™m gonna be moving out soon. I am too mentally ill to work and the last time I tried to get on disability they said my parents made too much money for me to get it. It seems like way too much work to get. Looks like suicide is the way to go.
