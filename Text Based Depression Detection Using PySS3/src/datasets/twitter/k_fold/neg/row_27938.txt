It's my birthday today. Turning 21.Birthday is coming up in half an hour. Will be midnight in said time. Don't have plans tomorrow, really. Been playing with the thought of maybe just ending things tomorrow. It's not like people will remember me. People will get over my death eventually with time. Time heals. I haven't lived long enough to make any significant or Grand impact on anyone. I don't know if I'll do it tomorrow, but just needed to put this here just in case anyone cares. Maybe I'll see y'all in the next life.
