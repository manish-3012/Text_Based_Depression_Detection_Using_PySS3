Love is strangeWhen you love someone their well-being are your main thoughts. It's like they are the embodiment of your soul. From the littlest things as smiling to one another (causing an explosion of emotions running through each and every cavern of your body) to the biggest life moments you both share.

The moment you're separated creates a  longing to be where they are. When their presence is gone it's like a part of you has disappeared/vanished. Though once you see them or reunited your heart just can't keep steady and they begin to hear it's pounding from outside your chest.

Even though something hurts, you allow yourself to endure the pain if it means the one you love is happy. Because their happiness is all that matters.

Building each other up, supporting one anothers goals and dreams, and rejoicing in each others accomplishments. These moments are what strengthens your soul. That connection just ties you both in this relationship that drives you not only closer to each other but closer to who you are. Truly grateful and appreciate being with you.

Shining your light into this cruel world, opening my eyes to all the beauty and hidden mysteries around us. You are a blessing and truly wonderful being. Universe has life in general has a funny way of making things work out. Thankful for being here.

Whether you chose to read all of this or not. I aint going force you to do nothing. Just going to leave this message here if you or anyone ever felt this way;

Life is not such a cruel place once you meet others. Yes, life does get tough and you need to grit your teeth, stand up tall, and know with confidence that you got this! You have the initiative to pilot your life into positive outcomes. Just know that you are here, alive. Enjoy being alive and share positive deeds with others around you.
