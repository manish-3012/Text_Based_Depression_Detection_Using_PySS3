Please do not mis-understand me. I want to make a documentary.Please do not mis-understand me. I come only with good intentions.

I am a film-maker, and I have thought about the idea of making a small film capturing the very end of a suicidal person's life. Just as there are documentaries available to watch on YouTube about assisted suicides (in the likes of Sweden where it is legal) I have been thinking about creating a non-legal suicide documentary. Telling the world of what is really going on, putting the reality to it's face, and inspire momentum for change. 

Kind Regards,
