I think of my funeral all the time.It is very first world of me, but I feel like nothing is working out for me anymore. Yeah I have a job, yeah I've got a great family, but I just feel constantly tired and defeated. How selfish is it of me to think 'if I die now, everyone will think my best friends are people I don't want to be my best friends'? I feel indifferent about my close friends because we don't have deep connections. I don't feel comfortable sharing with them. My family must be incredibly disappointed in me, I would be too if I were them. I don't know how I made it through this semester. I have nobody to talk to because I feel uncomfortable discussing my feelings.

Tomorrow will be the day. I think of my funeral a lot, how people probably won't come anyway or if they do, they'll spout lies. I think May is a good time as any. 1995-2015. Long enough. The bad things I've done outweigh the good and the guilt is killing me.
