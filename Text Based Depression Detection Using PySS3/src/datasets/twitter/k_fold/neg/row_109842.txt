I want to kill myself so much. But it will hurt too many people I love. I am going to run away instead. Do you think it will help?Some background. I am pretty lonely. I have minimal contact with family (narcissistic dad makes life hellish), and most of my friends have moved out of my shithole town. I have one good friend still here. Two days ago my girlfriend broke up with me. I am still madly in love with her. I want her back more than anything on this Earth. I haven't stopped crying for 2 days. I am also OK with her moving on without me because I just want her to be happy. She knows all this. I don't want sympathy. I have the potential to move cities and possibly countries to run away. Every place I go to reminds me of her. The aisle at the shop where I used to buy the tonic she likes. The place we had our first kiss. It's too much. I just want out so bad. I can't do this anymore.

Before the break up I had a couple of major and minor depressive spells. Most recently in December. I was so sad and angry with how my professional life turned out and so sad and angry with my landlord's shitty behaviour that I wanted to kill myself. There were plenty of times living with my parents when I felt this way. My now ex was an absolute gem in getting me through it, even though she didn't understand why I felt how I did. I think I will love her for the rest of my life. I accept that our time together is over, but it's not going to stop me from loving her. It just hurts so bad that everything is such a fuck up.

She left me because I treated her terribly. Our relationship had its fair share of problems. I fucked up two days ago by berating her exactly as my father does my mother. It hurts me beyond description that I did what I promised to never do. I broke her heart. Now I am in terrible emotional pain. I have a very supportive friend and little brother. I haven't told my parents yet and don't want to. I miss her so bad it hurts my body as I cry, pining for her. I know she still loves me. I just hurt her so badly. She said she never wants to feel that way again. I've promised her I won't ever do it again. She said she needs time. I doubt that we'll get back together. I wish we could.

I want it all to end so badly. But I can't kill myself because it will destroy my mother and ex whom I still love and still loves me. I want to run away to a different country. Start a new life. I don't know if that will help either. Has anyone here escaped to a different place and found it stopped the (constant) thoughts of suicide?

I just want to die. I want to die so much.
