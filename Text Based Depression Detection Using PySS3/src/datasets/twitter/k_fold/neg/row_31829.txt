[Serious] Is it bad that I find death enticing?I had a dream about purposely overdosing a few nights ago and itâ€™s been on my mind a lot, and I enjoyed the dream. I enjoyed taking the pills and watching myself in third person suffer. I have experience with self harm and suicide issues before, and I still find death to be an option. I'm mostly cured of depression yet I still think about killing myself often; is something wrong with me?
