I thought I was over itEvery once in a while all those feelings are coming rushing back. I just can't take it anymore and I don't want to do this. I feel like I'm worthless and can't do anything. Who would care if I die? My family will be sad, sure, but no one will actually care. They will keep on living and I'll be out of this pain. I'm just a worthless little shit and I don't deserve to keep on living
