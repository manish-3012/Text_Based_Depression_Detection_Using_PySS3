I don't want to do this anymoreI want to commit suicide because I can't stop obsessing over things. I can't stop worrying about my appearance, and I keep on checking myself in the mirror and taking pictures of myself. I do this for about seven hours a day. Every single time I do this, I feel worse. I know I am ugly, and I know that's okay, but I want to stop worrying about it. I've done similar things in the past. I used to have these intrusive thoughts about being a pedophile, hurting people, and religion. To help calm myself down, I would usually say some sort of mental reassurance. Usually it would start with: "If you do this, then you won't do x." I just want to stop this. I want to stop thinking about these things, but I can't. I want to commit suicide.
