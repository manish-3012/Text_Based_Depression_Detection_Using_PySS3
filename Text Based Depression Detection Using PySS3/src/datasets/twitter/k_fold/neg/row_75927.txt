I donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep going.I had a suicide attempt a few weeks back but I drank too little and still had heavy death anx and called 911. I am severly depressed and due to only getting a 50% sick permit Iâ€™m getting more and more drained. My therapist also thinks I have an ED and I eat less than 100 cals most days.

I donâ€™t know what to do, Ive been depressed for 1/3 of my life and itâ€™s not getting better. I am having a harder and harder time resisting the thoughts.
