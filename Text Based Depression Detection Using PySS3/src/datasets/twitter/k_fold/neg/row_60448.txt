I finally opened up to someone &amp; they don't even remember it. That's the final straw.I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember, and have actually tried to commit suicide on two occasions. Last night I finally opened up to someone about it. They had been through the same situation and were able to not only give me relevant advice, but make me feel like I wasn't alone for the first time in a very long time. I can't recall a time when I've been that open and vulnerable with someone. 
This afternoon I get a call asking me to piece together what happened last night, because they can't remember any of it. Unbeknownst to me, they had apparently been under the influence of several drugs and did not recall a single thing that we did or said last night. 
It sounds stupid but this has absolutely crushed me. I thought I finally had a person to go to when I was feeling low and it turns out they were so under the influence at the time of telling me that they would be there for me that they can't even remember that. The only person who I can relate to is someone so fucked up they can't even recall the major details of the past few hours. How could I be stupid enough to think that someone could have actually cared about me and been able to relate to my problems? I'm such an inconvenience to everyone.
