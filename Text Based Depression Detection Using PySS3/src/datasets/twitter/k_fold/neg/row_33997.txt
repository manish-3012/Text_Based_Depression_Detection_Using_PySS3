I'm not sure why I keep holding onThey say that social media and depression are linked.*

I can't help but believe that may be the case for me, but it is rightly so.

As I scroll through my facebook and instagram, I am forced to look at my bullies and acquaintances from high school become normal and happy people with lovers and friends and family.

And here am I, constantly sad and lonely with no prospect of love and happiness seemingly too far to reach. 

I have made academic progress which I am happy about, but it doesnt take away the pain of a loveless life. 

It feels no matter what I do, I can never look myself in the mirror and be content with the young lady that stands in front of me.

Instead, I see a pitiful excuse of a human being that shouldn't be here in the first place. 

I have thought about suicide many, many, many times throughout my 18 years of life and I am ashamed to say that this time is one of those times. 

Noone would miss me.
