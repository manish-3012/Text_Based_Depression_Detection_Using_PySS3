I feel like driving my car into the river.I just can't take it anymore. Every time I try to get help, I get assigned or referred an idiot, pill pusher, someone who had their license revoked for having sex with past patients or someone I can never trust. No one wants to bother helping anymore as I've been labelled as insane/a lost cause by the hospital system. I can't take medications because I'm allergic to mostly everything pill-wise, even Advil.

I should have killed myself back in 2013. I thought my life would get better. Instead, it has become pure hell within the past two years. I'm holding back all my urges to drive my car head first into the river right now.
