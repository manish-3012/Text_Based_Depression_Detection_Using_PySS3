I don't think I can make my father proud.My father just called me talking about my result. I failed two subject but it's considered heavy as it cover almost entire human system. (I'm a med student) 


He truly disappointed at me. As he we're as usual. I always can't do things the right way. I'm terribly stupid and dumb. I don't know how am I able to go through this. There is too many regrets and things won't go in your favor and it will never will. And I hate myself for this.


If I am just a lump of burden, I should've choose suicide long ago. Right now I don't even know who I am. I won't suicide soon but I guess it will be earlier than expected. 


Oh I wish I can just disappear just like that. Thanks for reading and sorry. Bye.
