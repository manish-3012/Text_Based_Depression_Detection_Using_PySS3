Exhausted physically and mentallyI've been heavily depressed for years now but at this point it's becoming too much. On top of my depression, I've recently been fired from work and I have to commute almost 5 hours everyday (back and forth combined) to get to my college as I can't afford a student housing. I'm unable to get sleep on public transport because I go through some rough parts of cities and I'm afraid of being robbed of my few belongings. At home, I can only get 2 to 3  hours of sleep as heavy studying is needed. I honestly don't know what to do. I don't see much hope for me to be honest. I don't see a future. I've been lonely for years with few friends and no moments of joy. I probably won't end my life but the thought of suicide does appease me.
