What do you do when living just seems like such a waste?Iâ€™m middle age. My life has amounted to nothing. Iâ€™ve wasted so much time, itâ€™s never coming back. Nothing interests me, nothing will make the situation better. Iâ€™ve done the counseling and the medication. Iâ€™m more or less holding on until my parents pass to spare them the pain, but after that why bother?
