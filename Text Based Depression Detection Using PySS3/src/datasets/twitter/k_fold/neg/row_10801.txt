I Just Want To Be DoneI lost my kids this week. My ex took them from me. They were the things that were keeping me breathing. I have known since I was 14 that I wanted to die, and now it is so bad, it's hard to keep breathing. To get up in the morning. To force myself to go through the motions. How do you keeping living when the only reason you have is taken from you? How do I force myself to function? I just want to die. To have it over with. All my life consists of is pain, nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks. I can't remember the last time I even felt happy.
