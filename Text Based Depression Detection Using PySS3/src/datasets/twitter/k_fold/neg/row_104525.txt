Looking For A Viable Alternative To SuicideHey everyone, I know it's probably pretty obvious but I've been thinking that suicide is a viable alternative to my life right now. Why, you might ask? Well I've broken it down into four different categories that seem to be having a negative impact on my life - love, friends, academia, and health. 

1. Let's start with love. Up until two years ago I was with what I believed to be the most amazing person in the world. To me she was perfect, why doesn't matter but what does is that she made me happy and gave me purpose. She left me a bit over a month ago now. Without her I realize that the person I was able to share my life experiences with is gone and that everything I had worked towards over the past few years was completely lost (with the exception of learning a few things). Frosh was this past week and I did everything in my power to try and meet women to get over this - I thought I did good - over the course of the week I got four numbers. All rejected me the following day or never responded to my messages. 

2. Friends. I have literally none. I have so many new numbers of people yet none of them ask me to hang out with them and when I do they either don't answer or say they don't want to. I feel like sitting alone in my dorm with a bottle of Smirnoff is more comforting than talking to someone else as the alcohol doesn't leave me until the next day. 

3. Academia. I guess the easiest and shortest way to put it is that I don't understand shit even though I just paid $900+ for textbooks, I'm spending 4 hours a night working on it, and it's just the beginning of the year. 

4. Health. I have diabetes. It's getting extremely expensive to afford the insulin I need to live and the government and my insurance are barely even covering the costs so I've stopped eating anything expect at dinner unless my blood sugar gets too low. My body physically hurts from doing this at this point. To top it off I had a stroke about three weeks ago and now I'll be going in for an MRI this coming weekend. (luckily healthcare covers that). At this point I almost hope it's a brain tumor so I can just be done with it all. 

What would make me happy and reconsider my options? Someone to hold. A friend who cares and wants to have fun. Good grades or an understanding of the material I'm learning. The ability to play sports, be healthy, and happy. Yet I can't see how I can get any of these. 

I just want it to all be over. I'm sick of sitting in my dorm, cutting myself and drinking alone. I don't even know what I expect from posting here. Confirmation? Who knows.
