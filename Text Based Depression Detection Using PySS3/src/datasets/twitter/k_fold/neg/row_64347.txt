Who else researches ways to kill themself, but gets too scared with the thought of actually doing it?Sometimes I'll look into the most effective ways, least painful ways, etc... but they all involve very active things like jumping from a high place or the like. I think I'd be too scared to ever go through with it, but I do think about it a fair amount.
