Iâ€™ve tried once and itâ€™s hard to stop myself from trying againI know this is over used and no one will never read this but I thaught I should say this, a bout a year ago I tried to kill myself from jumping off a hotel roof in Poland, my best friend at the time decked me befor I was able to jump though,  then I found love, I was with this guy for almost a year until he left me for some bitch a few months ago, it was hard to keep hope whilst I was with him but now Iâ€™ve caught myself standing or sitting in the windowledge just willing myself to tip slightly in one direction, I know I shouldnâ€™t and I wonâ€™t, not for a short while atleast but please if anyone here is also around my age and sees this then please reach out, we all need a friend sometimes (btw Iâ€™m 15)
