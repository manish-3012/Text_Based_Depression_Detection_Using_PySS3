I need adviceSo Iâ€™ve been feeling like dying , with 2 suicide attempts , Iâ€™ve been hiding it really well for years and Iâ€™m cracking lately , Iâ€™ve been letting out so much I havenâ€™t meant to be , my mum and brother have a completely fake image of who I am and how Iâ€™m truly feeling inside , I want to tell my family but I feel like I canâ€™t , my mum would laugh at me or something or not believe me and I just donâ€™t feel like I can open up about it , they think Iâ€™m happy and funny and joyful and stuff , recently itâ€™s become worse as I have a pushy mother , telling me Iâ€™m never going to be anything in life and Iâ€™m special needs because Iâ€™m not as smart as over people my mind hates my body , whenever something bad happens like I fuck up as per usual , my mind gets frustrated at my body , my mind blames me and makes me feel like shit but I just cannot tell anyone I need help
