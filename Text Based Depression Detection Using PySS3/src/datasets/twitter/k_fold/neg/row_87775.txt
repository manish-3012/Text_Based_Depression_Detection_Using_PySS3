I want to kill myself.I am a 29-year-old dude who thinks he is still in teens may be a peter pan syndrome too. So, I was all optimistic and wanted to live for so long, but finally realized I am not so strong to carry on with my miserable and lonely life. I am 29, I have not had a meaningful relationship until now, now I don't even like anyone romantically, even if I do sometimes, I get crushed very bad, has happened 4-5 times in the past year. Even after doing everything right, you feel like you are rejected by anyone. You are rejected by women, by family, by friends for not living up to the expectation(I used to be a bright kid). Life has taken a toll on me, I feel like I am not able to continue with life, I am eating dark chocolates and drinking some chamomile tea for the last time contemplating ways to kill myself. My safest bets are jumping from a 20-30 storied building or jumping off from a high bridge, but that too seems scary, because I am scared of heights. I thought of ingesting poison, but poison these days are not strong enough and I don't want to be that dude who failed to kill himself too. How many times will I fail, i want to kill myself without fail, we are not allowed to have guns here, but i tried looking for something in the black market but they cost a lot, I don't have money for that. I just want to not exist anymore, I am still contemplating the ways to kill myself. I am convinced this world sucks, I don't want to be alone anymore and be miserable I want to end it all by my own hands so at least I could own my death. Die on my terms.
