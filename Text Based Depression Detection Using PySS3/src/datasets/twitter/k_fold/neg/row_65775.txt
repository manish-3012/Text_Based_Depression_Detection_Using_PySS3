This is the one.Hey everyone. My name is Ben, I'm 18 and I'm about to start a year of college. Today I plan to kill myself, this time for real. I've always backed out for other people, or because I feel that something good could happen. Now I know that everyone despises me. They see me as nothing more than an attentions whore and a desperate needy child in need of pity. Pity doesn't stop a sharpener blade from penetrating your artery so you bleed to death. Call me selfish, say whatever you want, becuase in the end I give up. My future holds nothing, the present holds nothing, and the past is nothing but pain. Feel free to laugh. Corpses can't hear your mockery. Goodbye world, you had some good left in you. I love you my family and friends, and I hope you can move past the brat you never really knew.
