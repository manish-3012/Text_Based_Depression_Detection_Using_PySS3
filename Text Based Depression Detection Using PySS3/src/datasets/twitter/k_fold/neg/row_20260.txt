I never thought I'd make it past 18and I did but I don't know what to do now. I've always thought I'd die before I turned 18 and I never really planned for the future. I'm now 21 and surrounded by all these people who seem to know where they're headed because they planned it out and I'm just stuck here, wishing that I did die earlier. I don't know what to do. I just wanna sleep forever.
