I'm done with everything, I just can't take it anymore.I don't even know what this sub is for and I'm not here for help. I'm just here to tell that I have been battling depression for almost 2 years now. There's no huge thing that caused but the teensy bits of daily injustice, trauma and unloving/uncaring acts towards me. I've spoken to a few people who I think they care for me but it doesn't help. All they can say it is no it's not good things will get better. How long? Whatever caused me to think like this is not in my control, my parents dont think I'm worthy of anything and most probs only care about money. I have an elder brother, I haven't been close to him all life, I was more of a liability for him and he thinks I'm dumb. I've tried to tell him subtly cuz we're not close and I don't wanna talk to him about it and he just doesn't get it. Everyone just keeps on hurting me, knowingly or unknowingly. Heck ik it's not good to commit suicide but it's become so miserable that I just can't take it anymore I'm just so done, squeezed out that I just wanna end this pain. I don't want random internet strangers saying "I care, don't do it" why would you? No you might think you did good by saying this or delaying my suicide but you're just making me go through this pain even more. I've been bold and strong my entire short life(I'm still a very young person) but I just can't handle it anymore. It's has been a shit short lived life and I'm ready to end it, Google a few effective and subtle methods and
