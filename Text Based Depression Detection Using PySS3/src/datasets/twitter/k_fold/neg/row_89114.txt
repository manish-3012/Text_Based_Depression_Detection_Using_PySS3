I'm finding it hard to cling onto anythingMy pain is real and i've felt it all throughout my high school until now 10 years later.

without boring everyone with my life's story.

I have depression and my family does not know anything. I've kept it a secret since i don't really want to bother them.. their life's hard enough as it is..

i fail at everything.. Life manages to keep my alive by giving me unbelievable strokes of luck, but snatches it away within days just as i'm telling myself "im finally happy"..

there are days that i believe i'm in a sick and twisted reality show and people are watching me.. like a group of children huddled around a scared cat offering it food but then deciding it's more fun to put the cat in a bag and then throw it down the river.
