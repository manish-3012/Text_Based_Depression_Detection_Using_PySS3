i dont feel safe with myself anymorei spend all of my time thinking about ways to kill myself, waiting for it to be night so i can hurt myself without chance of disruption. there is none of me that cares to be alive and if i could instantly die right now i would take it in a split second. my safety always relied on the fact that i simply had no way to actually die, but i'm starting to figure it out. i now know of things that would kill me and i'm just waiting for the next time i impulsively decide to kill myself again. i don't want or have the energy to get better. just let me die, please
