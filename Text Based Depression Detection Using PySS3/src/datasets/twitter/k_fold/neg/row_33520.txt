Please someone talk to me. Help.I have tried everything. Been in four psych wards, 15 different medications, therapist, weed, meditation.

I can't do this anymore. I'm blowing up constantly on my SO, on my 6 month old and three year old. Because I am so fucking depressed and I want to die every. Single. Day.

My so says he's worried about me but I know he doesn't know how to help. Idk how to help myself. Please someone tell me something worth living
