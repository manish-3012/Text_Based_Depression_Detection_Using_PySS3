I want the pain if it means to touch you againMy negative thoughts just keep pulling me down deeper and I canâ€™t do anything to stop it at this point, itâ€™s constant. â€œI can control myself I know I canâ€ keeps repeating in my head but I actually just like lying to myself. Itâ€™s easier to lie. 

I came so close to hurting myself again. The pain I get from doing that is less than the pain that comes from my own thoughts. 

I lost my youth to mental illness and i can't take this loneliness anymore, id do anything to forget. I'd give anything to get held. 


Loving/doing things that are bad for me &gt; getting better in anyway
