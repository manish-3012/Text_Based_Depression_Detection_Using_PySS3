Need advice/experience stories: university(16F) University is my impossible dream. I want so desperately to be accepted somewhere excellent, like Oxford University. I want to be able to stroll around a beautiful campus on an overcast day, and to study for hours in an old library, and to excel in my courses, engaged in interesting content. I want to continue learning about linguistics, studying English, French, and Latin as well as etymology and writing.

But I still have another two years of school, and this dream seems absolutely unachievable. How could I get into university? Why would I ever be chosen over another person... a brighter, happier, more promising and intelligent person who has received awards and perfect grades? The answer is, I wouldnâ€™t. I spend all my life studying and working, but with no results except anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. Anything below 100% feels like failure. 

Last week, I received my first C. It feels like someone has torn my heart out with bare hands and left me empty and useless. I know that this is probably trivial in comparison to othersâ€™ lives, but to me, it feels like the world is crumbling. I have absolutely no shot at furthering my education. I donâ€™t even deserve to, due to my utter lack of intelligence. I canâ€™t even explain how much I hate myself. I have no future.

If you have a few moments and you have gone to university... could you please explain to me what the admission process was like? From my standpoint, it seems like a hopeless, impossible gauntlet for a worthless student like me. I canâ€™t imagine ever being admitted, and it crushes me to think about every day. Iâ€™m so sorry for being unbearably whiny and dramatic.
