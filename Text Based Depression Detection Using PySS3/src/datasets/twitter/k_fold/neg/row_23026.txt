I don't see the point anymore.Everything's been downhill this year and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do anymore. I'm afraid to try anything because it seems like whatever I attempt will just go wrong too. Both of my grandparents who raised me passed around the same tike, my girlfriend of 2 years who I was planning on starting a life with dumped me out of nowhere, and now I may have to quit my job because of safety concerns. I have no skills and my career isn't going anywhere. Honestly, I don't see why I should keep trying anymore in hopes that maybe someday things will be better again.
