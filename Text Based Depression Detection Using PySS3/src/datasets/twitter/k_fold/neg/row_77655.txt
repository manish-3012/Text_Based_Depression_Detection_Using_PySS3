debt over 150k, only 28, suicide is the only solutionEach month that goes by, the amount just keeps growing. I'm so stressed I can't think straight. I see no point of fighting back. I'm having panic attacks and I can't sleep. To make things worst, I even got scammed out of some saving I had.

I'm the stupidest guy on earth. FUCK this! How can I be this young and be in this kind of debt. I need to do it just to end this agony. Help!?
