Does anyone else...?Start to panic when something unexpectedly bad happens and try to find ways to distract yourself but everyone just makes you feel stupid about it, and then suddenly you realize you have no where to turn and nobody cares and then you find yourself wanting to die?

Is it just me?

I havent felt like this for a long time but just everything is going so poorly and I... just dont feel good...

This will probably be deleted, I'm almost sure...
