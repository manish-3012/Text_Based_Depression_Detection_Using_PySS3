I'm lazy, I'm a leech, I'm downright horrible, and nobody believes in my ability to fix it anymore.I'm in the end of my 5th year of undergrad and still have classes to finish. And for a year of that time I wasn't even in school or working, I was just doing nothing because I was in the middle of a mixed episode after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Though I'm more functional now, I'm still just as awful if not more so.

Speaking of being bipolar, I also have a plethora of other problems. I have a sleep disorder that makes me sleep 12+ hours a day, even through alarms. And my doctor thinks it's just because i don't keep a regular schedule (which I try my best to do, but it's hard when you SLEEP FOR 12+ HOURS A DAY). My psychiatrist and one of my therapists believe that I also have ADHD, though it is not officially diagnosed yet. I also have an inordinately poor memory, I forget nearly everything people say to me or that I read. At work I can't remember regular customers' names even though I see/talk to them 3+ days a week. On top of that, I am very uncoordinated--I trip over things and hurt myself constantly, I break stuff on accident all the time, beyond the level of just cutesy klutzy.

Now those things aren't necessarily my fault, they just make existing hard. But on top of that, I consistently make the same poor choices over and over again that hurt myself and those around me. 

**Poor choice 1:** I became a drug addict (meth). During the thick of my addiction (coinciding with my bipolar meltdown), I stole money from my parents and my fiance (who is now my husband). I'm not sure how much it ended up being (I only took $5-20 at a time), but it's just bad on principle. Of course, I stole because I'd spent all of my own money left over from the part time job I had until they fired me for being late all the time or simply not showing up on occasion (due to some combo of the bipolar and the addiction).

**Poor choice 2:** I have become a lazy student since the time off (hence the 5+years of undergrad). I put off work until it's past due, and then beg for a second chance. Without realizing it (until recently), in the past year I've taken advantage of my professors' desire to see me graduate in order to get exceptions, fewer assignments, extended deadlines, etc. I'm not sure what happened--I used to be an ambitious A/B student on track to graduate early with 2 degrees. Now my family is afraid I'm going to drop out and settle for a low-paying easy job the rest of my life (though they would never say so to my face). I'm afraid of that too.

**Poor choice 3:** I'm a leech to my family. All my parents (and other family too) have given my my whole life is their full support. They've never been mean to me, always encouraged me to follow my dreams, and financially supported me my whole life (including still paying my  tuition/rent/food/etc even though I am married and nearly into my 6th year of a 4 year degree). In return I've given them nothing to be proud of. I don't have good grades they can brag to friends about (anymore), I don't have promising career prospects, I don't have anything to show for all they've invested in me. I only talk to them when they remind me (even though I love talking to them! I just am forgetful and get caught up in stuff), I rarely do anything for their birthdays or mother/father's day. I love my family and am so thankful for all they've given me, but the way I act shows the opposite. And now I've recently discovered (from my husband relating a conversation he had with my mom) that they are losing faith in me. That they resent me for wasting their money, just like I resent myself. That their patience and belief in me is wearing thin.

**Poor choice 4:** Friends? I don't really have those. I pushed them away through being an uncaring asshole of a human. I flaked on plans, took support but didn't give it, didn't listen, lied. I think my two best friends can only tolerate me because they live 1000+ miles away and therefore don't see me regularly and don't know the gritty details of how truly terrible I am. 

**Poor choice 5:** I also take advantage of/don't care about strangers. I've flirted with guys so they would give me alcohol and/or drugs. I take things from the lost and found if they go unclaimed for a while. I never look for the owner of money or interesting items I find on the ground. I never donate to charity or give money to homeless people (unless they are exhibiting some sort of skill).

**Poor choice 6, poorest choice of all:** My husband has hung in there with me through good and bad, through every relapse, through every broken promise, through every meltdown, through panic attacks and depression naps. He always believed in me, even after seeing me at my worst. So I went and did the one thing certain to push him away irreparably. I had a full-on affair, physical *and* emotional, with someone he was friends with, someone he and I spent several hours a week with. We'd even gone on double dates with the guy and his wife. I lied for months about "staying late at work" or "going out with friends" multiple times a week so I could fuck another guy instead of communicating with my husband about the issues in our relationship like an adult. He said after finding out that he would rather I'd tried to kill him. That he can never trust anyone again. That love will never mean the same thing. 

I'll never forgive myself for doing that to him. The one person who still loved me and believed in me even after numerous failures, I took his love and spat on it. 

I treat everyone horribly, including myself. It would be best if I died now, before hurting anyone further, or becoming an even greater disappointment. 

All I can do is break things.
