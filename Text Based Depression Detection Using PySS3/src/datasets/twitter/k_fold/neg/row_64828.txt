Almost 10 years since my mother killed herself, and I'm becoming more suicidal than everNext month marks 10 years since my mother hung herself. The whole messed me and my family up. My dad drank himself to death 6 years later, and a few months later my older brother ran off to the other side of the world for a better.

I've just been here, stuck, feeling hopeless. I've really tried, I really have. Granted I've got a decent part-time job, but it's not what I want to do. I gave up on my dreams of being a photographer a long time ago and now I'm getting to an age where it feels like it's too late to really do something with my life. I can't afford to better myself, I'm living pay-check to pay-check and wasting my time at a dead end job. At my job I'm made to feel useless and terrible too. After every shift I go home and cry. I want to leave this city I've been in my whole life, but there's no real opportunities for me. Plus I can't afford to get up and go like that.

I'm giving up, I hate my life and myself even more. I want to die.
