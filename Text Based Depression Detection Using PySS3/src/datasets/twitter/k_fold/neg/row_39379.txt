What's wrong with usThe idea of making a second reddit account and posting about my depression and how I plan to kill myself by the end of quarantine seemed like a good idea.

(Obligatory sorry for format, posting via mobile) 

It wasn't for attention (maybe) and it wasn't so that I would get talked out of it. I just wanted to tell someone about it, since I can't tell anyone I know personally cause they would try talk me out of it and could potentially restrain/prevent me from doing so.

While looking for an appropriate subreddit to post to (I knew there would be a suitable one, there's a subreddit for everything), I came across r/depression and this sub.

It didn't take the whole 30 minutes of reading through to realise that I am not not the only one who feels the way I do.

Obviously I knew I wasnt the only depressed person in the world, but I wasn't expecting to read other people's posts saying exactly what I was thinking:

- The idea of being okay with suicide, knowing that there is not much here on Earth for us.
- The infamous numbness.
- Having these thoughts despite being a Christian and knowing Jesus, that's the most confusing part, wondering how we are allowed to feel this way.

It's sad to see so many broken spirits. There's so much sadness and madness in us all. All around us. What are we to do.
