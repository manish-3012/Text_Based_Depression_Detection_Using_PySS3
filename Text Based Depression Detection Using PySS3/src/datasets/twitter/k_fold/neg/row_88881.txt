Christmas is inconvenient. Happiness is inconvenient. The performative nature of the world to pretend to care when the suffering turns visible makes me want to disappear more. People only care when you have the means to end it all.For Christmas, I want to leave without hurting any more people. I want to be gone. 
Shit questions. Shit answers. Shit documentation.
I will float and slip through the fucked up mental health system this country has. 
New year's will come, then Blue Monday, and people will pretend to care out of performativity rather than true care. It is a valid cycle that will forever continue, because being fucked up and wanting to die is every bit functional as it is to have these days reoccur year, upon year, upon year.

It's fucked. It's all fucked. I'm fucked. 
I can't wait to get fucked again next year.
