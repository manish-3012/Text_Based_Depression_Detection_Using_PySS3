Is today the day?My long time GF recently broke up with me and she said we could remain friends. I have yet to have the chance to speak with her face to face to clear the air. I have texted her telling her that i'm thinking of suicide and she told me not to. She said she will meet me sometime next week and talk things over, but our relationship is definitely over.

I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was 18. When I met my gf, those thought never came back. Until a few years into our relationship where things were a little rocky and I tried to kill myself. I took a whole sleeping pills with Nyquil hoping never to wake up but it didn't work.

Back then i still had her supporting me emotionally and i could still see the light.

Now, she said it will be a clean break. All my previous issues of depression resurfaced again, I made a hangman's noose, called her one last time, but I couldn't do it because there were other loose ends to tie.

Now, I wake up thinking if today will be the day. Is there something seriously wrong with me?

TL:DR - got ditched by GF, all previous suicidal intentions came back. All the suppressed emotions are killing me. There's not a single day where i don't think about killing myself.
