Why does she hate meMy own flesh-and-blood mother makes me feel sick. I feel like I'm going to puke. She litters the house with empty beer cans and cigarette ash. She mocks me and humiliates me, never believes a word I say, always says that I'm overreacting and that my father is babying me when he tries to comfort me. She never let me do anything do distract myself from this fucking terrible life. The only place I feel safe is home alone on my playstation watching Youtube or Netflix; even then, that doesn't bring me any joy, it just stops me from feeling miserable. I feel better when I'm at school being harrassed by other people because at least I'm out of that death trap called "home". This is exactly why my sister moved out at 18, also including the time my mother got arrested for beating her. Everything about my family that anyone tells me is a straight-out lie, my sister's father wasn't neglectful, he walked out because the abuse he got in return for taking care of them both was too much, leasing to my mother having to sell meth just to feed her daughter. I need to leave this house. Please someone help. Call CYS, call the police, because I don't have the balls to do it myself.
