I just want to sleep.Iâ€™m not sure how much more I can take. I hate being broke, jobless, and a waste of space. I donâ€™t have anybody to lean on. I feel so alone. I just want to sleep and have been staying in bed a lot lately. I keep imagining a bag taped over my head. Seems less messy than a gun. Maybe Iâ€™ll build up the courage to do it soon. Maybe not. I canâ€™t really see a happy ending though.
