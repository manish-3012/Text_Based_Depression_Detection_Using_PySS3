ImpulseM/21/Bipolar NOS with psychotic features (diagnosis--not sure I believe it). Not on prescribed mood stabilizers or antipsychotics.

Having very strong intrusive thoughts about [method redacted]. Have everything on hand and ready to go any minute. Attempted twice before but always stopped midway with no permanent damage.

Profound sense that I am disgusting--so thoroughly and inherently repulsive that I should not be allowed around normal people and should be put down like an animal with [method redacted]. I should not be allowed to live. My body is a fucking cancer. I am human shit.
