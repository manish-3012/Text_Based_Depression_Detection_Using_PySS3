Sick of friends leaving me and not knowing whyFor the past few months there have been many examples of friends suddenly blocking me on social media for seemingly no reason, at least not any that I can think of.

Literally, people have been doing this despite me not talking to them for months.

I don't know what drama is going on behind the scenes that I'm not aware of, but I'm sick of being out of control and everyone leaving.

I've had so many reasons to end it all before now, this is just the cherry on top.
