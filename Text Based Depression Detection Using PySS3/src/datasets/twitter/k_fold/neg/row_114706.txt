I have to go, itâ€™s the only way I can stop hurting others.Yesterday night my best friend in the whole wide world confessed to me how she really felt about me and our friendship. 

I knew things were tough but I didnâ€™t think anything was wrong, until she told me what was. She told me that I made her uncomfortable, that I seemed obsessed with her and wanted to be her. She said that she felt like I would kill her and wear her skin. The only valid reason I think she feels like this is because I brag about her a lot to my family and to total strangers about how much I love her and how sheâ€™s a role model for me. She was the first friend that was actually healthy for me.

She told me about how all of our other friends felt about me too, and how they were fed up with me. I had no idea any of this was happening, that I was causing problems yet again. 

Because it seems to always happen. I find new friends and eventually I do something wrong, unintentionally, and they leave. 

So, honestly Iâ€™ve always known at this point things arenâ€™t going to get better unless I change, but Iâ€™ve been trying this whole time, and I thought I was getting better until she told me everything last night. Now I know that I am not able to get better. 

I have to do this, I have to kill myself, so that I donâ€™t bother anybody anymore, so that I donâ€™t unintentionally hurt someone else I love. I just want to go, and for everyone to be happy and peaceful finally. 

Iâ€™m doing this to protect them. 
I donâ€™t want to be alive and risk the temptation of going back to them and begging them to stay. 
I donâ€™t want that. 
So I have to do this. 
I need to, for everyoneâ€™s sake and my own.
