People Reject Me All The TimeAnytime I ask someone to hang out they reject. Anytime I suggest something they reject. Anything I do they reject. 

The funny thing is only people I donâ€™t know donâ€™t reject me. Strangers are friendly to me. They smile. If theyâ€™re girls theyâ€™re flirty with me.

Iâ€™m in this such a situation where Iâ€™m forced to live in solitude. The main problem is I had enough. Iâ€™m tired of solitude. Iâ€™m tired of living just so I can say Iâ€™m alive. Iâ€™m not even alive. I just exist. How good it would be to just stop existing.

Maybe this world or life is not for me. Why should I stay if I could be happy in some other life.  Nothing keeps me going anymore. Going to the gym and running for hours doesnâ€™t make me feel good anymore. The body has limits. Even if I train until I get a Greek godâ€™s body. What would I do with it? Thereâ€™s no one to share my life with.
