No point to living anymoreI am just really done with life. I don't see any point in continuing. Nothing is ever going to get better. In fact, things will only get worse. I am a 31/F with no friends, never had a boyfriend, crippling social anxiety, Aspergers, depression, and still live with my parents. 

I feel like a complete loser. I've tried to go to school and better myself but failed miserably. I ended up graduating with a useless degree that I can't get a job with. Now I'll be forced to work for minimum wage the rest of my life. What's the point of life if all I do is work and pay bills? I would like to find a better paying job, but no one will hire someone like me. 

I really want to be able to move out of my parents' home. It's a very hostile enviironment. My parents constantly fight or go through long periods of time not talking to each other. It really stresses me out. I have no friends or other family members to move in with. My sister hasn't spoken to me in over 15 years because she thinks I'm nothing but an autistic loser. 

I have absolutely no social life. My days are spent working or sitting at home playing video games. Before you say "Put yourself out there" or "Join clubs", I have tried that. I even joined a social group for people with Aspergers and guess what? Everyone grouped up and made friends with each other and I got excluded. I have tried reaching out to people, but they made it clear they wanted nothing to do with me. Whenever I invited someone to hang out, they would make up some excuse why they couldn't. It hurt so much to go to group each week and hear everyone talk about how much fun they had at the amusement park or the movies. Eventually I just quit. 

I don't see anything improving in the future. Things just keep going down hill. I don't know if I can live like this anymore.
