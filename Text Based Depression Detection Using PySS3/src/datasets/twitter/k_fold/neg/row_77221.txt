I can't do this anymore.Hello.
I've lived my life with social anxiety ever since I entered my teenage years, and It's gotten to the point where I can't stop it at all, It's driving me literally into insanity and I just can't cope with it.
Every day I wake up feeling like my whole life has been a disaster, like I'm a failure, like I will never find happiness. I always overthink everything, even when I achieve something I've always wanted, I can't get that feeling away from me that tells me I'm a horrible person. I've tried for SO LONG, to keep these feelings away, but it's never worked and I've spent so much time and effort to get them away, but It's never going to work. I feel uncomfortable whenever I do anything, I feel like everyone else's lives would be much happier if I was just gone forever.
