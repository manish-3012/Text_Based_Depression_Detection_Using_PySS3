I canâ€™t keep goingIâ€™m 21... I have no family and the ones I do have Iâ€™m not allowed to have contact with. Iâ€™ve been raped, beat, and starved for most of my life and Iâ€™m surprised I havenâ€™t taken my life sooner. I canâ€™t take it anymore. The flashbacks are all too real. The nightmares make it to where I can feel and relive the horrors that have happened in my life. I wake up screaming and kicking. I can barely sleep. I canâ€™t keep doing this. I am tortured day in and day out by my own brain and I donâ€™t know how much more I can take. Self harm isnâ€™t helping. Therapy and pills arenâ€™t helping. Pretending Iâ€™m happy and ok is getting harder to do. I canâ€™t keep doing this...
