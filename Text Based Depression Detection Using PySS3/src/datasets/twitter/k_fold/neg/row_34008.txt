Acting like a bitchI really want to seek help but I usually act like a bitch and moan on the internet about my issues only for me to deny them in about half an hour. I open up about the specifics of my issues, but end up blocking any feedback two days in.I want to change that because I really hate how it feels to be a slave of my emotions and the strong swings that come with them.
