I cannot wait for my mum to f*cking dieall i wait is for her to die. then im going to lie under the train that very day.
i cannot learn english. ive had to learn it all my life to be able to write poetry, stories. it is artificial language to me, a languge for game (and i want to play , i want to be a child forever and to create and play my own games, to live virtual lives). i hate my morher fu*king russian language because it's real and because all what i loved - music and books - all is done in english. my unrequited love, Dasha (its girl name) whom i ve loved 6 years (six!!!! without being able to talk with her via skypoe at least because she ignores me because im a pervert) has proficiency in english, has that fu0king C2 certificate, she is a teacher she is a grownup person she works in an IT company as a english teacher for these damned programmers (and her 28yo boyfriend is a programmer). and i cannot move from this plane of knowledge with which im writing now 2 years. in fact i don't learn language at all. because i m fu9king depressed all the time. im fucking sit with a grimace of anguish on my face all days. i want my Dasha i want to be friends with her i want to return back and be forever child to live over and over again that period from 13-to 20 years of age. that b0tch my mum don't die. i cannot wait , i would kill her to be able to kill myself sooner, but we are two in a very intimate relationship, in short i cant kill her. guns are forbiden in my country, i've got only a knife or a brick to do it and so i cant do it, it s very bloody and slow method.  cannot do anything. my tonsils stink, i hate human stench in all forms (except Dasha's shit's), i hate my body, hate arteries, these nose and lips and saliva and eyes and all. i hate human body except Dasha's one.  i want to fu0k and to be with my Dasha. and i want to speak english and write poetry and to want to compose music again like in my youth and to be young again.
