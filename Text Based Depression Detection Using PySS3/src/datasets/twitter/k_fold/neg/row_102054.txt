Waking up disappointed because i live to see another dayThis is my first day on Reddit, I just want to let it out because I have no one to talk too. Everyday I wake up with an emptiness inside of me that's just enough to bare but just enough to be in pain the rest of the day till I fall asleep. I can't stand the sight of my body, I deteriorate slowly throughout the day &amp; anger is what ends up tiring me out. I'm tired of living with this black cape of shit over me, I hate myself &amp; I hate everyone around me. I don't even feel like I I have to kill myself because that would end up being a pleasure I don't deserve. I deserve to feel this misery everyday until I just don't wake up anymore. But I'm trying &amp; I think that's a step forward.  Thank you guys for listening, it's nice to know that I'll be heard with no judgement.
