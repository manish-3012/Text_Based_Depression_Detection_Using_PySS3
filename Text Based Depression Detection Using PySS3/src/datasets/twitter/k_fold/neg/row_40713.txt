i donâ€™t know if i want to die or just escape the pressureim just ye olde angsty junior in highschool. straight up want to die, but donâ€™t know how to do it without upsetting my family. my best betâ€™s making it look like an accident, but weâ€™ve had so many medical deaths in my family lately and thinking about my mom crying is the worst. my brotherâ€™s in college and i donâ€™t want to fuck up his dreams or whatever. i know he has depressive episodes (it must run in the family lmao) and heâ€™s recently got his life back on track and i donâ€™t want to be The Thing That Permanently Fucks Him Up. 

school is miserable. the only class i enjoy is SL bio. all my HL classes are hell and the other SL classes are boring or really too hard for me. the girl i was in love with is straight. i hold all my friends at arms length bc im afraid of disappointing them. 

i was ok for a while. like i was depressed and actively suicidal, then i wasnâ€™t, and then i was. and then i fucked up further. 

i did something by mistake that i need to pay $1200 for. nt drugs or anything, nothing illegal, but i have no idea how to get the money without asking my parents for it. theyâ€™re already paying so much for me - private school tuition, on top of a trip to london this summer. i donâ€™t know how to ask them for the money. theyâ€™re exhausted all the time, and weâ€™re barely making enough money to keep us afloat. i want to pay them back, but idk how. i donâ€™t want to put us in debt. i canâ€™t get a job until summer of 2019 because the school iâ€™m in rn doesnâ€™t allow students to have em. and even then, iâ€™ll need to move out to university pretty quick. i canâ€™t make $1200 in like a month. 

honestly im glad i have the capacity to worry about this. like i was so depressed at one point that i couldnâ€™t care. i just wanted to die. i can feel myself slipping again but idk how to stop it. i dont want to ask to go to therapy because every time i mentioned it my dad looks like he swallowed a sour grape. i miss my brother. i donâ€™t actually want to die. i just want to be free &amp; happy. and sometimes i feel like dying is the only way to achieve that.
