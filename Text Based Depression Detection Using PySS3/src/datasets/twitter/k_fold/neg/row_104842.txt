Idk what I'm doing. I wanted to be better, but I kinda just want it to endI don't know if I'm just a manipulative piece of shit, but I often think of committing suicide after things go wrong. 

But, sometimes I also have random thoughts of stabbing myself in the stomach or arm. I've planned out what I would do if I were to ever find the courage to actually pull it off. 

I'm so tired. I thought I was getting better. But honestly I feel like nobody loves me. I feel like I'm inept at speaking to people in a healthy and kind way. I can't take criticism. I overreact. I yell a lot. Its everyone else's fault. I shut down and hold grudges. Everyone is leaving me. I dont have hope or a plan for my future. I lost the love of my life. I am an abusive person. I'm never trying hard enough. I'm defensive. Noone wants to be around me because I'm just plain toxic. 

I'm just waiting for death to take me. People would be so much better off without me. I'm a terrible person. I've been trying to be better I feel like for my whole life. All I've ever wanted was to be there for people and to make people happy. I think I've done an awful job. I've hurt so many people. What's the point honestly. 

I'm so tired
