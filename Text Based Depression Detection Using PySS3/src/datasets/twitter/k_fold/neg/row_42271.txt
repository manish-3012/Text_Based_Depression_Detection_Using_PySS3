Feeling aloneIve been depressed from when i was about 9 for pretty much no reason but when i was 11 i found this girl i liked and we started to talk about a year into talking to her she got a boyfriend i know i should of been happy but it fucking killed me inside and her boyfriend witch was one of me friends for a while stopped talking to me for no reason witch made me suicidal a few months pass and they break up but still are friends and she rebounds onto me so i think this is my chance so i try my best to be with her about 3 days after we start kissing so my hopes are pretty high that we are going to go out on a date but 2 days after she feelings just died and she started liking my friend that broke up with her so im really fucking heart broken and i cant stop thinking about suicide i just dont know what to do anymore because i still like her im 13 right now also sorry about my grammar
