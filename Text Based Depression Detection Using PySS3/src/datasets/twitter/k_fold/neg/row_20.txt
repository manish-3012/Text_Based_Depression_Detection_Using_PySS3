I feel like I am drowningI used to go to school at a state university, then I had to drop out for financial issues. It's been a year since then and I haven't moved anywhere in my life. I have one job (15 hours a week, so I don't make enough money for essentials like food, soap, toothpaste, etc..) and I am trying to find another job but I can't find one. I feel like I'm going to be stuck in this hole forever and  part of me just wants everything to be over. I apply to 5-6 jobs a day and make sure to call back but all I get is an explanation as to why they don't need me. I also haven't been able to afford a haircut for 3 months and I'm self-conscious about it because my hair never gets long and it feels gross. I spent all of this month with my bank account overdrafted and I have no clue how I will pay rent. Sorry for rambling, but I can't stop thinking of killing myself and I really want help.
