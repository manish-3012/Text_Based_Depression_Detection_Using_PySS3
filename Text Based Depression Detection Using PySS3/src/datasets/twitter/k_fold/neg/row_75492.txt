I had a fantasy this morningI'll start with why I'm here. I broke my wife's heart. She's an amazing woman that deserves not a single ounce of sadness, and I let her down. On a lonely night while she was gone I found some intimacy on a webcam site. I don't know why I did it, but I felt sick about it after and confessed. It happened a few days ago. I confessed yesterday after she was telling me how perfect she thinks I am. I couldn't take it anymore and here we are.

As I was walking into work this morning, I saw a stranger across the street on the sidewalk. I fantasized that they would pull out a gun and rob me, and I'd do something stupid to get myself shot. I don't think I could pull the trigger myself, but I keep coming up with these ideas to get myself hurt or killed where it wouldn't be an obvious suicide, so she could still get life insurance. Maybe I ride my motorcycle without a helmet down some bad roads. Maybe I go kayaking in some rough water and don't secure my life jacket (I skipped a paddle trip tonight just in case I wouldn't be able to fight those thoughts). Even as I'm writing this, I'm afraid it could be found should something happen and keep her from getting insurance.

I've never had a single suicidal thought before today. I'm not even sure if I really am, but I thought it would be good for me to come here. I can't take hearing any more about breaking her heart or letting her down. She said she never thought I could hurt her like that. I just feel even worse for thinking about doing something that would hurt her more.
