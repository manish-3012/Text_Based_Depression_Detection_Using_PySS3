I really want to die right nowI have to break up with my bf because my mom (who I'm living with, I'm 19) says I'm being selfish by making her suffer through me being with him. She says she hates me that I might have to move out. He's often verbally abusive towards me, sometimes puts pressure on me, has called me: cunt, bitch, idiot, autistic, retarded, chubby, and others, he's wished on me that I get abused like I deserve by future partners. I cant remember the other things. No one likes me, not even myself. My friend said she loves drunk me but I cant ever be like that sober and I feel uncomfortable around people anyway. I'm just causing my family pain and I dont understand it because all i wanted to do was date him even though he makes me feel like shit most of the time. I cant get a job and I feel like Ill never be able to do anyting, i dont even know what i want to do, I'm studying architecture because i wont be good enough to make it as an artist but architecture is so so cold. I want to kill myself so bad right now but i cant even do that because I'd be hurting those around me again. I wish i was an only child so I could.
