In a few months I'm going to do it.I'm a 24 years who lives with their parents and without a job. My parents are growing older each day. My mom has heart problems. We are struggling financially. I have I don't know what it is thing. I get scared when studying so I stopped studying and I have an upcoming exam soon. Yep I'm still in school getting my bechelors. My orginal plan is to work for a few months save enough to buy pills and go back home and take them at night after the Thingyan festival.I'd be long gone the next morning. But watching my mother counting money almost tears me up makes me feel pretty shitty. I'm the worst person aren' I? Feel free to condemn me! I really should be talking these things to my psychiatrist but I couldn't talk to him anything so here I am talking to strangers on the internet. Attention seeking if you will.
