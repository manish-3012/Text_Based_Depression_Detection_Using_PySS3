Iâ€™m going to be a fatherAnd Iâ€™m a deadbeat. I hate my life and everything in it. I smoke weed to escape the reality of what Iâ€™ve done with my life. Now Iâ€™m having a kid and Iâ€™m not ready at all. Iâ€™m here because suicide crossed my mind. itâ€™s not an appalling though that I might not exist tomorrow. 24 years here and Iâ€™ve done nothing worth anything and Iâ€™m treated as such every day. Yet people want me to do better. And I have reasons to be alive obviously. But I just know Iâ€™m going to amount to nothing always. I will never have respect or care by anyone who isnâ€™t biologically obligated to do so. Iâ€™m sure my son is going to hate me.  I canâ€™t kill myself. I canâ€™t hurt the ones around me. But I canâ€™t imagine 40 more years of life.
