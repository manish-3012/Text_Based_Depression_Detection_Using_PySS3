Healing is harder than painIâ€™m sitting in my room, in the dark.. I just realized I have to get up in the morning.... itâ€™s too stressful. I really just canâ€™t do it. 

Iâ€™ve been trying to heal for 19 years. I was happy feeling the bare minimum. If anyone can tell me where to buy a gun. Iâ€™d be happy...
