CPPS, anxiety, depression, datingHello everyone. Sorry for my bad English. Iâ€™m a guy who lives in Russia and suffers from chronic pelvic pain syndrome/chronic prostatitis since 13 yo. Now Iâ€™m 28 and I want to suicide many years. I took diazepam, alprazolam, amytriptiline and many many antidepressants all classes. Itâ€™s so terrible. Iâ€™m trying to meet people in dating sites. Communication with people alleviates my pain. I try to find a girl but after meeting I came home with tears on my face. I feel very loneliness. I canâ€™t patient everything anymore. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m not needed by anyone. Girls donâ€™t see me as a man because I suffered a lot and quite sad and boring. No one of girls canâ€™t understand my sufferings. In society men must be strong because of it I even canâ€™t say my suffering in real life anyone. I want to die many years, everyday.
