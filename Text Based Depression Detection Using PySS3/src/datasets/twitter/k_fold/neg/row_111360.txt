How do you guys do it?I keep moving the date up sooner and sooner. I want to take that ibuprofen every single night, but I wait. I shake and I cant breath, but I wait. It's so painful. Every single night. I'm scared of dying but I want to die so badly. I dont want to hurt my mom. Her grandmother just died. I'm waiting until summer so she'll be over her grandmother and she wont be stressed from work. I keep wondering how you guys manage to stay alive, I guess the same way I manage. I'm a lot weaker though. Some of you guys plan decades ahead.
