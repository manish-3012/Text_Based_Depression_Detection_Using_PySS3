Husband cheated and dumped me after 15 years. Was doing good, but now.......guess why I'm on this sub!!!!! Yes life is sucking hard right now. He announced this all last month, and he moved out about three weeks ago. Since then I've been in therapy. I have a good support system and I'm actually enjoying living on my own. I thought I was doing okay.

But this past week, man....all I can think about it offing myself. I don't know what it is. It's like a repeating thought I can't get out of my head. I've been suicidal before but never attempted. Now it feels like I have a legit reason. I'm alone, the future ahead is gonna be rough, I'm not sure what comes next, I feel romantically unlovable. Plus the whole "my husband always loved someone more than me and the last 15 years might have been a lie" mindfuck.

It's such a strange feeling, because on one hand I'm curious about the future and I'm enjoying how I spend my time. Yet at times I feel this crushing despair and rejection and it seems like there is only one answer. I started on Zoloft (25 mg) about a month ago, so I'm not sure if that's helping or causing this. I definitely feel less anxious/OCD since starting it, so I think it's helping.
