Birthday forgottenToday was my birthday, everyone close to me seemed to have forgotten me maybe itâ€™s my fault for pushing them away but I have struggled and nobody seems to notice. I feel worthless and I donâ€™t enjoy my life anymore I have started to seek alcohol and drugs but they may have made it worse. Iâ€™m close to giving up as I despise myself too much to even look at myself in the mirror.
