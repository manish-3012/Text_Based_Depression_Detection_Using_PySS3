I feel like I'm going crazyI live in a shitty small town in the middle of nowhere and I never get to interact with anyone but my mom. I wish I was able to drive and had a car because I seriously never get any human interaction. There's nowhere to go in town to meet people and it's just awful every single day. I don't even really know how to talk to people anyways because of being here so long. The loneliness is just eating away at me and I wish I could have a social life.
