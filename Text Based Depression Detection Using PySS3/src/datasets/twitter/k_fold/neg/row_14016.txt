Why canâ€™t I be happy?A couple of days ago I got my A level results (UK â€œfinal resultsâ€). I was top of my year and got into my dream university to study a subject that I love. 

Objectively speaking, I should be happy. Yet here I am 4 days later having a panic attack. It sounds like a bit of a catch-22 situation: Iâ€™m sad at being sad. Nothing makes me happy. I feel like theres nothing I can ever be able to do to â€œfixâ€ myself. I feel like Iâ€™m at a dead end. 

Iâ€™ve heard all of the â€œits normal to feel sadâ€ crap. My attendance at school was 83%. Iâ€™d ditch lessons and spend hours sitting at a bench in front of a highway. Iâ€™d imagine my self getting hit by the cars passing by. It . Donâ€™t ever fucking tell me that thatâ€™s normal.

Iâ€™ve tried â€œfresh airâ€

Iâ€™ve tried â€œexerciseâ€ 

Iâ€™m starting to think that I cant be cured. 

I feel lonely. My friends never invite me anywhere. The only thing I do is go for runs and watch tv. It hurts whenever I pick up my phone and check for notifications, because I know nobodyâ€™s messaged. 

I should be happy, but Iâ€™m really not.
