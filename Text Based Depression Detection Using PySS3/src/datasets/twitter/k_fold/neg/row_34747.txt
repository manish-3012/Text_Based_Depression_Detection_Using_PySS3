Iâ€™ll never be a real woman.There isnâ€™t any point in me going on any longer. Iâ€™ll never be seen as a real woman by anyone else and Iâ€™ll never be happy with what I look like. Iâ€™ll never be anything other than a man that wants to be a woman or a woman that doesnâ€™t even look like one and I donâ€™t want that. Puberty has made it too late for me to successfully transition and I was never able to get on puberty blockers in time. At this point Iâ€™m simply waiting for the courage to finally kill myself.
