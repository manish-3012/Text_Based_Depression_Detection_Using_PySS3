Feeling Suicidal But Don't Want to BeI've been suicidal for a long time. I've attempted in the past. Right now I'm going through a hard time trying to take care of a friend who's just getting worse. I want to be able to support them properly, but at the same time I feel like I can't and I want to die, but I don't. I'm trying to reach out to professionals to ask how I could better help my friend during this... I don't know what to do. If I lose my friend then I'm dying too. I won't be able to handle it.
