I really don't knowI'm used to having down days and feeling shit. I have good and bad days like everyone else. But it seems like my bad days are so much worse the last couple of months, and that the good days are becoming more and more rare. I have an anxiety disorder and hereditary depression. I've been to therapists my whole life but it never helped. I'm 18 years old and I'm sitting my leaving cert this year which I am extremely unprepared for. I think I'm done with life. I've seen what it has to offer and I've tried what I wanted to try. I keep thinking about death and what might happen. I know my family would be sad, and it would have some affect on my friends, and that's what used to stop me from having these thoughts, but lately the  feelings I have seem to out weigh what I think they would feel. It's tough to explain. I just feel like my life is a waste and I want it to be done, and my family would be better off (one less mouth to feed) and my friends would get over it.
I really don't know why I'm posting this, think I'm just fucked up of feeling this way. Thanks for letting me vent I suppose.
