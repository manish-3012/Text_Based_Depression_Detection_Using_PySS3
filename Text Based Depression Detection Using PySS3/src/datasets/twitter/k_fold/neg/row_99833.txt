Every time I write something, it starts becoming my suicide note.I was on /r/raisedbynarcissists replying to a person's thread seeking and providing support. And I started typing a reply because their description of their lived experience of trauma seemed to match so much with mine. I really thought that I owed that post a reply. I spent an hour drafting that reply. Paralyzed by editing. Trying to make it all not sound like a bummer or laden with any traces of suicidal ideation so that I could appear supportive. 

It was going to be something to the effect of .... .. thanks for sharing ... blah blah blah ... anxiety depression maladjustment blah blah selective mutism ... blah. nmom and absent and then dead dad. Cultural normalization of parents' abusive behavior and erasure of male survivors in my part of the world ... damage done to their outer and inner self. ... loss of idea of healthy family... describing some of my own abuse.

I wrote long sentences with convoluted structure which followed that annoying should've-would've-could've trope to show that I was once a poor victim left unprotected like them. Which were then quickly devolving into short outbursts of phrases describing how much I have been isolating myself for the last many years. cutting off contact. wanting to kill myself. How i am killing myself. How I can't stop starving myself because I am deserving enough to buy my food but I am not deserving enough to eat it. Dying a slow death. 

If only my world could be at peace with my death, I would be very swift to do it.
