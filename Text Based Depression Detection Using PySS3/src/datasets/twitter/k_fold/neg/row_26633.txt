I can't take this anymoreAll I want to do now is die. I'm currently 17 and been bullied, abused and harassed by people at school and by family for about 11 or so years. I've alse been holding in my pain for about the same time and now I cannot take it anymore. I've been wanting to kill myself ever since I was back stabbed by someone I considered to be a close friend, and now its getting to the point where the thought of my death is joyful, but also scary at the same time. I don't know when I will kill myself but I hope its soon, because no one is supporting me and nothing has helped me.
