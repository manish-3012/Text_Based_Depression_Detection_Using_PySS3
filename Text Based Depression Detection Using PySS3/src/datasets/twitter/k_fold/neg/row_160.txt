In 2016 I was really sick, I wasnâ€™t supposed to survive. I really wish I hadnâ€™t. My pain would have been over then.In 2016 I had both MRSA and pneumonia at the same time. I spent a month in a room where people had to wear masks, face shields, aprons and gloves. Even when people came in to feed me. I didnâ€™t see faces for a month.

Each cough brought up blood and mucus. All those coughs, From the first to the last were like knives in my rib cage. After I was released I was coughing up junk for almost 2-3 weeks.

I was treated with large amounts of mucinex, prednisone, levofloxacin and inhaling water like it was air. I was on large doses of Narco with an anti nausea medication for the pain. Why didnâ€™t I die then?

I later found out I wasnâ€™t supposed to survive according to my doctors. 

It has lasting effects, Iâ€™m immune compromised, Iâ€™ve got scar tissue in my lungs. I wish Iâ€™d died. By dying then, so many things would have ended. Things world be peaceful.
