I have to end thisI'm so empty and alone.  I have nothing to get up for, nothing to live for, I tried to hang myself a few weeks ago and ended up just sitting on the floor with the noose round my neck for hours. l've kept going to work as I can't afford to go off, but I'm drowning, I really want to end it but I feel so tired. My gp put my meds up and I'm a 3 month waiting list for cbt. What's the point, I don't believe I can get better now and I don't believe anything can help me.

I have destroyed my family now they know I want to die, I' eve failed at everything I've ever done.  Every night I drink and smoke weed to block everything out.  You can't tell the people you love these feelings because=use it hurts them so much.  I just want to disappear, this well never end. I really need to finish it this weekend.
