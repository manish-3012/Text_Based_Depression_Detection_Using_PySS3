I'm AfraidI'm having pretty strong suicidal thoughts and I wish I could talk to someone about it without them looking at me like I'm crazy. 

I feel like I've got literally nobody in my life who supports me completely. My friends have stopped talking to me and one even outright said that I'm annoying. Then there's my family, I came out as gay to them a year ago and they're just pretending I never did. Even when I bring it up they say I'm messed up in the head just because of who I'm attracted to.
Part of the problem of why I've got no friends anymore is because I have social anxiety. I feel like I'll never have a meaningful connection with any other human, I'm just too awkward and different. I don't even know if anyone will miss me if I'm gone.

Sorry for my rambling, I've never really been good at organizing my thoughts
