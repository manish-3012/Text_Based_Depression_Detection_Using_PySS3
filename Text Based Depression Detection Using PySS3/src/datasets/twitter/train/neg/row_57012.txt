I'm really lostI've never been diagnosed by a doctor, but I've always been generally depressed my entire life. I'm 20 now, and I truly believe I have depression or something wrong with me. I started smoking weed in college because it helped me enjoy life and relax and not have anxiety take over my life. My girlfriend of 6 years found out and broke up with me. My parents found out and now they are threatening to cut me from the car and life insurance and won't talk to me, and I'm loosing so many friends because I'm having such a hard time trying to cope with all this crashing down on me at once. I feel alone and lost and I really don't have any motivation to try in life anymore. The only thing that makes me happy is smoking weed and nothing else. My grades are slipping because I have no personal drive in life and I just want to breakdown and cry. I know I'm ranting at this point but I just need some guidance and advice on what to do because I have nothing going for me at this point.
