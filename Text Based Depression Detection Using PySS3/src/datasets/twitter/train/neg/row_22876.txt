I feel like i've got everything, but life is still pointlessI have a girlfriend, an amazing family, great friends and i think i find life pointless.  I feel like i see things for the way they really are, just matter and chemicals clumped up together passing through time and it makes me feel as if life really is just a waste of the time in the most literal sense.  I've considered suicide just because of boredom.  I feel like in a sense im depressed.
