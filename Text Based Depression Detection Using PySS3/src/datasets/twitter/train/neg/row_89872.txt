I'm going to kill myself.I need someone to see this. I've always wanted to leave this world, having left some sort of positive mark, but I would like to say that I feel too much emotional pain/scarring to justify having to live another second.

&amp;#x200B;

I get it, no one chooses to be here and that life is so rare that we should make the most of it because (to our knowledge) we only get one chance at life. I really get it. But if we can't choose our birth I feel that we should at least choose the time and date for our death.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm completely hopeless, lonely, and tired. Maybe I haven't tried everything to feel even an ounce of happiness, but I'm so tired of this immense emotional pain I feel constantly. Seriously, I wish there was a way I could convey to someone how it feels; except that I wouldn't wish this pain on even my worst enemy.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no emotional support in my life. Didn't grow up with a dad. Practically grew up without a mom. The rest of my relatives lived across the ocean. At 14, I got the worse advice I've ever heard: "Be your own parent". I was so desperate for some sort of feeling of family that I followed it anyway -- it screwed me up and only drove a bigger rift between my mom and dad. It shaped who I am today. And I don't like who I am. Just thinking about who I am right now disgusts the flying fuck out of me. You don't understand.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried changing it. I saw a reddit comment once about how people should try to have a sense of being genuine, kind and having integrity; and I wanted to follow that. That was the type of person I really respected and wanted to follow. I've been trying. Every single day for almost 6 months now. I try to be what I want to see in the world. 

&amp;#x200B;

And yet I still have no substantial friends. No "family". No one to fall back on. Two of the people that actually gave a shit about me got pushed away because of my depression. Its too much.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried most things at this point. Therapy, sleeping better, eating better, just in general taking better care of myself. I've listened to podcasts and ted talks on mental health. I've read books on "emotional bandaging". 

&amp;#x200B;

Like I put in a real, solid effort.

&amp;#x200B;

But for a while now I've just felt like if I didn't exist, it would be so much better. It would help my mom, so that she wouldn't have to pay for my college anymore (which she lords over me every single day btw like i get it you could take away the money at anytime but fyi that doesnt help me feel good like why did you even offer to pay in the first place if this is what you were planning to do). She told me today that she could pay off her mortgage, give it to someone else because she **knows** they'll use it better, or use it to travel. Gee thanks I already feel like a disgusting piece of shit, thanks for reaffirming that I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then somehow it became about how I was so disrespectful to her in high school and I tried explaining why (5 years of emotional abuse made me lose respect for her as a parent causing me not to communicate with her at all. we were like roommates that didn't talk during that time.) Like yeah I get it,you didn't have a son, I'm sorry. But I didn't have a mom. You gave me all the material affection like food, clothes and a roof. And yeah my situation could be so much worse. But I would trade for a worse circumstance for a more loving mother. Any time I was emotionally hurt she would just give me advice or cut me off because she had no patience to hear what I had to say.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried explaining to her how it was for me. I know how it was for her. But I don't think she understands or even wants to understand how it was like for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no one to send this to. I wish I did. I wish I had someone I could send this to and they would come pick me up and talk to me. I wish we could drive to the mountains where the road is windy and listen to some chill lo-fi trap or some other millennial shit. I want a friend who cares. I think that would give me at least an ounce of hope to live.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to feel that comfort. But I don't have anyone like that. For a long while now. It sucks feeling alone, feeling these feelings, and having no one to share it with. I get it, it's a lot of emotional baggage -- and I have a lot. But it would really help.

&amp;#x200B;

Im so sad lol. Im crying as I type this. I'm so hopeless.

&amp;#x200B;

Fighting with my mom was what triggered me. I wish it wasn't. But I'm done. I've had enough. Sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading it, if you did. Knowing that someone read a piece of my story is enough for me to move on.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I'm going to kill myself. Somehow, someway.
