I have a good reason to dieI may go to jail for a sex crime (not child molestation or rape), register as a sex offender, lose my status with my community, lose my career and I will still struggle with indecent thoughts, depression and be ostracized by my family. Oh and be broke and most likely homeless. At least if I die, I will die a free man who people will pity but not hate me. I will be able to leave money to my mom and die with the shameful secret that I fucked up because I am a fucked person. Besides, it's not like suicide wasn't on the table for some time so at least I can blame that. And yes, I have an amazing lawyer and spent years in therapy.
