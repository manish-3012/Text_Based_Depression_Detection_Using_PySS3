My mind is flooding againI want to have kids within 5 years but i dont know what to do about it. I feel like im too far behind on anyone else. I also hate the idea they are going to stop treating me and iâ€™m going to be a waste of money. I feel disposable, like nothing i do is going to help. Iâ€™m not taken serious enough and everyone stopped caring about me. I dont know how to change my life, but i am so worried about everything. Itâ€™s all so difficult to cope with, i wish i had realized earlier how important education is bc now i cant go back. Thats it; i cant go back. I donâ€™t want to go forward either. I just want to have it all.
