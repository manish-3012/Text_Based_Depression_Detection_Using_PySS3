My life sucks17 years old (M) 2.3 GPA, (about to get lower) My depression started after I was put in a special math class in school 2 years ago. I absolutely hate school. I have a few ok friends, rarely go out, no mom (died when I was 3) family stress me out, dad expects to much out of me, stepmom is a gold digger with mental problems, moved away from a city I liked years ago, now I go to school with a bunch of stuck up rich kids that are good at everything, and I really hate my school and the district. I have a huge crush on a popular girl in my grade way out of my league, like WAY out. Iâ€™m naturally very quiet, introverted and Iâ€™m very lazy with no ambition. I have recently been diagnosed with adhd. I get anxiety over everything. I hate my voice, and I find it hard to talk. I also hate my name it sounds weird. I donâ€™t want to college but itâ€™s one of those things society forces is to do to be successful. I donâ€™t want to go to CC or get a job after HS. Iâ€™m kind of considering the military but I donâ€™t like being yelled at. Is life really worth it this point? I have no idea what to fucking do I donâ€™t see myself getting past 20
