All I want for my birthday is to dieI wish I had the guts to do it myself. All I can do is hope that I get hit by a car or murdered by a stranger. I hope for these things every day. My friends think I'm just reckless or careless when I cross into the street without care, but I'm really hoping a car will finally put me out of this misery.

Everything just gets worse and worse every single year. This year is already worse than last year, and last year was worse than the year before. Just a downhill run until I'm too old to even walk out into the street any more, old and sick and broke and lonely and worthless.

Another year older and another day closer to the end of this worthless existence. Do me a favor, if you see someone in the street, just run him the fuck over and don't stop.
