Ruined my career, ruined my life, haunted by it every night and day.I made a terrible mistake last year. Essentially ruined my career. I feel so ashamed. The situation got away from me and I was scared and couldn't admit the truth to myself and I completely screwed up. And I've been swallowing it for the last year and every damn day it's hanging over my head and making me miserable. And every night I have bad dreams or wake up in a sweat and can't sleep. And its getting worse. I'm falling apart worse than I could've thought. I really don't know what to do. I can't keep descending like this. I thought it would heal with time or that I could man up and get over it, but I'm so screwed up instead. Not sure where to turn - this forum is the easiest.
