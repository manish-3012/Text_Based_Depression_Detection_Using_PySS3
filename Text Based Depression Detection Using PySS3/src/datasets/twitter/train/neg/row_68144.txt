Someone tell me what to do pleaseI donâ€™t know anymore, Iâ€™ve tried everything:Iâ€™ve quite school Iâ€™ve done therapy Iâ€™ve been on medication for weeks and Iâ€™m not better.
I have a few good friends and I try to protect them from how bad I feel but I know that they tired of me ranting about the same things now and itâ€™s having an effect on them.
I know that my friends would be better off without me and Iâ€™m so so close to killing myself but I donâ€™t really want to go because I still enjoy myself every now and then. It just hurts so much to see my problems affect my friends and to see them drifting away.
I donâ€™t know how to get better and Iâ€™m so tired of almost everything.
Please help me
