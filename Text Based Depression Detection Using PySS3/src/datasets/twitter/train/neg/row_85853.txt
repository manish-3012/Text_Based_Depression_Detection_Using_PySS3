Something inside me (M23) wants to kill myself and I donâ€™t know what to doFor a couple of years now, Iâ€™ve been having thoughts about killing myself and recently theyâ€™ve been getting to the point where I think it might happen. Thereâ€™s also a tiny part of me that keeps subtly trying to reach out for help but I always diffuse it before I ever get to the point of talking to someone about it, which is why Iâ€™m writing this post. 

When I was 18 (now 23), I developed a gambling addiction (blackjack and roulette) and over the past 5 years Iâ€™ve lost my six figure family savings because of it. Iâ€™m now 2 months without any gambling and have only Â£5000 left of debt to pay off but I feel like my history with the addiction is still continuing to mess with my head. This is still only part of whatâ€™s going on in my head so to avoid going off on too many tangents, Iâ€™ll leave this part here but can discuss more in the comments.

For as long as I can remember, Iâ€™ve never been happy with myself. Iâ€™m a 23 year old guy but Iâ€™m 5â€™4â€, look about 12 and I donâ€™t have the personality to make up for it. Because of this, I always had a history of lying and making stuff up in a desperate effort to try and get people to like me. Iâ€™ve always had a group of friends but Iâ€™ve always felt like an outsider within our friendship group, constantly feeling like theyâ€™re saying one thing to my face but not actually liking me.

Fast forward to just over a year ago, I got a decent graphic design job, in a nearby city. Because of this job, I moved away from my parents and in with a friend from school whoâ€™s a bartender in the city. My works going incredibly well and I currently think itâ€™s the only thing thatâ€™s keeping me alive. Iâ€™ve made new friends with a couple of the people I work with and itâ€™s the first time that I feel like people genuinely want to be with me. Thereâ€™s one that I get on with particularly well and Iâ€™ve tried subtly reaching out to him to ask for help but I always stop myself before it gets anywhere. I recently mentioned it to him when I was drunk and the next day he told me that if I was serious then he was there to talk to but I just responded saying that I say a lot of stuff when Iâ€™m drunk and not to worry about it.

Due to my flat mate working opposite hours to me, whenever Iâ€™m at home Iâ€™m on my own. Iâ€™ve been staying at the previously mentioned friends because â€˜itâ€™s convenient for work and we get to hang outâ€™ but realistically Iâ€™m just staying there at the moment because Iâ€™m scared of what Iâ€™ll do when Iâ€™m on my own. Iâ€™ve been throwing myself into my work and working hours later than Iâ€™m supposed to because when Iâ€™m concentrating on my work then my mind forgets about everything else and itâ€™s almost blissful. 

Iâ€™m not entirely sure of the reason for this post but I think I just wanted to write it down and get it out there, even if the people who know me donâ€™t find out. I think part of me is looking for advice and support but thereâ€™s also part of me thatâ€™s looking for the motivation to do it and that scares me.

TL;DR suicidal thoughts are fighting with the part of me that wants to get help.
