I don't want to be here anymore.No use in a throwaway because who gives a fuck about me anyway?

I have nothing. No job prospects, I'm disabled due to arthritis, I can't work, I barely scraped by through university (do not comment saying how I got through it anyway - I did fucking shit and telling me otherwise makes it worse, sorry. I did shit at uni. I'm embarrassed.) I don't want to live. There's no help for me out there.

Seriously, what's the fucking point in life? All I get is bitching that I don't want to work and can't work and that the only thing i'll be better off doing is dying, but they say that I'm being selfish in the same breath as calling me an entitled millennial. I'm too fucking scared to do it myself so I'm waiting to get hit by a car or something so I can just finally die in peace.
