Why do I have to live for somebody else?I know I'm selfish and I don't need to be told so again but what is the point anymore. My mother is terrified of losing me and it breaks my heart when she cries over me and because of her reaction I can't help but think about my grandparents and how they would react. I don't want to be here anymore but I have to stay because if I don't they might break just like I did. But why, why do I have to worry about this? Why do I have to keep suffering because of this? I know I sound like a shitty person and that's because I am, I know that it would be terrible of me to do this to them but why do I have to suffer because of that? Why is it like this? I just want to kill myself so badly but when I think of my mother crying I just can't do it, at least not yet.  


*I already know that there is an individual that loves me that will be reading this post and I'll be getting tons of worried messages when I wake up... to this person I love you and appreciate the concern but I'm just trying to talk more rn instead of actually take action &lt;3*
