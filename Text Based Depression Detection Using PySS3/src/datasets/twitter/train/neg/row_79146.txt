On DemonsSo I posted here a couple of days ago when it was getting really bad. The act of posting helped; getting all the thoughts out of me, putting them down, sending them out to be acknowledged by strangers who didn't know me but still cared. It was all good. I was feeling better.

But I was never *really* at risk. Like I said at the start; I can't kill myself. I have an SO who would be devastated.

I shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't have told myself I had a reason. Because that gave this rot inside me something to work against, almost like I'd challenged it. Like it is awake and alive, not just a quirk of brain chemistry; something that hates me. *Hates* me.

And it's so persuasive.

I can't kill myself. It would hurt my partner, who loves me.

*Why do they love you?*

I don't know. I just know they do.

*You used to be so good. So capable. So full.* ***That's*** *who they love.*

I can get better. I can be that person again.

*You can't. You know you can't.*

But dying now would hurt them so badly.

*Better a quick pain now than forcing them to watch you rot away into nothing. Better to do it while they still love you, when they'll still have good memories of you that you haven't poisoned.*

That's wrong. That's distorted thinking. That's the depression talking. I know all that.

But I can't *stop it.* I was seeking help, talking to my professors about the situation, figuring out a way to get through intact. Hadn't talked to all of them.

Still haven't. Just gave up, stopped turning in homework, not going to show up for the final, going to get a failing grade. Lying to the people asking me if I've talked to them yet, saying it's all worked out.

So I don't have anything to come back to.

*So you don't dare waste everyone's time again the next time you think you deserve it.*

It used to (according to hearsay) be a common thought that mental illness was caused by demonic possession. A perverse, evil intelligence that slips into your head and forces you to do awful things. 

I thought that was silly, once.

But I am watching myself carefully ruin my own life, cut off all avenues of support, deny myself my reasons to stay alive, and I *can't stop it.* Why? What kind of misfire in a functioning brain can cause it to seek death with *purpose?*

I have a plan, now. The right combination of drugs and alcohol to overcome my pain threshold before I chicken out, the best way to do it while minimizing pain and distress in innocent bystanders, what my notes might say. It'll be a while before I actually have the tools to follow through, and I think there's enough of me left to check in to a hospital before it goes that far. I don't know for sure. I can't really control it anymore.

Now, a note for the reader; thank you. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to listen and to reach out to people who are hurting. 

Please remember this. Remember what is happening to me. Remember that I am a person fighting a disease so intense it seems easier to think I am possessed by actual evil. Whatever happens to me, please use this; this little slice of clarity I've wrested away from it. Tell people this is what it's like. Use it to help others, to show them you understand.

There is enough of me left that I will find a way to make this useful. It can't take that from me.

***It can't take that from me.***
