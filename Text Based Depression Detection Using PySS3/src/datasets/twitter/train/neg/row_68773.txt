I hate my nose bump and large nostrils, I hate the very visible sebum on my nose, I hate the black heads on my nose, I hate the small bumps on my forehead, I hate my boring dark brown/black eye color, I hate my pathetic height (165 cm or 5.5, the average height for men where I live is 182 or 6 feet and for women it is 168 cm or 5.6), I hate my hairy legs, I'm ashamed of my ethnicity (I'm Arab), I hate my extremely dry scalp, hair, skin and lips, I hate the small moles on my face, I hate my small hands, I hate my light brown skin color, I hate my chest, back and shoulder acne, I hate my physique, I hate my big teeth, I hate how i look in pictures, I hate my thin and short penis, I hate my weight i feel fat 64 kg or 141 lb. No one has ever told me I'm attractive, no one has had a crush on me (I pay attention to my surroundings and no one looks). I hate my genetics and I'm afraid of having ugly children, i think my bloodline has to die out. I'm considering suicide.
