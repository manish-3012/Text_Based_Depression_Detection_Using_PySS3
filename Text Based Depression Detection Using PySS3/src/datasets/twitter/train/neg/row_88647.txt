I feel like Iâ€™ll never amount to anything. All the more reason to just do it already.I had to withdraw from cosmetology school because I canâ€™t afford gas to get there, I dropped out of college a year ago bc of depression, I canâ€™t find a job that I can support myself with, Iâ€™m $4000 in debt, and I canâ€™t find anyone worth sharing my time with. All of my other friends graduated with bachelors degrees or are still in school despite their mental illness and all have stable jobs and loving families. I just moved away from my toxic and abusive parents but Iâ€™ve done nothing but fail ever since. I hate my life and everything about it. Nothing good will ever come from me. Iâ€™m miserable and I just want to end it already.
