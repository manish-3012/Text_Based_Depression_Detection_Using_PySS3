I'm literally counting down the daysI don't know where I'll live next month, or if I'll still have anyone left in my life. I'm horribly short on rent which is due in two days. My boyfriend is going to leave me and I will only have the choice between completely miserable living situations or homelessness. I think it's probably just going to be time to check out. People like me are meant to be left behind I guess.
