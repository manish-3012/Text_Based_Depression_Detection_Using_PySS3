Not doing okay.Today I'm not doing ok. I'm afraid that I am going to hurt myself. I've prayed, reached out but to me its evident that maybe I'm just not worthy enough to live. Cant find work, cant get unemployment, cant get help.  My emotional support dog died, my grandmother died.  Things have been going downhill, lost job, cant find new one. Get told repeatedly that I'm not qualified or that I dont have degree. My house will be foreclosed on, my car repod. So, what do I have to stay here for? The urge to hurt myself right now is over shadowing any good reason I have to wake up for tomorrow's crap. I don't have the energy to face another day like today. And I cant help my race, age or the fact that I worked my way up in a job that replaced me with a mgrs son.
