Morning vibesLaying bed listening to Joji and wishing I just didnâ€™t live on this Earth. Iâ€™m just so tired of existing. The stress is unbearable I donâ€™t know what to do. Just fucking venting on my phone because it sucks. Reasons to not off myself; 1) my sister moved in with my for university, 2) my mother.
