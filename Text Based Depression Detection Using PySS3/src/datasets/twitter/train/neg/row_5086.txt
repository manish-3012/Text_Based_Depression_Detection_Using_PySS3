Hello, fellow suicidal humansI will be fine once I have sobered up and continue living my loser life but can you imagine just not existing? How great would that be? I had to have an operation when I was a child and I was put under for like 8 hours in which I was completely unconscious. That's what death feels like. It's incredible. I do have a family so I can't do anything but not existing is incredible. I look forward to living my life working minimum wage jobs and being ugly.

Edit: When I say family I don't mean wife and kids I mean my siblings and parents. I am single and childless.
