I think I'm going to do it; right now. Someone give me a reason why I shouldn't.I don't find anything useful or worthwhile in this life. I have hobbies and I have interests; ironically enough neither interest me anymore. I used to write poetry or paint pictures to express how I felt, get it down on paper, to make up for my lack of worthwhile relationships, social skills, simple pleasures. That coping method doesn't work so well anymore. So I buried my nose down in school and found a job, just to keep myself entertained and away from my darker thoughts. But I hate my job and I hate each hour that builds up to another shift again and again. I hate school and having to see the one person who actually means something to me and I mean something to, and I hate seeing him because every moment I spend with him I stress my nerves out worrying he doesn't like me, doesn't want to be with me, thinks incredibly little of me. 

I'm here now, in the park with a long enough rope. And this is my final call for help; is there anything worth staying alive for in this dry, empty, meaningless world? I don't want to be alive anymore if there is nothing more than this tireless charade.
