Tonight, I make the decision I think tonight, after work, is when the decision shall be made.  I have found that my family does not really like me and with a big family event coming up, it would be the perfect time.  

I have considered the pain it would cause others, but I almost think it would be worth it.  Maybe then they would see how much they either miss me, or would go on fine without me.  I contribute nothing to this household, sure I am thankful they let me live here still (In college), but I am not happy.

I have had a plan or sorts in the works for sometime now, and I think about it almost every single day.  I have no other place to turn, sharing these thoughts does not make me feel any better.  Talking to people just makes me feel guilty and it is really something that I need to overcome by myself.

If all goes well, I will leave tonight and go on an adventure of sorts.  The destination being end.  I have had those days in which I say "I will wait 24 hours" and have, but the next day is never any better than the day before.  It is the same old same old and life has become pointless.  Go to class, get a degree, work some more (Been working part-time for the last four years), go to job A, job B, sleep, repeat.  After college the outlook is even worse, go to cubicle, stair at grey walls all day, sleep, repeat.  That is not the life I want to live but it is one I need to live to get by.  

Late tonight, I buy a pack of smokes, write a note, get in my car, and drive.
