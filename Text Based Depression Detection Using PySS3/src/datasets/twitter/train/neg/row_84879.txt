I dont know what to do.Hello Reddit, my name is Chris, i'm a 26 years old male from central europe and my life is a complete mess since years and i dont how to break free from this. I'm socially isolated without any friends or atleast someone that cares about me, there is no one in my life. My life is lonely and empty, without any colour or light. This went on for so long and i dont know how much more i can take. I dont know how to make it through this night, there is nothing in my life that could stop me, nothing but emptyness. I dont know what to do, i dont know where to go from here. 
I was so often at this very point, broken down, crying, at the edge of living and i always tell myself "it will get better some day" or" this is not the right way" but i dont know who long i can fool myself and for what. Why do i still live?
