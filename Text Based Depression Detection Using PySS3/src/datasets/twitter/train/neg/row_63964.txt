I can't take being alive anymore.I genuinely thought I was going to end my life the last time I posted here- and I'm disappointed that I didn't. I don't want to pretend like things have gotten better and I'm magically fine or whatever, because things have only really gotten worse.

Basically, I've lost two friends. One because she was upset about how much time I was spending with another person. The other person hasn't contacted me in days, and shows no interest in talking to me. I'm usually the one that reaches out, but now it sort of feels like it should be an equal amount of effort.

I'm disappointed, because I really felt that I could trust these people. From now on, I really don't feel that I'll be able to share how I'm feeling with them or anyone.

I'm not doing so great with eating, either. I'm currently having around 300 calories a day, but it still feels like too much. I'm exercising to the point of passing out and I still can't see an improvement. It hurts, honestly, because I spend almost all my time on the Internet with people that bring me down. I know I should stop but I just keep slipping.

I think it would just be easier if I wasn't ever born- it would save everybody a hell of a lot of trouble. I'm an accident and I know I'll never amount to anything.
