Death will be my deliverance.I realized recently that I was never properly socialized. I cannot deal with other people in the real world. I keep ending up on the street getting fired from job after job. I don't know how to bond with others. Since my last family member died, I've been alone. There was never anyone there for me so I never bonded with anyone after that. Now that I'm in my 30's there's no turning back. I've tried every single therapists in this town and none of them were able to communicate with me. I'm so withdrawn I am beyond hope.

I tried to fix this but am unable to. Panic set in when I realized there would be no advancement in my life from here on out. When I'm 80, I'll be at the same level as I was when I was 13. Nothing will get better. It's a lifetime of rejection.

The panic faded when I realized there is a way to end this. I have enough rope and there is a tree where I can go hang myself.

This is good bye reddit. I was amazed at how many of you could just walk out into the real world and get jobs or go to school. Get married and have families.

This world lost me 17 years ago when I lost my last family member. My days of isolation are behind me now. I look forward to ending it all.
