Need help on motivationI have tried a couple of times to kill myself but theres always that animal instinct of preservation that kicks in.

I have gone through the usual avenues of trying to sort out my mental health, drugs, therapy etc but I find that they only keep me in a state of ignorance, Or keep me able to forget my problems.

I feel sick, I dont know who I am anymore, I feel like i treat those around me poorly and am never able to live up to their expectations of me. I feel like I trick people into liking a manufactured image of myself and that it is only a matter of time before the truth comes out.

Theres also my sexuality which I feel is an unfixable problem. I dont want to be gay. I feel like i didnt choose this and it makes me sick to be honest. I have no issue with other LGBT people, in fact I am fiercely envious of people able to accept themselves for who they really are.

The purpose of this post Is that I am looking for a suicide support group/board. I understand this upsets some people but save your time please. 
Has anyone had any success in accessing these forums? Iâ€™m in australia which has blocked access to most. I understand a VPN will probs work but i still need the name of the website.

Thanks for your time
