I just want to be free.Itâ€™s been a long time since Iâ€™ve felt genuinely good. Lately I have felt more down than usual. My mom passed when I was 11, and my dad didnâ€™t acknowledge how I felt and told me â€œYouâ€™re a SwiftPickleLicker. Youâ€™ll be fine.â€ Now Iâ€™m early 20s. 

I had to learn how to cope on my own. I never quite figured out how to cope in a healthy way. I funneled all of my energy into video games. Now I have 2 kids, a wife, so I should be happy, right? But truthfully over years Iâ€™ve just declined steadily more and more, and Iâ€™ve been no more than just a shell of myself for years. I donâ€™t feel anything but sadness. Very rarely do I feel joy. 

I have to put on a mask on a day to day basis.. and itâ€™s draining me. Iâ€™ve contemplated many times, how easily I could be free from all of my Earthly problems.. my wife always tries to help, but she doesnâ€™t know how to. And neither do I. 

The only time I went for help about 7 months ago. The lady told me Iâ€™m a liar. Iâ€™m a manipulator. If I was depressed I would have already killed myself. I was shocked. It just further rooted in me that people wonâ€™t understand me. That I have to hide it. Fake it til you make it.. right? 

Lately Iâ€™ve been thinking hard on one thing.. just driving my motorcycle straight into a big truck. Maybe a brick wall. I donâ€™t know. Anything. Will I do it? I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m not afraid to.. I get excited.. my adrenaline starts pumping and I get such a rush. Iâ€™m in the lowest point I have ever felt in my life. And it seems to just get worse every day.. so who knows. I just want to be free.
