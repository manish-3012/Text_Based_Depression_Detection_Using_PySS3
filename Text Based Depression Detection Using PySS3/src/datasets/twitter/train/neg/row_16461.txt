I've been planning to kill myself in the next few months.It's not like I hate life. My life could be worse. I'm just tired of life. It isnt for everyone, definitely not for me. I would say suicide was linked to my depression but I dont think it's not. I think earlier in life when I wanted to kill myself, it probably was depression. But now it's like theres no cause to it. I mean I've always been suicidal. For the last 9 years I think it's been. Cant remember a time when I dont think about killing myself. It's just the self control that stops me from doing it. But death is beautiful and I would like to experience it fully. I dont want to be resuscitated again. I want to experience death fully. Why does everyone have a problem with that?
