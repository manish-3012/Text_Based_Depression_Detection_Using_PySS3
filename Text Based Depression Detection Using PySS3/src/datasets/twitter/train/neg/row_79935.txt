can i please catch a fucking BREAKmoved to the frozen northland from the deep deep south of texas to jump start my transition in nov, finally now, i FINALLY got insurance like, two days ago and was planning on making a phone call to the gender clinic soon..... except that i immediately today got a massive case of flu; sore throat, nausea + vomiting, phlegm, coughing, muscle aches all that good shit; and had to call off for the third time in two months cuz heyyyyy I can't do a warehouse job with this shit happening right now. 

first call out was for a work-related accident; one they STILL ARENT diagnosing and has been giving me daily pain from a 4-7 on the pain scale since it happened
Second was because our fucking car wouldn't start in -46F weather and heck, at least i wasn't the only one but now we got to replace our car ON TOP OF everything else

and now this shit.

can i please just get off this fucking ride. can i please just fucking be done. can the universe just give me one good fucking thing without yanking it out of my damned hands? if i lose the job i lose the insurance i lose the paycheck and i lose my transition for like the eighth time since i came out in fuckin' 2011.

i just want it to be over i don't need to struggle this hard just to exist
