I almost did it today.I got a plastic bag and put it over my head. Just before i slipped away, when things got fuzzy, I took the bag off. I cried for about 20 minutes, my friends were in the adjacent room. I don't know what to do. I haven an appointment for a therapist, but I don't know if I can make it. I'm exhausted, emotionally, physically, mentally. I can't cope anymore. I can't pull myself up.
