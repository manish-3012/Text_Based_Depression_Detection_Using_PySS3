Parental suicide?I've read the terrible articles about the effects of parental suicide (especially maternal) on kids. But is it really better to grow up with a depressed mom than one who commits suicide when the child is young? My daughter is 4 now and is much more aware of her surroundings. Am I doing more harm than good by staying alive but depressed around her? I want her to have a good life and, as difficult as it is to say, I think it could be better without me in it.
