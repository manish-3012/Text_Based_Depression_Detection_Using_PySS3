not even sure why i'm posting hereI spend hours on end fantasizing about eternal sleep. Sometimes I can even taste the metal of the barrel of the gun in my mouth.

I have the best life and yet I am so bitterly unhappy. I have a child, a partner, a full bank account and a roof over my head. A steady job, I'm a good student, but I just don't care.

All I ever am, truly, is disappointed. Bitter. I am sick and tired of feeling sick and tired and I just want to sleep, forever.
