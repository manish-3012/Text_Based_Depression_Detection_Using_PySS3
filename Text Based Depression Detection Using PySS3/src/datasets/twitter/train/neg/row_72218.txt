I'm tired of people seeing me being suicidal as their failureI'm suffering and in pain, I'm depressed. I have issues behind my loved one's comprehension. Even those with their own issues don't have the same issues, we all suffer differently. 

I know if I die those that care about me will be in pain and I do feel guilt for that now but it's not that they failed me. These are my issues. This is my pain. They didn't fail me. 

I can't explain my feelings to them because there aren't words to convey them properly. I understand the sadness they'll feel, the pain but why feel like failures? If I want freedom then they didn't fail me...
