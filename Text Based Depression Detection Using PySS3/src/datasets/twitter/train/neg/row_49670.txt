Not sure where to post this. I'm not dealing with self harm, rather really wanting to kill other people. I sometimes kill small animals and rodents but I feel empathy and feel really bad and regretful after doing it. But part of me sort of gets off on these feelings of empathy/remorse as they sort of remind me that I'm still alive. And those feelings of remorse are so strong that they are almost like taking a drug. So I keep doing it. 

These feeling are driving me to fantasize and plan out killing random people, what it would feel like, and what I'd do to hide the bodies and everything. Really elaborate stuff. 

Now I don't think I could actually do this. I live with my dad still, and I think the rush would be way too fucking much to handle. But the mere thought that I may do this to another human is terrifying. 

talk to me.
