Am i wrong in the head?I dreamt that i cut my wrists in the bathroom and painted 'this is your fault' for all my family and 'friends' to see. My mom finds my cold, lifeless body on the tiles, and fantasize her reaction. But All she would care about is the mess. I create different images in my head of this scene. Its slightly different, ie the person finds me. I just want this dream to become a reality
