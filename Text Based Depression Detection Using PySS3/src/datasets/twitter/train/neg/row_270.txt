16, posted earlier. thank youiâ€™m still here, you all left me thinking. i may feel numb and paralyzed in bed right now because i am so depressed, and so suicidal. i may feel like i can never be as happy as i was the past few weeks. hell, i feel like i donâ€™t deserve to be happy. but you all made me feel like i should drag myself along a little longer and try to pick myself up. what is the first step in believing you deserve happiness, and where do i go from there? thanks to this community again, i would not be alive if i didnâ€™t decide to say something here earlier
