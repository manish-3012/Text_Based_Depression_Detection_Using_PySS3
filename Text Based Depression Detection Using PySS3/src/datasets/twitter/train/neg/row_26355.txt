Yup definitely killing myself within the next few yearsGenuinely cant bare to live. I've seen so many horrible things and been through hell. Whats the point, I'm alone. Always lonely, sad. I really dont like the cards I was given. I'm so upset. Its very hard for me to function in everyday life, I have active panic attacks. I cant ever walk into a school without getting a panic attack. Ive done so much stupid shit in my life. I feel like not living anymore. I can't kill myself yet because I owe money on my car and I don't want my family to get fucked because of me. Everyone around me is going to university, have girlfriends, happy. I have no real friends, no money, no social life because I cant talk to people. I really fucked up on my Snapchat. I got drunk and posted a lot of stupid shit. Feel stupid as hell. Roughly 3/4 of the population only cares about themselves. I literally dont see the point of life.
