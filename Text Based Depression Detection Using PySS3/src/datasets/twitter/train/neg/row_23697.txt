Losing friendsIâ€™m about to go to college in 2 months, and life is pretty shitty. I know transitions are always hard, so please donâ€™t comment that. My boyfriend, who was a very close person in my life, has a new girlfriend and it sucks. I hate thinking about him with someone else, especially since I know he still has feelings for me. He was a close friend too, so Iâ€™m feeling that emptiness as well. I think I lost another close friend. Weâ€™ve drifted apart since Iâ€™m a year older and very clingy, which basically drove him away. All of my mistakes are catching up to me and Iâ€™m losing friends because of it. It sucks and I really have only one person to confide in, and they arenâ€™t readily available. I know transitions are hard, but I donâ€™t even have anyone to support me through it. My support system is falling apart and itâ€™s my fault.
