I'm going to hurt someone. This is just a way of making sure I don't.I'm not a thief or a gambler. I'm not a drunk or druggie. I'm not a murderer or rapist. I'm not anything bad.

But i am weak. And I know almost without question that one day, I'll become on of those things, and I won't care about recovery, or rehab, or therapy, or whatever. i'll be content with my vice. i'll be a horrible person. and it will hurt people. everyone will be disgusted with me or hate me or just not want me around. and they'll be right.

suicide is just becoming a way (partially) that makes sure I'll never go that far.
