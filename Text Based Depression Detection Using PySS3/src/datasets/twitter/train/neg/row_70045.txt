Is there anyone who can talk?Iâ€™m off my meds right now because they got more expensive and I ran out. Iâ€™m feeling extremely suicidal. I need someone who can keep me distracted on my drive home.  I donâ€™t want to die but I feel like I have to. I donâ€™t want to feel like this.  I just want the feelings to stop. I want to love myself again.
