I want to die but I don't have the courageEarly last year I was diagnosed with anorexia which led on to depression. I was put on meds for about a year and put my family through so much bad shit. I've fallen back into a deep hole and I can't climb out this time.

I can't talk to my parents because they're just gonna tell a therapist and I'll be spending half my time under constant supervision to make sure I don't get rid of myself and in a scary therapist's room. I don't want to go back onto meds either.

The fact is that I'm having a negative effect on everyone I come into contact with. My parents call me a disappointment and I know why. I get extreme anxiety when it comes to homework, which leads to me not doing it and getting bad grades. I constantly embarrass myself and even my coping mechanisms make me cringe with embarrassment.

No one loves me. I can't find the right person for me and when I think I have, it's over in a week. Some of my friends are really nice to me but others seem to hate me and constantly verbally abuse me for being bi. I want to die and take them all with me.

Alcohol numbs the pain for a short period of time, but just makes me worse after a while. I constantly injure myself when I'm angry: I nearly broke my hand punching a door and my throat is constantly sore from screaming into my pillow.

Over the last few days I've spent pretty much all of my time lying in my bed in darkness, contemplating life and whether to kill myself or not. From a biological point of view, the point of life is to reproduce and I know that will never happen, so why don't I just end it now? From a spiritual point of view, it's to enjoy life, and I can't do that so I may as well be culled now.

I'm so much of a pussy that I can't decide how or when I'll do it. I think my parents will care but they'll forget after a bit. I won't be able to have a successful life so why don't I just end it?
