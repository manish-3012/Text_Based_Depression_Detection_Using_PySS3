My relationship with a suicidal/depressed girlfriend.Hello everybody, I'm not an English native speaker so apologize if I make mistakes. I've been with my girlfriend for 8 months. About 15 days after our first date, she attempted suicide. While we were at party with a tenth of friends, I found her hung out to a tree and I saved her life, if i had arrived like two minutes later it would have been too late. At this time, I really hesitated on if I had to stay with her or not, but since I was almost the only person she had to talk to, I stayed for her own good. Eventually, I fell even more in love with her. I talked to her as much as I could about her problems and found out it wasnt the first time she did that, she already tried to end her life. Those mental concerns were related to a, well i won't measure my words, kind of rape she lived while she was 15.
Months have been passing and she seemed to be happier, even if she had her downtimes, I thought it was going better. But these last two weeks have been a pain for me, she has been repeating me that no one loves her, and we argued for nothing and she threatenned me to do it again since she was useless. I've just spent a week-end with her and even if everything was good, at the end she went totally crazy for a detail about in who's car she had to go to get home and she yelled at me. I met her one hour ago and told her she was making me crazy, that I loved her but she's making me suffering more than anything else.
She saw a psychologist several times because she almost doesnt want to talk to me about what bothers her. At this point, I don't know what to do. I really love her and I cried a lot when I told her I would break up, but on the other hand I can't know if I can trust her and if she can heal up from her mental problems... So, what do you think ?
TL:DR I am hesitating on breaking up with a girl who is mentally instable and already attempted to suicide herself.
