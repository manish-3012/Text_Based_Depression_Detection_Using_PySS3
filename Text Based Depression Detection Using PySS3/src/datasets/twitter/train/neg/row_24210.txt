Not all problems all temporary.I canâ€™t go back. I canâ€™t fix the things I did. Iâ€™ll always be hated for it and I canâ€™t change it. My past will never leave me alone. 

Iâ€™ll have my bachelors degree in a few weeks. Thatâ€™ll be my last accomplishment because I know I wonâ€™t be able to do anything else of merit. 

I hope I have the courage to go through with it this time instead of living the same worn out life.

Thanks for listening again.
