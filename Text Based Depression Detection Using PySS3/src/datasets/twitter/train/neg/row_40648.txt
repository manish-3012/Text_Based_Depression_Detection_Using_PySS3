Iâ€™m really scaredI canâ€™t seem to get myself help. Every time I do I give up. Iâ€™m unmedicated bipolar. Meds just donâ€™t work. Iâ€™m planning on doing it tonight. Last night I kept having panic attacks that jolted me awake ...they made it feel like I could not breathe. I kept waking up my fiancÃ© and I felt so bad. Today I feel very out of it and numb. My head hurts. Iâ€™m very scared. I guess I just want someone to be with me while I go through this until the end. Please tell me itâ€™s going to be okay.
