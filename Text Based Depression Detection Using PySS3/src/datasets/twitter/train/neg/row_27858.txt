I cant do it anymoreTo other people my life looks easy.. quit my job (and money/insurance), live with my mom (ashamed of it), enrolled in a nice college (havent done work since spring break)... it looks like i have an easy life but i hate myself. I've been depressed since I was a kid but learned to hide it really well. I'll be four years clean in may but every day I think about dropping everything to go buy some heroin and just die. I dont want to die, I'm terrified of killing myself, but I cant live in my head anymore. Every thing I do, every thing I say, is followed by a loud, intrusive voice telling me what a fat, stupid, lazy burden I am. I stopped talking to the one friend I had, I've been sitting on this couch in the garage every waking moment just smoking and drinking myself to sleep for 16 hours a day. I'm clearly depressed, I need help, but I have no means of getting it. I'm in chronic pain every day, it all hurts, and I can't take painkillers for it because of my addiction.

I don't know what I'm doing or why but I just wanted to say it to someone. I can barely get it out without my family getting enraged. They react to every problem I have with anger (whether its mental or physical). 

I just feel like a burden. That everyone would be better off without me.
