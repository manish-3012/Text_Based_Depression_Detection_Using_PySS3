I think this is itI'm not sad, or happy, or anything. I am nothing, just walking apathy, and I think this is it. I have a plan so it looks somewhat accidental, and it's been the plan for nearly a year. I've seen therapists; I've taken the meds; hell, I've even posted here before. I just don't see a reason not to. People love me, but they'll move on. I always did. They'll toast on my anniversary and birthday and assign me traits I never possessed, and then they'll just slog forward. Because that's what you do. So peace, and love, and more than anything, I wish you all feeling - good or bad. Don't be me. Be better, and live, with all the ups and downs that entails, because I couldn't.
