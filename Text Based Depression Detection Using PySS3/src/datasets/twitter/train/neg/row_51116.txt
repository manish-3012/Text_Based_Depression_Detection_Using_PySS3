I think my mom would be better off without me.Sheâ€™s remarried to a great man. If I was gone, she could get rid of all the baggage of her old marriage. She could have another baby and have a proper family. Sheâ€™d never have to think of her ex again. Sheâ€™d be sad for a while but sheâ€™d get over it. Parents say losing a kid is terrible but they always get over it or even make new ones.

I really want to be a mother though so that makes me want to stay. I think Iâ€™d be really good at it. It will hopefully happen in a few years so I donâ€™t have to wait long to be happy.

On the other hand, I donâ€™t want the people that dislike me to get the satisfaction of me being dead. I want to outlive them.
