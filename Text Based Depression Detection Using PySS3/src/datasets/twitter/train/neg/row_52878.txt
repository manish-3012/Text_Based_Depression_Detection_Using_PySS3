How much does it even cost to be admitted to a hospital if you mention suicide in therapy?So yeah I'm having those thoughts again. My sister's boyfriend and my only real irl friend died a month or 2 ago, and my sister is still a little upset over it. I cant really talk to anyone about my suicidal thoughts because I feel like it would be in bad taste. I have a therapist appointment coming in November but honestly, I doubt I'll last that long. If I do though, I just dunno how much hospitalization would cost if I had to be admitted. I dunno I'm just huge sad rn.
