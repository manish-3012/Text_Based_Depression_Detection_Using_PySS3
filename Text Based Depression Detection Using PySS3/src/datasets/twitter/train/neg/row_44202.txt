ValidationI just want to hear someone tell me that they would wanna kill themselves if they were me. I am so sick of hearing people act like my life is worth living because they have some weird hero complex where they think keeping people physically extant is the highest good. It comes across as so disingenuous. There are all of these non-suicidal people on these forums thinking they're helping by spewing mindless cliches with no thought to the context of someone may want to die and it's irritating. I wish there were pro-choice forums on reddit.

I don't have a future. I just want that to be acknowledged.
