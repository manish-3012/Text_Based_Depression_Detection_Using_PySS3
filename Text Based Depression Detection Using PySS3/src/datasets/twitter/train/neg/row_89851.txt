Anybody else laugh or feel the moment as â€œfakeâ€ when talking to somebody about depression/suicidal thoughtsI donâ€™t know why, but whenever I try and get my thoughts into words and out of my mouth the moment feels fake. Everything feels like Iâ€™m being satirical or making a joke or something because it just comes out so casual. But these are the thoughts I constantly have, just when actually coming out of my mouth sound so fake-sounding, because of how nonchalantly I say I want to not exist.

Maybe itâ€™s because the people Iâ€™m talking to canâ€™t fathom the fact that I just wish to not exist and die. Our brains are so completely different with entirely different beliefs that I know they canâ€™t understand, and for some reason it makes me hysterically grin or giggle a bit.
