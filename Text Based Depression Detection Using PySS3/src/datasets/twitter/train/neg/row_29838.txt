I fucked up and failed my daughterA little over a month ago a super fucked up and got fired from a nice, kush job.  I wasn't making amazing money, but my family (wife + toddler) was comfortable.  Since then, I've been applying for jobs and getting almost nowhere.

It's always the same fucking thing, your experience is AMAZING, but 1) not what we need at the moment 2) you don't have a security clearance 3) you're overqualified.

I get multiple recruiter calls every day, all leading to fucking nothing.

We're neck deep in student loan debt from my wife's law school - she hasn't held a job in 3.5 years.  The baby is almost 18 months and as precious as precious can be.

But I've failed her.  I simply KNEW as a kid that i was going to fuck up and end up in prison (cause doesn't everybody? that's what i was taught), and now i've fucked up and lost my job (but no prison or anything like that).  I'm tired of being told how fucking awesome i am - if i'm that fucking awesome, then why won't you give me a fucking job?  Oh, you're not hiring?  Then why the fuck have I gone through three goddamn rounds of interviews with you?

I just want to provide for my daughter, full stop, but the "greatest job market of all time" in on of the country's "fastest growing job market cities" isn't even trying to give me a chance.  I can't sleep anymore because every time i close my eyes i think of killing myself.  I can't sit at home alone because i can only think of killing myself.  There is no firearm in the house, so shooting myself isn't an option, but goddamn if i don't imagine it CONSTANTLY.

And ain't NOBODY trying to help... At least not in the ways i'm asking for them to.
