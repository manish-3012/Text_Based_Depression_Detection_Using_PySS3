Once you've posted here, you're pretty much doomed to be thinking about suicide and people who have it worseBut I don't remember their and mine intrinsic value, as well as anything good to get sober from that minute-to-minute suffering. All of my friends and relatives I was in touch with are unhappy and in poverty, they won't even talk to me because they got their own troubles to sort out, and I really tried not to, but still talked myself out on them which never leads to good feelings and associations - never could be pissed about them being this way.

Here, nobody cares about anybody, and I'm broke so I can't make an exit bag to quit making you listen to this bullshit. Moreover, look what a brave new world is two steps ahead of us. I'm not going to be a part of it, just no way being stupid, conformant, stripped off your constitutional rights and suffering for the rest of pretty humiliating life (not quite pessimistic evaluation yet) is better than being nothing and carrying on with this burden
