A permanent solution to a temporary problem. Fuck everyone who has ever said it.Iâ€™ve been struggling for 7 years. Major recurrent depressive disorder, anxiety, mixed bipolar and strong tendencies of BPD. Iâ€™m only 20, I get it my whole life is ahead of me, the world is my oyster. Blah blah blah. Guess what nurse In the ER, this stuff is never going away. My major mental illnesses are not a â€œtemporary problemâ€ it may be your temporary problem because you only have to deal with me till you leave work but for me it never stops. One day Iâ€™m not going to wake up and be like hey Iâ€™m cured. Iâ€™ve been through six therapists, played musical medications with just about every med out there, been inpatient twice, and in the emergency room more than half a dozen times. Five of those being in the last year  and a half. Iâ€™m only 20 yet instead of being at college with the rest of my friends I canâ€™t hold down a job, I canâ€™t save money for this incredible future Iâ€™m supposed to have. Iâ€™m tearing apart my thighs with blades. Iâ€™ve attempted once before but my boyfriend managed to save me. This is my world. These crashes are always going to be there and Iâ€™m so fucking tired of hearing itâ€™s a temporary problem because itâ€™s really fucking not.
