do you ever feel like you're always alone, even when surrounded by others?you know how people always say "you're lonely, not alone"? i really honestly feel like i'm just unable to become close to another human being - mutually.  

  
i have a lot of people in my life who love me and want to be close to me. but i feel cold saying that i am either too overwhelmed by them or i don't feel close to them.   


my life pretty much changed for the worst when my long-term boyfriend and i broke up two years ago. the relationship was very traumatic for me for a lot of reasons.   


i spent the relationship taking care of him and his situation, which i do not regret - but i compartmentalized all of the trauma that i received. i never took care of myself, and now its hitting me. 

&amp;#x200B;

i cant bond with others anymore. i used to have stupid useless sex constantly that made me feel like a piece of meat to be consumed. now intimacy terrifies me. 

  
closeness and hugs scare me. i'm extremely isolated and i only ever leave the house for my (extremely tough medical) school and to get food. debt is piling up because of that but its my only joy. 

i cant stand people getting close to me. i cant stand hanging out with friends. but yet i want love and intimacy so badly. i feel like im so broken, and that i'm never going to feel like a human again.

 i just feel like a vessel that serves as a stupid, servicing fleshlight to fuck. to only ever improve the quality of others - not me. i don't deserve it.

i just don't understand why i shouldn't just kill myself over spring break. that way if i survive, i have a week to be in the psych hospital and not miss any assignments or exams.
