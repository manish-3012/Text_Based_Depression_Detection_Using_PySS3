Needing some encouraging words?I had a post a while ago that explained it all. But basically Iâ€™m stuck in a toxic and mentally abusive situation. I really feel like I want someone to rescue me.. physically not mentally, but I know thatâ€™s not happening.. and I have to do the work to leave myself. Starting from the bottom..
I have no one to go through. My family are the people doing the abusing. And I have zero friends
