What's the point?I can count on one hand the number of times in my life I've felt truly happy. 

I've been having suicidal thoughts since I was in the sixth grade. My middle school guidance counselor recommended to my parents that I see a therapist. My mother beat me for â€œlying to a teacherâ€ and for â€œmaking her look badâ€. I never brought it up to anyone again, until last night.

I've been extremely depressed and anxious lately due to a bad work situation. I'm just so sick of everything being a constant uphill struggle. Things have been going steadily downhill my entire 25-year life. Every year finds me worse off than the last. I don't enjoy anything anymore. Things I once loved are now chores. I confided in my boyfriend that I've been having suicidal thoughts again. We are (or at least I thought we were) very close, but he seemed more or less unfazed. He replied, very honestly, that while he'd prefer I remain alive, he'd eventually be okay if I died. No other human in my life would care in the slightest; I'm estranged from my family and have only a couple of not-close friends. My pets have good homes lined up in the event of my untimely death. So, Reddit, I ask you: Is suicide such a bad thing if you leave no one grieving?
