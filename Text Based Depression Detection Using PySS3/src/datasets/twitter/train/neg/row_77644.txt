I've hit a low point, Reddit.God do I have a life story, but I've been getting a feeling that it's coming to an end soon. The last time I felt this depressed was three years ago, and that was when I landed myself in the psychiatric hospital for the first time. I would much, much rather end my life than go back to that kind of hell. I'm not actively planning suicide at the moment, but living still hurts too much to bear. 

Really I'd just like to talk to someone, anyone, I don't think I've said more than a dozen words to anyone in the past three days. I don't know what to do with myself. Living doesn't even seem real anymore, it all just feels like some kind of sick joke.
