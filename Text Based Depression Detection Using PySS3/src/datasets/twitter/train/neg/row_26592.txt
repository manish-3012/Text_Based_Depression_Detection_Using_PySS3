Almost there..I've been fighting these urges for a long time now. The recent events in my life have all but pushed me over the edge. I'm desperately searching for reasons not to kill myself. Not finding anything in this world to keep me here. Here is my backstory..

I was raped several times at a young age( started when I was 3 ended when i was 5). Its affected me deeply, emotionally mentally, sometimes physically. I can't keep friends. I burn bridges better than anyone on earth. Once things go well I implode, and ruin everything. 

Was involved in an accident where a old lady pulled out in front of me and I t boned her. I put everyone involved in the hospital ( old lady who was driving broke two vertebrae her daughter a concussion and the four year old boy is paralysed on the right side of his body)  broke my shoulder and concussion. They hired a great lawyer and beat me at every turn. The state is a no fault state so even though she pulled out in front of me it fell on me and my insurance. I lost my license job car girlfriend apartment savings within a period of 5 days. I almost killed myself after all that. My family baker acted me when they found out. Just spared me a little time. I moved across the country and things aren't any better. Only found shit work.. 

Why do I keep trying? Why do I keep pushing and working so god damn hard just to be miserable? Just to be fucked over by someone with less intelligence and more money. Fuck all this. Reddit.. Here are my final words..
