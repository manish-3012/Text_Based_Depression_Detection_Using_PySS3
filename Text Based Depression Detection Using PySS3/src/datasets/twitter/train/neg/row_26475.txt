I have no hope for the future, forever aloneI will try keep it short. I am 32 years old, haven't had a girlfriend in 13 years. Did some messed up things while I was drunk in high school. I touched 2 girls while they were asleep. I didn't rape them. I can't remember everything. I was lying in the bed with one, I can't remember exactly how it got there. I stopped when I realized she didn't want me touching her. I have said sorry to her, the other I can't get hold of. I feel very guilty and ashamed, and I should. I am disgusting. I never want to hurt anyone, ever. That was more than 16 years ago but I can't forgive myself. I lost my virginity to a prostitute at 26, and have been to about 22 after that. I am really a useless human being. I am unlovable and unforgivable. I don't know what the point is of going on. How can I ever find someone who could love me. Anyway, don't know if anyone will even read this. I am so depressed and have been from since I can remember. I am so alone. p.s I have fallen in love with a married woman, she is my only friend. I don't want to ruin her life and marriage. But I can't be without her. I should just book out.
