Well, I'm in deep.I need help. I am, once again, on the brink of suicide after the end of a relationship. I can't seem to find any point in living. I feel like if I die, nothing will matter.
So, yeah. PM's are welcome with either reasons that keep you from doing up or just a kind soul who wants to talk through it.
