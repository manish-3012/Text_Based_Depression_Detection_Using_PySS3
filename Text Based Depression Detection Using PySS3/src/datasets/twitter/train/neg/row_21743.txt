I've found the cause of my depression but I can't do anything to fix itI'm depressed because I'm lazy as fuck

I'm currently a senior in high school. I never get anything done on time, I don't study for tests until the night before, sometimes even the morning of. I study about 20 minutes each day on average. I have tried to stop being so lazy for 2 years and nothing has changed. I'm still a lazy piece of shit. Might as well fucking kill myself if I can't get fucking anything done
