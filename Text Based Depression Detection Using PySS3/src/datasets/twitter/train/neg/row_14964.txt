No longer a matter of if, but a matter of when.I don't know what to do. I've been suffering from depression and suicidal ideation my whole life, with some half assed attempts and failed medications. 

This time just seems so much worse. I want to give up. I'm ugly, I hate how I look, I feel like a fucking idiot for ever thinking I was attractive or could model. Nobody likes my personality, I can't keep friends, nobody thinks I'm funny or worth keeping around. I'm on vacation but ive spent every day so far wanting to kill myself and holding back tears. I no longer believe there's a chance, more that there's either a couple more days or a couple less days. I want to die.
