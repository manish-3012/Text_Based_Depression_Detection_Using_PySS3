I want to kill myself tonightThis might be a last pathetic cry for help, but yeah... I really can't stand the pressure anymore.

I come from a fairly modest family, fairly loving though bad at expressing it. There's a lot of tension in this house, mainly because of money issues and because of me, giving everybody a hard time. It could be worse, I know. I could be homeless, abused, who knows. But I'm still unhappy.

I'm EXTREMELY sensitive, too sensitive for this world. I just want all this to stop. All this tension... I hear my mother downstairs complaning about how I'm doing poorly in school. I can't stand the way she always looks at me with such spite and disappointment. I can't put up with their expectations anymore.

I'm tired of being a burden. Tired of being 21 and having no job, no social skills, wasting my parents' money on classes I'm failing because of my lack of motivation and stupid anxiety. Don't tell me to seek theraphy, please, I don't have the resources, I live off my parents' salary, in small town.

I just want to die. I imagine my parents would be sad, but... I'm already making them sad by being a failure on a daily basis. It feels like 9th grade all over again, when I had my 1st major depressive episode and I couldn't focuse on studies or myself overall. 

But now it's different because I'm an adult and they don't feel pity for me anymore. It's just harshness. They're sick of it too. I just want to go away and make this all stop. I'm thinking pills, but I'll see...
