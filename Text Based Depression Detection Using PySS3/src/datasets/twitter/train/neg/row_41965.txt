11 years of fighting depression, I think I've about had enough.Depression hit me hard 11 years ago and I've been on a slow path to recovery, or so I thought. Somehow it's relapsed this years and it's as worse as it's ever been. I'm on the verge of divorce, my true love is out there waiting for me but I can't be with her. So I will end up with no one when this is all over. I'm losing my house, my marriage, I have no friends, my family is unsupportive, and I'd rather live on the streets than go back living with them. The one thing I want that could save me and make life worth living is the one person I consider my true love. Except she's taken and she has largely withdrawn herself from me. So when it's all said and done, I'll have nothing, no one. I am 34 and my depression started when I was 23. I held on because I was convinced it would get better. It started to but then it got worse again. I just don't have the strength to continue anymore. As soon as I figure out the best way to end it I probably will.
