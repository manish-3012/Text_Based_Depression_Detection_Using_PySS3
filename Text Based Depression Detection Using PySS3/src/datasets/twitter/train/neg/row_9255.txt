I don't know why I want to dieI'm just miserable. My life is great, I have a job, enough money, a relationship. But I hate myself so much. I feel like my whole identity is a lie. I have DD and don't feel any joy. The only thing I feel is disgust for myself and that I deserve to suffer as much as humanly possible. I don't want to die because I don't want my family and my boyfriend to suffer but I don't want to be here anymore. All I wanna do is get high and slit my wrists but I know my boyfriend would be upset so I chose not to. I'm living for other people, not for myself. Why am I like this? Why can't I just die
