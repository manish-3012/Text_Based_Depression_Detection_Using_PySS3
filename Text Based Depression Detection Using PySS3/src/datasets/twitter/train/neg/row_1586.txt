Suicidal thoughts everyday.I hate my life. I'm so apathetic right now that I can't even bother writing more than a few lines. All I think is that maybe if I killed myself I shouldn't be in pain, but I'm just too scared that something goes wrong because I don't have a clue on how to do it without too much suffering. I can't sleep I can't awake I can't focus on anything.
