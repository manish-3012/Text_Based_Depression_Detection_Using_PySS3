Some final reflections as the journey comes to an end**Experience is the best form of knowledge.**


I have been told in past years that Toronto was a growing life sciences hub. My experience shows otherwise. People are told about what a great place this city is to live in, even as others experience grievous costs to residing here. As one sees this city and its inhabitants struggling with these and other contradictions, it really emphasizes the importance of oneâ€™s own lived experience in understanding this world.

This experience is inherently subjective, since it is based on each personâ€™s unique viewpoint which is tempered by their own circumstances. It may be uncomfortable to abandon the concept of objectivity in truth, but that is simply how human affairs works. Even the natural sciences are touched by human subjectivity, with experimental outcomes differing based on the conditions used and constant heated debates inflamed by conflicting papers. This is not a condemnation of scienceâ€™s attempt to discover objective truth, just an acknowledgment of its current limits. Perhaps in the future more advanced sensing and analysis may pierce the complex veils of society and the mind. For now, we will have to make do with other tools.

Empathy is one of these tools. Metaphorically putting yourself in another personâ€™s shoes is the best alternative to literally doing so. But it must be remembered that even empathy may not be enough. I remember when I was content. I didn't understand why people would be so sad they wanted to kill themselves. It wasnâ€™t until I finally experienced it for myself that I finally understood that depression exists. Empathy cannot fully substitute experience. Empathy without experience leads to the kind of mindset that makes one give out hackneyed platitudes such as â€œIt gets betterâ€. Forgive these people, for they know not what they do. Similarly, society and its institutions commit the same mistake, perpetuating reassuring narratives like the centrality of hard work, simply because they do not know better. Society values your life and tries to stop you from taking it, but it may not know how to keep the experience from being harrowing or how to give you a reason to carry on.

In living your life, in everything you do, never forget the importance of experiences. You may be able to see through the empty guarantees of others through experience. You may learn the experiences of others, just take note of the differences between their and your circumstances. Do your own research and have a proper plan on how to do things. That includes killing yourself. You must understand the challenges involved and the potential failures involved*. Make sure you have exhausted every other option. Remember that suicide is, by its very definition of ending your life, a last resort.

*I see a lot of posts on overdosing as a painless exit. That really depends on the drug involved. Many experiences are of people waking up again, sometimes with liver damage. You are trying to lessen your pain, not increase it. Drug overdoses are a terrible method.

**Everyone deserves meaning.**


People need a reason to continue on the journey of life. They need meaning. The denial of such leads to short-sighted decisions. What is the point of planning if your decisions do not ultimately matter? When will saving money actually help when you'll never make enough to pay off your debts and retire? Why restrict unhealthy vices in order to suffer the privations of this world just a little bit longer?

This need for meaning also applies on larger scales. A region of a country upset at not seeing any of the proceeds from its natural resources. An ethnic group resorting to violence in response to the suppression of their culture. A state protesting at the appropriation of its territory by a more powerful neighbor. In all of my readings of the histories of various nations, the search for meaning appears to be the root cause of unrest.

Like experience, meaning differs from person to person. Meaning is subjective and takes a variety of forms. What one person finds meaningful may be unimportant to another. Even within the broad categories there is much variation within. An example is belonging. I do not think finding a significant other is something to worry about, while quite a few on here few feel differently. Their idea of belonging is romantic, while mine is content with platonic relationships. A major component of belonging is respect, accorded to different aspects of a person: their achievements, their rights, their space, their property, their choices, their thoughts. Disregard for the last (â€œThere's no reason to feel that way!â€) is particularly crushing, as it is a denial of the self (â€œI think, therefore I amâ€). Belonging is one of the more difficult forms of meaning to achieve, as one rarely has (and shouldnâ€™t) have control of the actions of others. It is difficult to force others to accept you: it is far easier to work on oneself. 

While control over others is not a legitimate form of meaning to strive for, control over oneâ€™s own situation is. Expended effort only means something when it leads to changes that one desires. Failure to achieve said outcomes is often caused by circumstances outside one's control. While in some cases these limitations are obvious (like an overly strict parent), they can be more insidious in others (e.g. introversion leading to less people you know, a reduction in so-called social capital).  Freedom from such external constraints on one's choices constitutes what is known as negative liberty.

Liberty's other half, positive liberty, consists of the capacity to make choices that express one's will. This requires that one meet their basic needs. This is attained by oneâ€™s fair share in societyâ€™s output. It is astonishing to note the vast production capabilities of modern, industrialized societies coexisting with stark deprivation, which can even reach localized extremes in time and place. The problem is of distribution, like when abundant food often gets wasted instead of reaching the plates of the hungry. When I was more prosperous, I noted how an investment account essentially allowed me to profit from the work of others simply because I had money. A 10% return over half a year on a few thousand dollars. Now consider adding a few orders of magnitude to the initial amount and you will see how the rich become even richer. Much unhappiness can be removed by simply providing fundamental goods such as healthcare to the less privileged. Ensuring this is done in a way that benefits society is one of the ultimate goals of the social sciences.

Self-actualization, â€œbeing the best one can beâ€, is often considered as *the* ultimate goal to aim for. As Maslow rightly noted, reaching such heights of self-development often requires that one's needs are met and that one is empowered to make meaningful choices. The profound sense of satisfaction created is transitory, since self-actualization is a temporary state. My first paid employment was in a hospital's research wing. It felt great earning money doing stuff I was interested in, but that was only the starting point of what could have been a promising career in research. There is always room to do better. That humanity is convinced that the grass can be greener is perhaps the driving force behind civilization itself. To see further, to go farther, to create better.

**Other people's struggles may be worse, but your struggles matter the most.**


Iâ€™ve seen quite a few stories on here. Many of them tell of struggles I have never known. I was never abused. I can't even begin to understand what that feels like and the lingering scars it leaves behind, visible or not. Besides wearing glasses, I am able-bodied and do not have the misfortunes of reduced senses, mobility, or vitality. I do not understand what it is like to have difficulty understanding subjects like math. I grew up in a middle-class family that was able to immigrate to Canada; I have not been deprived of anything essential. I can afford to be unemployed due to my savings and donâ€™t need to face the specter of homelessness.

Though your situation may be better than that of others, that doesnâ€™t automatically mean greater happiness. The First World has legitimate problems, even if it better off in many aspects. In fact, I have seen stories here of people who have good lives, but donâ€™t want to live them. Regardless of whether you are better or worse off than I am, one thing is certain: **your struggle matters the most**.

You are the most important person in your life. Friends have their own lives and may not be there when you need them most. Even family can be indifferent or hostile. Never forget that the only person who will always be there for you, no matter what, is you. In the end, everything you do is for you. In order to take care of others, you must first take care of yourself. You are the decider, making decisions that impact your own and other lives. Your struggle is important: take it seriously.
