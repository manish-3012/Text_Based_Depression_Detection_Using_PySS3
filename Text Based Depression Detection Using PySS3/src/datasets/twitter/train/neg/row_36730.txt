What a world we live in.I just can't seem to win. I've felt so miserable for so long, I have no purpose. I wish I wasn't such a coward and could just say fuck it and end it all tonight. I don't understand why I've held on for so long. I've just been through so much pain in my life, and I feel so miserable. Nothing gives me pleasure, I emulate egos that mask my true self, one stuck in an isolation from the world. I have shitty self esteem, no redeeming qualities worth mentioning, overall I'm disposable. I wish I wasn't nice enough to live, if I had any bit of logic, I'd call it quits here and now. Nobody outside of this Reddit post will ever know how I feel deep down because I will always hide it, and that's one of the few good things about me. I wish I could find a reason to live, I am trying so hard in respect to my late mother and father, my sister, and my close friends but I'm certain I'm a ticking time bomb ready to fucking end it :(....
