I want to give up.My boyfriend continues to reassure me everything is temporary and it will all get better but what if I don't want to wait for it to get better. I've been struggling with suicidal ideations and depression for about 10 years, have been hospitalized twice before I was 18, been on so many meds I forget half the names. Marijuana does help and I used to use alcohol as a crutch until about a month ago. I went from working a full time job for 2 years that was about min wage and now I'm in a job that can't even give me over 25 hrs and pays min wage. I left the job because I was unhappy but it's been 8 months and I've been regretting the decision for 6 now. I need help but I just want to kill myself.
