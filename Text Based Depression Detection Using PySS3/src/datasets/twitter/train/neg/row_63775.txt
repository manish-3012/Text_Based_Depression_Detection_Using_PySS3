Nothing to do, no-one to talk to...Not really interested in being here anymoreWhat is weird to me is that I don't feel particularly overwhelmed, it's just that I've decided I can't really keep on like this. People point to the future, yet how can I be enthusiastic for that when the present is so woeful? In three months, I lost my girlfriend, my best friend betrayed me in order to stand a chance with her (failed) so he had to go too. Then my main aspiration, the one thing that kept me from cutting too deeply, was also taken away from me. Fuck the candidates who have their place effectively guaranteed by Daddy's money. To top it off, my former stepdad recently passed away in the same week that my dad was admitted to hospital with a heart condition. All of this has ruined what promised to make this year so good. I am a shadow of my former self, consigned to bed with stress as the friends I have left go out and enjoy themselves. How many times can I tell myself that everything is okay before I just realise that it isn't? I saw a picture from my birthday, and there I am, about to blow out my candles as excited for the year ahead as I was happy about the year that had just been. But those that promised to make it so good are now gone, and as I spend another Saturday in this empty house I wonder how I can just get out. There have been times where I have briefly motivated myself but I know that it is only a temporary respite before the depression returns. Maybe it will finally choose to overwhelm me in the next few weeks.
