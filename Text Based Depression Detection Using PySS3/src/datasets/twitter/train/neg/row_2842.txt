At 21 Iâ€™ve somehow become an alcoholic with severe depression who canâ€™t even kill himself because heâ€™s such a coward. Itâ€™s too late to fix me I realize this is the point of no returnItâ€™s too late the girl I love is getting married ive been an alcoholic since 18 my family doesnâ€™t know about any of my issues and I have very few friends and they donâ€™t wanna talk to me. I realize now that this is the end of my life. Iâ€™ve already drank too much Iâ€™ve already ate too much and I have no future. Iâ€™m not ready to die but I know itâ€™s coming soon I know Iâ€™ll have no choice but to kill myself. It doesnâ€™t get better it canâ€™t it wonâ€™t and I regret my whole life
