What's the point in living? Please hear me out.Posted this on /r/depression, I thought it could be good to post it here too.

I have been alone since I were a kid. I had been suffering I were a kid. I have been unworthy, trashy, unlikable, shitty, since I were a kid.

My pain exists since I were a kid. Etc. My point is, there's no reason to live. "But the people who care about you?" Indeed, they do care about me. But why do they me want me alive, then? If my life is only pain and suffering, why do they want me to continue on living? Why?

I am sorry, people. But is there any other way to end my pain? My suffering? Death seems to be the only one. Death would put me at ease. Would save me from suffering. It would be peaceful. Why can't I do that? Life is not getting better anyway.

Also, I am kissless shitty virgin teenager who never dated anyone or haven't been liked by anyone. 

What's the point in anything? What is it? There is not. I am trash that should die.
