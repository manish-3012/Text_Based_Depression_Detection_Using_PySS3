Iâ€™m sorryIâ€™m sorry I couldnâ€™t have been a better friend. Iâ€™m sorry that Iâ€™m such a disappointment and a major let down. Iâ€™m sorry that Iâ€™ve caused nothing but worry and pain. Iâ€™m sorry that I couldnâ€™t become who you and everyone else thought I could be. Iâ€™m sorry that you wonâ€™t have me in your future. Iâ€™m sorry that I did this. Iâ€™m sorry that Iâ€™ve lied to you about being happy for so long. Iâ€™m sorry that everything I did wasnâ€™t good enough.
