I can't take it anymoreMy ex girlfriend and I took a break last month so she could grow more as a person and focus on just her but we still talked everyday like we normally did before, and then a week ago she told me she still wanted to be with me and we should still get married and have a life together and then cut to yesterday when I find out she started dating someone the day before. I can't take it, I just can't she helped me through so many things and now she's gone and just dropped me, I don't have a reason to live she helped fix me just by being with me and now I'm worse then I was when I was with her. I don't eat anything, I started cutting a couple days ago and everything just feels hopeless without her and I know nobody would care if I died. Why would they? I'm a disappointment and a failure. I can't stop my thoughts of her and it's driving me insane, she says she cares about me but then through me away because I assume I'm not enough for her, I just want everything to end I have nothing going for me, I don't want to move on from the one person who made me happy and made me actually want to live for a change. If I died everything would be so much better.
