Hey I'm Levi and this is my life. You're probably wondering why this is in the r/SuicideWatch area well I'll get to that but into the story. As you know I'm Levi and i got in a car accident at 6 months old and survived, I know crazy. When I was 8 months old I started walking, crazy right. 8 years later, I was on the internet and I went on Omegle and I came across this pedophile and he said moan into the mic and like a dumb little kid,I did it and I didn't tell my mom. When i was 12, I got addicted to porn and I legit hate it. Now I don't use the word hate a lot but I really do. It ruined my life for 16 years and still going. I'm still trying to quit and all that shit but that's irrelevant. At 13, I had a swiss army knife and late night I think I was thinking of killing myself with a swiss army knife, just ending it. But I thought about my family and felt better. at age 14 I felt sad so I huffed Mr. Clean stuff and felt good for a little bit. Now I feel like huffing again but I don't know what I'll be like after I do it. Also I almost ended it when I was texting my friend but she talked me out of it. Last I feel like I got raped by my boyfriend(I am bisexual) he was in 11th grade and I was in 9th grade. Thank you for reading my story I hope it reached to some people out there. Bye Bye for now.
