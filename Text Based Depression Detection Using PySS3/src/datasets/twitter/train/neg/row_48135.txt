Anybody out there? Drunk alone and downI am lost. I put down my dog 5 months ago, I broke up with a girl that loves me, I'm in a constant struggle with my past and my parents making me as self loathing as I am. I'm not close enough with anyone to talk to about my thoughts of ending my life and making it look like an accident
