Don't rush to answer this. Help someone who needs it more first :)(18, Male.) I'm having suicidal thoughts right now and my family are the only things keeping me going. I've been depressed for years and the anxiety is draining me day by day. Every bad thought is just hitting me all at once. I tried to convince myself I'm happy and things will get better, but these bad thoughts are too over empowering. I recently got friendly with a girl and she left me to go back with her ex, she found out he cheated, we were going to work things out, and a week later she got back with him. That didn't really help matters either and it's only made my situation worse. I've been to the doctors for some sort of help, but he said you will have to wait 4 months to see a counselor. Not much help at all. I'm not sure if I would try anything, but it's starting to feel like my only choice to deal with the pain of everything. I know it might sound pathetic, but I'm not as strong as I used to be.
