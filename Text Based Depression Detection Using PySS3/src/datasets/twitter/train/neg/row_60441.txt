Would someone commit suicide if theyâ€™ve planned for the future?Iâ€™m asking because of my best friend. I suspect that heâ€™s suicidal, heâ€™s been joking about suicide, heâ€™s losing modivation to do school (he loves school), heâ€™s swearing a lot (he believed swearing was wrong just a few months ago), and heâ€™s dreading church (he loved church). Heâ€™s just not himself, and looking into his eyes he looks tortured. He even said that his mom would be mad if he killed himself. I wanted to say that Iâ€™d be devastated but I was too shocked to say anything. Iâ€™m getting really worried because he hasnâ€™t been on Snapchat or Facebook in days. I texted him and he hasnâ€™t replied, and not being on his phone at all is very unlike him. He plans to go college next year because he wants to be a veterinarian, and heâ€™s been working very hard to keep up his perfect 4.0 gpa. Iâ€™m planning on calling him tomorrow to see if heâ€™s alright, since itâ€™s 2 in the morning. I just wish I called him tonight like I planned, Iâ€™m so scared I canâ€™t sleep. Iâ€™m especially worried because his parents are emotionally abusive. He is Christian so maybe itâ€™s against his religion to commit suicide, but idk if that would be enough to stop him. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m just getting really worked up over nothing or if something really is wrong. I just have a gut feeling that heâ€™s not alright.
