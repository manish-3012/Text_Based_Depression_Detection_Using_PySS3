I'm not sure what to do.I'm 18, just graduated. Lost my job, car broke down, my family is too poor to help me get a new one, still no calls about jobs, phone resets tomorrow and I don't have money to renew it, the woman I love moved on and I feel hopeless. I know no one her can help, but it helps to vent.
