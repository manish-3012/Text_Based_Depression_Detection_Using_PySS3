I cant suppress anymoreI cried for the first time in 3 years recently.  I was having a rough night where I thought every1 hated me and wanted me dead.  Thank christ for my friend who talked to me during that time and kept me from doing some dumb shit when in that dark place.  Ever since than I just cant anymore.  I think some shit came to the surface and Ive finally understood how Ive always felt.  Every1 says its best to stop suppressing your feelings but now I feel even more sad and empty.  Its gotten to the point where I think every1 hates me constantly and that I can barely get out of bed.  Im not doing any of my college work until the last minute or lunch.  My brains slowed to a crawl.  I dont know what to do.  This all is happening not long after my first attempt which sorta made me question everything.  It showed me that I didnt really want to go.  But that realization and that feeling of being alive is gone now.  Now Im just sad and empty and paranoid.  I dont feel like killing myself atm but Im impulsive and at this rate I cant see where else I would end up other than 6 feet under.
