No future for me anymoreI failed out of university 2 years in, and life has been nothing but pain and humiliation ever since. There hasn't been a day since February that I haven't thought about killing myself. After I was kicked out in Feb this year, I started spending all my tuition funds on junk. Stupid move, but I didn't care anymore. I still don't, really. Of course, my family flipped out when they found out. Now I'm the family failure and an ungrateful leech to everyone in the house.
Still, they made me enroll in part-time classes to improve my standing. But it will take me 2 years of upgrading to start working towards my degree again, so it's pretty much exactly like starting the program from the beginning. Needless to say, whatever feeble motivation I had is completely gone. I had to cut contact with all my friends as well, because I don't want them to know that I'm a failure. They'll all have their degrees while I'll be starting from the bottom. Because they worked hard and I didnt. I'm too ashamed of my status as a part-time student to try and make new friends, so I'd be a complete loner for the next 4-5 years. And at that late stage, it's likely impossible to make real and lasting friends. So basically, the rest of my life will be nothing but suffering alone. Why even continue?
Midterms start this week, and I haven't attended a single class this semester. I don't even know what my professors look like. I am aware I have a serious self-discipline problem. Even with all my effort, I can't focus on studying for more than a few minutes at a time. And I spend stupid amounts of money on things I don't need. I guess I've just had too much freedom all my life. My plan is to just wing it, and if I fail (and I surely will) I'll end everything then. For now that's as far into my future as I can see.
