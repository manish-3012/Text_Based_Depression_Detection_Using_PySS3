3 weeks postpartum with second childI currently 3 weeks postpartum, breastfeeding is quite demanding, as it was with my first, I feel like itâ€™s the very same difficult journey as before...my husband supports me...but he just doesnâ€™t understand how miserable I am right now. He just doesnâ€™t understand me. I discussed with him when he goes back to work on the 4th, I want to switch our newborn to formula, but the very idea, just disappointed him. He only feeds her during the night, which I appreciate, but thatâ€™s it...itâ€™s just me every other hour, and Iâ€™m just exhausted. Iâ€™m already thinking of ending my life, and he doesnâ€™t know...And the times before I told him when having our first born, he didnâ€™t get it. I love our newborn daughter, and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll go to that extent, I just want to cope. I even told my OB weeks before giving birth that I know I will experience postpartum depression, so she did start me on Zoloft which I started 2 weeks ago. I donâ€™t know how I can make my husband understand that I think breastfeeding is causing me to be more depressed.
