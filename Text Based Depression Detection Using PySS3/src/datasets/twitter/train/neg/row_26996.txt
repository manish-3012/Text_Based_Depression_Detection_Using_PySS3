Planning on killing myself in June over stay at home orderRight now the Bay Area just extended the stay at home order till end of May, and I'm beginning to think that they will extend it till June, but won't say that because they will cause panic in the public. I live with family members that won't use my right name or pronouns. My career has been ruined, and the tech industry could permanently shift to work from home, which scares me because I'm not mentally capable of working from home. And switching to a new career path because of the fact that I'm transgender is going to be very difficult. And then there's soon going to be another great depression because of the virus and SIP orders. Socially I'm doing fine, I have 2 friends willing to defy the SIP order for me, and a 3rd in about 2 weeks. I really see no point to living anymore if they extend this past June. I have some faith that they won't, or they'll be forced to back down because of public opposition to extending the order past June
