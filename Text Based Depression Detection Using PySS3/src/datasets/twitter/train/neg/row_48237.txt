Killing yourself overseas.I have tried *really* hard to try and be happy, i mean, the most i have ever tried in my whole life.

Therapy, lifestyle changes, perception alterations... but still nothing makes me want to live anymore. I don't have a family, i don't have friends, the only person i love doesn't care about me anymore it seems, i have nightmares incredibly often, haven't slept well in months, my only motivation is a fickle one. And damn it, i can't stop thinking about the past. All of it. It's all so awful.

So im going overseas this year and i do not plan to return, i was thinking about killing myself in Japans suicide forest or something along those lines. I know i want to die, and i also know i don't want to die *here* if i can help it. If i don't kill myself very soon, i will then.

Does suicide as far away from home seem like a peaceful idea? I dont want my whole life to amount to me just suffering and then dying here. I at least want it to end a little uniquely.
