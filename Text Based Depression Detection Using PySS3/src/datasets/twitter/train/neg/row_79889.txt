Forever AloneI have no friends and therefore, no significant other. Every attempt to keep a friend is meaningless. I always fuck it up somehow. Thatâ€™s why I got nothing for Valentines Day. Not a single teddy bear, or card, or waking up to a lovely text from someone who actually gives a shit that Iâ€™m alive.  I was practically forced to look at the happiest of people enjoying this holiday at school. If no one cares about me on the day when everyone loves each other, then no one cares about me any other day. My English teacher doesnâ€™t care that Iâ€™m not doing my work, people acknowledge my existence so far about 3 times a day, and no one talks to me. Which is good. Then no one will care when I leave.
