I just need to escapeI am not ready to explain how bad this depression.. this hopelessness has become again to anybody in the real world. 

I have attempted suicide (3 years ago). I was hospitalized twice. 

I have no real reason to feel this depression anymore. It used to be various types of anxiety but my situation has changed and I no longer have those types of anxiety. 

But I still have this depression which is getting worse and worse and now I don't know if there really is a way to feel happy ever. It started 8 years ago and hasn't let up. 

Randomly I cry and I can't stop any of this and I just want my head to feel clean and free of sadness. 

I know that is too much to ask for. I get excited for nothing. Feel unable to connect with anybody. I never feel happy enough to smile. My conversations with people I hate because I become disconnected and have no idea how to feel anything towards anything. I do not like myself. I don't know how to love or feel loved. I am bad at everything. I have given up hobbies. I am just mentally deteriorating..

I have no choices to fix this depression.. (Have tried therapy, various ssris [no longer believe in them as they can cause further damage]) 

I realize I have lost this battle.
