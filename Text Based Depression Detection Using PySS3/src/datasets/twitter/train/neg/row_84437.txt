Which is the worse way to grow up?I am depressed. Angry. Suicidal. Damaged. Broken. Not good. 
I'm also a mother. My daughter is 2.
I feel like I need to kill myself or disappear before she can remember me. Before I ruin all the happy times in her childhood. Before I twist her up the way I am twisted up inside. 
What is worse? Having a mother that you don't remember because she killed herself when you were a baby? Or a mother that stuck around long enough to fuck up you and everything else around her. Then ill probably end up killing myself somewhere down the road anyways. 
I am called crazy and the only person I have left is my daughter. I have no friends and my family has all turned away from me. I have been broken my entire life and everyone I know is sick of dealing with me. There is no helping me and I'm tired of fighting. This kid just makes it so hard...but I know so many people resent thier mentally ill mothers for making their lives hell.  I don't want to poison my daughter's life. Is it worse to not remember your mother at all or to remember her as a poison and hate her?
