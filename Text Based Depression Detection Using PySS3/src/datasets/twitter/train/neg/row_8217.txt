Well that hasnâ€™t happened beforeI just had three panic/anxiety attacks, because people came over and my aunt asked me to walk the dogs. What. Like, I just collapsed after walking into my room and started shaking and hyperventilating uncontrollably. Three separate times. Before 12 pm. My chest really hurts.
