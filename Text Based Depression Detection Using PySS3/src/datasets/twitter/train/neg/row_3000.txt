You Saved Me.Bless this sub.  It saved my life the other night.
I was low, below rock bottom, I'd had a few shitty days, school was giving me a hard time.

I was going to jump.  I was going to fall off a cliff and end my suffering that night.

The usual thoughts that stop me from doing something crazy weren't working.

I cleaned my room, I quit my job, I wrote a note and stuck it to my wall.  I was dead set ready on dying that night.  

I was so ready that it scared me.  I posted here, asking for people to convince me not to kill myself.  And within minutes I had a few people who rushed to my rescue.  It felt so nice to be cared for.

You guys talked me out of it.  You told me to have a hug with my mum, you gave me metaphors for life.  But most importantly, you just talked to me. 

It felt so nice to be able to talk to someone.

Thank you.
