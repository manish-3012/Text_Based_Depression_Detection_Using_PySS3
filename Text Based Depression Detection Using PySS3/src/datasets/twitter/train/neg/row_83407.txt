Is this normal to think this?I have had suicidal thoughts for a while now. Recently I have had talk of school shootings shoved into my face by the media. Killing innocent kids is wrong, but what about the not so innocent people? There was a threat at my highschool, someone tweeted that they were going to bring a gun to school. There was no shooting but people were scared. And when you hear the kid who has tormented you your whole life say they are terrified, I got a very good feeling from that. Maybe our school needs a shooting? Maybe some kids need a.wake up call. You cant excpect to treat people like shit and excpect to get away with it right? Odds are I won't do anything but i do realize that these.thoughts are not normal. Please let me know, What's your opinion? Am I sick in the head?
