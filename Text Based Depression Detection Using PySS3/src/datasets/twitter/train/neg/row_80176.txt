My blood pressure is out of control and nothing is working. I don't want to have a stroke.I think I'd rather kill myself than be paralyzed for life. My BP meds aren't working and my resting pressure is spiraling out of control. It's not normal to have pressure of 170/120. I'm only 21. Whenever I go to the doctor, though, he says my pressure is normal. I don't know what else to do.
