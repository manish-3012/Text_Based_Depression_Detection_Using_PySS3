I am in a spiral of feeling suicidal yet being mad at myself for being suicidalI just can't seem to get myself together. I've been suicidal for years now. I never really gotten better fully. But the closest I've ever been was when I was 16. I had a plan to cut class during study hall and lunch to give myself a head start to get to the cal trail to get to san Francisco, where I planned to take a bus to the golden gate bridge then jump off. I lied to my therapist saying I was just depressed because I didn't want anyone to be able to stop me. I knew it would be a quick death and it had a 99% success rate. I didn't even leave a note because I wanted to just disappear without a trace. I cry while writing this because my mom saved my life by not letting me go to school that day.

But now I am getting closer and closer to doing that again. I am such a failure. I dropped out of college twice and I am determined to at least finish one semester then I can just die. I just cry all the time, sometimes for no reason at all.  I don't know what to do. Life is just not for me
