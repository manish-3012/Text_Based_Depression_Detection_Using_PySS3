Somewhere elseI've realized the trend. Almost every November I hit a low. Usually end up in the psych ward. Or at least the emergency room. I realized this two years ago. And I've gotten so good at keeping quiet now. Suppressing everything. But it's still there. Pounding through my head. I take out the blender, and imagine turning it on with my head inside. Could I scramble up my brains with my hair? We brought a saw into the basement. But I think, if we ever set it up properly, I could cut my whole head off while he's away. The one thing keeping me here dialing through the days is a dog. A very broken dog I adopted. He hates that dog. I love that dog. Could that dog recover without me? Would he still be on a warm bed at night? That dog deserves everything. I deserve to be dead. Without me alive, I think this dog will also die. But then we could be together somewhere else maybe? I can't do that to him. The dog needs more time.
He likes to shoot guns in the backyard. I've warned him for years that I have issues and, given an easy enough chance, I'd hold that pistol to my head and hope I can hear my skull burst before I dive into the wonderful blissful blackness. He wants me to get my pistol permit. The plan is to get through just a few more years. Pay off debt. Get my permit. Assuming my last hospital stay is far enough in the past and won't be brought up. And then I have no guilt to be here. He'll be fine without me. He can take my car. Pay the bills. And I won't even have to use his gun. I'll have my own. I'll have legal permission to gush my own brains and blood into my backyard.
But every year feels like it's getting harder. I'm not even a human anymore. I'm a shell filled with regret. I want a do-over. And it would be so easy, to ask to learn how to shoot. He'd probably be so happy. And when he looks away, I only need a second. Is there enough reason to stick out a few more years? I feel so lost. I want to be someone else, somewhere else, yesterday
