I'm sick of being a disappointment.As the title says, i'm sick of being a disappointment to everyone around me. I'm a shit son, shit student, shit friend. I have achieved nothing in my life, not academically, not socially, i've achieved nothing. My parent's aren't proud of me and feel embarrassed because of me. Yet they take care of me. I'm an antisocial loser who spends most of his time in his room, whenever there's a chance to make a friend i always ruin it. I have horrible grades in school and no ambition to have a career. i have no talents. Everyone around me encourages me to make a positive change in my life, but i just don't have the willpower. I don't wanna live, i don't have the motivation to even get up from bed, forget finishing studies, starting a career, starting a family. I'd rather just spare myself the trouble of being a 30 year old virgin who lives in his parent's basement. My poor parents will never feel the happiness of having their son be successful. I've been horrible to them, i've been horrible to my past friends. Everyone knows me as that slacker who sits on the computer all day. They laugh and berate me, but i can't blame them. I think i'm just gonna hang myself, it won't matter if anyone will supposedly miss me, i'll be dead. I guess the point of this post is to feel some solace knowing that at least someone got to hear my story.
