I get it, I'm a piece of taMaybe I'm just having a bad day where all my shortcomings are coming to bear all at once, but I feel like no matter what I do, I can never improve my lot in life.

It kind of started in middle school, really; I was bullied a lot, and I always fantasized about how one day I'll be better than my bullies, how I'll be able to one up them and show them who's boss.

I made it through middle and highschool, I wasn't the top of my class (in fact, my bullies unfortunately ended up higher than me), but I didn't think that'd matter, since when we were all going off to college, I heard they all were studying what was considered "useless" stuff, like graphic design, while I was going in for computer science.

I figured I'd finally get what I wanted; to finally be better off than them. (One of the things they made fun of me for was that I came from a poor family.)

Fast forward to graduating college, and I can't even find a job besides the one I was working to pay for my tuition, and meanwhile, I heard one of them has a six figure gig in California already lined up.

I couldn't even at least take solace in the fact that I at least had a better social life than them, all my friends hated me for breaking up with my girlfriend at the time. My bullies? Engaged to be married.

Three years later, I get demoted at my old highschool job, meaning I have to take a pay cut and lose all my benefits that I had to fight tooth and nail to get. (Which didn't stop them from periodically taking them away from me without rhyme or reason.)

Meanwhile, the rest of my bullies are making it big.

I don't even want to be more successful than them, anymore. I get it; they're a gift to the world and I'll never compare to them, my rightful place is beneath them.

Can I please just be able to afford my medications and my own place, now? I've learned my lesson that I'm just a piece of trash, I'm sorry, I won't ever think I'm better or ever going to be better than anybody again!
