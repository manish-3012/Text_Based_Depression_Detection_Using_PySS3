Experiencing an "IF" Post DeathI planned to die and thought about how I would do it. Weeks ago. I was supposed to be somewhere in Colorado or Utah this week, and disappear. All this plan changed fast when my friend stayed with me, and now we have a plan to go back home, staying there for a week. My school starts today. I actually forgot all about my classes because I thought I won't even live by then a couple of weeks ago. I still am serious about my plan, and sometimes I think about when that day might come. It's not a sad or negative thing, no. It's just that I know my existence doesn't belong to this place for too long. I've led some interesting short life. By the way, I'm 20 years old. I just know I have till, maybe, five years top. I'm still thinking about how I'm going to do zoom in the morning, a third-year student in the university who was supposed to be dead. Lately, I have been so confused. I keep thinking, what if I do this or this? I pretty much live out my ride, stopping at friends' places for a while, there and there. 

Have you ever know this strange feeling of realizing, "shit I'm experiencing today"? Like, if you truly had a date set, and when it goes sideways, you see what you might miss out on if you weren't there? It's not so great here, me shuffling my feet in the mud. At least the weather is looking up. I think I might be able to get out of the mud.
