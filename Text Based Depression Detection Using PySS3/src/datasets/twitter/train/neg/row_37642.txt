Worst year...It started kast year when my father died, thanks cancer. Since then i have just stopped caring about everything. I turned my back on my country, walked away from 7 years of active duty military... I feel likemi have let everyone down. I let my wife down, her father..i havent been able to talk to my mither since he died... I feel like a total loser... When will this weight get off my chest? Will i get cancer? I just want to stop being weird and ruining everything for everyone....27 years old and life blows.
