I've been getting suicidal texts from someoneI really want to help this person out. I talked with this person online and in the beginning it was cool, we had fun talking. They were funny, and made jokes. However now they come and tell me things like, "I want to die", "If I killed myself it would be good", etc. 

And now I'm scared. I asked them if they were joking (probably a horrible choice on my part), but they replied they not.

I.. am at a loss. I don't know how I can support them. Also, a last text they sent me was alarming. 

"No, but it doesn't matter" This was after they responded to me asking if they were joking.

What can I do to help?
