my world came crashing down todaygirlfriend I adored ended it. Ex wifes family is now ganging up with her on me slandering me and calling me a cheater. I left my ex because she cheated on me and I never cheated on my ex gf. I live in a small town away from immediate family. I have three kids that need me. but I dont know where to turn. My friends are concerned but have lives of their own and they cant really do much for me. I dont feel good in my own skin right now. my heart is racing and the stress is overwhelming. Is there something I can do right now to calm my nerves?
