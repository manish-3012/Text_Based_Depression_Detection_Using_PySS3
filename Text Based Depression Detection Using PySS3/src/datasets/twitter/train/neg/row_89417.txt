[17M] Give me a good reason not to kill myself, bc my mind is pretty much made upIm so close man. Now that I dont believe in religion no more, Im not scared of going to hell, so Im pretty much ready to go, but theres one thing, what if I dont kill myself tonight? I wonder what Ill be in 30 years but I doubt it will be anything good. I have absolutely no friends, always lonely, ugly(mouth breathing face lol), Im naturally lazy and now Im miserable. I have a mom that loves me so much and I love her, but I just dont want to be here no more. Life has sucked so far, Ive been picked on in school, sucked at every sport, am a complete idiot, never had a gf, dont have friends, my dad makes fun of me for waking up at 12 everyday making me feel like shit, and I doubt it will get any better. Nobody has wished me a happy birthday other than my parents like ever. I hate this world and I hatr myself. Not to mention I accidentally stepped on my dogs foot today getting him really hurt and he was crying so much. I felt so bad, but Im not surprised because Im a complete fucking loser. If someone gives me a good reason to stay I will, but right now im convicned I should end it
