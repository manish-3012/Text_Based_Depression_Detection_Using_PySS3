I attempted, i failed. I could use something, anything.The past few months have been shit, ever since he broke up with me for another man, i havent been myself. Ive gone to therapy, I've taken the meds, I've done everything thats supposed to make me feel better. Guess what? it fucking hasnt.

Two hours ago, i wrote my note, i cleaned my apartment, and I went to the spot my ex and i shared so many memories at. I tried to end it all, but the gun just fucking went "click". I forgot to re-chamber a fucking round after i cleaned it yesterday. I cant even kill myself correctly.

Im home, and now that I've finished throwing up, I'm lost, my mind and body is in shambles, and I'm really not sure what to do now. Im so lost, i cant reach out to my friends, my family, or anyone close because they dont know how bad its got, and ill lose my dream job. 

Can someone help me?
