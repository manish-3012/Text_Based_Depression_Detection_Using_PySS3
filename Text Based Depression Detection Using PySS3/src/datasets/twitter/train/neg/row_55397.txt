I'm weighed down by a heavy heartI know it might sound stupid, but I'm struggling not to overdose on my anti-depressants. I had a series of breakdowns a few years (4 years) ago because of a bad breakup, and now I'm feeling constantly alone. Over the last few days, my cousin and her boyfriend have been staying at the house, and now I'm feeling sick, seeing how happy they are, and feeling that I'm going to stay this lonely.   


I know all the normal advice, but I can't find the energy to do much more than lay in bed and hope to just stay asleep. The thing I crave is the knowledge that I'm not alone, but all the evidence tells me that I'm too far gone for anyone to want to be with me, and that conclusion is tearing at me like a beast's claws.
