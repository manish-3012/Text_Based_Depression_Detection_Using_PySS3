Slitting My Wrists And Feeling GoodI fantasize about cutting myself open and letting the blood drain out in the bathtub. 2020 fucked me real hard, with getting laid off from my job during the pandemic, social chaos and my parents about to get divorced. I'm stuck living at home like a loser and can only find a part time job that I hate. The meds I take aren't working. I want to feel good again and getting drunk and trying to work up the nerve to ask for help or die is the only way I know how.
