no one actually caresso one of my â€œfriendsâ€ sent me the password accidentally to a group chat thats been around for two years- where all my friends talk about the fact they really donâ€™t like me.
I do theater with these people and I go to school couple of them. Iâ€™ve known a lot of them like my whole life. I just joined the school district freshman year in the middle of it and I really donâ€™t have any friends at school. Just people who text me about hw.
So yah.... sometimes I wonder if I should just go on and kill myself no one actually cares. (edited
