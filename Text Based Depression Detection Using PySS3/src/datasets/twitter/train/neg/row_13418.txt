Please give some tipsHello, I recently moved into uni. A few days ago I made a post talking about my inability to make friends, but recently I managed to make some. I still feel an empty void in my heart that I suspect is because of my hopelessness regarding my financial situation, uni and dating. I constantly take long walks in hope that maybe the pain will stop but it won't. I'm crying as I'm writing this, can anyone please help? Also I called the Samaritans and they didn't answer.
