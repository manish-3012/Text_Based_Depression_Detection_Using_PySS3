What do you do when you have no will to live?I haven't wanted to live for a long time. I don't know if I ever consciously chose life. I'm alive because I have to be--I take care of my mom who has a lot of health problems. 

I have no dreams or desires because I know from experience that I'll never achieve or obtain anything good. 

I don't want to live, but I have to. I don't want to feel the way I do anymore, but this feeling never goes away. I don't know how to make myself fight for life when I don't want it. I don't know how to improve things when I have no desire for anything. I've even let go of wanting to feel better because I never do.
