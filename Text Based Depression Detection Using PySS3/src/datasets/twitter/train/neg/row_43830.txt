don't fucking lienobody likes to help anybody it's annoying i get it whenever my parents ask me if i'm feeling any better i feel it whenever my relatives shy away from speaking to me i feel it whenever my friends ask i feel it and the worst part is when they know you are depressed and suicidal they feel like they have to ask and make sure you're okay but they hate to do it at the same time. i don't want your fucking sympathy. 
i started to act like i'm okay a few months ago and now my parents, my mom in particular acts like i'm faking it since i say i'm okay oh sorry mom i'm using up your money again not like i'd rather waste it on other things or anything
