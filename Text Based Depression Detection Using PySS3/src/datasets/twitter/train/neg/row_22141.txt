Counting the days of my depression: Day #001 I will join Nausicaateso quest.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I showered and brushed my teeth without the urge to fall into the corner of the sink
2. I pet my cats and dog
3. had great sex

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's a great idea from Nausicaateso and I feel like we all should start doing it!
