I think I'm going to do itI've given it a lot of thought, and I think I'm finally going to go through with it. I have a plan, and even a time frame. I'm going to spend the next month getting my affairs in order and making certain I won't be leaving behind loose ends. I've told my best friend what's happening and my decision and he hasn't responded. I don't expect him to.

I honestly haven't felt this calm in a while. I actually kind of feel happy. I can finish what's on my plate, but I don't have to worry about anything coming after. Because nothing is coming after.

I know people will be upset, but I'm upset all the time. I feel immense pain just trying to exist. Why should I have to endure that?

Anyway, I wanted to tell someone. I needed to. So here I am. I am going to end it after August 11th (that's the day the play I'm costuming closes). It was good knowing y'all.
