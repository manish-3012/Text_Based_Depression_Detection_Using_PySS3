Why are you suicidal?Personally I am 26 years old and I lost out on like $100,000 of savings this year from sex work and I only have $30,000 now which is probably only enough as an emergency fund for me so I canâ€™t even spend much of it.  
I was planning to quit sex work and hopefully enter the first real relationship of my life and buy a car or rent somewhere to live etc. 

My family forced me to quit this year or disown me so due to this loss of freedom I became
extremely angry and depressed to the point of feeling suicidal. I also lost almost all my money. If not for them I would have worked all year (covid didnâ€™t affect my area much at all, and I couldâ€™ve worked most of the year safely) and
I would have $200,000 by now. 

I have no friends and no boyfriend and not much family support, at least I would have had my money.
I was hoping to save all that money and spoil myself with a nice car and apartment and also to work much less so I could have time to try meeting friends/boyfriend and so I can study. 
I was also hoping to spoil myself with some surgery for confidence and to be more beautiful, looks honestly helps open so many doors. 

Now Iâ€™m depressed and hope to die before 31 or something and I canâ€™t be bothered to study anymore.
If I donâ€™t have time to look for a partner now I doubt I ever will, letâ€™s be real after 30 the chances for forever alone singles keep dropping to less of a chance to ever get in a relationship. 

At the moment Iâ€™m not feeling depressed or insane enough to kill myself anymore but sometimes I dream about being dead to make myself feel better and it sadly makes me feel a lot better.
