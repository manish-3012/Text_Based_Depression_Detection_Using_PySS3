I cant deal with life anymoreI've seen nothing good out of it. Last year i lost so many people and pets that I love. I have no one else. Due to my offputting looks, anxiety and depression i have never had friends. The way people treated me made me hate people my age. My relatives and pets were my only rock. With most of them dying I cant handle life anymore. I've been suicidal for years. But when things like this hit you its unbearable. My parents are the only ones I live for. I dont want them to feel the pain i feel everyday. But i cant live with that pain for another who knows how many years.
