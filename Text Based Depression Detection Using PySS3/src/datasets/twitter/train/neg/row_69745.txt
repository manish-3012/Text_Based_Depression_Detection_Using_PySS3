I'm really starting to wish nobody cared about me so I could kill myself.Mainly my family. What 'friends' I do have probably wouldn't care if I said genuinely that I wanted to kill myself, I've basically said it before. It sounds bad but my family caring just makes me feel more trapped in life. I'm being forced to live at this point. Gonna go into inpatient soon probably so if that doesn't end up helping at all I might just say fuck it and do it anyway cause that feels like basically my last chance to turn things around
