I'm gonna try and do it tomorrowI am just fucking beyond done and my life hasn't even really started yet. I'm 17 and a senior I'm going to work tomorrow and right when I get home I'm gonna drink a bottle of gin and take a bunch of Xanax. I just fucking can't do anything anymore and I want to cry. I haven't spoke to anyone in 48 hours and I've been laying in bed that fucking long. I'm losing my FUCKING mind. I can't cry anymore.
