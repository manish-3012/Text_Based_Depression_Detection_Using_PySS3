my therapist got happy with my "bucket list". I don't think she understood..some backstory: I owe her some money. Some months ago we had a session which she didn't charge me for because I wasn't okay. She's totally okay with it but I think it's unfair. I talked to her about it and she said if I really want to pay for that, that I can do it whenever I can, there's no rush


last session I brought this subject back because I told her soon I'm going to pay her as this has become part of my list of things to do before dying. She got so happy that I'm making plans for my life.
Honestly I have no idea why I told her about the list, there's only 2 or 3 things in it actually, it can't even be called a list. Probably it was some part of my body begging for help.
I'm a real mess and I'm too far from being something to be proud of. But that was the first time in months that I saw her getting really really happy for me. I know it's wrong but I felt it was cruel to destroy her happiness so I didn't correct her.
I started doing that list because I'm really bad and things are only getting worse. It's not a will to live as she thought, it's actually me trying to finish things before attempting. I couldn't tell her that, I know I should, but I miss that good feeling when people get proud of you...
