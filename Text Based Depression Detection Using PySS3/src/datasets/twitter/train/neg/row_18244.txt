To nice?Why do good people get treated so bad? I've always been the one to do anything for a anyone, met a girl who was in a bad place spent all my spare time helping her, sitting in hospital with her, loving her as much as I could til she was ready for a relationship only for her to fuck around on me, get pregnant to another guy ( I paid for her abortion) only to have her leave 6 months later and is living with another guy. I just want someone to love and hold but I'm ready to give up and die
