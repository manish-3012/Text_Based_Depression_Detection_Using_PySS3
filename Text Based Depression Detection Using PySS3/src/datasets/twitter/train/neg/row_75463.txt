I'm worse than any child molester, rapist or murderer simply because I am an adult virgin with a small penisSounds crazy, but I don't make the rules.

See when it comes to love what really matters if who you are on the inside. This is what we're fed and what we have to believe. There's lots of child molesters, rapists and murderers out there that can find people to love them. But me? Not a chance. So it's only logical to conclude that I am worse than them. My unfortunate hairline? Worse than rape. My small dick? Worse than molesting kids. My status as a 30 year old virgin? Worse than murder. These are the only conclusions I'm allowed to make.

What a world we live in. How could anyone in my situation ever live this this? I am the worst of the worst without doing a damn thing. I have to kill myself because I will never be able to find peace in this world.
