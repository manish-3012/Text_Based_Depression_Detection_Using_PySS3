Why canâ€™t we just choose to die instantly?Iâ€™ve been depressed for a while now and on the edge a huge amount of the time and I just wanted to know why Suicide canâ€™t be easier? Why should I have to hang or shoot myself? Why canâ€™t I just snap my fingers and be gone. Who honestly designed this shit? I just want to be finished and done with life.
