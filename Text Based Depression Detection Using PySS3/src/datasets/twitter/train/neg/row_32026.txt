why do I even bother continuing?today is the first day of distance learning for me and already I feel dead inside. For the first two months of in person learning I kept to myself and sat alone with nobody to talk to I now heavily regret this. I feel so numb and dead I don't have the motivation or drive to do any school work. I know if I stop I will get my ass kicked out but I just can't continue I just want a way out of this living nightmare and the only way out of this living nightmare is death. Nothing anyone says helps me "oh yeah we're here for you" its always the same thing. Nobody can make my suffering end I am stuck in my house doing online school for the next two months, I have very few friends, I'm single, and I don't know what to do anymore. Sometimes I think I don't even deserve love I have never been hugged or kissed by anyone outside of my immediate family. if I do do it I will die a virgin not like that matters. Its only been a day and I'm already losing my mind my strength is waning. Its waning very fast. I just want a soft gentle girl to sweep me off my feet and hold me in her arms
