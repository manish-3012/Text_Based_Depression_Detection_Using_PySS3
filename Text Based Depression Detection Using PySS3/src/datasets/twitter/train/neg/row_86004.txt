Whatâ€™s the point of staying alive if I canâ€™t ever be happy?Iâ€™ve been depressed for as long as I can remember with varying levels of severity over the years. I try so hard to be happy and no matter what my dumb fuck brain wonâ€™t let me be happy EVER. I surround myself with positive people and distance myself from toxic people, I take anti depressants, Iâ€™ve done therapy multiple times to no avail, I work out, I meditate, I eat healthy and stay hydrated, I go out and meet people, I have plenty of friends, I come from a good home and have a loving supportive family, and yet I canâ€™t remember the last time I was genuinely happy. If life even has meaning at all then whatever higher power created me is punishing me for something. Iâ€™m just fucking broken and I canâ€™t be fixed. What the hell is the point of staying alive if itâ€™s constant torture to do so? Iâ€™m so ready to leave this place
