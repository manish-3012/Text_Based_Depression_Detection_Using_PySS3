Body preparation?I know what happens biologically, so to make it easier for the responders, I imagine in a bathtub. Should I not eat for two three days prior, and maybe not drink water for 24 hours? An exit bag should keep me from looking gruesome or painful. Iâ€™m just wondering how to minimize the post death mess. Thank you
