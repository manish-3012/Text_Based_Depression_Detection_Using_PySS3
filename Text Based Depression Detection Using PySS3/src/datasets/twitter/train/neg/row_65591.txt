Generic TitleI left my emotionally abusive partner the other day and now Im so lost. 
He broke me down and took away my happiness and when I finally had enough and left I felt pathetic for letting myself get into that situation. 

I lay here every night not knowing who I am anymore and I want to go back to the set routine I had with him because its all I know. 

I feel weak, I feel pathetic, I am so close to that edge of taking my own life. 
I am no longer a person, Im a broken down mess and there's no coming back from this. 

I honestly do not see myself alive in 1 months time. 

How am I suppose to grow and be stronger from this when I dont have any foundation of me anymore to start from. 

Im going to kill myself soon. It's all I have.
