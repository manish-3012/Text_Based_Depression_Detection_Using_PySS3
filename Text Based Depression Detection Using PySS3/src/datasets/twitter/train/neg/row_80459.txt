Advice Needed - what happens after a friend suicide attempt?I spent 2 days watching a friend who had suddenly started to see things and hear voices.  

I almost brought her to the ER but she seemed to suddenly be sane whenever I decided that was only path.

On the day before Christmas she slipped out the door and jumped under a bus.

After being told she might die, thankfully, the doctors said she will survive! After a few surgeries then 6 weeks to heal internal injuries and broken bones, what happens next? 

Do the ER doctors send her to be inpatient in an psychiatric hospital? Do they send her home? (She has no health care insurance). 

How can I learn about the post-attempt process so I know what the best guidelines are? How can I help her on the path to recovery?  are there any good books or apps or resources where I can find advice and wisdom?

ðŸ‘ thank you for helping!
