7 years with herI am anorexic, I have been dealing with this bullshit since I was 12, got diagnosed when I was 14 and Iâ€™m now 18 and I am facing the hardest relapse ever. 

I feel so alone and ashamed. I feel like no one really understands this fucking miserable illness and Iâ€™m just floating here, alone. 

Iâ€™ve been abusing adderall and Iâ€™ve been sleeping a lot to avoid eating. 

Iâ€™m at uni and i feel like that also adds to the pressure. But overall I feel and look overweight. I canâ€™t possible stress that enough. I fucking LOOK overweight. 

Iâ€™m as thin as a rail when I â€œsnap out of itâ€, 103 pound me thinking she is still 170 pounds. 

Anyways, Iâ€™m making this post because I feel lost and I feel like I canâ€™t recover. Iâ€™ve been dealing with this stupid voice for the past 7 years. 

Itâ€™s non stop. It never fucking stops. God damn it never stops. I feel like itâ€™s a on going music for eternity, haunting me until I die. 

I think Iâ€™ve reached the point that Iâ€™ll do anything to get her and this voice out of my head. I canâ€™t take it anymore. Itâ€™s a constant fight between me, her, and food. I canâ€™t do it anymore. 

7 years of this stupid shit gets tiring. Iâ€™m tired. I want out. I didnâ€™t sign up for this.
