Now not suicidal. Thank you, RedditorsI used to (for years) cycle from baseline of sadness, to suicidal and back. I found that opening up in tears, to therapists and my shelter's staff helped me. Mysteriously, opening up helped me feel ok. 

I have crying spells and fights against my own feelings, but my life doesn't seem too bad. Not too, too bad.
