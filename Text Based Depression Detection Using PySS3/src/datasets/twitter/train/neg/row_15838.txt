Reaching the end, no turning back.Well, saying as I have been depressed for roughly 4 years now...there are a lot of things that get me closer and closer to it. But what happened yesterday made it almost inevitable. I had to do an English project where I created and recorded a song about the play "Macbeth". The recording plans got all jacked up and I resorted to my best friend to help me whip something together last second. He got another one of his friends to "help" us, but he just ended up making a troll video to humilate me and put it on YouTube. I expressed my anger toward my friend (whom I now know is innocent) and it spiraled out of control. Today, he is not my friend anymore...and it was the biggest mistake of my life to be such an ass to him. He blocked all types of my different means of contact, and told his entire YouTube sub base that I am an asshole. I'm sick and tired of being humiliated, and I realized how hard it is for me to be happy without someone that I care about to talk to. 9 years later, I lost my best friend and I'm making plans to take my life as I type this. It will be goodbye soon Reddit, thanks anyway.
