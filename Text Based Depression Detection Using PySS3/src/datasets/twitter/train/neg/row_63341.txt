Feel like it's not possible to get betterI shouldn't be alive anymore. I'm an oxygen thief.

I have borderline personality disorder. I see the way that I act and think and I can't control it anymore. I can't stop the pain and the urge to hurt and kill myself. I can't control my reactions to things and the extreme emotion I feel. Sometimes I just want to scream and scream and scream. I feel like I'm a waste of space in society. I don't think there is any help for me anymore.

I see the pain I cause my boyfriend, my friends, and my family. I barely speak to anyone anymore about how I feel. I can't trust anyone, I feel so alone. I feel like all the therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists don't know how to help me, that they blame me for being this way, for being a pathetic waste of space.

Sometimes I just sit in my room and just slap and punch my face over and over until I bleed. I cut my wrist and bruise myself because I feel like I should punish myself for being such a horrible human being. Sometimes the only response to the pain I feel inside is just more physical pain.

I can't control my actions anymore. Sometimes I want to jump out of the car whilst it's moving. Sometimes I want to jump in front of the train and I really have to stop myself from doing it. Sometimes I want to wake up at 2 am and just walk out into the cold and drown myself in the river. I want my body to float away to a place where nobody can find me.

I feel so alone and I don't think anybody can understand. I don't think there's any hope for me getting better. I don't see any way out of this. I don't see any way out of the borderline. I can't get better and the pain doesn't stop. It's just endless pain and sadness.
