She didn't msg me all day and I feel like I've fucked something up. I just want to die now...feel like there's no reason to wait.I'm in a really rough place right now. I mean, I've been in a rough place for a while now. I'm getting ready to kill myself in just a little more than a week. So yeah, rough. if you want specifics, it's in other posts here on /r/suicidewatch . The important part is that this night, where I haven't heard from her all day, has been even rougher than any of the other days that convinced me suicide was the best of a lot of bad options.

I sent her a VERY bold snapchat last night. Thought she was okay with that. We'd specifically talked about it, agreed it was still perfectly fine and desired. But she opened that snap...and hasn't said shit in the 13 hours since.

And now I feel like I've ruined even the small amount of happiness I was gana get to have before I died. And I can't stop crying.

She's been wearing his ring. I'm not sure it's his, obviously. But it's on a chain around her neck in every picture for the past week. His ring, no interest in me....fuck...I just want to die now.

But I know I gata wait. I just get to keep crying for a few more days. Then nothing. God I can't wait...
