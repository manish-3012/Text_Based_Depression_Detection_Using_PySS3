Nobody caresI don't even know what I'm going to write here.

I've got nobody special in my life. Nobody who loves me, I'm pretty sure even my friends are only just putting up with me. Even my dogs aren't cheering me up today. I don't know what to do, I've tried crisis lines in the past, but all except one time all I've had is someone repeat exactly the same things I've been saying. "Active listening", they call it. Not very helpful.

I'm not sure if I'd say I'm suicidal. I've tried to do that before but I can't. But almost every night I go to sleep hoping I'm not going to wake up the next day. Every day I wake up disappointed.

Where can you even go from here? Is this all I've got to look forward to for the rest of my life?
