Goodbye (not in a death sorta way just goodbye)I am not suicidal but I joined this subreddit because I had a desperate compulsion to try to talk down strangers. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s ever worked, I know some people are dead now. I canâ€™t bring myself to leave. This happened after I took on too much responsibility for my boyfriendâ€™s mental health. It didnâ€™t end well, he got obsessive, things became toxic. It hurt to break up with him. Especially since he tried to kill himself after, poorly but he tried. A few weeks later I started dating another boy and only three days in my ex stabbed him. I wasnâ€™t a witness, but Iâ€™ll never see my ex again. That boyfriend broke up with me a week later for another girl, typical. Iâ€™ve been a mess for a while, emotionally. It hurts for a lot of reasons and I canâ€™t seem to get over this past year. There are so many reminders of my ex, good memories and bad memories that feel surreal. This sub reminds me of him just the same, he posted here before he tried to commit suicide and everyone saw it. I hope no one I know dares to comment under this rant but this is goodbye. Thankyou for reading my pitch for a modern Shakespearean tragedy.
