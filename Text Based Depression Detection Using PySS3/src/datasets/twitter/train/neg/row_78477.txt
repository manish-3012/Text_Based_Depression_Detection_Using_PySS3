Thoughts just keep coming backIâ€™m 22 finished Uni and throughout my time just felt increasingly lonely and unable to be proper friends with people. I feel like whatever I do with people they just never want me as their friend - never being messaged or asked to things.

Since Uni I have just become crippling my lonely as people drift away and donâ€™t care about you despite my efforts - sick of always being on the outside for so many years and just always reverts back to wanting to end it all as it never gets better 

Just tired of it
