BrokenI think I'm ready to die. The past 10 years have come and gone so fast and I haven't done anything. I'm 29 years old and after dropping out of college at 20 I have worked basically minimum wage and scraped by financially every month. I haven't made friends or had relationships. Its so painful knowing I can't go back and try to make my life work. I have no path forward. No way to get a career. I've suffered with depression, ADHD, and social anxiety which I guess is why I quit on my life 10 years ago and why Im here now. If you are a young person please don't isolate and give up like I did. I don't want to live to 30 at this point everything is so painful
