I have to say something about my problemsMy lifeâ€™s been on a downward slope for years and hasnâ€™t gotten better. For about a year Iâ€™ve been considering suicide but have always had that thing in me that stops me. My past year Iâ€™ve been nothing but suffering, I try to make people happy so i know they wonâ€™t suffer as much as me and others I know suffer too. I ended up losing the only person Iâ€™ve ever loved a few months ago and I have been feeling like thatâ€™s the final straw. I just need support cause I know life isnâ€™t for me, but I still donâ€™t want to die deep down. I want to try to fix my mental state. Iâ€™m getting close to finally giving with my life I feel.
