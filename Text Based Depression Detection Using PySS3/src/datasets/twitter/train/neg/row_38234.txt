I can't kill myself because I'm paying off my carso i just got a car last saturday and I'm 19 so i have no credit prior to this. my brother thankfully cosigned for my car, but the problem now is that i can't kill myself because then my brother will face the consequences and that makes me feel even more guilty. sucks too cause i got a loan for 3 1/2 years and I'm barely able to make payments on it cause I'm working a shitty dead end job that makes me miserable.  life just sucks
