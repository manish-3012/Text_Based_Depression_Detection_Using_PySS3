I cut and I donâ€™t really want to die now that I think about itIâ€™m so stupid. God, so fucking stupid. Iâ€™m probably gonna get downvoted to hell and back. Anyway, here goes.
So this year has been shit. Completely and utterly. Iâ€™ve posted once talking about how I felt my whole life was crumbling before my eyes. No need to repeat myself (Iâ€™ve been regurgitating the same words to describe my problem to different members of my family these last few days) long story short, Iâ€™ve failed a decisive exam and am probably gonna get kicked out of my college. Just 22 months ago I was living my best life when everything took a sudden nosedive for the worse. Letâ€™s just keep it at that.
Iâ€™ve been thinking about offing myself everyday for the duration of my predicament. I hadnâ€™t started contemplating it seriously until a week ago. I started weighing down my options, trying to find something painless and effective (cuz Iâ€™m a coward really). I settled for cutting. I know it may seem edgy and kinda stupid but Iâ€™m 19 and I found it surprisingly soothing. Iâ€™m a rational person and I can recognize when Iâ€™m attention whoring but cutting really gave me a respite that hours of aimless crying didnâ€™t before.
Anyway, today I thought I really was gonna end it. So I cut a little bit too deep. I caught horizontally and it didnâ€™t draw blood (at all our kitchen knives are shit) but it left an angry swollen red line beneath the scars and I noticed that my blue veins are alot more pronounced and kinda popping.
What Iâ€™ve realized is that I donâ€™t really want to die. But I read somewhere on the internet that you can bleed out INTERNALLY and not find out. Am I gonna bite it? Iâ€™m so angry at myself for being this fucking stupid. Wtf am I gonna do?
