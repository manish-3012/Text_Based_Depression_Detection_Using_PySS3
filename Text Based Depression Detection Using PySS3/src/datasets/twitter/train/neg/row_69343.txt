I shouldn't want to diei feel like i should be happy, i shouldn't want to die, i shouldnt hate myself so much, i have everything anyone would ever want, and i don't want anything more i really don't, i just don't want any of this, i just wish i never existed in the first place.

i feel like every single day is too much, like breathing is too much, walking is too much, every little desicion is too much, i want a break of everything so that maybe i'll feel more ready to wake up every morning.

i am doing well, nothing to complain about, i know, my studies are going well, i have people around me, they're great, i dont deserve them, they helped me through a lot of breakdowns although i should have never bothered them with this.

i can keep on living for a little longer, but i dont see why, it feels like a duty that im not fit for.

i don't want to keep feeling this way, i know i shouldnt feel this way, i should be happy and living my best life atm, but i'm barely holding onto it.

i hope you can make sense of this cause it's hard for me to put it in a better way.
