Having friends but not being able to talk to themIm sure many people can relate to this, i have a few people that i'd say im close with ( around 7 including online friends ) but no matter how close i get to them i will always hate talking about suicide and my struggles.

Everyone has their own problems to deal with and i feel as if i start projecting mine onto others i'll be seen as more of a burden.Only a few people know about my tendencies and that's only because they've found out by accident, even on those few occasions i've always felt to bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Many of us have plans, mine are for 6 months from now. Nobody knows though and i intend on keeping it that way.I have put way too much effort into prepping this for it to be shut down.

It would be nice to be able to talk to them or just cry in the arms of another but thats just a fantasy, in reality im going to die alone, in the middle of no where and only to be discovered once my corpse has started to decay.
