My mom told me to "just die"Im struggling this morning, couldnt look in the mirror

I'm 17, having trouble attending school

Spoke with my mom about what I should do (go vs stay home) and she was frustrated with me in what felt like seconds. We avoid all talk of depression or mental health with her because it irritates her, so in times like these we get nowhere.

But I also don't have anyone else.

I told her that I just wanted to disappear and she snapped and said, "okay then, just die!" I don't think she meant it but it felt like being stabbed. It's been 15 minutes and she left the house, took my car, I'm alone with my dad (not safe). I texted my friends and no one can pick me up. This doubt is creeping up on me and I want to go get the cyclobenzaprine and xanax in my medicine cabinet and chase it with vodka, or the knife sitting five feet away and slice open my thighs. I want to. I want to. If I kick out the screen I can get through the window, but there's nowhere for me to go. I need to disappear.
