I am pushing away my angel from me...No angel ever gave up, but they can't fight the gods way. Even in revolt and fighting against they lose as they believed on a lie. The archangel of you and your protection may crumble. They are mischievous and infants made to give wordily protection on a stranger face or even on any other form. In iconos or in spirit, blind and thoughtless...

Today it's a day that means I never and will not gave up on the world but it feels like my help sells my soul to oblivion and to everything that I hate the most. I am pushing away my angel from me denying this and inflicting myself this. I feel that nothing will help anymore, I'm vulnerable and helpless as I never felt before.
