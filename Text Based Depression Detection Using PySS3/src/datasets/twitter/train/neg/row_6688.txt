How can I get some help without losing everything?So my internet friends and like one person in real life are my only support system and I lost all my internet friends over one weekend. It's not fair to the one left over to deal with all my shit, so I need some kind of professional help before I hang myself or walk in front of a bus. 

But the thing is, I don't have healthcare because I'm American and poor, so I can't see a therapist. The low income clinic is inaccessible since I can't drive. (A bus trip is like a mile walk in 90 degree heat plus an hour long ride.)

I could call a crisis line, but I'm afraid they'd throw me in a mental institution. If I was locked up for a 72 hour hold, I'd go 3 days without pay, which would mean I wouldn't be able to pay my rent and I'd end up homeless (and/or begging for food), just making everything worse. Also being locked up like a prisoner is fucking miserable for my anxiety. 

I'm so alone I literally want to die and can't turn to anyone without destroying everything.
