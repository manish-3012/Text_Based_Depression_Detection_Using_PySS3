I have decided to end it allI have no friends also my crush has boyfriend now. We have been known each other for more than 2 years. And we know most of our secrets, we were just more than best friends. Shared everything. But now she has a boyfriend and isn't keen on chatting with me anymore.
We were in a deep relationship. Now i have no one to lean on... She was my everything..
I have nothing but good looking face lol....

I have decided to end it all so what is the best suicide method...
just tell me please.  

Edit: I have a good sense of humour and I'm nice guy but people are moving further when i try to be nicer
