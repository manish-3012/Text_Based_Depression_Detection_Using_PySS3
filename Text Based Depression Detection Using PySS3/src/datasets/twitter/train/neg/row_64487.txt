Why doesn't anyone want me around.My own family. My friends I use to have. My girlfriend. Myself. I hate myself. I'm can't do normal people life. It's all the same fucking rehashed bullshit over and over. I hurt so fucking bad... I can't even get anyone to fucking talk to me for more than a day. I'm so tired of begging for friendship. Love. Respect. Fucking anything so that I don't fucking feel empty all the time. I just have melt down after meltdown. I can't do anything right. Probably can't even kill myself right. I'm so tired of this. Fucking a lifetime of this. Why do i even try. Why am I still here. I just want to fucking die and it fucking sucks. I wish I had ended all this a long time ago. Why do I wait for everyone. I always just wait and wait and wait. It's fucking unfair.
