In the last week I have attempted 3xMy fiancee and her family do not see eye to eye with my family. This lead to a huge divide between both of our families. I love her to death and do not see myself with anyone but her, she is my world. 
I am not sure if we are broken up forever or I am just giving her a break from me and my family. 
I cannot live without he, I cannot be myself, I am not me without her she is and always will be my better half. I am going to end it all soon I just have to figure out how. I want to fix the situation but I do not see how I can, my only way out is this way.
