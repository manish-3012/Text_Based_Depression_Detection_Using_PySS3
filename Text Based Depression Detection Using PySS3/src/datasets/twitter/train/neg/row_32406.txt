iâ€™m no oneiâ€™m just an empty sack of shit who doesnâ€™t belong anywhere, no one talks to me anymore, iâ€™m being ignored by everyone and just being let down by everyone.

i cut myself earlier today and iâ€™m doin it now, am i only destined to feel pain?

everything hurts and i feel like i am just nothing to everyone.

iâ€™m no one. and i deserve to die and bleed out.

i hope you find my body and regret everything you did to me.

maybe iâ€™ll fine find peace....good bye.
