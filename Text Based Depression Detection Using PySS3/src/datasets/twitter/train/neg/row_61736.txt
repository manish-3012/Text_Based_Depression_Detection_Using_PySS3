What do you do the day after you didn't die?I was gonna off myself yesterday. Usually I can get settled down enough to tell myself to go to sleep and see how I feel when I wake up, but it wasn't happening. I had everything ready. Long story short, a weird and minor event resulted in me falling asleep and here I am (obviously).


Now I just feel strange. I have a terrible headache. It's like yesterday was my window and it closed. It's so odd to see everyone going about their day not knowing what could have happened, or just seeing that everything would continue as normal if I went through with it.


What have you done the day after? I'm not sure. I think I'll buy some cereal.
