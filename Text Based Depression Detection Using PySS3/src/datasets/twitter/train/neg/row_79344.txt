Uk guy (44m)Well its been 7 days since i was stopped from killing myself. In that time i have had another failed attempt and have begun to cut myself.

I have reached out to crisis centres and my GP. all of whom told me that im not a serious risk. 

As i write this i just dont know what to do. Im single, ugly and pretty vulnerable now. I dint want to die but says it all when cutting myself is a viable option. 

I work in a hospital and the pressures are immense right now. I dont drink or take drugs but my cigarette intake is up to at least 40 a day. As sad as it sounds i just want a friend to talk to. Someone for me to ask how their day was. Anything to take my mind away from how utterly hopeless and useless i feel. 

Im worried that my 3rd suicide attempt will be successful. But then again i just want the pain to stop. If the relevant services here dont give a shit about me why should i give a shit about me.
