The meds are not working any more. As I sit here at my mothers dining room table the only thing I can
 think about is the noose I made and have hid so she doesn't find it.
I have had two stays at a mental health facility in the past 30 days.
My meds have been adjusted and readjusted.
My girlfriend of two years has no clue how to handle the severe bi-polar disorder I have and has been talking to other guys. I know she has, and I don't blame her. I can barely stand myself. Why should anyone else be forced to deal with me?

 I am broke, my car is in my girlfriends name, my job is in serious jeopardy and all of my friends are sick of my depression. On top of all of that anytime I show any type of emotion about anything I am told that it's my bi-polar disorder. I can not be sad,mad,or happy without it being blamed on being bi-polar. I cant even watch some King of the Hill and laugh because I am reminded that when I laugh she doesn't know if it is real or just my illness. 

 I do have two wonderful children who I love. They are young enough that if I hung myself they would forget me pretty quick. They would be better off. I used to go to Chicago and just walk around when I get really depressed and I didn't feel my meds worked. I can not make the hour and a half drive there any more. 

 I do not know what to do. I have called the suicide hotline, I have called my support group , I have reached out again and no one is there. I just don't want to burden anyone anymore. I just want to feel free.

 Making my noose was the most calming moment of this past week. I felt euphoric.

I have nothing. I am nothing.
