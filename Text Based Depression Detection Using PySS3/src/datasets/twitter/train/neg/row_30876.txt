My wife has had an emotional or physical affair on me (I may never know) - Trying to rebuild, but I keep screwing up.I am in so much pain right now. I have spent so much time at the ER, just so I could check myself in if I got to a dark place. Tonight, I don't want to - I want to be alone, and that scares the shit out of me.
