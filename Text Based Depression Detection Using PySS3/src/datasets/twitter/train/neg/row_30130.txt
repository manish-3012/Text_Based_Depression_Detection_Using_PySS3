Tough jobA year ago I left a good but tough job in the oilfield.  By tough I mean 16 hour shifts and lots of heavy manual labor.  I had to take lots of ibuprofen but after a year and a half my body had toughened up to it and I was in great shape.  But I was getting burnt out.  My crew got split up and I was left to float from crew to crew.  I had saved a ton of money and felt like I was in a position to leave and find something better.  Also I had to fudge my CDL hours which could have led to losing my CDL so I was stressing about that.  But as soon as I quit I realized it was a huge mistake and I spiraled into a depression.  Attempted to hang myself but didn't succeed.  Then coronavirus happened and they laid a bunch of people off and couldn't go back anyways.  I have a non oilfield job now but I don't see myself succeeding at it.  There's a chance that I might be able to get back on in the oilfield because I still have connections out there.  But I'm out of shape, my mental health is not good.  I don't want to go back out there and be a mess.  Go through all the pain of getting in that kind of shape.  My back is weak now and it will hurt bad.  Was going to commit today, but I know it will hurt a lot of people.
