Boyfriend said mean things to me when I opened up to him about my suicidal thoughts.I have been struggling with hidden depression and CPTSD for a few monhs now. Lately, I started having suicidal  thoughts for a month or so, I told him I cant take any pain this more. I will try to heal but if I can't in 10 years I'd rather die and I explained why I think assisted suicide should be available to everyone. 

He called me a fucking asshole , that I am romantisizing it and I should stop feeling sorry for myself.
