Being isolated is driving me insane.Everybody gave up on me after many times I've cried for help. I have a private crisis counselor and therapist for bipolar disorder. Last night, I wore gloves and cut through them. The polar vortex is hitting my area hard, and I stayed outside to see if frostbite could kill me. I went to the pier the same night and contemplated to drown myself.

Right at the moment, I have a knife in my hand. I just like the feeling. I refuse to tell my parents because my mom would be in danger. My dad blames her for everything negative that ever happened to me. He made threats to kill her. My dad believes anyone with suicidal thoughts should just commit suicide. He told me this right in my face. The better, he doesn't believe in mental health diagnoses.

My boyfriend is doing the best that he can for me. He feels helpless, and I've hesitated to talk to him. I'm in college far away from anyone that I know. I don't know where else to turn anymore.

I made this decision to return to college to improve my grades from a 0.4 GPA I earned last year. People at my college witnessed the rage episodes and meltdowns in public and on social media. People give me weird looks, like I'm mentally insane. I feel so isolated and reluctant to even be on campus. I've strayed away from anything having to do with it. I want to transfer as soon as I'm out of academic probation.

I really can't take it here anymore. The isolation is driving me crazy, and I don't know what would be the best option for me right now.

Please help me.
