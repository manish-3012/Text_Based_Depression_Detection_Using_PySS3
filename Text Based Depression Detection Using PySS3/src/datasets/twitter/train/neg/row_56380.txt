Why do I feel this way.I just can't deal with things. I get angry, I scream at my kids I just want to be alone. Better yet I just want to be gone.

I have dreams of finding out that I have cancer or of dying in a car crash and those dreams make me feel happier.

I don't see a reason to be here. I contribute nothing. No one would really miss me. People would  e better off with me not around. I just can't seem to manage to find any light right now.

I have tried medication, and counseling. I apparently failed at those too. Maybe I'll just overeat until I explode... That works right.

Sorry for the rant just needed to get it out there.
