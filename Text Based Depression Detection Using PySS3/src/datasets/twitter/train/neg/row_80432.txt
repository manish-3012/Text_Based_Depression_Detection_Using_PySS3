I need help. Acknowledging it is the first step, right?Background info: Panromantic asexual, trigender
I have this friend, 'K'. I have another friend, 'M'. Long story short, I tell K I love her after a year of keeping it secret. She loves me too but decides she's not ready for a relationship, which I repect. A day later she's dating M. This hurts so I tell M and... they both think I'm overreacting. So that's tier 1 on the cake.
Next comes loneliness. Rejected outright, I'm upset but every little thing goes wrong which makes things worse. I become lonely and slowly more withdrawn. Bullying starts and I start to become confused about my gender. I self-harm occasionally. Eventually all of this mixed together is too much and I start to consider suicide. Pain and confusion and fear swirl in my mind and I'm wondering if death is so bad. My friends help me through it.
But its starting again. This time it shows and people can see that I'm a sad, broken freak. I'm considering suicide again. Please help.
