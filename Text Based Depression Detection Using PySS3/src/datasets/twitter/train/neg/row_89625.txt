Itâ€™s inevitableIâ€™m going to kill myself. Not today or tomorrow, but eventually. One day Iâ€™ll decide Iâ€™ve had enough, put a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger. Iâ€™ve gone through depression, thought I beat it, but it comes back. I hate myself, even though sometimes I retain some sense of pride for whatever unimportant thing I did, I still donâ€™t love myself. One day, Iâ€™ll finally end it. But for now I endure.
