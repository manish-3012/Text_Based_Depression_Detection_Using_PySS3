Everything seems good in my life. But I still want to die...First of all, my name is Jorge, I'm 19 years old. I suffer from depression and panic attacks. I am in treatment with pills and everything.

Everything in my life seems good. I have good family and our relationship is good, our economical situation is normal, I have a lot of good friends, I'm studying music theory, I have a band that is going a little big in our city, I'm going to the gym and have lost a little weight, and I'm also drawing a lot lately. Everyone is supportive, everyone is caring.

The thing is, I don't know why, but it never seems enough. I feel like I have a hole in my heart that can't be filled. Even though I am doing a lot of things with my life, I feel like I'm going nowhere. I already tried to commit suicide several times, none of them succesful in any way.

I don't know what to do, I don't know where to go. Everybody tries to help, but I feel like a hopeless person. Every night the same thoughts pass through my head, and I don't know how to express it.

I am an open book. You can ask me anything you want and I will answer. But please help my safe myself.
