I have lost the will to live20 years old and everyday i think what is the point? Waking up at 6 dead tired and go to work, come home, eat and then pretty much go to sleep so i can even get up in the morning. Doing this for another 40-50 years?

I spend most of my free time imagining suicide methods and what would happen after. When i was driving over a small bridge that goes above a train track my first thought was "i can come here later and jump"

I cant enjoy my free time at all anymore, i cant do any of my old hobbies because all i can think of is how much time there is left until it is time to work again. If im doing something on a sunday ill just look at the clock every 5 minutes thinking "great now its only 14 hours 35 minutes until i must wake up and go to work instead of 14 hours 40 minutes.

There is nothing i want to do or want to become. For years ive been asked "What do you want to become? Is there nothing you want to work with when you grow up?" and my answer has always been i dont know. Ive applied for schools just so my parents or people i know think i have some kind of plan but in reality i just want to lie down and die. 

I did try to knife myself in the stomach but only got about 3 centimeters in before i gave up.

In short i have nothing to look forward to but everyday i dread the comming of tomorrow.
