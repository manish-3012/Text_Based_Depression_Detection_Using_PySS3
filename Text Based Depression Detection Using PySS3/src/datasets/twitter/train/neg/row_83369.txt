byeHello guys ! Iâ€™m a nineteen years old from *****, Iâ€™m passionate about computers, technology, music and many other things. Right now Iâ€™m supposed to be studying for my entrance exams to med school, sadly I just canâ€™t bring myself to, not sure if itâ€™s lazyness, stress, or maybe even depression but I havenâ€™t been able to work at all in the past 3 months. My exams are very competitive so that means I will 100% fail them. I guess thatâ€™s sucks, but itâ€™s not the end of the world, all that means is that Iâ€™ve wasted the last 2 years of my life and that my parents will be extremely disappointed in me.

By the way I canâ€™t retake the exams, so I guess Iâ€™ll live with regret for the rest of my life,wishing that I wouldâ€™ve worked harder during these months leading up to the exams. Sucks to suck I guess, Iâ€™ll just have to keep grinding and get a different degree.

Except Iâ€™m just tired, to be honest, I donâ€™t want to work anymore, I donâ€™t want to make any efforts. Having an enjoyable life is way too much work, Iâ€™ve already made a big mess of my life and I donâ€™t want to clean it up. Why would I even try ? Even if I pull through nothing is waiting for me at the end of the tunnel, most things I enjoy are very superficial and arenâ€™t worth all this work.
I donâ€™t want to live my life with huge regrets, disappointed parents, and broken dreams, Iâ€™d rather end it now and be done with it.
I understand lots of people are a lot worse of than me, Iâ€™m as privileged as it get, Iâ€™m constantly reminded of that yet all it does is make me feel empty inside because of all that potential is wasted on me. I truly wish I could give my life to someone else.

I also understand suicide is a selfish act and a coward solution, but I guess I wonâ€™t feel bad when Iâ€™m dead, I wonâ€™t feel anything anymore.
Sucks for my family who truly love me and who wonâ€™t see it coming, sucks for my gf but Iâ€™m sure sheâ€™ll get over it, sucks for my friends but fuckâ€™em anyways.
For once Iâ€™ll do something for myself.
I canâ€™t work anymore, Iâ€™m tired.
