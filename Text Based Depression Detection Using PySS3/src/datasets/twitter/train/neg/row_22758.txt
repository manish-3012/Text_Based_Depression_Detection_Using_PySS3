Just an ugly ventIdk how I'm still alive at this point. I don't know how I got through this year. my mom clearly thinks I'm a fuck up who can't do anything right (she just gave me a lecture on how I can't do anything eight and how I'm gonna fail at life for the 50th time this year) but she won't let me go for some reason? Her logic is so confusing lmao. One day she's telling me how wonderful of a daughter I am and the next she's telling me all this. 

I can't tell you how many times I wanted to kill myself this year. My aunt (shes like the only person I can talk about my depression to) had to talk me out of it like twice. I even looked up suicide methods a couple of times,one time I even wrote a suicide note, cause that's how badly I wanted to do it. Only reason I didn't go through with it because I couldn't find one that was painless and I didn't want to hurt my family like that. They'd get over it eventually, but I care about them too much to put them through that, even if it's only temporary. I just.... Hate being alive. I hate myself, I hate this planet, I wish I could just die. 

Now I have a pet guinea pig, and I'm only here for him. He's super attached to me, he'd definitely be sad if I'm gone. He's like... The only reason why I even get up in the morning. 

I know I'm only 16, I've got my whole life ahead of me, blah blah. I've heard it all. But why should I hang on if it's so hard to go through?

 I'll probably feel better tomorrow anyways though, don't worry about me. I just needed to get this out.
