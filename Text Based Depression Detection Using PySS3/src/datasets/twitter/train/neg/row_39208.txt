ThoughtsI most likely will not make it past my 27th, if i do..30 will be pushing it. I feel like slipping into a coma and not waking up from my sleep.

Too many issues to address, still no light at the end of the tunnel. I thought finding work would solve it..nope. The happiness I've lost is irreplaceable. Now I'm just an empty hollow shell and people see right through me. People can spot my impending doom it seems.

I have it all, yet I have nothing at all.
