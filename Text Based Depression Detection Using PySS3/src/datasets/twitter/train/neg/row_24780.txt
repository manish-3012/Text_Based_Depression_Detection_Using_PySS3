Not even worthy of this subredditI'm not in poverty, or broken up with anyone, or have suffered abused, or dropping out, or any stories worth talking about. There is absolutely nothing special about me that can shed me in any empathic and sympathic light. 

Yet eventually I suffer, avoid and even resent almost all people. I am constantly thinking about being dead instead. I want to end my asocial and worthless life, but I lack conviction and courage to do it. But still I think about it all the time.

There is not going to be any replies, and even there is, I'm going to act like a troll. Because I hate and long for human at the same time. So I attract and cry out and then being a dick and shy away and rinse repeat.
