Compartmentalization Keeps Me GoingI think the only thing keeping me going can be summed up with one word. Compartmentalization.

I made it through today. One foot in front of the other. This morning started out pretty bad, dealt with grandparents getting pissed off at me for requiring their help yet again. They made it known it was â€œthe last timeâ€. Like I didnâ€™t already expect that. Like I needed to hear all the things they said that Iâ€™ve already considered over and over. For some perspective Iâ€™m in my mid thirties, only I thing Iâ€™ve accomplished is fucking things up worse than I had in my teens.

Went to a hostel, my last resort beyond the streets. And if I I wind up on the streets then the line Iâ€™m walking will probably get thin enough for me to slip off.

But it didnâ€™t happen. The application to rent by the month for a significantly reduced price actually went through in only an hour and a half. I couldnâ€™t believe it. It was such a singular yet insurmountable barrier.

Today I made it one step further than I expected to.

But if Iâ€™m being honest, with all the shadows crowding around me, itâ€™s only my ability to compartmentalize that I think is letting me proceed one step at a time. I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s not the healthy way to deal with things itâ€™s literally the only thing keeping me going. Cracking jokes in another subreddit about a game. Watching The Mandalorian or The Witcher while the walls are figuratively burning around me. These blinders I put on are pretty much it.

I canâ€™t think about the future or the past or whatâ€™s around me, just one foot in front of the other for now. Today I took one more step. I overcame a barrier that could have ended me.

Maybe you can too.

I also just wanted to say thank you to everyone venting on this sub. Every few minutes thereâ€™s a new post. It breaks me to consider that, yet in some messed up way itâ€™s helping me too.
