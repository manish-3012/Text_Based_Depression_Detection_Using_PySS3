I will never be of useI will never be of use to anybody. I have absolutely no skills and bring nobody joy. I lost my dream job 8 months ago due to my own incompetence and rude behavior and have no desire to search for another. I have no will to better myself anymore. My wife takes complete care of me. I donâ€™t do chores, cook, or work, so what use am I to society? The only thing I do is wallow in my own misery with no desire to even crawl out of this pit Iâ€™ve put myself into. Being able to sit and do whatever I want all day is most peopleâ€™s dream, but itâ€™s my prison. I donâ€™t leave the house at all, Iâ€™ve even started to become afraid of it. I have absolutely no hope for the future, and Iâ€™m only in my early 20s. What has kept me alive from these past attempts? Why am I still hanging on? All Iâ€™m doing is making the lives of others completely miserable. I have no friends, no life, no skills, nothing to offer to the world. I will never be of use to anybody, so why should I waste valuable resources like food, money, and time by continuing to live? Killing myself would lift a weight off of the few people I have left in my life. Killing myself would be the least selfish thing I could ever do, considering all that I do is take from others with no regard for how Iâ€™m affecting them negatively. Iâ€™m a complete waste of space, and no matter how much you tell me Iâ€™m not youâ€™re just someone on the internet, and this is just a throwaway account. No matter how many of you feel the same, or try to offer advice the truth is that nobody cares. If I donâ€™t care about a single one of you why would you care about me? Iâ€™m nobody, just another waste of a human lost in the obscurity of the internet. No personality to speak of, no skills to help others, and no use to society. I should just get it over with and die already.
