Wish I could of enjoyed one more high firstLets face it i have out lived my usefulness. My life has peaked, the love of my life is dead, and all family has long left me behind for reasons I cant even understand or fathom that would justify leaving me like this for all the sacrifice i put in. Guess blood isnt always thicker then water, atleast I got to experience alot more then the average person as far as things without money are concerned. I just dont have the strength to walk through anymore and have always thought about doing this even when i was 'happy' or content in life, and recurring thought from the age of 10 im 24 now. I have given the time for things to change but they only progressively got worse. Sadly the only thing that probably kept me here as long as i did was my dog for the unconditional love and the self medicating. Its been a long walk alone on a dark road and my feet are tired. So long good bye
