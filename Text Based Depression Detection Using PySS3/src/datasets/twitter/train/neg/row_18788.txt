Iâ€™m numb to emotions, Iâ€™m readyIâ€™ve been hanging on and staying alive for other people since I was hospitalized for an attempt 1.5 years ago. Itâ€™s been really hard, but I have people I love whoâ€™ve said that their lives will be forever changed. Iâ€™m normally an emotional and empathetic person, so this was really keeping me alive. 

Since last night though, Iâ€™ve felt very numb and alone and I think Iâ€™m ready. 

I canâ€™t even finish my suicide notes. I just want to die.
