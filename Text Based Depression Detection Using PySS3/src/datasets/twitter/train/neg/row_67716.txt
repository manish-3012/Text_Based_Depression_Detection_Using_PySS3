What's the pointIt's been a year since I became depressed and I'm sick and tired of this shit. Life's a joke there's no true aim and work is just a  form of modern day slavery. I've gotten to the age where I must go to work to earn but I cannot under any circumstance get in the state of mind to go find a job. I want to die. I'd rather die than work and that is not me being lazy. I give up there is no hope for people like me. Although I can't bring myself to do it I want out.
