On the edgeI have been emotionally and physically abused by my alcoholic father every month since I was 10. He always attacks me whenever heâ€™s drunk and vents his anger out on me. My parents argue all the time whenever he drinks, but Iâ€™m always the main victim every time. I canâ€™t help but feel like my family allows him to abuse me. He doesnâ€™t think of me as his son, and apparently he never did. He always yells â€œYouâ€™re not my sonâ€ at me. My mom, the only person I have that can protect me, never does anything serious, and with that I mean she might say something at the time. But the following day, they all act like nothing happens (with each other), heâ€™ll ignore my entire existence, and when heâ€™s drunk again heâ€™ll attack me. Its the same loop that has continued for so many years, he drinks at least half the month, every month. 

He kicked my eye one time when i was 12 which damaged my vision on my right eye. He broke my hand and wrist when I was 16. One time when I was 17 he grabbed me by my hair and started punching me all over my body, while trying to shield my face, I accidentally hit his teeth with my elbow (Iâ€™m a lot taller than he is) and knocked 2 of his teeth out (he has bad teeth due to years of alcohol and smoking). There are so many more occurrences of him being physically aggressive towards me, but I decided to keep it short. 

Ultimately, I cannot help that the rest of my family members (my older sister and mom), allow him to abuse me. Iâ€™m sick and tired of this. I donâ€™t feel like I belong here, if they loved me they wouldnâ€™t let this happen, would they? A whole decade of this drained everything out of me. My mom wonâ€™t let me defend myself, claiming someone should never hit their father etc. Traditions etc. And all that bullshit. She says stuff like â€œA child should never hit their father even if theyâ€™re father is trying to kill him.â€ My family is Asian and where theyâ€™re from they have all these weird folklore made by sheep herders and illiterate government officials. I havenâ€™t received help from anyone and the situation continues as I am writing this. The fact that weâ€™re in lockdown due to a covid outbreak in my city doesnâ€™t help. He has no issues with any other family members, just me.

I want to beat him up to a pulp, I am physically able to, but its my mom that stops me. I donâ€™t want to break her heart, but at the same time I canâ€™t take this anymore. Now every time I see his face I canâ€™t help to desire to beat him up to a bloody pulp and kicking him out to the streets. I canâ€™t take it anymore, one of us has to go and I feel like I should be the one to go, as they defend that alcoholic piece of shit.
