I'm becoming a monster. It has to end.Too much anger. I can't accepting facts anymore. Accusing me of being wrong when I'm absolutely sure I've got my facts straight makes me want to punch faces in. Stupid dog being stupid stops being cute and becomes annoying.

I'm at a point where I get agitated like Nic Cage in his prime before I even realize it. It's a running gag at my workplace.

Unable to learn, unable to stay focused. No improvement in life.

Unable to open myself up. Can't show my mother how much I love her. Still punishing her for things she did 20 years ago, but only harming myself. Same with silblings. If it wasn't for my nieces and nephews I'd not even see them anymore.

I've seen about five or so psychologists and two shrinks. The battle is too big though. 

I finally know how I'm gonna do it. It's gonna be quick and painless. I'll fix things beforehand, so nobody has to worry about a single thing when I'm gone. I'll sell stuff and put everything else in boxes with names on them. 

I might have to wait until my mother dies, though. She went through alot of shit, and my death would be the final nail in her coffin.

But in the long run, there's no point in fighting.
