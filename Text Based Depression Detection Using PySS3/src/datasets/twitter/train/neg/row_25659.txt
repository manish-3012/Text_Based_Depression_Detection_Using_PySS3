My mom is the only thing stopping me.I hate my life. My life is centered around music but I'm mediocre at it. I've never been good at school, I don't have any friends, I found the love of my life but that ended, blah blah blah, the usual. At night when I go to sleep I hold back tears and my chest feels heavy. I've felt this way for most of my life. Nothing is worth it to me, except my mother. She is my everything.
    I was raised an only child by my single mom. My mom is still single, her dog is getting old, and I just moved back in with her because she moved closer to where I work and go to school. I'm all she's got. She is an incredible person and she's given me the most unconditional love. She has struggled and endured so much throughout my life just to make sure I have gotten everything I need. She knows I'm sad and tries to help, but she can't. 
    I'm just looking for a reason to live or a reason to die. I've already written letters, I have a life insurance plan to get money for my mom when I die. I'm in this awkward grey area because I want to be dead but I don't want her to hurt.
