My disability is ruining my life, and my parents make me regret being bornNothing I do is ever enough for them because I can never do enough. Iâ€™m in too much pain. They punish me for this constantly and tell me that i need to help more. I want to help more. But I canâ€™t. I can barely sit up some days and cry a lot from both mental and physical pain. They yell at me when I break down and canâ€™t move. They yell at me when I donâ€™t spend time with them even though when Iâ€™m around them I just make them feel bad and guilty. If I show the smallest bit of pain around them they start acting like they hate me.

Iâ€™m non-binary, my parents are apparently grieving my â€œcisâ€ self as well. Theyâ€™re transphobic all the time even though they donâ€™t mean to be. Iâ€™ve tried telling them how much theyâ€™re hurting me but they never seem to care. They just say Iâ€™m hurting them by being non-binary and being in pain.

I canâ€™t do a lot of the things I want to and my parents make me not even want to try since I know itâ€™ll never be good enough. Weâ€™re starting to be a little low on cash as well.

I think maybe itâ€™d be better if I just died. They could live normally then. Iâ€™m so tired of being treated like this. I donâ€™t want to do it anymore. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore.

My homelife seems to get worse everyday and itâ€™s going to be a while before I can move out. Iâ€™m having trouble seeing the point.
