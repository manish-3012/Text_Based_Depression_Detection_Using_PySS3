I hate this life. Everything is just ridiculous and 
cheapened.Everybody is beneath me -- morally or intellectually -- and I don't find anything that I can find joy in anymore, only diversions.

Life is just really watching a lot of rats smelling the cheese in the air, then they find it, and shit on it so other rats can't have it.

Every day is a routine of the worst sort, and I feel like I am being eaten alive by weakling proles without souls or any shred of integrity.

I just want it to end. I have no friends, barely speak to my family, and essentially have no true will to live anymore.
