I am thinking about killing myself. Any suggestions on how to do it?There is no point in living in this world. Everything and everyone sucks ass. People are mean, i am useless. Havent achieved anything of meaning in 25 years of my life other than a butt ton of debt. My parents hate me, my friends are non-existant. I wake up everyday without a will or purpose to get out of bed. I dont know what to do anymore other than just suffocate and die.. Please help if you can.
