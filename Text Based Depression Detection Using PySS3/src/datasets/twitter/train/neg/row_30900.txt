Can't take anymore, I wish I was dead!Can't take life anymore, I'm 28 unemployed, lost motivation in doing my hoppy which is photography and now to make matters worse I've lost Â£510 with being a victim of an online scam. I think the only option is just to end my life, I need to die no point living anymore!
