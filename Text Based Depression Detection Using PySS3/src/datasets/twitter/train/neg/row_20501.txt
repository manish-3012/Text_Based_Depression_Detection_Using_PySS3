I hate my thoughts...You know its just like that constant voice in your head. That at random times just tells you that you suck.  I imagine people here have that too.  In the moment when I have them like that's it. Thats my entire world. Anger, hate, frustration, etc.  And it eats and eats away.

And then it goes away and it feels better. A weight lifted right?  You realize it was all in your head.  Or was it?  Its like everytime i sink down there and crawl out it just gets easier and easier to fall back in. And the whole gets deeper and deeper.  I find things that trigger it and im like well no the voice of anger was right not me.

I really don't want to wage this war anymore.  Todays topic wasnt IF i should end it, it was HOW.  Alone and semi-peacefully. Or messy, and angry. A bullet to the brain in front of someone to fuck them the fuck up.

One day it may just actuakly come to it. And the only voice is that voice.  At least when the deeds done itll be gone.
