Need someone to talk to
Just went through a horrible break up. Feeling worse than anything. Been suffering with depression, anxiety, sickness in the family, bf is sick being the main reason we broke up... I could use someone to talk to. Over the phone or skype possibly. Just some human compassion I feel so overwhelmed and unable to breathe. If you want to talk I could really use it. PM me if you want to talk... I know you guys have been there before. I'm having a moment and could use a person :( thanks
