I feel robbedSuicide was always a backup plan for me, an exit for if/when things got too bad. Something I could rely on as a last resort if everything fell through. But my mom died suddenly a couple years ago and after watching my family suffer through that I couldnâ€™t bear to put them through it again.  My exit strategy was stolen right out from under me and I canâ€™t even be mad at the person who took it away from me. Sorry for the rambling post or if this doesnâ€™t belong here
