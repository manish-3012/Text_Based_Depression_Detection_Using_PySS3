I have like 700 suicide attempts under my beltEvery night I did it I used to think it'll finally be over. Then I'd wake up the next morning. I always was careful not to take too little or too much. Enough to die but not enough for it to show the next day if I did survive. But that's just stupid. If the effects of the drug are gone by next morning. How was it ever supposed to kill you. Tonight I don't care what happens. I'll keep swallowing pills till I'm writhing in pain and I'll hold back the vomit until it enters my blood. And stops my goddamn heart. I've been trying for 3 years straight. I've tried to kill myself almost every night. But those weren't suicide attempts, those were just trial runs. I had my chance when I had enough oxycodone to kill a horse. Somehow I survived. Now I have to take the painful way out. The prolonged way out. I have no doubt I'll be dead within the next 5 years anyway with all the damage I've done to myself. Might as well make it go by fast. I'm saying this, but I know there's still a huge chance I'll once again wake up the next morning. God damn it. This fucking body never wants to give in. Warning labels are bullshit.
