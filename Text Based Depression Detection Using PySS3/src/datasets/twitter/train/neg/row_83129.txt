I don't know who I amEvery day just blurs into the next. Nothing feels real. I look at my phone. It's May. It feels like the whole first half of this year went by in a day. I'm empty. I'm lonely.

I can't relate to anyone. I try hard to have feelings other than apathy but I can't. I don't want to be here.
