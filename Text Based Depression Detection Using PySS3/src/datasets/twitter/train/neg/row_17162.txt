Trans (m2f) friend seems really depressed and I'm worried for her...She's been transitioning for abt 7 yrs now and is gorgeous now (really) but still hates her body. She wants surgery but cant afford it and is really fixating on it. She brought up suicide today while we were chatting &amp; it seemed like she'd thought about it for a while too. I'm freaking out a little bit. 

She's not on reddit (AFAIK) but I'd love some advice on what I might say or do to help her feel better about herself.

Is there a better subreddit for trans-specific stuff?
