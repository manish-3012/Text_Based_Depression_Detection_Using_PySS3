Hey. I could use an outside perspective on my living condition. ThanksI don't know where to start. I guess I'm just not sure if I'm depressed and should see a therapist, or if I'm just taking things too hard. Every day I get up, go to school, then to work, then home. (Except on some days I meet with my Uni hiking club and occasionally go on hikes/camping trips with them) I rarely talk to anyone and when I do it's brief and I feel like I have nothing to say. I have two close friends, (well one is my roommate) both of whom get on my nerves. I feel like everything I say/do around them they make fun of me for. Same thing with the hiking club.  One guy in particular seems to pick at me and tries to expose weaknesses in me.  Everyday I feel like a bag of meat surrounded by other bags of meat floating in a void. I see a future where I am alone and have accomplished nothing. Sometimes I think about killing myself. I even went and bought razor blades from ace hardware but then decided that I couldn't do that to my family. But then I think that my family will be dead eventually anyway, and I'll be dead so it won't matter. I just dont know if these are things that everyone does? I've thought about going to a therapist but I have nothing to be depressed about so I feel like I'm complaining about nothing. Sorry for the wall of text.
