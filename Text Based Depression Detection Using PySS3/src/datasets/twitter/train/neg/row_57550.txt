I'm just like so fucking sadI'm fucking losing it ,I feel so sad and empty, in someway i love it when the sadness hits me because I can actually feel something, but the rest of the time I feel absolutely nothing, life feels like a dark void. I'm 15, friends, i have a caring mother who i absolutely adore, father eh.. Alcoholic etc, lost a girl who meant a lot to me, and actually made me feel happy and now i'm just in this dark place...  and no she did not die. Of course there are happy times but at some point of the day it just ends up me drowning in sadness, and honestly it gets me to a point where i'm ready to end my life. I was on this medication but it made me feel (ABSOLUTELY) nothing and it was terrible, so fuck that. But now i'm just completely lost in this dark place, and it feels like there is no way out.
