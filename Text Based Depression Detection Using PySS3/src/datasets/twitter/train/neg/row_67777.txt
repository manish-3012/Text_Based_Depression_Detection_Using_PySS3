I kept everyone at arm's length so it wouldn't hurt them when I leftWhat ends up happening? They now think i'm a prick. Now I'm veering between wanting to stay, and being very angry that none of them saw that I needed help. People just seem so quick to let somebody go, even if that person's life is at stake. Humanity is lost. 

I brightened all of their lives at one time or another, and now they can't do the same for me.
