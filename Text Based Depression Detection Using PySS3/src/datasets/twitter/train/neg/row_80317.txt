Back and forth and back and forthThings are okay. But i find myself thinking of suicide as my plan B, not my plan C or D. I still think of if every day, several times a day, the thought of a tieing a wire around my neck, and on a wooden beam, and jumping off, or flying out to the middle of nowhere, renting a car to an even more remote place, and a swallowing a bottle or two of sleeping pills with a whiskey. 

its not a good plan B. but i keep thinking of it. like if i cant get my life on track soon, or if i can't make it work in this new city, maybe i'd be better to just end it. Something inside me is broken, and I'm just always like this at the end of the day. during the day i can be energetic and happy, but in the end, i can't stand the mistakes i made in the past, i cant stand those memories of those mistakes they never stop, they never leave me. my whole life must be some joke. i'm psychologically broken. my spirit is gone. 

this scares me. i don't really want to die, but i think i'm only a couple steps away from ending it on a quiet and cold enough night.   

back and forth and back and forth my mind goes. its so exhausting to continue like this. I lack the strength to be strong again. i'm just too broken now. is there any place left in the world for a broken man?
