I am tired of overdose attempts, wanna attempt hanging nextI gave up my life long ago.

Attempted suicide many times, failed many times, I'm tired of failing, I'm tired of living. I'm alone on this world. 

Depression took away my opportunities, energy, friends, boyfriend, everything, now I am just a mentally disabled piece of flash laying on my bed the entire day taken care by my parents.

I want to hang myself. I am not afraid of pain. Nothing ever works out to me.

Apart of depression, I have Borderline Personality Disorder and eating disorders. I'm so weak. I'm so lonely. Nobody understands me. Hell goes on countinuously inside my head and no medicine and no therapist have been able to stop it. 

I feel the entire world is lava, burning me all the time, I have nowhere to go.
My only safe place was my boyfriend who dumped me in december due to my depression. 

I want to leave a beautiful memoir, like a book. I long for my death everyday. I just want to rest. At 26, I am so tired of this world and living. I've had enough. Facing everything alone is even harder. 

I will ask them to bring white lillies to my grave.
