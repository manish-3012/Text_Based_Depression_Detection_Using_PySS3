I see no reason to not end itbeen unemployed for months. been rejected by countless companies that I've applied to. I'll be homeless in 2 days. sometimes you just give up fighting life. no one thinks about anyone but themselves. i'll probably be killing myself in 2 days when the landlord kicks me out of my home of 12 years - sorry his house that I've paid about 90% of his mortgage - because he sold the house to some millionaire investor who owns tens of thousands of houses.
