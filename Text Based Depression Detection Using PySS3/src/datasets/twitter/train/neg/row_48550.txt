My mom is dying of cancer. I don't think I will ever be ok again.My mom is only 51. I never expected to lose her so soon. I'm in my early 20s and have had severe depression/ anxiety since I was a teenager. I had been doing really well in therapy and was finally as happy as I think I can be. Until this week my mom's illness took a sharp turn and she was declared terminal. They have stopped treatment and I don't think I can go on. How do you live without the one you love most? The one who created you... I cannot imagine ever being ok
