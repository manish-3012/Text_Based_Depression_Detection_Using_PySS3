Well I'm back againIn time for the holidays. I fluctuate, but my suicidal feelings have come to me again. They seem to come in waves, every four months or so, they return, to ruin my life and push my closer and closer to the edge. I've endured before, I've told myself it will get better, that I will improve myself and move onto something bigger and better. In some ways, maybe I have. I've lost weight, but I'm also leaving university without a degree, and I feel bitter, lost, confused, and defeated. My family is fractured, and even over these holidays, I'm spending them alone. I think I'm beginning to see why suicide rates increase over the holidays.
