Feeling so empty.My depression has been worsening so quickly lately, and I hate myself so much. I feel ignored by my friends and I get extremely suicidal when I'm alone. Now that the idea is in my head, I just can't stop thinking about wanting to be dead. I don't know what to do, I just want to feel appreciated, I don't want to feel this empty anymore.
