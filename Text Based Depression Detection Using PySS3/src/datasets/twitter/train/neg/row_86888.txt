Im gonna kill myself eventually why not now?I have headaches. Been to the best neurologists in the state. Can't find anything wrong with me. Tried almost every class of headache med. None of them came close to working. I'm 16 male and severely depressed. My headaches are constant unending acute pain. I don't have one second of my day that I'm not in pain. Weed helps manage the pain it prevents it for about 30-45 minutes. I have to smoke again after that to refresh the effects. I don't have money so I can't have a reliable resource of mj. My parents are completely opposed to the idea of using it medically no matter how much I beg or how many suicides I attempt. Opioids are not an option as I need to ramp up dosing so fast I end up having to cut myself off after a couple weeks. I have an amazing group of friends and I love my parents so they're the reason I'm not dead. Unfortunately I'm getting worn down as it has been almost a year since I've the headaches have begun. I cannot keep living like this. I enjoy almost nothing. I try and learn guitar I get distracted by my pain can't focus. Can't focus on anything really(except of course bitching about my headaches). In my limited experience with girls they've all been shit(I don't know why I wrote that). Besides my friends and family I despise everyone. There's no silver lining, no out,no optimism , no hope. I have no passions even if I did I doubt I could focus on them. Im not expecting much out of posting this almost no one cares about my headaches as there's no diagnosis. I appreciate any kind of response, doesn't have to be long or articulate. Thank you sincerely for reading if you read this far.

Tl;dr: constant headaches ruin my life, no hope for treatment, suicide seems like only relief
