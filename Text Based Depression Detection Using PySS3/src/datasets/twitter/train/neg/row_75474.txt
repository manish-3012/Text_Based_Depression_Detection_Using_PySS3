Tonight I want to die more then ever after realizing what I've doneJust about 1 minute ago I was about to cut myself again, until I looked and realized: I have scars. A lot of them. I have permanently scarred my body forever and I will never get those scars, those reminders, those statements, those testimonies off and away from me. I've felt suicidal before but tonight I really want to kill myself, and I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

These scars are just another reason to hate myself.
