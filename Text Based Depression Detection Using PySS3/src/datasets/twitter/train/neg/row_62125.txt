What happens if you are feeling suicidal/on the verge of a breakdown, and want to enter inpatient care in the US? Is this happening during COVID?Just curious if anyone has been in since the pandemic began. I keep hearing about folks getting turned away at hospitals and facilities because nurses and doctors are so overwhelmed.
