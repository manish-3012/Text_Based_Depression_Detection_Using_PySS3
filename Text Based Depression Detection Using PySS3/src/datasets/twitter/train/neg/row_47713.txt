Called the hotline and they hung up on meCalled the national lifeline, waited a damn long time to be connected, when I finally was, after going through the standard questions I started talking about what's wrong, what I'm feeling, and the operator was asking some really strange questions... basically just making me restate everything I'd said in greater and greater detail. I didn't get the point of it so eventually I asked what they were getting at, thinking maybe I could answer better. Instead of clarifying, he just ended the call.

What is there left to do when the fucking suicide hotline hangs up on *you*?
