Overdosing on mirtazapine?I am diagnosed with BPD and I am in therapy. At the moment itâ€™s been getting worse and worse and itâ€™s been really hard. I just want to overdose so badly but I donâ€™t even know if I want to die, I just want to hurt myself. Any experiences with a mirtazapine overdose? I have a lot of it on hand plus venlafaxine.
