I donâ€™t know where my head is at anymore.I care about others more than me. It makes sense. I want to leave an impression on this world and you can do that by helping others. I just think that if my people around me are happy, maybe I will be happy. It doesnâ€™t really work, but I put on the smiling face for the sake of protecting my peers and being there when they need it. I want others to know theyâ€™re worth it. I want them to live a happy and healthy life. Something in my head isnâ€™t right and that may be the death of me some day soon, but I just hope I donâ€™t hurt the people who for some reason have come to care about me. Thatâ€™s what gives me pause.
