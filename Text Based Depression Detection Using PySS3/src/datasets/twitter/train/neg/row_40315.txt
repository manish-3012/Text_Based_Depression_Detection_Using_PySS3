Canâ€™t think straight anymoreSince I was young, Iâ€™ve always been told I was â€œgifted.â€ I used to be good at school, especially math, I loved math. Once my depression hit however, everything changed. I hate math now, not to mention Iâ€™m terrible at it. Math isnâ€™t the only thing that was affected however, my consciousness and thought process as a whole has been damaged. When ever thereâ€™s something that requires thought, such as reading about politics, or philosophy, my mind goes into complete disarray. Hell, itâ€™s even difficult trying to format and write this. I wish i could understand things but I canâ€™t anymore, itâ€™s like reality has dawned on me and I canâ€™t take it. I feel completely alone, barely able to even explain what I feel to anyone, everything I used to enjoy I donâ€™t anymore, and I donâ€™t know if I ever want to again. I donâ€™t know what to think or how to think anymore. Sorry for this mess of a rant, I just donâ€™t know what to do.
