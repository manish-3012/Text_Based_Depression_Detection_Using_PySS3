want to leavei know that i have extreme anxiety/avoidance symptoms that lead me to feeling more and more like shit that already lead me to attempt suicide in 2012. and i don't do anything to stop it because stepping in to stop would mean investing myself again and every time i did that felt more tiring than previous attempts.

i'm avoiding my entire life right now and i'm almost 25 so i've wasted the best part of it by sitting in front of my computer by avoiding avoiding AVOIDING

i'm in a cafe so close to a drugstore and i could just buy the pills.

i KNOW it's painful way to die but at this point i'm so numb and i don't care about feeling pain anymore, i'm just so tired.
and all of this over schoolwork, seems petty right? but having one thing to give back on my own fills me with such anxiety that i shut down completely and go into this cycle again. how can people expect me to do anything more in life if a fucking basic essay makes me like this? i'm avoiding driving lessons, i'm avoiding moving away from home, i'm avoiding friendships. what's the point of lifei've given up living it already? i'm scared of everything, people tell me. and i feel more than rotten for being scared. i want to leave.
