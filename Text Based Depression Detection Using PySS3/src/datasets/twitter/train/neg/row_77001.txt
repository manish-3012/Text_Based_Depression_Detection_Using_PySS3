I can't beat this illness.I got diagnosed with schizophrenia a month ago and spent three weeks in hospital but I've had it since I was about 11, or at least prodromal symptoms, and the medication isn't helping. My life is fear. My life is fucking pain. I have days where I feel like I could love and be loved, or be happy, but not now. Now I wake up just to go back to sleep. Now, I wish I wasn't, all the time. I cut myself, I beat myself up, I sit around longing to disappear, to be put down.


What do I have to look forward to? If I haven't functioned for over 10 years, why would I start now?

Everything is fucked. I am fucked.


Edit: I wanted to say I'm sorry I haven't found the words to reply to everyone but I am so touched that so many people wrote to me and PMed me about this, it really picked up my spirits. I am going to speak to my psych today and be honest about how I've been feeling because I don't think death can be the only option.
