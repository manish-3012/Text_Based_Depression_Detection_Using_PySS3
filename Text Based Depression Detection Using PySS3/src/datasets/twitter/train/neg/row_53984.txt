My boyfriend is set on killing himselfit is 2 days from my birthday, he awoke crying he doesn't want to live any more, he has often said it. I take it seriously everytime as I have severe general anxiety disorder so it's extremely hard for me to handle but I put on a tough face for him, cry a bit with him but this time he just started chugging rum which I snatched away and poured down the drain and he was naturally angry at that but I know it doesn't help a person who would like to commit suicide, he lives with me and he just left with him friend and he kissed me and said "I love you so much" and I asked if he was coming back and he just didn't say anything and there's literally nothing I can do right now except rock back and forth and worry myself to tears. I've always worried but nothing of this magnitude ever struck. Any advice on things I can text him? I know I can't stop him if he's hellbent and I just don't know what to do
