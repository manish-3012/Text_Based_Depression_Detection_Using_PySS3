Its been three years since my first suicide attemptI still wish I were dead. My life is still complete shit. Nothing has changed. If anything my life's gotten worse. It's like the universe is actively trying to take away every reason I had to keep going. I'm just so tired of constantly waking up already exhausted. No medication can fix me.
