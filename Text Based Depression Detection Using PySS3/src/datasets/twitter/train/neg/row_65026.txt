Why we keep going onThere's so many of us here, screaming into a void. The void you assume are strangers you've never met, who aren't going to stop you from doing what you must. 

There are so many ways accessible for you. A knife, a rope, or perhaps a drug, if that's more your flow. 

Yet you persist. You can't bring yourself to do it. Maybe its instinctual self preservation kicking in, or maybe it's that little glimmer of hope left in you. Something in you that just can't let you cut your veins open, tie that noose, or swallow those pills. I believe it's the latter for me. 

The hope of the future, that there is something out there maybe worth living for. Hope that someday life will be better, that you'll finally meet the love of your life, or have the best friend you've always wanted, or fix all those mistakes you've made.  

I hate that one last remnant of hope. Why can't I just get it over with? Why does it have to make it such a complicated ordeal? It misleads you, blinds you, makes you believe there's actually something worth it out there when there really isn't. When this is all life looks like it will be. You live on in that hope and die disappointed.
