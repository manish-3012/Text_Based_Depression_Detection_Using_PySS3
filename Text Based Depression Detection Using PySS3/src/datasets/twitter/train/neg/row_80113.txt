I keep imagining killing myself.Long story short, I'm a struggling student, at risk of being retained this year. I keep worrying about failing the exams, and I even considered killing myself should I fail. I kinda walked back on the latter, thinking I'll get a job as a cook or something. Still, thoughts of me slitting my neck, jumping to my death, overdosing on pills, they stay, and they're inferring with my mind.
