Using coping skills...Ugh. I (again) apologize for yet another pathetic and whiny post. I am forever embarrassed to still be posting on here just days after discharge from a psych hospital. You would think I would have my shit together already since it was not my first in-patient stay.

As the title suggests, I am trying to use my coping skills to prevent me from getting overwhelmed so I DON'T attempt suicide again. So far so good but it is exhausting...even with medication...I say that all Prozac is doing is making me an energetic and "happy" suicidal person. I can't shake these thoughts and they get pretty strong before they back off a little...until they come back again...over and over this cycle repeats.

Tell me I'm not alone. Tell me I'm not crazy for this...I still have no reason to want to die but...it sounds so much better than the intolerance and misunderstandings I get now.

Anything would be better than this life of being broken too badly to heal all the way. I am hopelessly lost in my mind...lost in the Depression that overwhelmed my very soul.

Sigh

Tell me...something.
