I don't think I can survive through summerI was doing so well. But my depression came back and hit me like a truck. I was trying to fight it but the thought of shooting myself with my dad's gun just keeps coming up and the thought of returning to school in the fall seems so far away and improbable. I've started cutting myself a lot again too and I just don't know how to make it stop hurting. 

I know I probably should tell my psychiatric nurses what my thoughts are, but I don't wanna disappoint them by telling them I'm kind of planning my suicide and that I've relapsed with self-harm. I feel like such a disappointment. 

I also think maybe my antidepressants have stopped working...which is really disappointing because they worked so well for a while. 

I guess I am just lonely and sad and needed to tell someone this.
