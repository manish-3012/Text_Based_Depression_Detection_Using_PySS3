Living is hellI don't see why I should keep going. I'm all fucked up. I always feel like a burden for everybody around me. PTSD is a nightmare I don't know what to do anymore. I used to selfharm and I really think I should get back to it so it could ease my pain just a little bit because nothing else does... I have flashbacks all the time and I can't even go to work anymore. Can't go to grocery store without having a panic attack. Can't be touched by anyone. I just can't do anything and it fucking hurts me so much. 
Will this ever stop!?
