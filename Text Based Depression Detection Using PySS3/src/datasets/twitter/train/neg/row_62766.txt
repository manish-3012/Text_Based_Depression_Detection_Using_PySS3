Mental hospital questionSo I (21f) was going to go to a mental hospital this morning to be assessed but I decided not to because I took Xanax to cope with my panic attacks. Iâ€™m not prescribed. Iâ€™m worried that if I fail for it (itâ€™s been about 5 days since I took it, Iâ€™m not a regular user) that Iâ€™ll be forced into the other part of the hospital that is a rehab. I really need to go but Iâ€™m terrified that Iâ€™ll be forced into a rehab. Can they legally do that, or just recommend it? I really need advice
