Starting in collegeI started attending college earlier this week. I broke down on day two. Teacher was forcing me to look at the rest of my class and repeat my answer until it was loud enough when I was in front of the blackboard. I have never been learnt what he was asking me.   


I kinda told everyone I knew I need some sort of help. I cant eat among other people, Im so scared of it that I will just starve for the whole day instead. Drinking is similar, but I at least dared to do that.   


I told people I want to leave. They said its stupid. It all just kinda makes me wanna die instead.   


Like I just wanted some support. But no, I have to be crying on my own, and help OTHERS with their problems. And when I do dare to repeat what is bothering me, then I am a monster, a LIAR.   


I dont wanna go anymore. I just asked for some support. Thats all there was to it. Even my boyfriend refuses to help me. I feel like a monster. I want to die.  


I cut myself again, even though he told me not to. But I dont want to be in this world anymore, I dont want to be hurt by others, by him, by stupid school. I just want to feel nothing at least.
