suicide texting hotline...so I texted a crisis hotline just to see what it was like and the person I talked to was super condescending and obviously reading from a sh*tty script ... in the end, the â€œcounselorâ€ said that the hotline couldnâ€™t help me and now Iâ€™m more suicidal than ever... I see no reason in living and I havenâ€™t for years... I think itâ€™s time to end it at this point.
