Need to get this off of my chest...I am struggling to keep the motivation to even keep going.  Yesterday was okay, but today I don't want to keep going.  I am stuck between wanting to die and just pushing through.  Like, death would be great, but I know that everyone around me would suffer greatly from my loss, so I don't want to die.  Fuck, I hate this feeling and I hope it passes soon.  I don't know how many more days I can take this shitty feeling.
