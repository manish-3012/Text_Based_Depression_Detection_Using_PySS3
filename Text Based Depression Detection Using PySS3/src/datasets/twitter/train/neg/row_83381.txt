Is there someone out there to help meI am going through a very hard time in my life. I feel so alone. I need human interaction I think or I'm afraid I might do something I would severely regret. I don't even really want to talk about what all has happened to me, I just need someone to talk to. About your day, your pets, your hobbies, your favorite food. I don't know why. But I'd appreciate a conversation so much. My heart is broken and my head feels that way as well.
