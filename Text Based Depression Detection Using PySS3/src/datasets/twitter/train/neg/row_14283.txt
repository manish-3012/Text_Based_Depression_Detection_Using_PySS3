please help.i'm a smart girl.

i hate 99% of myself. but i know i'm smart.

so i should be able to rationally convince myself that suicide isn't the answer. but i can't. i can't see any reason why staying alive is my best option.

i spent the past four days destroying my skin, just cutting up my thighs to the point that i can't walk without being in pain. 

i have people that should be able to help me. just last night i went ice skating and drank coffee with my boyfriend, who's amazing and kind. and i woke up still wanting to slit my wrists.

so, please, if you think you could help, i need it.
