I feel conflicted over having "snitched" on my spouse.My spouse's mental health was getting worse. Spouse (S) was acting completely out of character and ultimately had a breakdown where she mentioned having suicidal thoughts and having thought of a specific way to commit the act. I was incredibly concerned and didn't know what to do, so I stayed awake making sure S was alright and then, first thing in the morning, told her therapist everything including behavior that I had found worrisome, which had been escalating over the recent past.

S is now going to voluntary inpatient treatment (as recommended by S's care team), but I worry if I did the right thing. I wanted S to get help, but not be elsewhere during the holidays. But then I think it's better for her to be alive and get help during the holiday season than possibly be dead before it ends. I don't know. I'm conflicted as the kids and I will miss S and I feel guilty for "snitching" and like I got S in trouble or something. At the same time, I didn't think it was something I could handle all on my own and am glad to have other people looking out for S's well-being. 

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for with this post, but I needed to let this out. I guess I'm curious on if other people think I did the right thing by telling her therapist.
