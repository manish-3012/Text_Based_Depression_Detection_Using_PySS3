Talk to the people around you. Tell them exactly how you feel. It saved me today.I suffer from a few psychological issues that I take medication and have lots of therapy for. However, the past week or so I just kept telling myself that my Mother wanted me to kill myself so she wouldn't have to live with my problems.

It took me almost five days to work up the courage to talk to her about it and worked through it. She didn't feel that way at all and told me that she seems troubled by me all the time because she is worried about me and just wants the best for me.

I had cried myself to sleep every night since I began thinking that and in the end, just speaking to her about it was all I really needed.

Just wanted to share this with everyone and hopefully it helps at least one person.
