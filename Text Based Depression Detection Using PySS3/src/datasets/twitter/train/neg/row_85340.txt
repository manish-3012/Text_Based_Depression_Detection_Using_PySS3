23 more days until I finally kill myselfI said that I will kill myself on the 25th of this month several
Months ago to give myself some time to think about it and see if I really wanted to go through with it. Well I'm very certain now that I do. I'm looking forward to the 25th so that I won't have to be such a pathetic ugly loser anymore. I have a plan in place and the week of I will write my suicide note. I'm only worried about leaving my dog behind, but my sister will take good care of her.
