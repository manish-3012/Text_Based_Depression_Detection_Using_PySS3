Homeless and hopelessBack in December my mom lost her job. We're homeless and unemployment runs out mid June. (HR hired convicted drug dealers and her employees were going behind her back and lying. It was complete bullshit.) I've been suffering with depression and suicidal tendencies since I was about 9. It's just me and her, and I just don't think I can do it anymore. We're thankfully able to stay with a family friend, but it's extremely stressful. I can't get a job because we're in the middle of nowhere and I wouldn't have transportation. If we both even managed to find a job, it'd be $9 an hour minimum wage...and we can't live off of that. We bot have chronic pain and I don't want her to work herself to death with 2 jobs. Every single day I just feel hopeless and wishing I could kill myself. she's 53 and every single job she's applied to has lead to nothing. She's an incredible worker, and she's had a lot of interviews, but her age is causing her to lose the jobs. I'm scared, because we'll have no income soon and there's nothing good to look forward to. I've been able to make just enough to cover our asses each month through art commissions, but...I'm tired. I don't see the point in fighting anymore. We've lost everything. I'm going to live in poverty forever and I'm bitter that my only 2 friends are able to go to college and have everything stable.
