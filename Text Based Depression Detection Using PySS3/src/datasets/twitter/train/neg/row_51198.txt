Broken SystemCan someone please tell me why the psychiatric world suck so much? I've already been in hospitals and treatment enough over the past few years! But now that I'm in a spot where I'm on no meds, get therapy once a week and am awaiting a psychiatrist appointment in mid December. How do I last that long? I'm doomed to fail the system once again? There's no discussion about other options because quite frankly there is none... The problem is if I go to the hospital right now to get the process to move faster I'm risking far worse harm to my Mental state, depriving what I have outside locked doors! Do they not realize that the longer I wait, the higher of a risk that I am to myself? They (Outpatient treatment facility) think that pushing my boundaries is going to help? It's only promoting the inevitable. By no means do I like psych meds but it's better than losing control and killing myself or you know fucking suffering 24/7...
