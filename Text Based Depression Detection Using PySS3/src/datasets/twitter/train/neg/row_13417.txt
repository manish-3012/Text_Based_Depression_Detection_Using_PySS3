Words neededIâ€™ve been considering this for a while and fighting it. I donâ€™t want to die but i want things to be better and i just see everything around me getting worse, often by my own fault. Iâ€™m an optimist but things are just never good and I donâ€™t know if they ever will be. 

Give me some good reasons to live please, other than the biggest and most important one which is my family who I love dearly.
