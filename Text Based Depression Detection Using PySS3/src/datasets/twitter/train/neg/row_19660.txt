I'll die eventuallyHey guys.  I'm two months into recovery for drug addiction so my anxiety and depression is rearing its ugly head again.  I used mainly to escape those symptoms.  SSRIs sketch me out and benzodiazepines I got addicted to, so no meds for me.  All I got is AA.

For me, to use is to die.  That's how far my mindset has progressed in that regard.  When I get suicidal I use and drink, and many times I wish I overdose.  I've overdosed twice on the infamous Xanax and alcohol combo.  

However, with trying to stay clean, I've came up with a weird, albeit useful coping mechanism.  I tell myself "don't worry, I'll die eventually" in a comforting way.  When my shit acts up, I either get suicidal, get strong urges to pop xans and drink or wanna shoot up, or both.  Living a clean and normal life is hard for a guy like me, sadly.  So in those moments in the depression hole, I tell myself "don't stress it.  All this will end in time.  You don't gotta go out and use to die.  You don't have to do it yourself.  You will die a normal death like everyone else.  Just give it time.  You'll die eventually.  All this will be over eventually.  Shit, maybe you'll die tomorrow."

Keep in mind I do not think this way on a regular basis.  This is a last resort I've been doing to comfort me in my darkest moments.

Thoughts?  Healthy or nah?  It's keeping me sober and away from the knife at least
