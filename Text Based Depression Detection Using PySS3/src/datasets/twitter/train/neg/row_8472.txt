xdWhere do I start, should I even start? I've cried out a million times already, cryptically and directly.

For 21 years I've known only neglect and solitude. Parents who should have been there substituted their presence with video games, friends who I could've made along the way never appeared, and a reason to live was never present. 

I'm an eccentric misfit who's presence is shunned by society. "No one understand me" is a clichÃ© to say the least, but try over two decades since birth of solitary confinement within your own head and no one by your side and tell me you figure that there may be someone out there who would understand your line of thought and feelings. 

I'm drunk, and I've no reason for posting this. This is just a cathartic relief of drunken words I'll spew unto the void.
