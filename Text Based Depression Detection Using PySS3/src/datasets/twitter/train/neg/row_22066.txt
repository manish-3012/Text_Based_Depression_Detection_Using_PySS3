LonelinessMy last post was when I was crying to much to think. But I am alone. Since 6th grade I've never had any friends. Over the years I've gotten one only for that one to stop liking me. I put on a mask for most of the day. Smile, laugh, make jokes. But I always come home alone. Never talk to anyone one outside of school. I've Been labeled as an introvert. I'm not an introvert. I hate being alone. I love it when my younger sister includes me on things, makes me feel like I have friends. I'm a senior now and only have a month to go. I struggle to make it to the end of the day with everyone talking about prom and the after parties. I've never been to a party before either. Never in those conversations where they're all laughing about the night before. I just laugh along like I know what there talking about. I've never been in a homecoming group. Always get nervous and left alone when you get to pick your groups for a project. I almost had a friend this year. But he had to switch out of my class because the college didn't recognize it. I couldn't keep us talking. I'm told college will get better. The kids who used to pick on me some of them are going to the same school. I don't know why I'm typing this out. I'm feeling super alone today.
