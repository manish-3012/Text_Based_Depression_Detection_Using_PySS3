I thought christmas was bad......but the new year seems to be turning out worse. 

People are hurting. Every one seems exhausted and made of wax.

Another year of being trapped in a world that i will only ever view from the sidelines and never fully participate in. 

Another year dangeling from the cliff.

Always on the outside looking in. 

My  doctor says he fills more benzo scripts in January than December. I only get a few as i have been naughty with them in the past. They dont make me feel "better" but they do give me a glimpse of what it might be like to be "normal" or nurototypical. I dont like them because they make me so tired but they do produce a flat effect and i guess thats what im going for these days.

I miss my mum. I miss my dogs. I miss who i was before the world happened to me.

Nothing gets better it get worse. My life is fantastic but i hate myself and always have. Circumstances change but i will always be me and i will always be broken.

Im 39. Ive tryed the pills. Ive been to the group talk. Ive done 6 years of counciling and cbt. But i never change because i just cant be conviced that im worth the effor. Every fiber in my body tell me im unwanted and unloveable. Even when the facts say other wise.

Ive tryed to kill my self when i was younger and i know how hard it is to actually do. I have no plans but i think about killing myself with every set back or percived hurt. It how i have always been.

People only realise how much the love someone when their gone for good.

I dont know why i keep going or how much longer i can keep this up.
