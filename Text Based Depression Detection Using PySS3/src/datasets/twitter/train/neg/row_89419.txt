ah damn I hate koreaI am 14, and from korea.

why korea is so crazy, really crazy at studying, academy is at every street, even narrow street.. Always sleep after 1 A.M... tired, and really wanted to die. always chased by English Academy, and Math academy's homework. always tons of them. And the friend (actually, different age. he was 20) suicides at his home  that his friend told me.. he was living in UK..but also korean guy.. he suicides, and I thought this was dream, an terrible dream.. his name in reddit was rxzack3. so sad, and reality problems. I wanted to just jump over at 3rd floor and just smash my brain, or other things. if I am alive, just stuck in hospital bed and..... 
Always....
