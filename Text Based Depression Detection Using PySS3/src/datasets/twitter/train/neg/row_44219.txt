Haven't made up my mindI'm back a year later, Now 18 and I feel like I'm not ready, my grades have always been bad and now that this is my final year I can't do anything to catch up on time so I'll have to go to continuation school. Or at least try idk any jobs that'll accept my transcript or me without an diploma. I haven't tried I have a medical condition that stops me from learning or it'll take longer than most people would get things. I play guitar so i know I'm not entirely stupid or at least I have some talent. But the point is that I'm not sure what to do with my future living without a diploma or an education ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸
