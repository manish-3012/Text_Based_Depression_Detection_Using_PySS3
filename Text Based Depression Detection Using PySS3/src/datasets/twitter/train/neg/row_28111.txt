Don't know whyI don't know why I have felt this way since I was about 11, no longer wanting to be alive.  It seems to be getting worse as I get older and I don't know how to shake it.  I try my hardest to talk to people to hint that I need help but no one takes me seriously.  I'm just so tired of being alive.
