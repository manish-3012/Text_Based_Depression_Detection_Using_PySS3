i want to be able to talk myself out of itit's been years and years of not being good enough - of getting the best job i can in my career, and it not being good enough. of not being pretty enough, or skinny enough, or having too much personality - or too little. everything outwardly looks good - the people who aren't over me tell me i have everything ahead of me, but my boss and people close to me never do. who am i? i don't feel like it's enough.

i have it all written out, i dont want to do it. someone tell me how to talk myself out of it please.
