hhhMy grades are failing and my parents are clearly disappointed in me. I just want to give up on school, even if I get good grades Iâ€™ll still end up having an unsuccessful future. I hate this stress. I hate school so much, every time I go I feel like crying, and the bad thoughts always get worse. I hate sitting alone all the time and being pushed aside by everyone, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m invisible. I donâ€™t want to tell my parents because the last time I told my mom she just told me to stop bitching. Honestly, no one would care if I just dropped dead right now.
