Iâ€™d rather kill myself than be a mediocre personSince I was young, my parents told me I was a child full of potential, and although itâ€™s true for every kid, I took it very seriously. I became an â€œAâ€ kid. I only got good grades and my future seemed bright. When I entered middle school, my grades dropped by a pinch, and although they were not perfect, they were still excellent.
 
In high school they dropped a bit more, I even got some 80/100â€™s, but they still were good enough to get me a scholarship in a prestigious university.

The problem is... Iâ€™ve always been depressed. My parents have never given me support outside of the economic aspect, and the academic one. For them, I am just my grades. An 80/100 is unforgivable, and I grew to believe anything below 90 is a mediocre grade.
 
Iâ€™ve been in college for only 2 semesters, and although I managed to get an average of 85 on my first semester (just enough to keep the scholarship), this second semester has been by far my worst. On my second period I failed 3 subjects, even though I tried to get good grades. Now, on my final period, a mixture of frustration, sadness and indifference has made me not really try that hard. Iâ€™m going to lose my scholarship by the end of the semester.
 
I wasted the opportunity my parents gave me, and the opportunity college gave me. I wonâ€™t stand studying anywhere else knowing I couldâ€™ve achieved more if I tried harder, and that is the reason Iâ€™m planning to kill myself.
 
Iâ€™m just waiting to the moment I lose that scholarship. My parents will never forgive me, and I wonâ€™t either. Goodbye everyone.
