Sick of how horrible the world is  

Iâ€™m here because Iâ€™d like to know if anyone else is feeling this wayâ€¦ Iâ€™m not depressed, Iâ€™m just sick of the world and donâ€™t want to be here anymore. 

As a biracial woman, there are too many battles to fight and Iâ€™m just sick of it. Iâ€™m exhausted. Society is mean and getting worse. I canâ€™t imagine a time where I can just be accepted as a person, instead of being put into a category and having to fight against the assumptions made about the colour of my skin, my gender, my accent. Fuck, Iâ€™m even judged for my hairstyle on a daily basis. Iâ€™m judged for not wearing makeup. Iâ€™m constantly made to feel like Iâ€™ve failed as a woman because Iâ€™m not married and never wanted kids (there are many reasons for not wanting kids). Nobody cares about the person I am. Nobody can accept the person I am. 

I admit Iâ€™ve always been a bit weird, Iâ€™ve led a somewhat unconventional life and it freaks people out. I have never found where I fit in and Iâ€™m sick of looking. 

Iâ€™m honestly just sick of it all. Does anyone else ever feel this way? Just exhausted by the world and its nastiness.

And please, no comments about how I'm a snowflake, or a whiny feminst. That's exactly what brought me to this place. Being told I'm wrong to feel bad about being treated like shit.
