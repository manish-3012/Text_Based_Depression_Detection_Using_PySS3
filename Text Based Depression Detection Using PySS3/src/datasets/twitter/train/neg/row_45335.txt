Everything hurts tonight.I'm new and not sure what to say. I'm not sure what I'm looking for, at this point I don't think talking about suicide is a cry for help, I've spent most of my life wishing I'd been a slower sperm, hung back, and let my swirl of squirming brethren rush past me to the egg and genesis and life beyond.

I sound like bad poetry though.

Life feels very unreal right now, everything hurts, my joints burn and ache and I feel physically ill. I have PTSD from sexual violence and everything lately has been bringing back all the memories that I try to avoid. I feel like I'm dreaming while awake, caught in a nightmare with my eyes open. I'm starting to see the shadows of my dead friends and relatives in the afternoon shadows and I feel like their blue blackness is calling to me, I miss them and they miss me, everyone who loved me and I loved is dead, and I don't want to be here anymore, I want to be with them again, and they're calling to me, them and the black river below the city, 300 feet deep, I feel them calling to me, I can almost physically feel them drawing me closer. To sleep forever in their arms appeals so much.

But I'm digressing I guess. I've been depressed and without friends for a long time now, I've been having a lot of problems lately. I have a lot of problems, depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, I might be on the autistic spectrum. I'm a university student, I was stalked and attacked in the dorm I was staying in by a guy that worked for the university. He was drunk and it terrified me, he locked me in his room, tried to rape me, I got away but he tried to break down my door. I reported it to the dorm's student supervisors and they did nothing because he was popular. I reported it to the university and they said they wouldn't tell the police. I went to counseling services and they confused me with another student and said I was faking it all. No wait, you're not faking it, only the other student is. And now they took my loan away, even though I passed my courses. I didn't submit something at the right time.

&amp;#x200B;

I've run out of money, I started a GoFundMe, but no one noticed, no one even viewed it. I can't get a job because I crashed my car and now I have a physical disability and can't stand or walk for very long without my legs going weak and giving out, and my back hurts constantly, even when I try to sleep. I can't run, I can't even dance anymore. I just want to dance sometimes, but it hurts so much. I wanted to dance ballet again, I wanted to learn martial arts, and kendo.

&amp;#x200B;

Now everyone's dead, my friends, my family, my grandmothers, everyone I loved is gone. I can't stand this, everyone after me for money, tuition, telling me my rent is overdue, as if I can pluck thousands of dollars out of the air, and being gone from here is so appealing. I've asked the university for help and no one cares, no one can tell me how to fix anything, and I can't do anything anymore and everything hurts so much, everywhere aches, and it's not just my back, I can feel something creeping over me, sucking my energy away. Whatever it is, I hope it kills me. I don't want to wake up anymore. I want to leave this world behind.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for writing this, I just don't know who else to talk to. I'm going to try and sleep for awhile.
