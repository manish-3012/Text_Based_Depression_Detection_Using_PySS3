I will apologize in the form of a life insurance policy...I'm so sorry. For the time I take away from people. I'm so sorry fo me being bitter when I'm depressed. I'm so sorry for vomit splatters on the bathroom walls. I'm so sorry for being absent, not talking to you when you needed me. I'm so sorry for being a resource drain.


I can't put together the action of being sorry while I am alive and mentally unwell so I will do it the only way I can--when I die, I will give the only way I can in a way I never could alive.


There is no doubt I need to die. I need the courage. I must find it. How do people do what I know I need to do?
