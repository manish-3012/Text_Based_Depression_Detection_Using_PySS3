Today I told my mum for the first time that I genuinely want to kill myselfIt was so hard. I hate making her cry but she knew something was wrong (more so than normal lol) and Iâ€™ve been building up for a while to tell her. I just told her I donâ€™t see a future and I feel like Iâ€™ve let her and my family down because Iâ€™m not strong enough to keep going. But the hard part is that she spoke to me and some of what she said was the general off putting stuff but I just canâ€™t knock the fact that I want to die. Even after I came off the phone and I was thinking about what she said, I still couldnâ€™t stop thinking about my desire to do it. I just canâ€™t keep going anymore. I think I might go to A&amp;E and tell them (my counsellor suggested this) but Iâ€™m not entirely sure what they can do
