I feel completely useless in this world.I hope this is the right reddit. If not, oh well. I might as well post it somewhere.

So, reddit, I feel completely useless, as the title says. Every single goddamn thing I've done in my life has resulted in a failure. Everything. Lemme just list a few things.

Joined Taekwondo - Got my black belt, then quit(Ya, not so bad, this is the happiest on here).

Wrestling - Sucked, got made fun of by everybody, then quit.

Writing a book - Either sucked or lost interest.

BMXing - Sucked and pretty much dont do it anymore.

Skateboarding - Same.

Skating - Same.

Weight loss - Lost 10 pounds, gained 15.

Girlfriends - Had 1 for 3 months, apperently she was only in it for the gifts and was going to break up after valentines day.

Video-making - Sucked and gave up.

Singing - Always fail at any event or whatever I try.

Music - I suck at it.

School - I try my hardest, but still struggle to get good grades.

My social life sucks, my family life sucks, my romantic life is unexistant. My only actual friends are little gamer friends I make that move on after one ore two weeks. Oh ya which reminds me, I suck at video games.

This jist of this thing is that I suck at everything. I really on the verge of just giving up. I really can't think of a single thing to do, anywhere my life is going, or anybody to talk to other than you guys.

Reddit, I really don't know what to do. What the hell could I possibly do. My first thought is suicide, but obviously thats not going to help one bit, so what can I do.

tl:dr - Im suicidal.
