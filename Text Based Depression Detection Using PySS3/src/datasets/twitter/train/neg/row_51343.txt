I called a suicide hotline on my way home from work last nightI made a throwaway account because many family members know my main. 

Last night at work was a particularly difficult one. Ideation would not leave my head all night and I didn't know what to do. All night I kept thinking of what I should do so I don't have to go through another one of these days. I could drive my car off a bridge. I drive over the same exact one every single night on my way home. It would be so easy. I got off work and into my car and broke down. I called a hotline to stay on the phone with me until I got home. I don't know what to do anymore. It gets better, and then it gets worse than I ever thought possible. I see no future for myself because I just get closer and closer every single time. I'm so lost.

Thanks for letting me vent.
