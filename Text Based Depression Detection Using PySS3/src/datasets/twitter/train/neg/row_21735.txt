In the process of contemplating suicideHi, this is my first post. 

i am 24 year old and currently in final year doing business analytics. I feel dumb and not capable of anything in life. I feel as if i'm just a burden to my parents who have gone through so much to take me where i am today only for me to repay them by graduating with low gpa and  knowing the bare minimum in my field. 

i don't know what will i do after i graduate or what  my gpa will be. i'm not sure i might be able to graduate. 

My future looks dark right now ,  i feel worthless and dumb. and I've been contemplating suicide for the past few days. 

i'm trying so hard to hold on at the current moment , i tell myself "its ok things will get better ", but my future doesn't look like something i can hold on to. i feel like i am not programmed to succeed in life.
