Iâ€™m probably going to do it in a couple of daysNobody cares about me. I have no friends. Iâ€™ve been bullied, made fun of, Iâ€™m a reject, an outcast. Iâ€™ve lost my only friends, my best friend a month or two ago. Iâ€™m a worthless piece of crap. Iâ€™m a burden on people. I canâ€™t associate with people my age. Iâ€™m lonely. Iâ€™m tired of people throwing me away like a dirty rag. I donâ€™t see the point in living. :(
