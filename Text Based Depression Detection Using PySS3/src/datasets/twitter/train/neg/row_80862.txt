Me losing in every single game I play suggest that I have no luck in life so what's the point of being alive if I must suffer?I play a lot of mobile online games and I am on a losing streak on every one of them, like clash royale, duel links, fortnite etc. This streak has been going on for days now and I had a thought. With this sheer amount of bad luck that I have, even in real life with no friends, whats the point living?
