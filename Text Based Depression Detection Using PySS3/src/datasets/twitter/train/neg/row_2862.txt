New Years Countdown to DeathFirst time posting, and I donâ€™t mean to ride the pity train too hard. I was told having friends would help me feel good inside, but it was just a band-aid on a shotgun wound. It made me feel like an outsider looking into the lives of people who are happy, have futures and experiment with love. It made me realize that I literally have nothing, and theyâ€™re too busy in their lives to even begin to worry about mine. Wouldnâ€™t wanna give them this baggage anyways.

This year Iâ€™m scrapping all the New Years plans and driving to the rockies with a gun. Iâ€™m going to find a pretty river, and kill myself. It would be quite the contrast from the year prior, and worst case Ontario I pussy out and get to have a decent view while accepting my self-worthlessness. 

Either way, letâ€™s hope thereâ€™s no afterlife because I sure as fuck canâ€™t take an eternity of this.
