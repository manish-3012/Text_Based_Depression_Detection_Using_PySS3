Helping those affected by a suicide attemptHi,

Last week I made a silly error and allowed a situation to build to the point I felt the only rational endgame was to kill myself. It related particularly to an attempt to take out a contract on an apartment with a close friend that I was arranging. I allowed it to get to me too much, particularly the financials which were a few days from falling into place.

At the time I sent a message to this friend explaining my decision and apologising for not being strong enough to deal with it and for any lasting effect this may have. My attempt did not lead my death which I am glad of, it was a major blip that comes following a period of settlement of my anxiety and bipolar disorders. 

We have (rightly) put a hold on our plans to move in whilst I seek more help for all this and I feel that I am moving in the right direction.

I am concerned about making sure that my friend who essentially read a suicide note from me gets the right support and with helping to rebuild this friendship. We have had a couple of long discussions in person about this and it is clear that this has really freaked him out, he has been aware of my issues for a long time, we've been friends for 8 years and my mental health problems have been ongoing for a lot longer.

Has anybody been in a similar position on either side or is anybody able to offer any advice?

Thanks!
