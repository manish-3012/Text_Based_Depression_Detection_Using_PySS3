Donâ€™t know what to do anymoreI want to commit suicide im done with my life. Yet I canâ€™t because there is no easy way out and I canâ€™t because my parents especially my mom hates her job and wants to quit.

If I leave sheâ€™ll end up quitting her job. 

I didnâ€™t ask to be here and yet Iâ€™m responsible for leaving.

Iâ€™m 19m. They eventually want me to get a full time job but I struggle getting a part time job. I donâ€™t enjoy my university program yet I donâ€™t know what I want to be.

They probably expect me to get married and have a family one day but I struggle to see the worth in my life how am I going to support another.

I want out but I canâ€™t. So Iâ€™m stuck here until otherwise my life turns a different course.
