It's game over for meI failed out of college today. My entire life plan and everything I worked for so far has collapsed around me.

I've been living with suicide ideation since 8th grade and tonight I think I'm finally going to realize what I've always wanted to do.

I've posted here on a throwaway many times before. Just wanted to stop in and thank you all for all that you do. You really made a difference in my life and so many others. Please keep at it. My failures are my own. 

Thank you.
