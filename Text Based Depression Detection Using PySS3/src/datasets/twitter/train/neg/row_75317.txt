I feel like its all too much...Last Friday a good friend of mine committed suicide. since i found out all i can see is horrible mental pictures of dead bodies just running through my mind. i don't even know how he did it. but i cant stop thinking about it. every time i feel happy now i feel this huge cloud of guilt just form over me and i cant stop it. is this normal. is there anyway to stop it.? I personally suffer from major depression so its not helping me at all. i feel like i cant function and my work feels like it never gets done now. like its all meaningless and im confused. should i seek help? will it pass?
