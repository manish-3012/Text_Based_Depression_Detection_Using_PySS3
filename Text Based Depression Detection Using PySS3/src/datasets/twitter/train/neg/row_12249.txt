Need to know how to add padding to ropesI don't know if this is the best place to post it or not but I couldn't find anyplace else to post it. I have decided to take my life very soon. And I found out that by adding padding to the rope that you hang by can lessen the pain by some factor and I was wondering if anyone would know how to pad a rope. Or maybe suggest something that has enough padding already. Thank you to everyone who reads my post.
