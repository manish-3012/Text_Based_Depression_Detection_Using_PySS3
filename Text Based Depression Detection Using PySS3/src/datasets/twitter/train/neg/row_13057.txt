I see nothing good in my future.I work at a dead end job at the moment. The one real friend that I had in this town (also my manager) is now angry with me for my work performance which honestly has been above average since I started the job over a year ago. I feel betrayed.

Now as I'm starting to look for a new job all of the suicidal thoughts that I've had on and off for years are all flooding in at once. There is nothing that I want to do anymore. Interests pop up and disappear within minutes and making any kind of effort seems impossible. I don't know where to go. I want to disappear. I wish there was some way to simply erase my existence as if I had never been here. 

I understand that there are people that care about me and I think that's literally the only thing keeping me here. I'm sorry to bother you all. I just don't know what to do anymore.
