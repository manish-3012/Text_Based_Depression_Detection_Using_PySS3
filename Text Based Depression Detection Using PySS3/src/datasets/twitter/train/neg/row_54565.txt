Should I tell my parents about my suicidal thoughts?It's been years now, dealing with suicidal ideation. There's days I think I'll finally do it, that is my moment to go and sleep forever. The thought of suicide is so comforting and maybe that's why I didn't tell anyone about it, not even my psychologists. You know, if you tell a psychologist they will let someone close to you know about your feelings because "your life is in danger". Even if understand what they are doing, i still hate it, i wish i could just be honest with one person, i don't want my family to know...  That would hurt them more, right? But now I'm in a situation where I think I don't have much of an option; I'm desperate, i need to get this out of my chest to a professional. I feel like a bomb, any day now and I will just say things how they are: "I want to kill myself, I have fantasies about it and they never let me go, i have lost hope". But before doing that i prefer telling my parents firsts instead of them hearing it from another person... My conflict starts here: my dad thinks suicidal people are cowards and my mom thinks "that is easy to be strong mentally". That's not the only problem, I'm worry that they will treat me different or be more wary of the stuff I do. I don't want pitty, I don't want a special "treatment", the only reason i want to do this is because i need to verbalize my thoughts or else I will explode! I still think about really ending my life, that's another thing... if i tell them, maybe this precious option i have will dissapear... i don't know what is better... kill myself in a unexpected way or kill myself knowing everyone is aware of my pain... i don't know... I don't know what i should do...
