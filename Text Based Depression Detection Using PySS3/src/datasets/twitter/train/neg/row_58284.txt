rantingOk I just came on here because I look at this thread a lot and I figured I'd post because I think about this shit all the time. I just feel like there is absolutely no escape and this is never gonna end. I wake up, I feel extremely depressed, and then throughout the school day it just gets worse. I get home, and i feel the exact same way. I think about killing myself all the time, and the thought of suicide is comforting. When anything happens, suicide is my comfort. Knowing that I could just end it all makes me feel relieved. I feel stupid ranting on here because my problems and my feelings feel so invalid compared to everyone else. I feel like I cant really complain ya know. I'm just so sick of feeling depressed and suicidal every day, and it is so hard to change my mind. No matter what I do, I will always be like this. I do go to therapy, but that only helps so much. It doesn't really do much anymore. Anyways, I hope this will go away one day because I'm so over it. Sorry if this is stupid, I'll probably delete this later.
