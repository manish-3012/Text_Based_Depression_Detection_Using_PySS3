Iâ€™ve made the decision today to end my life.I donâ€™t know when or how yet though I have some ideas. 

Iâ€™m completely calm. No fear, no regrets, no tears.

I no longer have a quality of life. My anxiety has ruined everything including the relationship with the man I love. My job is meaningless and Iâ€™m will never be in a position to go back to school to retrain. I have few friends and donâ€™t want any. I am not good at anything. Iâ€™m draining the public healthcare system and am no asset to society. 

Iâ€™ve given up on drugs. 20 years of depression and maybe 15 or more different types of drugs. Not a single one works. Therapy hasnâ€™t helped. Iâ€™m too broken to be repaired. 

Iâ€™ve always said my depression was terminal. I have always known it would kill me if nothing else did first. Iâ€™ve given it my best shot. 

I give up.
