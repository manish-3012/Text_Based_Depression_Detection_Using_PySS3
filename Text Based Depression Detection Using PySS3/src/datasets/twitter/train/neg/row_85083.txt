I hate my lifeI don't want to kill myself but lately I've been feeling like I want to just die. I wish someone would do it for me. I am so very tired.

I just lost the love of my life because I made a stupid mistake. He was my everything and now he couldn't give 2 shits about me. My father passed away almost a year ago and I still cry everyday about it, it rips me apart on the inside. My family isn't close. My mom is the only one who tries to talk to me. I hardly have any friends. I see the good ones probably 3 times a year because they live far. My friends at school (if you could even call them friends) only care about drinking and partying. I have been sick since since April (about 5 months) I just feel like shit constantly every single day.

I just want to be out out of my misery
