I made too many mistakes, this is my last.When i wake up i fight with my mom then i go to work i fight with my bosses co workers customers etc. My job is already a fucking shitty 12 hour physical torture, no holidays no money no fucking anything. Im 23 M ugly as fuck only had one real gf in my life i fucking hate everything and the top of that i lost a family member this year... never had a father and ive been depressed for more than 10 years now. Everything i do is just a fucking problem, i dont enjoy my life. I hate myself and want to die
