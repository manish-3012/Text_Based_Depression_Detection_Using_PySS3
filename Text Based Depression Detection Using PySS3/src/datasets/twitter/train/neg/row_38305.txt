I feel absolutely despised by the world..Alright reddit, I made this account to hide my identity, but I really need you guy's help.

I am a scientist in real life, but I'm an autodidact so I don't make much money. I am gay. 5 years ago I met an amazing guy, and I moved across the entire United States to be with him and meet his family. We lived with him, his mother, and sister. Things got weird when his mom quit her $18 an hour job because she "Got tired of working and it's the MANS job to support the family". I had 2 choices, me and my partner go homeless or support an old bitch. Eventually it got out of hand, so me and my SO moved back to North Carolina to stay with my parents a while. 

I have severe Bipolar disorder and OCD, so sometimes I tend to act a bit unusual. This hasn't gone un-noticed by my coworkers and family. Every 5 seconds someone is upset at me for SOMETHING, whether its small stuff or big. No one speaks to me at all unless it's for a negative reason. My SO seems to have no sexual interest in me whatsoever anymore, I constantly get made fun of for not going to college (idk WHY but..) 

I dunno...I feel like I'm just bitching to you guys, and that this isn't really a serious matter and I should just accept the fact no one wants to be my friend, but in the long run, yes, I have considered suicide. I feel like if I did go through with it, the only people who would really notice are the ones I live with.

I'm ignored completely until its time to  pay the bills...it really makes me upset. Yes, men in their 20's cry. Idk what to do..
