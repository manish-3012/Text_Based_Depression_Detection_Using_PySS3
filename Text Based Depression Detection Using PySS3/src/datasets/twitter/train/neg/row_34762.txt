Don't want another yearEvery year it just gets worse.  My mental and physical health continues to deteriorate.  I become increasingly numb to my surroundings; I dissociate so often and deeply, I've almost caused several car accidents.  I grow more and more distant from my family, and I can't seem to love my significant other.  If 2019 means another year of this, x2, I don't want it.  I'm tired.  I don't like the nightmares.  Don't want these broken relationships.  Don't want to spend my entire life trading away hours of it for currency.  Everything's so fucked up in this world.  In my head.  I just want it to cease.  I just want to disappear.
