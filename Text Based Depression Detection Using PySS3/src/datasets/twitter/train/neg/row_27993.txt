I can't handle it anymoreIm a fifteen year old living in my parents home.Im currently a freshman in highschool (first year of highschool).I have been dealing whith my toxic parents a lot but i literally can not handle it anymore.Im called names by my dad all the times how im a failure,im never gonna do anything in my life,he wished he hadn't made me and that i will always rely on my younger brother (because he is the golden child).My mom bullies me for liking videogames and tells me im retarded and that i shouldn't be isolated in my room.Why do you all think im isolated in my room?I just want to stay away from my parents.My parents aren't good on money and they always blame that on me and my brother.I was becoming more suicidal by the day.Then i come home to find that my mom had destroyed my pc.Why you may ask?Well i had forgotten to wear my jacket in the morning because i was late and in a rush.I was devastated.The only thing i loved had been destroyed.Im literally stuck here.I can't afford to move out and have nowhere to go.I just wish it would all end.Im thinking about suicide every single day.
