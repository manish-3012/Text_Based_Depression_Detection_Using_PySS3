Nothing helpsThis text probably is pretty messy and I'm sorry for that. I might add something if someone really wants to know. It doesn't matter anyway.

I have no motivation at all to post this. I don't think there is a point anymore. Over the last year my situation got worse. I'm at my lowest point right now and it just goes lower. I have two people I met here I care about. Everything else in my life seems meaningless. Conversations and kind words used to cheer me up but they don't have the same effect anymore. I have one person who is able to cheer me up and she lives too far away to visit. I need human contact in real life. I know that I don't deserve it but I need it. It really is the only thing that can save me right now. I'm scared and I feel like I am going insane. My brain fails to work sometimes. I can't think properly anymore. I used to be really good at it, I can evaluate very well. But now everything goes to shit. I start isolating myself more and more without me even noticing and I can't do anything against that. I'm getting closer and closer towards the end. Maybe it is finally time to give up.
