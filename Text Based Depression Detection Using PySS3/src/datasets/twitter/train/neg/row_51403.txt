Keep forgetting to take my medsi feel so alone and my screams in the dark feel like theyll never be heard. i feel like have no one to run to anymore. i feel so lonely and tired and lost and exhausted and i want to off myself 

i screwed up by loving again, i screw up every damn thing


I should take all these meds at once and call it a night. Hell, call it a year
