Thanks so much, mom......for bringing me into this garbage world, into this garbage existence, without my consent. 

...for making me feel guilty enough to stay alive, even though you don't really care about me. 

...for making me believe I would be safe and loved in your home while I got back on my feet after the *worst year ever* (so far). Looks like this year won't be much different. 

Well, mom, just so you know, I'll be moving out as soon as I find a place that will take me. I don't even care what it looks like... no one will come to see me, anyway. And then when my dogs are dead, so will I be. Then you no longer have to pretend to care about me. Good riddance.
