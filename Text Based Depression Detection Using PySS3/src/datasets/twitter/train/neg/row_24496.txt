I need someone to talk to.. I can't explain this.. I know it sounds ridiculously random. I'm not a creep or anything.. I've been dealing with the grief of my ex that committed suicide a decade ago when I was 15.. it'd be really nice to talk to someone, on the phone, that would just let me vent to them. I have guy friends that I talk to about it but no one that is a girl that could understand.. I'll send you my phone number.. I'm really on edge right now..
