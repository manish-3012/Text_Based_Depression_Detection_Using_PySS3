I used to have hopes and dreamsI used to dream about becoming a nurse. I used to dream about graduating college and pursuing a career to help others and make sure their lives are just a little bit less miserable. 

I used to dream about getting a significant other  that I can share my life with. I wanted to travel the country with her and experience the world with her. 

I used to dream about wanting to be happy and fulfilled with my life.

None of this matters anymore. None of it does. My future significant other doesnâ€™t exist, and my chances of being a nurse are all non-existent. I donâ€™t have the capability nor the intelligence to help others. The only thing I have is loneliness, misery, and overall incompetence at everything in life.

My only option is suicide. All of these dreams I once had are nothing but a fantasy land. The only plausible reality is me dying at 19 years old. The world will be better off without me once I am dead. 

This year will be the year I will die. There is no other way out of this
