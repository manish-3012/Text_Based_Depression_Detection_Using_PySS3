Somebody tell me what to do..Everyday just gets so much worse, I can't stop crying and I have this terrible pain in my chest. I have been posting so many topics like this, but I don't know what to do anymore. I'm too afraid to tell myou parents. I don't have the money to see a doctor. Part of me wants to feel okay and the other part wants to be miserable, I can't describe it. At this point, I really want it to end and I'm not sure how much longer I can be here. The only time now when I feel okay is when I think about not being alive.
