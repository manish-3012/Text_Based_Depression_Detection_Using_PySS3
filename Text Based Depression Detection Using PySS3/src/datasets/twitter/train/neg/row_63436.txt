That old joke...You might have heard it, how many psychiatrists does it take to change a lightbulb?  Only one, but the lightbulb has to really want to change.  Not really a joke of course.

I'm just typing this out because I want to see if it make sense when I read it like it does in my head.  But I don't really want to change.  Life doesn't get better unless you work to make it better, and I've proven time and again that I'm not going to do that.  So what hope am I holding on to?  Some miracle that's going to completely change who I am?  That's not going to happen and I know it.  Almost 42 years of life and I have nothing to show for it.  No prospect of a job, let alone a career - and I wouldn't be able to keep one even if I could get one.  No real shot at a relationship because I couldn't in good conscience let anyone get that close to me, even if someone were willing.

The real damnable thing is that I've tried medication, and I've tried therapy, and you know what?  I don't want them to work.  Because if they did, I'd actually have to try and be a functioning adult and I'm too fucking scared to do that.  And because of that I hold myself in such contempt that I can't imagine anything that would free me from the mental prison I've built.
I have nothing for myself to live for.  All that's been holding me here is the few friends and family that I have.  But you can only live for other people for so long and I feel like I've gone well past that point.  If I can't live like this, and I'm not going to change, I don't see any other way out.
