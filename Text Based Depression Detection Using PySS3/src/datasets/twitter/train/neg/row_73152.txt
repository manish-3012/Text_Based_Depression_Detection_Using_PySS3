Im going to attempt again.Iâ€™ve attempted so many times since April, but Iâ€™ve somehow managed to stay alive. I miss my ex and she absolutely hates me, she blocked my number, I want to get back with her and try to make shit right, she lives in TX, and I live in Ca, but I want to move out there and let her know Iâ€™m committed and serious about how much I love her. I feel like my friends are on her side and they are not telling me things I should know. My family makes me feel like Iâ€™m trapped in a prison, everybody is annoying to me now, Iâ€™m so depressed, I donâ€™t want to be involved in anything, I feel trapped. Donâ€™t tell me that thereâ€™s more girls out there because sheâ€™s all I want and if I canâ€™t have that then Iâ€™ll just attempt suicide again and again until I rot in hell. I miss her, i cry every night about everything, everything pisses me off, I canâ€™t take this shit no more, I want to hurt everybody around me bc my mental health is fucked. I canâ€™t do this no more I want to end it.
