I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself tonightI donâ€™t really know what to right tbh

Iâ€™m a 15 year old trans guy, came out when I was like 11 and waited on the Tavistock (the uk gender clinic) for like 3 years and then once I got there they distarged me cos I donâ€™t have any fucking friends anymore and my step dad was being a prick so that apparently means I donâ€™t know shit about myself, we literally only had like idk 3 meetings. I had been waiting so fucking long for this. I feel so fucking dysphoric all the fucking time I hate my body so fucking much. I just want enough testosterone to at least make my voice a little deeper. And whatâ€™s pushed me to the edge is when I went out yesterday literally 5 people called me a girl and my mum and step dad have pretty much given up on calling me a boy and by my pronouns, they always call me a girl/thier daughter and use she/her. And even if I do get to transition this society is so fucking transphobic like just on fucking twitter or some shit and on every post to do with trans folks itâ€™s always so negative like thereâ€™s a whole wave of even cis lgbt ppl hating us. Literally whatâ€™s the fucking point. Iâ€™ve already attempted suicide over this when I was 12 and camhs did absolutely nothing, no therapist or anything. I have not a single friend except for like one online friend and literally every family member that was like â€˜oooh you tried to kill yourself this is so sadâ€™ has hardly spoken to me since plus I havenâ€™t even met half of my family and my biological dad hardly ever speaks to and keeps on arranging times for us to meet them cancelling like the only person that might actually be upset about me dying is my cat.

Anyway, I already have 2 codomsl pills with me right now and according to google I only need like 5 in one go to kill myself and thereâ€™s probably way more in the house so yeah canâ€™t be arsed with life and I have literally ~nothing~ to live for so, goodbye
