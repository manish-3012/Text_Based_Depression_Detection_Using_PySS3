Extreme lonelinessI can't take it anymore, I am so alone. I have nobody in my life. I feel nothing due to lack of relationships with people. I just want to die. I have no close friends in my life, nor do I have any friends. I can't take it anymore, I just want to die. I tried killing myself when I was 15 three times. Eight years later, I still want to die, almost every day. The suicidal thoughts are out of control. I feel like I am past my expiration date, I just don't want to exist anymore. I regret not killing myself when I was 15, the world would be better off with out me.
