AttemptedI just took a mild OD and Iâ€™m not sure what to do. I know itâ€™s mild, not life threatening most likely, I stopped partway through cause I panicked for some reason...I donâ€™t know what to do anymore Iâ€™m so stressed and upset. I feel like Iâ€™m burdening everyone (especially cause of the coronavirus). I feel worthless and alone. Iâ€™m so tempted to go back and finish the job. I dumped some stuff down the drain so I couldnâ€™t take it. The only thing stopping me is my cats. Idk what to do anymore.
