I just want to knowI've thought of suicide ever since I was 14. Most times because of the circumstances surrounding my personal life, while other times I feel suicidal simply because I feel like I've done all I could in my life and that there's no meaning in living a long life. 

Like, the very idea of living until 60-70 years old before I'm finally able to die naturally seems very "uncomfortable" (don't really know the right word to describe it) to me.

And so, I just want to know. Is this a phase that I'm going through? Does everyone go through the same thing at my age? These thoughts of mine have been plaguing me for so long and though I've always wanted to go to a therapist, I'm not sure if it's serious enough for me to go. Maybe I'm just looking for attention, you know?

I feel tired and I don't know what I should do about it
