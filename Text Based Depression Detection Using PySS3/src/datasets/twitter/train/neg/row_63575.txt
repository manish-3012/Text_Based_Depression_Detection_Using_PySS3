I just took a lot of pills then had a change of heart and made myself throw most of them up. Please help stop me from doing it again.this might not be the point of this subreddit but basically, I've been suicidal for a very long time. Honestly? since as early as I can remember. I've got a memory of taking like 6 paracetamols and then thinking I was going to od when I was like 12...

the tldr story is: brother molested and beat me, mother was very strict (as stupid as this sounds, whenever I heard the front door slam I shook with fear) and my dad kicked me out. I'm now in uni and I've had a group of awesome friends for a while now. life is going as it should. but I still feel really sad... maybe once every 2 weeks I get really down and thinking about everything that's happened and everything that I've repressed. but for the other part of that 2 weeks I feel awesome. maybe I've got bi-polar, idk. but right now I don't want to die when 20 minutes ago I did. if you can help me not feel like that again then I would be very grateful. counselling might be a good idea but I'd feel a little strange going to some stranger and being like, "hey I feel sad and I tried to kill myself earlier because of this and this and this" when nobody else knows. my ex girlfriend suffered from depression and apparently they were no help to her - they just offered her pills and sent a letter to her parents (when she had no contact with them, they told her parents she was suffering from depression etc which turned me off the whole idea). 

idk, this might be taking away attention from the people who are actually considering suicide but I really feel like I need to stop repeating this pattern of normalness followed by feeling like a shitty hopeless failure. 

argh I don't know what else to say.
