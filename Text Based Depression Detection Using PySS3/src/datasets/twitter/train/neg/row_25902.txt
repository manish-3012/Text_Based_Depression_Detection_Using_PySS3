Why aren't I good enough anymore?I got told by the girl I've given all my heart to that she doesn't want a relationship right now only to be told later by my mutual best friend that its not that she doesn't want to be in a relationship right now, its that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with ME at all. Idk what do and despite getting "rejected" by her before I wasnt completely heartbroken because it was ubderstandable if she didn't want a relationship since were both young (16) but now that I know the truth i feel like ive fallen down a cliff and there's no way back up. 

She wasn't honest with me and I feel cheated on but I still love her and would do anything to get her. Why does it hurt losing something I never had in the first place?

Another thing is, the guy she "used to" (imo still does) like is single now and they were flirting with each other over the last week. It wouldn't suprise me if the guy (who I happen to complete despise) dumped his prev of to get with her and I'm guessing they're going to become a couple very soon. 

I miss her. It used to be me making her laugh. It used to be me making her smile. Why aren't I good enough anymore?
