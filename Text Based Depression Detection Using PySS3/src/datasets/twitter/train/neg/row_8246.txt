I want to kill myself of all the stress but then again Iâ€™m too scared to dieIâ€™m still in school but school and personal life is stressing me out so much. Not only that my life is a stressed and depresed mess Iâ€™m still considering suicide. I feel like nobody cares about me. I feel like no one in my house expect my grandma. My friends say oh youâ€™re so smart and talented but then again I donâ€™t think there is anything special about me. Iâ€™m far behind in school in grammar and punctuation. My teachers give me a B but my mom thinks I need a D. I normally cry for some reason is that normal? I always distract myself with the things I like. I donâ€™t really have friends outside school. Anyway I need help as much as possible.

Iâ€™m sorry if this is a jumbled up mess.
