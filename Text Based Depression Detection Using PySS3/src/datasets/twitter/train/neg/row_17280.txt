The only reason I haven't killed myself is because I have people in my life who care..Hello everyone. Throwaway account, of course. I am a 23 y/o male who has been struggling for quite some time. A lot of suicidal and depressed people say that wish they had people in their life that cared about them and how that would make life better. But, I'm going to come from a different perspective and say that the only reason I have  not killed myself is because I DO have people in my life who care and I don't want to upset them. I know it should feel "nice" to know that if I killed myself, people would be affected. But that's the problem. I just want to kill myself and be selfish (for once), but I can't because of what that will do to others...


This isn't a new feeling and I've been suicidal for at least 5 years. It's a fairly constant feeling and every now and then the urge gets pretty high. I've attempted once before, but failed. 


Just looking for thoughts and opinions I guess...
