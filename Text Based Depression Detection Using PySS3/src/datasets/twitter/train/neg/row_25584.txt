25000 mgI'm lying on the couch debating with myself if I should take 25000 mg of acetaminophen and see what happens. I know I can stomach 35 pills, but can I stomach 50? I'd like to find out. Then I'd like to let it all sit, not freak out this time. How long would it take acute liver failure to set in? A few days to a week, I would imagine. Painful, but I'm not sure that I care about that. I would most likely die... am I okay with that? On one hand, help may be on the horizon. On the other hand, I feel more anxious and suicidal with each passing day. I'm starting to clam up again too. Maybe this time when I take the pills, I'll be able to keep my mouth shut.
