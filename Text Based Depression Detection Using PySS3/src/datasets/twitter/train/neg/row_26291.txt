I stopped taking my antidepressants cold turkeyI'm really dizzy and having mental breakdowns that leave me so numb I literally claw at my skin trying to break out of the hell I'm trapped in. I hate not being able to turn my brain off. I'm so insecure. I've gained weight and I can't stop obsessing over it. Everyone's annoyed with me because I'm "still super skinny." I don't understand why they can't see what I'm seeing. I'm so self-conscious and disgusted with myself, everywhere I go. I stopped taking my meds just in case they're what's causing the weight gain. I feel so insane. 

On top of that, my boyfriend finally left me after being distant and cold for the past couple of weeks, making me feel like unwanted shit, everyday. I feel pathetic knowing I still miss him dearly and would take him back instantly if given the chance. 

Everyday I just try so hard to have a nice appearance and give people friendly smiles, and be there for whoever needs it.. I try so hard to be more lively and approachable and say fuck it to my social anxiety.. But I'm always overlooked. Like I'm invisible. Everyone befriends one another and I'm left out. I take a seat next to someone I had a nice conversation with last week, and they move to sit with someone else. Everyone is so confident and outgoing. Other girls are so beautiful and bubbly. I feel like I'm nothing more than a nobody who tries her best to get better but always ends up alone, crying and staring down bottles of pills. 

I try. I fucking try. I'm sorry my thoughts are all over the place. No one's gonna read this anyway but. I'm sorry.
