No way outEverything I do from here on out screws my kids over. Being brought up by me screws them over. Me leaving screws them over. Me dying screws them over.

I wish I could hand over my life to someone else. Wipe the memories of me from my kids, my husband, my mother, put this new woman in and let her take over. Have her be better.

I thought I was ok right now. My anxiety and pmdd were acting up and I'm struggling a bit more but I knew it's hormonal and will pass. I took the kids to their morning engagements and then we spent the afternoon playing down by the river, enjoying the early spring weather. And then my husband randomly picked a documentary about a mother of a young child trying to kill herself and it felt like my throat was closing over. I feel envious. I think of methods. I try to justify it, try to think of how they'll all be better off in the long run. 


They won't. My kids adore me. We fight and I yell when I shouldn't and sometimes I do go too far and am purposely mean but I think honestly they think I'm wonderful and cuddle me and kiss me and tell me they love me so much. Mama, I love you up to the moon. They'd be destroyed. I want mummy I want mummy. I've held them their whole lives.

It's awful pressure. I wish I wasn't here. I don't want to be medicated. I've hated it before I can't deal with it again. I can buckle down and push through and I'll manage but fuck. I wish I could replace me. And go somewhere, die somehow that wouldn't hurt anyone, just be done.
