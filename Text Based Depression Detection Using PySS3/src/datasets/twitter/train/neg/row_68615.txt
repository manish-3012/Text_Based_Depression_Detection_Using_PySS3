There is no fucking way in hell I am waiting until fucking 2024 for life to get better[https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/09/14/coronavirus-vaccine-availability-2024-jones-dnt-lead-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/top-news-videos/](https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/09/14/coronavirus-vaccine-availability-2024-jones-dnt-lead-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/top-news-videos/)

I am a musician, my dreams of having stable employment are basically dead in the water if this is true. No venue will be able to survive another 3 years of this. I will completely run out of money long before then. I have struggled with loneliness and depression my entire damn life, my entire life I have tried to seek help but nothing has ever fucking worked, multiple medications, therapy, nothing fucking works. Music is the only thing that makes my life worth living and if I got wait until my goddamn 30's when my back starts hurting and getting to old to mosh there is no point in living. I have given myself another year and a half- two years, and I am checking out for good. I have suffered long enough, I have had enough if this socially distanced hell. I just want to be held. But human touch will probably be taboo for this generation forever given the PTSD its going to give all of us.
