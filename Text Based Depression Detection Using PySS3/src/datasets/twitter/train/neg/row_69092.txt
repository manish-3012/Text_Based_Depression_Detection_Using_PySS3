I wish I could talk about how Iâ€™m thinking about suicide conceptually, but Iâ€™m not actually going to do it, so please donâ€™t ruin my life.I want to talk to somebody about how I find my own life overwhelming, and how Iâ€™ve had suicidal ideation in the past, and how now I feel like Iâ€™m hitting a wall again despite crawling my way out of economic poverty and an emotional desert, and how the idea of suicide has always been kind of a source of comfort for me when I get in my own head, because I think of suicide as a sort of final way out of this puzzle of life I cannot solve. 

I wish I could speak frankly about these things, and tell someone that I promise (and mean it) Iâ€™m not going to kill myself anytime soon. But I canâ€™t tell anyone. Because it would ruin the lovely life Iâ€™ve built for myself. because any person hearing me talk about these things would tell someone, and Iâ€™d lose my job in the long term. 

Iâ€™m just tired. And lonely. Iâ€™m not going to kill myself. But I think about it a lot. And I think, probably no one would notice if I did.
