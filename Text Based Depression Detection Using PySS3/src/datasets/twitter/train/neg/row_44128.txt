I wanna kill myself but I don't wanna hurt the person I love.I've been depressed for as long as I remember and I think about killing myself daily. I've tried before but failed. 
The past few months have been the worst so far.
But I met this guy and I fell in love with him.
He doesn't understand that me wanting to die has nothing to do with him. He always tries his best to cheer me up and when he doesn't succeed he blames himself. I know he would think it's his fault if I kill myself. I don't want him to be in pain. I just feel like I'm dragging him down. I don't deserve him. 
I wish he would forget about me and find someone that isn't sad all the time. I wish I could kill myself without hurting him.
