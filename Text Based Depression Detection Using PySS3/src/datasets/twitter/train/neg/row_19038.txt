Best of luck in life everyone.I am useless. I have no friends, no job, no license, no money, no social skills and I'm about to turn 20. I know i can work on everything, but I don't have the energy. I fight myself everyday. I think 24/7 and it never stops. I'm also a drug addict. It's the only thing that brings me some sort of relief from myself and life. I feel like a loser, like a nobody. I've been this way for a few years now. My mother calls me a loser and a junkie, tells me to get a job etc. I know she is right, but for some reason it hurts me hearing the truth. I've failed everything in life, I hate who I am. My best friend jumped in front of a truck 5 months ago and was killed. That broke me inside and I feel guilty that I wasn't a better friend, wasn't there for him etc. I dont see the point in this life any more. Im getting older now and I feel depressed knowing I've done nothing with my almost 20 years of life. My grandfather has a box of leftover oxycontin that I stole a while ago after he had a hip replacement  ( scumbag, I know.)  as I'm writing this, I've just Swallowed  20, 2mg Alprazolam pills. I'm following that up with some oxycontin, dph and alcohol as I know that should well and truly be enough to finish me off. I only signed up to this app no more than a few hours ago, and seeing all theses posts and knowing I'm not alone is comforting. I'm sorry for ranting, I just wanted to get this off my chest before I'm gone.
