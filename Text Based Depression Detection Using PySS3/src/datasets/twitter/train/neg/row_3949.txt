Assisted Dying LocationsI read about a nurse that has already paid for her own assisted suicide somewhere in Europe, as she does not want to live past 75 because she has worked in a hospice for over 30 and has determined that 75 is the general age most people lose their mind.  

I want to look into this place as it seems like the best way to die, but I cannot find anything through google except research papers.
