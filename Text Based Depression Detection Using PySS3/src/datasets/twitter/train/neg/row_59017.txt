The love of my life just broke up with me.Whoever said its better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all is full of shit. Ive been in love with her for 7 years and this year i finally managed to get her to return the feelings. We were together for 5 months and she even told me she loved me. We even talked about having kids in the future. Then out of the blue she said this 
&gt;I've been thinking a little bit lately and I feel terrible but I don't think that I really want to continue this for multiple reasons. I really am sorry and I think that you're a wonderful person but I don't think I'm the right one for you. I think you deserve somebody who is more like you and wants the same things as you.

I feel so empty. I just cant think of life without her. How can she say she loves me two weeks ago, goes on vacation and comes back to say this. I havnt eaten in a day and a half and i cant stop the tears. I just feel broken.
