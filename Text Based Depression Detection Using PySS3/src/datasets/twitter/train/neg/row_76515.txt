Is this a good place to talk about the times I think I attempted suicide?Now I understand a failed attempt is very easy to remember but for me I just wanted to go to sleep, but the problem was I abused opioids, and quite a few times I took enough that it should have killed me, I think one time I took 30 lortab 10mg? It's hard to remember because usally I woke up in the woods or somewhere weird, my family never bothered to take me to the hospital..
