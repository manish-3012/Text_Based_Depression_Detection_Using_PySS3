Suicidal, not suicidal?Hey guys, Iâ€™ve been thinking of killing myself over the past few months even though I know I donâ€™t have the guts to do it. The thoughtâ€™s been constantly bugging me and thereâ€™s always that voice in my head telling me that suicide is the best rational option for me. I donâ€™t believe I have it in me to live; everything seems so futile. Itâ€™s a cold dark feeling that I canâ€™t get rid of. And Everywhere I go, Iâ€™m reminded of the different ways I could kill myself there and then. Iâ€™m wondering if anybody else feels the same way and what theyâ€™ve done to deal with it?
