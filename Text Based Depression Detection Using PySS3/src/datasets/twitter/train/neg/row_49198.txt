I havenâ€™t been this suicidal in months. Iâ€™m crying and cuddling with my service dog, but I canâ€™t seem to calm down.It started a few days, maybe a week ago. The depression hit like a hurricane. Suddenly, I was sleeping 20 hours a day.
Suddenly, I couldnâ€™t get up to take my dog to the dog park for his daily exercise. Suddenly, I wasnâ€™t eating or cooking. Suddenly, I was plagued by nightmares and night sweats and even completely disrobed myself during one of these nightmares. I havenâ€™t spoken to anyone. I have isolated myself. Iâ€™ve refused to acknowledge how bad itâ€™s gotten until just about 30 minutes ago I started sobbing heavily. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
