i've lost every sense of myself, i want to die.i'm depressed, cutting constantly, and i can't face myself. i hate every aspect of myself and i can't see any light at the end of this fucking tunnel.
all my thoughts link to suicide, its all i can focus on and its the one thing i want.
i have become withdrawn from my friends and family, i'm not feeling any interest in anything.
my mind is dead, im dead inside.
