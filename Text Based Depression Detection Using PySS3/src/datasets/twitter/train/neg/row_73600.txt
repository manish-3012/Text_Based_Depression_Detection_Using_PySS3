im a cowardI don't want to kill myself. Its not that i'm scared of death, but i'm scared of the pain, and how my family will feel once i'm gone. I want to be hit by a car, but I could never put that on the drivers conscious. I don't know what to do, this quarantine has driven me to a real low point.
