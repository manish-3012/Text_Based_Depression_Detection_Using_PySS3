Running out of cons here.Just like the title says. I'm legitimately running out of cons to my suicide. There are just. So. Many. Pros. Personally. I don't think I could ever do it. But it's all my mind has begun to think of. 

It would benefit so many people if I left. My Ex/boyfriend. Same person. I don't know what we are at the moment. It's long distance. And I know he doesn't want me. But over the past four years we've bonded too much for him to be able to walk away. 

My few friends. I could say I have a list of 10 people I would consider myself even relatively close to. And I wish that list could be shortened to 5. I'm a terrible friend. I don't try most of the time anymore. And with the few people I do try with. I mess it up. 

I'm the person who fucks everyone and everything up. Whether I want to or not. Good things don't happen to me. And if they do, it doesn't matter because they won't last long. Nothing does. I don't get. To be happy. It's not allowed. All I do is bring people misery and I'm getting really fucking tired of it. It would benefit so many people if I didn't exist.
