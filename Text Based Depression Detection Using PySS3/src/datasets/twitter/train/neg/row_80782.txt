Itâ€™s happening. How do I make it easier on my mum?Hey everyone. Im incredibly sick mentally and physically. Iâ€™ve been drug hoarding for the last few years and the time has finally come to follow through. I live with my mum whoâ€™s been really supportive and tried to help me through it all but itâ€™s just completely hopeless. She loves me but not enough to break up with my stepdad who molested me for 4 years and took photographic evidence. I canâ€™t live as long as I am around his presence and I canâ€™t live anywhere else because I canâ€™t work. I was in the psych ward for a month this year and have just gotten worse. I really tried with the meds this time. I got a refill just to add to my collection Iâ€™m using to end it. 

My mum is troubled. My sister died when I was younger and I donâ€™t know how my mum would cope losing another child and she has 4 others besides me. 

Should I go for a long drive, somewhere where I wonâ€™t be found for a while? Will it be easier if enough time passes with me missing that she can just assume? Is that better than finding my body? Sheâ€™d be the one to find it as thereâ€™s no one else who would care. Iâ€™m schizoaffective so Iâ€™m very secluded. It would take her a few days to notice Iâ€™m sure. I canâ€™t cope with the pain. I have a chronic pain condition. I have schizo symptoms. Tactile and visual hallucinations. Catatonia. Sleep paralysis. This morning I woke up to the feeling of being crushed under someoneâ€™s weight and my tongue being grabbed and twisted. My tongue was twisted in the side of my mouth for minutes before I could move it. I feel possessed. Thatâ€™s only scratching the surface but I canâ€™t write about my other hallucinations or it will make them worse. I get punished. Please help me with the best way to go about killing my self. I have multiple unopened boxes of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and painkillers such as tramadol and codeine that Iâ€™ll be taking.
