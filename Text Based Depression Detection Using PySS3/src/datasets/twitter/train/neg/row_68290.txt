Getting ready to kill myself tonight...so i'm 16 years old (i'm a male) and tonight i'm going to kill myself... 

... my mother is 44 and my brother is 18. the reason i want to do this is because i discovered a few weeks ago that my mother is having sex with my brother.... now i have nothing against the idea of a mother having sex with their son. in fact i've been wanting to have sex with my mother since i was 14. 

when i confronted my brother about it he was at first anxious. but i assured him that i had nothing against it. i told my brother that i also want to have sex with her and he laughed about it. he told me he was cool with it and it wasn't like there was any love involved in their sex. i asked him how i could get her in bed and he told me that it just kinda happened. my brother is in college and i am in high school. my brother still lives in the same house because the college he is going to is pretty close to where we live. 

he told me that one day while i was at school they started flirting with each other. one thing lead to another and it just happened. hearing this gave me such a sinking feeling because i was so jealous. 

i feel like maybe i could sleep with her if i tried to flirt with her... but i honestly feel it's worthless. 

there are a bunch of pain killers in the bathroom that i plan on taking tonight... 

i'm sorry i just had to get this off my chest and post this somewhere.
