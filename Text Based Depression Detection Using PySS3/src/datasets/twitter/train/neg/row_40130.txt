Iâ€™m too weak for this worldIâ€™m never going to make it on my own because over time I see just how incompetent and stupid I am. Iâ€™m so awkward, quiet, and nervous around people which means Iâ€™m always going to struggle being around other people. Iâ€™m too sensitive and I cry very easily over everything which makes it worse since Iâ€™m a guy and Iâ€™m expected to keep all of this shit inside forever until I die. Iâ€™m fucking sick of the failure and pain that comes with living. This world isnâ€™t meant for weak people like me.
