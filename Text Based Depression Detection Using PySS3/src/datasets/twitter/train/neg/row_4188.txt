I canâ€™t afford therapy and I donâ€™t know what to do.I need help, I seriously need help and I feel so trapped. I canâ€™t miss work, I just donâ€™t know what to do. My insurance hasnâ€™t kicked in yet and I feel so scared at this point. I can graduallykcv feel myself getting worse. I have days where I lash out at the people I love and the next day I wake up either not even remembering and feel so vconfused why Iâ€™m getting treated differently than before. I donâ€™t understand what is going on with my brain and I honestly just hate it. I want help, I want help so bad. I need it. I just feel so trapped. I honestly am struggling to word my own thoughts right now because I just donâ€™t even know how. How can I get help if I canâ€™t even properly think or form sentences
