I don't know anymoreI am a high school student in Italy, and I just feel like I want to kill myself. I have had suicidal thoughts for a year now, but the feeling is just growing. I am probably just an angsty teen with problems that are minuscule in confront to everyone else on this subreddit. I am now currently studying to enter my 'dream' college and make my family proud. Everyone just expects so much from me (I am the 'nerd') but I think that maybe killing myself might put my soul at rest. I cry every day now and every day I have a stronger urge to suicide. Sorry if my English isn't too good, I am italian
