I'm just tired and it's not worth itI feel like sleeping all the time, but at the same time it's so hard to sleep longer than a few hours. 

every joy seems so dulled down to the point that I'd rather not bother, and every bit of movement feels like trying to swim in molasses. every part of me is just sore for no reason, and the only place that feels even close to okay is in bed. 

I can't work. I just can't. I don't have the brain for it. even a small job a few hours a week is just to much. everything about it is bad, and for what? so i can do it again? I can't even fucking stand for an hour without my shins feeling like they're going to split down the middle and being alone in my own head for an hour or two is crippling

I miss my ex and i hate people.
