He didnâ€™t care.
My family doesnâ€™t know..well Iâ€™ve told them, but I lied I said he didnâ€™t do it, but that he was going to.
I feel like i deserved it because I let it get that far.
How can something like that happen at a party..just outside, while your parents are inside dancing to fourth of July music? 
I hate constantly dissociating.
