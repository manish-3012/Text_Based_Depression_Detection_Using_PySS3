I'm tired of being a disappointment. This is it, goodbyeI'm tired. Tired of being a disappointment. Tired of always letting people down. Tired of being, me.

I'm probably getting kicked out of uni soon, and honestly, I think that's my tipping point. I've been at an all time low recently, and I'm exhausted.

My parents have invested so much into my education, and have always supported my decisions. They work their asses off, just so I can have a decent life. And all they expect in return, is me doing well. And I can't even give them that. I fucking love them so much, but I'm tired of always letting them down. Tired of always giving them bad news. Tired of always seeming like a colossal fuck up.

My "best friend", the one person who I could always go to with anything, doesn't seem to give a fuck anymore. She was my lifeline, and now she's basically fucked me off, and I'm done.

So yeah. I guess this a goodbye to all of you guys, and most importantly, a goodbye to my family.

I'm sorry
