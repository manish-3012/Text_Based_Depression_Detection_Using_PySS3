16 years old and I've already stopped caringI've known for a long time that I my chances of ever finding love are nil. I'm ugly, I'm awkward and weird, and I now have severe acne that makes me repulsive in the present and will probably leave me scarred and disfigured for life. People try to tell you things like "get a hobby" and "girls aren't everything", but these same people will gladly talk about how their love is the center of their lives, etc. We make jokes about the cat people for a reason: There lives are as depressing as it gets. The way I see it, a loveless life isn't worth living. I've ceased to care, ceased to feel anything but the aching pit in my stomach. I'm normally a good student, but I'm failing math because I simply can't focus or try. I'm done with this cruel life.
