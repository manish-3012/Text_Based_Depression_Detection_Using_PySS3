God Doesn't Love MeIf he did love me, I would not be feeling this way right now. So alone and feeling like everything is my fault. Feeling like my anxiety and panic attacks and depression are all my fault.

"You can control it," says my boyfriend as he plays on his phone and laughs at memes while I'm crying on the other side of the room. "You just choose not to."

Where is God? Why isn't he helping me? I'm starting to lose my faith. He isn't there for me. He never was. If he was, I would not feel like I want to die and I would not feel so much hatred for myself and that I am such a problem in people's lives.
