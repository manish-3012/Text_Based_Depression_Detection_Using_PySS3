It's so hard to work towards the future when you don't even want to be in it.Eat healthy, exercise everyday, get skinny for what? Who am I getting skinny for? The mortician? 

Study hard, complete assignments, get into a good college for who? I don't plan to live that long.

Maintain friendships, keep in touch with people. Only for more people to hurt when I'm gone? 

Fuck this shit man.
