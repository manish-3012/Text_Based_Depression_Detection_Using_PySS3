I just turned 19, a year closer to my inevitable death.I just turned 19. I'm not sure how I've managed to make it this far, and I'm not sure how much longer I can go on. I think about not being alive so regularly that it's just become a part of my every day life. I have practically no friends and only one person makes an effort to talk to me, but it's out of pity; I know it is. Medication didn't have any positive benefit, therapy didn't work as I struggle to talk to anyone at all, I feel like I can't be helped. My anxiety has gotten to the point where I can't even leave the house without feeling sick to my stomach or shaking when engaging in a social interaction. I'm not motivated to do anything. I'm a negative person. I'm quite literally useless, and I don't think anyone can tell me otherwise. I wish I could just gift my life to someone who wants to live but is struggling, like someone with an illness or some malnourished, starving kid in a third world country. I don't know. All I feel is constant pain. I do nothing but sit at home all day in my room. I don't have a job anymore, nor am I partaking in any kind of education. I'm overweight, socially inept, useless and overall just not deserving of any kind of life. I doubt anyone will care or bother to read whatever I've just managed to jot down onto this post, but oh well. I could go into detail and write so much more regarding how much of a mess my family is and stuff like that but I don't think there's a point because no one cares. I don't know anymore.
