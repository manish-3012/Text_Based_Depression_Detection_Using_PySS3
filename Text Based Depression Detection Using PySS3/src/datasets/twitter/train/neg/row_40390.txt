I am doing it I am fucking doing itI am 15. I am fucking doing it. Almost everyone Laughed at me, Everyone just laughted at me, I dont belong here. I am shit abd everyone treat me like a shit. All family expect my brother thinks it my fault that every mental health problem I have its my fault even if they know my math teacher give me trauma. I am shit I dont belong here. God please have mercy on me, Sorry for my sins, Sorry for the rude words I say about you a moment ago. I was religious a couple months ago and not because I had terrible moment at life but this is longer story. Please god have mercy on me please. It was my fault or not? I dont know at this moment God have mercy
