I can't afford to get the help I needAs time goes on, the temptation of killing myself grows. I have seen therapists in the past, but due to medical bills and my inability to hold down a steady job I can't afford to get help anymore. I dropped out of college recently and I now have to find a new place to live. I don't think I'll be able to make it on my own in the mental state I am currently in. I'm thinking about ending it all soon. I've been fantasizing about ending my life all day today.
