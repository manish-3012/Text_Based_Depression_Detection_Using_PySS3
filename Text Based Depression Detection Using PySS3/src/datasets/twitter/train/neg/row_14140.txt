I'm really really hurt insideI... I really dont know how much longer I can do this. I'd cry for help but honestly I can tell people my issues , I can tell people my life story , I can say my mental illnesses but almost never helps. :((

I truly feel sick. And I had a very dark experience on Magic Mushrooms last year and it fucked my head up so good that I dont feel pleasure from weed , alcohol or almost anything. But I've been badly depressed for 10 years.

I often want to die. But anytime I get close I get scared away . I'm so damn lonely it hurts too. I never had any real friends or relationships or sex and I'm too depressed for that anyways. I hurt so badly inside. I'm stranded in this life and no one understands:( and even if someone does im still hurt and nothing changes.
