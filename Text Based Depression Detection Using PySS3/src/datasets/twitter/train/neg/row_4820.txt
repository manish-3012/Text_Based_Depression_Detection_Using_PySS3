I Don't Know What to do Anymore...I'm a senior in high school who has had severe mental health issues for a very long time. I'm also an online student who takes a few seated classes at my high school. 

Currently I have to have all of my classes finished by this Friday (Jan. 20th) and I'm nowhere near finished in 3 of my classes. I have no idea how I'm going to manage all of this work. I've been putting all of this off because I literally can't think about anything except how much I want to kill myself. It's all I can focus on...

If I don't finish these classes, I have a feeling that my counselor won't let me stay in my two seated classes (advanced choir and advanced acting.) Going to those classes are the only social interaction I get each day, and without them I don't know what I'll do. I already feel so isolated, without those classes I don't think I would ever leave my house. 

I can't think of anything to do except to kill myself... This would be my 5th attempt. I don't necessarily want to die right now, but this is the only solution I can come up with.
