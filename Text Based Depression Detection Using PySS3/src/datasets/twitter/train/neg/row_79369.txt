Don't know who to turn to, but in dire need of help.I'm going to make this as concise as possible though I can answer as much as necessary, my girlfriend is probably going to commit suicide soon I'm currently the only one taking care of her, I think she desperately needs intensive therapy however a psych ward would be horrible for her, she's been once it's the worst for someone who is so lonely If anything it drove her even crazier. I can't always take care of her I'm at my wits end, she's tells me she's going to do it every night and every night I talk her down from it. I can't keep doing this, what other options are there, I have some money but I'm not rich by any means what can I do? I don't know how to save her.
