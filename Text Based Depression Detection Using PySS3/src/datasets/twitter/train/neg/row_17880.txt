I'm ScaredNot really sure if this is the right place for this.

It seems like I'm stuck in this never ending loop of wanting to die but being afraid of death, and wanting to live but being afraid that life is always going to be miserable. I don't want to hurt my family, but I'm scared that deciding to give up is inevitable. I'm sick of waking up every day feeling nauseous at the idea of having to make it through the next twelve hours, let alone days, or weeks. I don't really have a plan or anything, all I know is that I want everything to just go away.
