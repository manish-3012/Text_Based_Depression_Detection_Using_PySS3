No emotional supportI shouldnâ€™t have said anything to my parents. I arrived home from a meeting for the honors program at college and they asked me how the meeting went. I mistakenly decided to tell them the truth and I told them that I wanted to leave the honors program and they responded angrily at me. 

They told me that I was stupid for feeling this way. My mom even told me that she wanted to hit me. They were really angry at me during the conversation, and I was too scared to explain myself. Every time I tried to reach out to my parents about how I feel mentally, I am met with anger and threats to send me back to the 3rd world country they were raised in. 

I have been seriously considering killing myself. I am already a disappointment to them anyways. Before I learned how to drive, they had to drive me everyday to a pharmacy technician class I took in high school. After passing the class with an A and failing the certification exam to become a technician, I realized that I did not want to become a technician anymore and I got yelled at by my parents. I feel extremely guilty about this. I basically wasted their time by having them drive me to and from the school everyday. 

I told them that I felt lost about what I want to do in life. They replied back to me with â€œyou feel lost? Thatâ€™s stupid. How about I send you back to the town we grew up in so that youâ€™ll really feel â€˜lostâ€™. â€œ I feel even more isolated now than I did before talking to them today. 

Reddit is pretty much the only place I feel comfortable to share how I feel. I am too scared to tell anyone else about how I have been feeling.
