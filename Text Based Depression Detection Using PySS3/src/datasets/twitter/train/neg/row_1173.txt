I donâ€™t understand myselfIm 17m and i just donâ€™t understand why am i here. If God knew i would suffer why put me here . If its a test and im obviously failing and he knows everything why make me do the test. Im so depressed i cant even fucking cry . Its 2 in the morning in nyc and i want to end my life so horribly but i cant. Once i tried to choke myself out in the tub but i was too week and every time id lose feeling id loosen my grip and survive. My mom ask me if i was depressed and she got mad when i kinda implied i was , im not allowed to have feelings. I wanna kill someone i wanna murder and hurt people but 

Why cant u feel happy
