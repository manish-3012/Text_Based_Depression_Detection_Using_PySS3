I wasnâ€™t supposed to live past being a teenagerThe stability in my mental health comes and goes and right now itâ€™s particularly bad. I have suffered from mental health issues since I was a child, and it was particularly bad in my teenage years. Mental illness along with multiple suicide attempts destroyed my memory, and I feel like losing my teenage years to mental illness impaired me as an adult. 

Iâ€™m in university now, I do my work, get decent grades, but I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing. I donâ€™t enjoy anything, my program is okay but I donâ€™t see my future like so many people do. I struggle to make real connections with people, I am so emotionally unavailable and have hurt so many people leading them on and being unable to commit to them. I also barely enjoy sex and am traumatized from being sexually assaulted after a graduation party. I am wasting away my young adult years now, and soon enough Iâ€™ll regret not doing anything with my time. Therapy has never worked for me. I can safely say that I am a ghost of who I was, and who I couldâ€™ve been. I pretend and pretend but this part of me always seeps through the cracks. I want it to all end but I donâ€™t think I could ever die, I am an only child and only daughter and it would tear my family apart. Iâ€™m just stuck. Iâ€™ll never be who I want to be and I feel like I have no options
