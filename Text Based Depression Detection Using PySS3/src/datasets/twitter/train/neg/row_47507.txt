I have questions seeking answers!!I have been visitng /r/suicidewatch for a while and I can't seem to get answers for my questions.

Each time I post my problems and explain how suicide is the only solution for me, I just get answers like : how can u tell that your problems won't fade away. 

And the thing is I don't. But I know so many people who've been struggling with problems since ever since their childhood just like me, which is exactly why I'm even more encouraged to commit suicide. For now there seems to be no indication that my life will get better. I've studied my problems and discussed them with so many people and doctors and even my parents ( whom are kinda involved with the problems I have ) and I'll always get something like I don't know how you can fix your situation but suicide isn't the solution. 

If suicide isn't the solution then what is. I can't seem to find any kind of fix for my problems. Some of you guys might say : there's might not be indications for a better life '' today '' but maybe '' tomorrow '' there will be. 

That might be true and I'm convinced that it might get better. But then again let's go back to those people who's lives were so bad for 60+ years. Is it really worth staying alive and having to suffer all the pain? 

Please, give me good answers and don't try to cheer me up cuz I've had enough of that. I need answers!!
