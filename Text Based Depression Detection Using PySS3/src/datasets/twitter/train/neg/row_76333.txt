I'm tired of walking this same roadDepressed/anxious/major anger issues since i was 11 (18 now) been on and off meds (off now because meds did more bad than good) multiple therapists (all of whom did no help.) I have nothing to be sad over I have anything i could want. Im able to follow my dreams with parents support but i really don't care. The only thing i truly care about is dying. Ive been on SW in an inst. before and that was essentially a prison for kids with mental issues. I keep breaking valuable things (broke phone about 10 mins ago) and i have no money or job (im too fucking anxious to get a job and even more so with my ability to keep it) I can't keep mooching off my parents forever. The only thing I want in life right now is to be free of this brain, right now im too much of a coward to off myself but i build up courage as these days drag on.
