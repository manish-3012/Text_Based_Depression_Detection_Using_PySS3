What Iâ€™m not telling peopleI made an attempt a year ago when I was dumped. My family thinks Iâ€™m getting better but the truth is the only reason I havenâ€™t tried again is because theyâ€™d blame my ex, and I still love her and would never want her to be blamed for that or feel guilty. She has enough on her plate she doesnâ€™t need me fucking up her life ðŸ˜ž but I wish I could die so badly, I wish with all my heart.
