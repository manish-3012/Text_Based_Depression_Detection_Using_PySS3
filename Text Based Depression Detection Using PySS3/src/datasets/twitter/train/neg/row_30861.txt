IdkI was blessed with the perfect life, i have really supportive and loving parents, my sister and brothers are amazing and so are my best friends. I go to one of the best schools in my country and i have pretty good grades, im quite attractive and social and ive got loads of close friends.
 I started having depression when i was 11 (im 17y/o girl btw). For years i thought it was normal to be constantly thinking about killing yourself, i guess i had the idea so internalized that the possibility of feeling happy seemed unreal. The feelings, or lack of, have never gone away, i just feel constantly bored and without energy, nothing gives me pleasure or makes me feel anything at all, its been a really long time since i last fell happy.
I tried to kill myself 2 times already, when i was 13 and 15, but they didnt work (obviously) and no one found out. I also tried to get help and talked to my schools guidance councelor/psychologist, but she blew me off and didnt help at all. Ive been planning to do it again, the last couple of months have been specially hard. The only thing holding me back is my family because they love me, and i know i love them too but i dont feel it, which makes it worse. It feels weird writing everything down for strangers to see and it scares me. But i dont have anything to lose. Also, im aware i prob. sound bitchy or egocentrical but its my post so yeah.
