Suicide sounds more and more appealing as the days go by (19M)Just need to rant, don't expect anyone to really help but I appreciate it none the less. Realized this a few nights ago because you know the euphoric feeling you get when you are thinking of your crush or like actually with someone? Got that exact feeling thinking about suicide.. I can't do it because my parents love me too much and it will ruin them, but I fantasize about it all the time. I hate being sober, I just want to be fucked all the time so I don't feel like this anymore. My only motivation is each day is a day closer to my death. I went to therapy from 12 years old to 17, am on anxiety and depression medication but none of it helps. On paper I should be happy, but every time I achieve something that I thought would make me 'happy' I'm just as fucking depressed. I'm not afraid of death and that's probably a dangerous thing. 

Yes I know I'm loved, yes I know I can talk to loved ones and get help. Been through that it's just more depressing. I've heard every single supportive line anyone could say to me, it all means nothing. When others go through depression I give them advice that has been given to me and I pretend I also believe it, seems to help them but none of it helps me. I'm always lonely and sad and I don't know why, I have lots of supportive friends and my parents who love me yet I feel like I'm always all alone. 

If you read all that thank you, had to get it out of my head.
