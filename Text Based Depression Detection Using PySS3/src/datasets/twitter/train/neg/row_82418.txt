There is no point to life so why bother?All the successes in the world will mean nothing if I have no one to share them with, and I'll never have a companion like that

so wtf is the point?

I'm in my last year of college but have completely lost the motivation to do anything, I'm starting to flunk all my classes, falling behind on everything

I just want it to be over.
