I need to get everything outVent banned my device so I'm going to spill my thoughts here.
I didn't expect to live this long. I never feel like I'm real. I can't remember anything. Something big is missing, something bad happened and now I'm not normal anymore. I didn't plan to live past age 15 and now I'm 17, almost 18. What am I supposed to do now? I'm stuck while everyone moves on. I have no motivation. I have awful twisted obsessions, wishing to be victimized and "loved" and abused. Why? I don't know why I am like this. I thought everything was okay until I was 9 or so and now I am suffocating on everything. Everything is too much for me. I want to die. I suspect I am far too damaged to ever live a normal life. I don't want to live barely scraping by, barely living. I only want to die.
