Wanting to Drop Off (Third Post, Shit Title)I keep posting here. I feel like I shouldn't. I don't know why. Things get better then get worse then repeat over and over again. Everything is a chore, a labor. I hate doing anything, yet there is nothing to do. Everything is so fucking far away. I wish I had a gun so badly. I am so lonely I can't begin to describe it. I want to connect with people. I want to be able to communicate. Sometimes I feel like I don't know how. Sometimes I feel like an alien. I was driving around earlier, crying, and thinking there's literally nothing here for me. I want to help the world. I want to see it get better. I really do. It's too far gone and I can't make myself be satisfied. I am living in perpetual fuck-ups mirrored by the world around me. I just want it to all end. I want to know that the people that were once in my life and decided to move on did so for good reason. They knew I was going nowhere, just toward the grave. They win. Everyone else. I know I'm not alone in feeling this way, but sometimes it just doesn't fucking help. I honestly don't know why I'm still alive now. I'll read a good book or see a good movie with a great message and think 'I'll apply that to my own life'. Then I never fucking do. I can't figure out how to change and honestly don't want to. But, I can't stay the same. I don't know what to do except blow my brains out. That sounds so comforting right now.
