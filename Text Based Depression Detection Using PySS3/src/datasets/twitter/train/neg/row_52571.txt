My life is a rollercoaster of emotions and Iâ€™m tired of it.I woke up feeling great for no real reason and now all I want to do is blow my brains out. I couldnâ€™t care less about living, I put my mask on, head out for the day, come back and cry. Itâ€™s a viscous cycle Iâ€™m stuck in and Iâ€™m starting to work up courage to finally get it over with. No one is left to care. All I do is come here, vent out my emotions and thoughts, consider death then go to bed to start my cycle again. Itâ€™s all I think about anymore, if I get fired, fail my classes, I couldnâ€™t care less. Soon I tell myself. And I believe that.
