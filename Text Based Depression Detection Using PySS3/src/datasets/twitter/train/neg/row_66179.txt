Iâ€™ve had this weird feeling for a while now.So this is probably gonna sound weird, but Iâ€™ve been suicidal for such a long time now. Iâ€™ve planned it about a total of 2 times now, and I truly believed I was going to go through with it. Time passed, and I never gained the energy to actually go through with my plans. Iâ€™ve been sitting here for the past couple of days now...with this weird feeling that Iâ€™m not alive anymore. Donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™ve felt â€œdead insideâ€ for the longest but now itâ€™s a different feeling. It feels like I shouldâ€™ve been gone by now. Itâ€™s an indescribable feeling. It really, really feels like I shouldâ€™ve been gone by now.
