What books/movies/albums helped you?I recently found out that someone that I don't know well (like at all) is suicidal. Being someone who has battled with depression for 15+ years, and survived a suicide attempt 12 years ago, I don't want to ignore this information, but I want some sort of book, or movie, or album that I can reference or use as a segue way to help him out and let him know things don't stay the same, and that I'm here if he needs to talk (even though I'm a stranger to him.) 

Does anyone have any books or anything that really helped you?
