I had to put my 20 year old cat to sleep, I don't talk to my abusive family, my best mate who I've known longer than I had my cat for hasn't checked on me, and Christmas is all about those you loveI'm fucking struggling. 

I don't want this pain. 

I just cried on the phone to my partner who said "you were fine five minutes ago" and then gave responses that barely counted as words when I told him I've not been fine for a while now, I just got good at hiding it. 

Even for my age I have low fertility, though I've probably left it too late anyway. 

My nephew SNAP CHATTED me a pic of his one year old brother saying he now has a brother -- I used to be really good friends with his mum, my sister, and didn't think she would not tell me about being pregnant again, let alone birth another kid. To find out from my nephew has just been another kick in my teeth. 

I'm glad she's had another baby, fuck knows I can't. 

I thought my partner was coming over tonight so we could go look at Christmas lights -- the ONE THING I like about Christmas, and he said he thought it could be a Christmas Eve thing instead. That was when I said I had to get off the phone because I was upset. I don't have anyone else. My cat is dead, he was my family. 

The day I put my cat to sleep my partner fell asleep for 4 hours even after sleeping a whole night because "he was tired". I'm fucking exhausted. I've got nothing else to give. 

I've spent the day in bed too fucking scared to face the world. I want my cat back, he was the only thing keeping me going but he's gone. He's just gone. My heart is hurting. My closest friends don't care, my partner just gives half worded grunts and I've no family to go to. 

I'm fucking hurting.
