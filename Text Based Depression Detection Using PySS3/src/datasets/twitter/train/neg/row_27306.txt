I feel so petty for feeling like this...I'm so sick of being single. All my brothers and friends have someone. My friends are getting married. And I can't help but feel jealous. I want that. But nobody wants that with me. Am I destined to be forever alone? Was I born to die with nobody by my side? I'm losing hope. I don't know how much longer I can hold on....
