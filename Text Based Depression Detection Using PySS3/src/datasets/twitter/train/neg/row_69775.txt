Honestly, I think Iâ€™m immune to Aleve now.You might have seen my user floating around here or in various medical subs but I just thought Iâ€™d share my experience here. The past 3 days Iâ€™ve taken 10 pills of 220 mg Aleve each day. Nothing has happened to me. I havenâ€™t thrown up or fainted or got dizzy. The only pain I feel is my period cramps. I donâ€™t understand why or how my body is doing this considering I have an autoimmune disease with kidney disease along with it. Iâ€™m just confused at this point. Confused and tired.
