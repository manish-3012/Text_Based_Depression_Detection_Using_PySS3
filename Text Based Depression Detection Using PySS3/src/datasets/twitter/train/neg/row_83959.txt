i wish everyone in the world would feel the pain that i feelevery day i am preoccupied with suicidal ideas and thoughts. i have not gone 1 day without thinking about how i should kill myself in over a year. even now i am staring at the belt and metal bar in my closet wanting to hang my self. there is a sliver of me that wants to survive another  suicide attempt so that i can see peopleâ€™s reaction to how much pain i am in.  if i could make everyone in the world experience what iâ€™m feeling then they would understand.
