So I'm planning on overdosing on hydrocodone/acetometophen, is that a painful way to go?The past couple months have been really bad, I'm 18 and I feel like a complete loser. I had a bike accident 2 years ago and everyday now my neck and back are hurting. I've always had problems with mental illness but things have gotten so bad lately. I'm so emotionally unstable and the pain makes it so much worse. The meds don't seem to be helping either. I couldn't even hold down my job and at this point I feel like I'm just dragging other people down. I've been dealing with social anxiety now and can't even have normal social interactions at this point so I isolate myself in my room. Nothing interests me anymore and there is nothing more I want out of life. I am so phycologically damaged I have to fake social interactions with people and am constantly uncomfortable. I thought about hanging myself but I chickened out. I'm awfully afraid of the pain of dieing or if I will fail and make my life worse. I know that 90mg of hydrocodone is enough to be lethal and if that doesn't kill me the acetometophen will. I would like input as to how painful this would be or the chances of it working.
