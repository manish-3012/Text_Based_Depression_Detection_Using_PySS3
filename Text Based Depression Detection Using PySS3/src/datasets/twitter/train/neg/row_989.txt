Iâ€™m done trying, Iâ€™m just a huge drain on everyoneIâ€™ve come to my breaking point of even trying anymore, these past few months have pushed me past to the point of no return. It all started last year when I was let go from a well paying job, I was unemployed for months draining all my savings while unemployment paid me little to nothing. I applied to so many jobs that I was hopeful for only to get rejection after rejection. I had finally got a job months later but the pay was just enough to get me by month to month. I was struggling but was making it work. Then that job contract recently ended prematurely and I am back on unemployment with little to no savings and not getting enough to pay my bills per month. I am constantly asking my dad to bail me out of going into more debt and getting evicted every month and this month the debt has just piled up and donâ€™t have enough to pay my rent or even buy food. I have been again getting rejection after rejection on jobs and itâ€™s made me realize Iâ€™m not as good as I thought I was. The past 10 years of my life working and building up my resume has just been a waste of time it seems. I have an interview today with a job, but if I get rejected on this one then I am just going to end it. I canâ€™t keep asking my dad for money, Iâ€™m about to be 30 and canâ€™t even be a proper adult living independently. This is my final option, either I am offered that job or I end it all to save the financial drain I am causing everyone. Sure they will be sad I did it and angry I didnâ€™t ask for more help, but constantly asking for financial help is the bigger drain. Sorry to everyone that Iâ€™m going to hurt by doing this and sorry to all my friends and family. I canâ€™t do this anymore and have zero will to live past this. Goodbye everyone.
