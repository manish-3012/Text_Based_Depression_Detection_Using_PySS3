My best friend killed himself after taking the life of othersI won't go into detail, for obvious reasons, but my best friend of 6 years shot himself after killing other people. I can't possibly begin to explain what has been going on in my mind since it happened, but the one reoccurring thought is "if he couldn't handle this world, I've got not fucking chance."
 I feel like I'm delaying the inevitable. We turned to each other when things got hard. Talked each other out of really bad spots. Supported each other. 
I failed him. I let him down. And now I'm facing it without him here to help me through it.
