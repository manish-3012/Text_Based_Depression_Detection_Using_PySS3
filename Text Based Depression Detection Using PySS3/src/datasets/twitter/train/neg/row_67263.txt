I wonder what makes life so great that it's worth it to keep going.I'm afraid to ask this, because when I do I either get people telling me to ignore this thought, or I just get belittled. I dunno, there are times when it gets really bad, and I wonder what I'm even fighting for. It seems like you can't show that you're hurting or express sad feelings without being called emo or angsty, and it just leaves me wondering what makes life so great that showing anything other than happiness is to be met with ridicule. What keeps them going? I dunno, this feeling always comes back no matter what I do, and if I feel like if I felt like life was worth it despite all the hardship, I would think less about suicide and the recovery process would be easier. I figure no one can really answer this, but I'd like to know if anyone feels the same, or what keeps them going.
