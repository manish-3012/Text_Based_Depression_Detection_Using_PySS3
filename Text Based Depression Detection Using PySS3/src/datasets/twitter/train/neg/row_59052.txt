She can just come to my job and sat down and no one cares.I recently got a promotion here. This job kept me distracted and alive for the past year and a half. My restraining order against her timed out so what can I even say? There's no one to call, nothing to do. 

I'm a friendly drunk with a lot of passive friends, which is fine, but this can't be ok. "She can't be here, we have a history" won't work. I've proven to the court that she is fucking crazy. They were on my side. 

I was still found guilty of assault because I admitted to pushing her away from me. I can be put in federal prison if I try to contact her, but she can walk into my workplace and sit across me at the bar.

If I ask her what she wants to drink, BOOM. Five or so years.

Good news is I've spent the past year festering like a maggot at my laptop working on a video that explains everything. Check my post history.

What I'm doing tonight I'm doing for you. The law is biased tword women. Any rational person knows this. I'm about to show you how bad it can get. 

Don't you EVER piss one of them off. This is what happens. 

**Pay attention.**
