It's behind every cornerI feel like the part of me that wants me to kill myself is always looming in the background, I've gotten to a point in which literally every single mistake I make, no matter how small, makes that stupid little voice in my head say "see, you should just do it, just go for it" and I have to fight it off or I'll start spiraling down hard. I hate living like this, I hate that part of me and I don't know how to get rid of it. I feel like it's just waiting until the right time to finally convince me. I hate this.
