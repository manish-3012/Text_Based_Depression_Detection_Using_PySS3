Why does my family put me down when it's clear that I'm strugglingI've been really down for the past 6 months I've had constant dry eyes that are not going away. I've tried everything to fix it but it's not going away. I know with the corona virus it's hard to access doctors or opthalmologists but I need to know what's wrong with me and how to fix it to be sane. I feel frustrated that my parents don't feel a sense of urgency to get me help. I get told I'm selfish for wanting to see a doctor or opthalmologist and that it's not possible.
