I keep trying to find a way to be able to keep living but it doesnâ€™t seem like I have any options. I just need to kill myselfI donâ€™t really know why iâ€™m still trying. itâ€™s pretty clear I just need to kill myself. Iâ€™m a huge burden to my parents so they want me gone, but I have no where to go because I donâ€™t have friends or family. so iâ€™d have to be homeless, but Iâ€™m disabled and itâ€™s basically impossible and extremely dangerous for me to try to be homeless with my illnesses. Iâ€™ve been trying to look for help but there really is none. it just sucks because if i just had friends or family I wouldnâ€™t be in this situation because iâ€™d have somewhere to go and help to get me on disability and medicaid and into housing and stuff like that. my birthday is on the 23rd and I guess thatâ€™s when Iâ€™m going to do it
