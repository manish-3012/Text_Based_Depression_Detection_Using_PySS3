how can i feel suicidal, yet i'm afraid to die.as a muslim, they told me to pray and fastjng during ramadhan and it will make me happy and i will not have any problem in my life. guess what? its not. i have a financial crisis in age 22. i dont have fulltime job, and still live with my parents. i dont know, to who and where i share my story, at least i can hear some opinion. i hope, this is the perfect sub for this. and please, stop me being suicidal.
