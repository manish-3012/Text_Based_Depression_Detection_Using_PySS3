All alone on my birthday. Why am I supposed to live life spending birthdays and holidays alone?I have gotten a few gift cards but no parties and no people to spend my birthday with. I see people who have big families and lots of friends have big parties and get lots of gifts. Why can't I have what others have? Why is everyone so against me killing myself to end this pain, depression, and misery?
