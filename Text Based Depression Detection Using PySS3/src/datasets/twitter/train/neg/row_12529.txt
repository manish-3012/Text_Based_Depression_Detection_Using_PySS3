Another night.It's just the beginning of the night here for me. Another night. Another night. Scared of the day. Scared of the night. But I like the night best. It's quieter, calmer. There's such a huge difference between being physically alone and actually being alone. Would be so good if it were easier to easily trust people and tentatively induce a connection without doubting. 

Oh brilliant. My ex's song just came on. Fantastic. Exquisite heart ache. Oh give me more. Give me more baby. It's like a hug from someone who isn't there, and so you're really just hugging yourself. Perfect. Haven't heard from her in 5 months. I think about her every single day. Every morning. Ever night. Every time I want to tell her something... I remember she's not mine anymore. She's probably moved on... Not me though. I am not over it. I miss her every day. But yeah. It is what it is. 

But me and relationships... Done. 
I am done with relationships. You can keep it. I don't want it anymore. I don't want to even look another person in the eye again. 
I am done. 

It's not because a relationship I was in failed. 

It's because I am unnecessary. I'm not needed. I'm not helping anybody being here. 

The world could do without me. 

Yeah so why don't I just shut up and do it already. I keep thinking about it. I keep running over the plan over and over again, so why don't I just shut-up and do it already.
