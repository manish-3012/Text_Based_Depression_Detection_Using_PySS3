i think tonight might be the nightiâ€™m honestly just so tired of everything. i feel bad about hurting my family but i genuinely think theyâ€™d be better off in the long run, iâ€™m just a disappointment to most of them anyway. currently iâ€™m sitting with one of my little cousins right now. sheâ€™s so sweet and innocent and for some reason looks up to me. i know itâ€™ll hurt her and sheâ€™ll be confused and sad but honestly iâ€™m an absolutely terrible role model anyways. i dropped out of high school. i self harm a lot, a bad habit ive never been able to get rid of. iâ€™m going nowhere in life. i just feel like it would be easier to end everything now before it gets worse. this is probably all over the place iâ€™m definitely not thinking good rn . i donâ€™t know if iâ€™ll even have energy to leave a note but honestly i donâ€™t think itâ€™s even worth it. everyone in my life will be better off when iâ€™m gone the last thing they need is another reminder of me. i think ima just take all the pills i have (ive got two meds i take now and 2 other full bottles i got prescribed but never took) and slit my wrists too for good measure. last thing i need is to fail at this too ahah
