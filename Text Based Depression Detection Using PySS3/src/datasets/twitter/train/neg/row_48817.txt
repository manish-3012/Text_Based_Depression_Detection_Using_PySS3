I'm so tired. I don't want to keep going.I relapsed because of a person.

I can't even do school now. My dad is teaching me how to drive and I just want to crash the car every time. I can't eat or get out of bed.

I hate myself so much for being like this. But I don't hate myself enough to fix this either. I'm just so tired. I keep messing everything up.

I just don't want to wake up anymore. I don't want the world to keep turning and I don't want time to keep passing. I don't want to exist. Everything hurts too much. I just want everything to stop.
