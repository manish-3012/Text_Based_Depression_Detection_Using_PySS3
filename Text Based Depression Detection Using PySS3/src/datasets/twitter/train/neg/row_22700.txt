I just donâ€™t want to deal with it anymoreConstantly pressured with work and homework and weight and everything else, Iâ€™m tired, I want to drop out and quit my job and just sleep until I never wake up. Iâ€™m constantly stressed over how I look, my ptsd makes it so I canâ€™t even fucking hear a bag pop and getting triggered off. Iâ€™m failing all my classes because Iâ€™m so unmotivated to do everything and everyone has such a high expectation for me but I just want to go away, I donâ€™t want to let people down anymore, I hate rejection and I hate people not liking me, it hurts so much. I want to die but Iâ€™m terrified of killing myself and feel guilty doing it because of how others would feel. So I just keep suffering through it but Iâ€™m tired.
