I know I canâ€™t but I shouldI am not a good person. I have done horrible things. I donâ€™t believe I deserve to live and I donâ€™t see why I should be alive anymore. I know I wonâ€™t kill myself because I donâ€™t want to put my mom through that (sheâ€™s already had to bury one of her children) but i have been feeling this way for so long. I just donâ€™t ever see myself feeling good about myself. I am a narcissist to some degree but I still feel guilt for those Iâ€™ve wronged. I know I have issues. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. But Iâ€™m trying to stay afloat. Donâ€™t know what to do really
