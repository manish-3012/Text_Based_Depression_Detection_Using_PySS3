What is there to live for?What is there to live for and why should I look for it?

I have to survive because my instincts say so. It's normal and undeniable. But I don't want to. I don't find looking for something to delude yourself with enjoyable. Yes I'm delusional as is but I don't wanna get even worse. I just wanna be gone. Forever. For eternity. Unconscious and lost in nothingness. There's nothing else I can do. 

So I'm asking again. What is there to live for?
