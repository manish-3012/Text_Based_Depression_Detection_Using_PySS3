I still have suicidal thoughts, but I'm glad I went to a doctor about thisI've wanted to die since childhood, I never understood how humanity could function and thought I was sub-human and should be put down. I never thought I'd live past 20, then I made it to 23 and was 100% vacant. I never felt like a human being, I can't describe it but just separate and lesser. People in public would never guess this.

I thought death was the best option. I knew I'd be dead but each suicide attempt didn't work. I wasn't strong enough to kill myself, so I went to a doctor to admit I couldn't function. I was put on 15mgs of cipralex and while all my problems aren't solved, I'm a lot better than I was. 

I've been on meds for a few months now and my quality of life has improved. For anyone who hasn't sought treatment yet, I'd recommend expressing these feelings to a medical professional.
