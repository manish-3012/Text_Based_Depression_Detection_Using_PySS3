I want to die...I've been  struggling with depression for over 6 years now, and no matter what help  I get I still have a strong urge to die.  I don't want to exist  anymore.

All I've done is cause problems for people in life.  All I've done is mess up, and make people's lives worse.

Why can no one understand what I'm going through?
