Getting cold feetBeen a rough year , tbh it has been a rough five year batch...
Thought about suicide for the last five years and was so afraid of conventional means like hanging or slashing your wrists.
But i found the perfect drug to OD with ...it is OTC and it induces sleep and coma so i hope i am not gonna suffer ..

But i am getting cold feet .. and i am afraid ..
But staying alive this way is not living
