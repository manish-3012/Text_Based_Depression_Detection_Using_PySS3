I turn 27 on Monday and have been contemplating suicide for the past few hours.It wasnâ€™t until I started thinking about suicide I actually started to feel something again. Genuine emotion. I canâ€™t stop thinking about all the people Iâ€™ve hurt. Iâ€™ve pushed so many of my friends away. I constantly think about all my past actions and how Iâ€™ve made people feel. I seem to always do things for personal gain even though Iâ€™m not always gaining things. Maybe Iâ€™m fucking autistic I donâ€™t know. My mom died when I was 11 and it really fucked me up. I had to live with my dad and my step mom and we never got along. I did heavy drugs when I was 17 and had to join the military to get away from everything. When I got out allâ€™s I did was drink and Iâ€™ve only recently slowed down. I got a dui last year and still continued to drink and drive. I should be dead. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ve made it this far but I honestly feel like Iâ€™ve hurt so many people and done so many stupid things that it would just be easier to end it. I feel like since my mother died I donâ€™t have empathy anymore and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m such a fuck. One of the things that recently happened was one of my best friends really liked one of our other friends. I knew this and told him I would never do anything with her. But I did and it crushed him. Of course she wanted to do it but I said I wouldnâ€™t. I apologized and he accepted my apology and I helped him move to a new state recently with said girl. I broke that trust with my friend and I know we can never have what we had. I canâ€™t wrap my head around why I would do that to him but I did. I believe itâ€™s because Iâ€™ve lied so much to my friends and to myself and I want to change but I feel like I wonâ€™t. I sit typing this laying in bed wondering if tomorrow will be different but the more I lean toward suicide the more empathy I actually feel and it feels right. I canâ€™t even get back into the things I love anymore because I feel like such shit. I canâ€™t get a grip. I donâ€™t know if it is the right decision but at least I wonâ€™t have to deal with the pain of my existence anymore.
