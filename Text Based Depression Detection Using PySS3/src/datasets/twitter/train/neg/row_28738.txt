Why is this happening?I feel so disappointed in myself and so alone all the time, and I feel like I don't have anything even though I have friends, a loving family and a decent amount of money. I have a lot more than many other people in this world, yet I still feel like I'm a complete waste of space and that I'm a failure. I can't take it anymore, I don't understand why I feel like this, I have more than enough. I just want to be happy like everyone else I know. That's all.
