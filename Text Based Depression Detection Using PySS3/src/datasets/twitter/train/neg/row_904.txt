I don't want to be a whinny but i just can't take it anymore...Firstly, my apology for poor writing since English is not my first language. I'm trying to write as much understandable as i can.

I am 24-year-old introvert guy, who has emigrated to Australia recently. I am kinda introvert and have some can be considered as close friends. I have gone through a lot of things, including working in many underpaid jobs just to support my life here and finally got my permanent residency. I was so proud of that, even more when i got a job as accountant in a small accounting firm. However like they said "the higher you climb, the harder you fall", when i lost my job recently since my company was undergoing some major changes in their structure and there would be no more work that i could do, i am feeling so depressed and can't help the thought of being incompetent to keep the job. I've been trying to apply for another jobs but receive just rejection letters so far. Today it is even worse when my manager in my current underpaid part time job (where i've been working for nearly 3 years) said she was pissed when seeing me working so slow and wanted to fire me but would give me another two weeks to see how i would do. It was a huge shock since I didn't know what was just going on.
My career is just in no where and even a underpaid labour job that I couldn't keep. I don't know how incompetent i can be.
 Now i am in a place far away from home, can't talk to my family since I don't want them to worry sick about me and can't talk to my friends since they have too much to worry already. I have to admit that ever since i lost my job, the suicidal thought have just kept haunting me and today after what happened, i feel that tomorrow would be the last day for me.
I don't want to be a whiner, a pussy and hopefully won't cost too much of your precious time but anyone, just anybody please tell how can i get through this...
