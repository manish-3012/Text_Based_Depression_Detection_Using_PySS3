Iâ€™m finally going to do it.After years of being suicidal, I finally have a plan. I made a little box of pills and put it in the corner of my room for when the time is right. I wonâ€™t live to see 2020. I donâ€™t feel afraid anymore because suicide has been on my mind for the last couple months straight. I canâ€™t get the thought of me just not being here anymore out of my mind. I canâ€™t keep going forward, Iâ€™m not going anywhere. Nobody cares about me. Not my family, not my bf, not my schoolmates or my coworkers. Iâ€™ve never had a friend, Iâ€™m completely unappreciated, and my mind is driving me insane. Iâ€™ve no idea what Iâ€™m going to do with my life, I hate my job, I hate my major, I hate everyone around me, I hate society, and no one cares. There is no hope. I donâ€™t want to get better, I donâ€™t want help, I just want to get out. I donâ€™t matter, out of all 7 billion people in the world, me being here doesnâ€™t make a difference at all. I never knew anyone and no one knew me.
