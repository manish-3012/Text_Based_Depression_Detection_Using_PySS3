Suicidal thoughtsSo I'm at a dilemma at this point in my life. I made some stupid mistakes when i was 18 and have been clean from those mistakes going on 4 years now. Mid twenties and I am bi-polar with general anxiety as well as having 2 medical conditions brought about by past heroin use, one of them is wasting disease, the other hep C. I can't get off the maintenance dose I'm on of suboxone, weaning off is not an option since I'm going to school and working a full time dead end job. I've noticed my grades have started slipping which is bringing about even more stress. I have nothing of my own, no house, no car, nothing. Not sure what to do here. It's 3 am as I'm writing this and have to be up for work in 4 hours. This has been going on for awhile now, 4-5 years but I'm at that point where if a world War doesn't happen in the next few months I just want to end it myself, my way blissfully with my DOC. I guess since I have no one else to share this to, I'd share it here. Thoughts, questions, comments, and concerns are all welcomed because I know this sounds very selfish and self centered but I'm still here battling and plan to keep going for as long as possible.
