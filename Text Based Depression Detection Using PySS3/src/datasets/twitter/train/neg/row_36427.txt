I'm thinking about doing itI'm from Serbia, so English is my second language (excuse the grammar and spelling mistakes).

So, for the past few months I've been thinking about commiting suicide, and I've tried to do it just a week ago. I'm seeing a therapist right now, but I must say that I don't really feel better. In my comment history, you can find a glimpse of my life and how's it been going, enough to paint you the full picture. 
I'm on meds and I'm trying to get a hold of myself and get back on my feet (small steps of course), but I can't do it anymore. I'm honestly tired and I don't know what to do.
