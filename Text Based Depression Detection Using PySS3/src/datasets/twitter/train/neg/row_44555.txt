Why do I care?I wish I were dead. I donâ€™t want to be alive on this planet anymore, but I refuse to remove myself because I know if I were to leave it would cause my friends and family so much pain and suffering, and I donâ€™t want to be the reason for their suffering. But why do I care? If Iâ€™m dead I wonâ€™t comprehend anything, my conscious will be non-existant, I wonâ€™t be able to comprehend the idea of being the one that caused my friends and family pain, but I still donâ€™t want to cause them the pain. I donâ€™t know what to do and I feel as though I canâ€™t make a right choice no matter what I do. I have never felt this way before and I only recently started to contemplate suicide about a year ago. I just want to get help but I know deep down that I will never be able to change the things about me and my life that have made me this way. I want the best for my friends and family but I know that if I killed myself my family, at least, would never recover and I canâ€™t deal with that thought weighing down on my conscious but as I said, if I were to remove my conscious, why do I care?
