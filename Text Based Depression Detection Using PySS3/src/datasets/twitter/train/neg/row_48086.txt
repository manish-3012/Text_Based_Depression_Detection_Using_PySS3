i am now considering suicide as an official option.i am 26 years old. i have been depressed my whole life. there has not been even so much as a single day where depression does not rule over everything i think, feel and do. i can't do this anymore, it seems there is now way out. i have tried all different kinds of therapy, i have tried all different kinds of medication, i have made lifestyle changes, diet changes, nothing works. 

i feel nothing every day. and if i do happen to feel something it is sadness. i almost never really laugh. or smile. i have to go to work every day and i hate it. i'm in school and i hate it. i have started looking into taking my own life. i don't want to but i must weigh my options. i've been trying to treat my depression for about 10 years now. it is still winning. i think it may be time to call it. i don't know why i'm even writing this post. none of you can change the way my brain works. 

so i've decided to start thinking about suicide. i will cut my wrists. i know it will hurt really badly but i'll just take a bunch of xanax and maybe smoke some weed. i'm not entirely sure i'll do it, but all i have felt for 26 years is depression so it's time to really take a stand up against it. in a way, killing myself makes me feel triumphant. like i can finally beat my depression. like i'll finally win. 

i don't want to kill myself, but it's looking like my only option, so again i'm going to start seriously thinking about it for the next few weeks. i can't talk to anyone i know about this though, because they'd try to take some type of action probably and i obviously can't have that. so i posted here instead because i had to talk about it somewhere. 

that's all. thanks.
