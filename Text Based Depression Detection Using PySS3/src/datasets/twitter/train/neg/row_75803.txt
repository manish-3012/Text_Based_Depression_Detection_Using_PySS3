Guys, Iâ€™m not sure I can do this anymoreI miss my dad too much, and the world is in too much of a shitty place. Besides, I promise no one would care, or mourn/remember me...the ones that would would forget in like a day..
Iâ€™m talentless, anti-social, awkward garbage, who is constantly berated by his family and his friends. Why am I even still here?
