Why is it so hard to die in this f***ing world ?I look up and  euthanasia is allowed in my country and in coutries where it is allowed - you have to meet "criteria " before you can fking leave this place.   
In the world where war and death is still everywhere. Why do I have to spend countless days finding away to just have one thing done that would make me happy ?
