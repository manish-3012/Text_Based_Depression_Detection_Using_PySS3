????god i hope i explain this right but exactly a month ago i had to put my dog down that i had for 13 years &amp; it was so hard on me, ive never experienced that level of pain before like it was soul crushing i felt like a 1000 pound weight was on top of me. but now that i know how it feels to lose someone close to me my brain has become obsessed with the thought of losing my dad. i think about it so much like if he dies i will lose everything since im dependant on him, my entire life would completely change. i dont have anyone but him, if he goes i do too. like genuinely if he dies i will probably have to be permanently placed in a psych ward because if i leave id probably go jump off a bridge or overdose on hard drugs to end my life. does anyone understand this lol i dont know how to stop myself from thinking about it and its making my mental health spiral like im starting to think i should just die first so i dont have to deal with that pain but also then heâ€™d have to deal with the pain of losing me..
