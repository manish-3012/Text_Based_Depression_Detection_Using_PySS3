what's the point of livingWhat is the point in living if you have no one to live with I've always believed that the meaning of human life was to reproduce keep in mind I'm not even 18 yet so that thought has always been extreme for most people to handle and I've even told people directly everyone will die someday it's not my own death and how it will affect me that I'm scared of its my friends and how it will affect them I don't care for myself I would kill myself if I believed my friends could handle themselves but once I lose them that's when I'll kill myself
