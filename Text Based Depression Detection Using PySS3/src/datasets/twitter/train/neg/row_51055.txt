Life is wearyingIn the past few years there have been numerous days I've contemplated stoppage of my existence. But there were some people by my side who offered unconditional support. They boosted my morale, made me smile and enlivened by asserting that my life would improve. Today, I'm alone. I've been imploring my acquaintances to spend some time with me.

 There's no one to care for me, love me. The prospect of dying alone alarms me. I'm not penurious. I could with some effort seek help from medical professionals. But, it seems improbable that my heartache can ever be cured. To be brief, the past year saw my ruination. My parents aren't with me, the love of my life chose to sever ties.

The business that employed me resolved to lay off employees to avoid compression of their profit margins.
What exacerbates my situation is the lack of human interaction. There's no person willing to spend some time with me. In such circumstances it seems to me that my existence is unimportant. I'm insignificant.
