Suicide hotline wonâ€™t work. This is my last resort.Iâ€™ve been trying to call the hotline since 4am but it seems like theyâ€™re offline. Which they also announced on their site that due to the current situation it might affect the operations of the hotline. In my previous post, I mentioned not being able to visit my psychiatrist for 6 months due to financial problems. Pro-bono and alternative medication is also very limited where I live. At this point I feel like giving up, Iâ€™m mentally and physically exhausted and I want to rest.
