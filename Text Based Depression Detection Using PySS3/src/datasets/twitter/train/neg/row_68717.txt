Reddit, I don't think I can go on for much longer. It's so hard. I'm running track, but I lose a lot. 4th place in hurdles. You'd think that's good, but no I get compared to my cousins...  I've had enough. This has gone on forever. I will never be good enough. Plus my dad called me a dick and always yells. I find refuge in creating levels and unity 5. I bake textures in Blender cycles and then send it to unity so the graphics look like fucking Gravity. It's amazing. I thought my family would be proud. But no. My family said I spent too much time online, which I felt was a fucking erroneous assumption, since I only worked on the project for 30 minutes each day before going outside and trying to please everyone in track.
    It's killing me. I can't go on much longer.
