Poor, white, introverted, and male. Why the fuck should I continue to deal with this?I'm fucking sick of being jerked around and treated like shit. I've been bullied since 3rd grade, I've had two comical suicide attempts, and I'm 23 and still in college. I can't go to the school counselors because they'll just report me and probably cook up some reason to distance the school from me.

I've always been depressed. It happens when you're able to see just how FUCKED on every single level this planet and species is. I tried telling myself that I can make it better, yet deep down I know that's complete bullshit. Throw in the PC culture of all these pathetic people in the "scholarly" bubbles and having their heads so far up their ass they could form a singularity.

I'm tired of fighting for the right thing and being told I'm scum and stupid for it. I'm tired of fighting in general. I've had to fight my whole life. Parents, school, jobs, relationships... everything. I'm just so damn tired I want it to stop.
