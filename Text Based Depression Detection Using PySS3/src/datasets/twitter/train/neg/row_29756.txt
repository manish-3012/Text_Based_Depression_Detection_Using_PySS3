Lonely.I know this is cringy as fuck to say, but I reckon I'll be dead in a few months anyway, so who gives a fuck.  
  
I need a girlfriend, and I am hopeless about it. I don't see a life scenario where I meet someone who would like me. I know it's easy to say there is someone for everyone, but the personality that I have is the exact opposite of what most girls want, so chances of me finding love is not a question of when like most people suggest. I'll probably never find someone, so I don't see a reason to continue to walk amongst the living while being alone.
