Will they take my child if I admit myself to a hospital?Basically what the title says. I really want to admit myself to the local hospital, but Iâ€™m terrified theyâ€™ll try to take my child. My plan is to leave her with her father during that time. 

I just really want to kill myself but I canâ€™t handle the thought of not seeing her grow up or see her smile anymore. But my support system is extremely weak and I need professional help. None of the doctors Iâ€™ve contacted have called me back, and Iâ€™m feeling this is an important issue that needs to be dealt with. Iâ€™m in the US, and CPS is fine as long as they donâ€™t take my baby.
