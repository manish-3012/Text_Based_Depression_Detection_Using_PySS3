URGENT!!! Friend threatening to commit suicideHi

A close friend of mine has verbally communicated and generally stated that he will kill himself on "January 21st at 6pm". He lives in a abusive household and his grades are not very good. He is unpopular under girls, my friends and I believe that he is genuine about his threats and we really want to stop this. I have thought of putting a keychain tracker on his keychain while he is not watching and then follow him around after school on the 21st but i believe measures should be taken beforehand. My friends and i have decided that we want to send his parents an email from an anonymous gmail account but i personally done know if this will benefit him at home. I cant think of anything past that and i don't want to get his parents in legal trouble even though i have audio-evidence of their abuse. My suicidal friend has exclaimed he wouldn't do it because he would ruin the lives of his brother and make his own even worse. I do not know what to do next, please help me this is URGENT!!!

Thank you!!

Ps. I live in Berlin so maybe some kind of resources here that im unaware of that people could bring up to me.
