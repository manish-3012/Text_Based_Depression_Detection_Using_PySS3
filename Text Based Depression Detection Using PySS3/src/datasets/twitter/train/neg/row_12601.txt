Iâ€™m scared for myselfI always wanted to do it, just end it. Get out of the suffering of this horrible place and end it. But something always kept me here. 

I tried to commit suicide I few times last month but never could with a knife. I just couldnâ€™t. But Iâ€™ve come across a problem. 


I leaned to take pills now. Thereâ€™s literally nothing stopping me now. Take the bottle, get water, swallow. And Iâ€™m gone. A life over so quickly. 


Iâ€™m so scared for myself. I could literally get up now and take them and by the time my parents open my door tomorrow all they find is a dead body. 


This is an active fight but I canâ€™t do it tonight. I still have to do a few things before itâ€™s over. Itâ€™s possible in the next few days though. Iâ€™m so scared for myself. Itâ€™s just.... in less then an hour... itâ€™s over for me.. Iâ€™d be gone. 


Iâ€™m scared.
