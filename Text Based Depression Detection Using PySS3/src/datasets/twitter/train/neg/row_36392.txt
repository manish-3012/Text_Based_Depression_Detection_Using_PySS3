What would you do for your last day?After going to multiple therapists over the years and being disappointed, chalked full of close to least a hundred different prescription drugs from several psychiatrists, sexually assaulted three times, abused, abandoned by all but one friend, back stabbed repeatedly, tortured by constant memories, help lines growing tired of me, I am going to die soon because I've had enough. Been planning it for about two years now, have most of my affairs in order, thrown away everything I own besides things I can pass down, and almost have everything I need to get the job done. I've narrowed my life down to lists because that's all it is anymore, that is all the worth it is and it was never worth anything. I'm on three atypical anti psychotics now and am calmer than ever, but I've snapped and lost my mind so many times and I'm tired of trying, tired of waiting for the next snap. I am calm, and that is how I know I really need to be be put down, even calm, I think about suicide every day and how the end is near and I'm just so relieved and ready. All I want to know is, what would ya'll do for your last day alive? I can't think of anything worthwhile besides leaving my messages for the three people I give a shit about and saying goodbye to them. Nothing is fun any more.
