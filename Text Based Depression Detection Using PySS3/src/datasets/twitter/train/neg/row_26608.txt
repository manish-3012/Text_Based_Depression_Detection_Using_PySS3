Life sucksEverything in my life leading up to now has got me suicidal. My dad passing away from lung cancer right after I turned 6. Having to drop out of high school because of extreme anxiety. Having no friends or social life. Being deathly afraid to apply for a job. Having a girl I truly loved leave me without giving me a reason why. Iâ€™d like to get my GED but the whole Covid thing is putting that on the back burner right now. Iâ€™m 21 now and all Iâ€™ve done for the last 5 years is lie in bed and hate my life. Thereâ€™s a rope in the basement that Iâ€™ve made into a noose a few times but never tried to use it. My mom would be crushed if I died, Iâ€™m all she has left but this world isnâ€™t very inspiring to be a part of anymore. Itâ€™s all fun when youâ€™re young with no responsibilities but when youâ€™re an adult people have so many expectations of you. All I can think of is if there was a gun in the house Iâ€™d be gone years ago.
