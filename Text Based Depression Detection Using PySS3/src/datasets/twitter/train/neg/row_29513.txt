Would I be faced with charges if I hired a hit man to kill me because Iâ€™m suicidal?I read that law enforcement disguise themselves as hitmen so if someone attempts to hire one to kill someone then the law enforcement would know. So supposedly Iâ€™m suicidal and I decide to hire a hit man to kill me but itâ€™s actually law enforcement pretending to be a hit man, would I be faced with charges for hiring a hit man or would i not since I didnâ€™t plan on targeting someone else. Or is just hiring a hit man in general illegal itself?
