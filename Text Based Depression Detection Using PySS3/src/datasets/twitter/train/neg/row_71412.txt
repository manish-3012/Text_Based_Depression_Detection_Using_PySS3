I can't do it because of my family but I think about it all the timeThis year I thought I was doing better, especially after starting meds. I've had weeks where I didn't think of killing myself even once. But lately I'm not sure - because before my suicide ideation was always abstract, I was kind of terrified of death and didn't really want to kill myself, I just wanted things to end because I never thought I was worth much.

But now when I think about it, I feel like the main reason stopping me sometimes is that I don't want to cause my family that kind of pain, and I know it will. 

There's no real point to this, I just wanted to vent and I think I've exhausted all my friends with my emotional wreckage to the point where all of them are fed up with me now and don't want to have anything to do with me anymore, so I don't really have anyone else to turn to.
