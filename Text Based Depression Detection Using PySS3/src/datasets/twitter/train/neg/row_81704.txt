any thoughts?I've always been hesitant of posting how I feel online or to this subreddit but I need help 

this year hasn't been good for me. I'm usually someone who sits inside all day playing games and doesn't so anything socially with anyone because I just don't have friends that interest me irl. but for the last 7 months or so there's been this girl who's come into my life again. I knew her for 2 years before this but started talking 7 months ago.

she had a boyfriend at the time, he was a fuck boy to say the least. I had feelings for her the entire time. I've liked other girls before, sure, but this was entirely different. the feelings I got from just being her friend were really strong. I told her how I felt. she didn't say no and we still talk a lot. we're "best friends" we have been since her boyfriend. 

just all this hurts me so much, 7 months straight of depression with small bursts of happiness that only last a couple hours then I'm just here again. ive never wanted to kill myself more lol. it sounds like I'm just over reacting but my life genuinely had no purpose before her. I wasn't focused on a job or finishing school or whatever but now I want to do these things for her. I'm pursuing a career now, but is it even worth it? I might just be wasting my time. heart break is the worst. I don't know what to do.
