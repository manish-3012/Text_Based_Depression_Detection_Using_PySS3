I'm not in a good place right now.I've been met with a conflict that has not been going so well. It's been so that members of one of the communities I'm in have ostracized me as a result of my actions (It is my fault.), and I'm not quite sure where to go from here. This career was in consideration for one of my possible career paths but I'm not quite sure anymore as it is heavily networking based (as every community is).

I'm afraid because I've poured my heart and soul into this community and this field in the past few years and it is all going to crumble due to a mistake I made.  


I've since apologized to everyone and even if they do not accept it, I know I have a lot of reflection to do. I'm not going to harm myself or others at this time, and do not struggle with suicidal ideation at this time, as I know someone will read this and then call police on me so I get sent to a hospital and then lose everything.
