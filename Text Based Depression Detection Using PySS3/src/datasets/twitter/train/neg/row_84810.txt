Best option? (Serious)I'm sorry for the rambling.
I'm a 30 year old guy and I'm going to to kill myself tonight. Interestingly enough I actually don't want to end my life but I'm really out of options. Some backstory;
I'm a compulsive liar, I honestly don't know where this 
comes from, but I've lied repeatedly to my family and most importantly my amazing s/o about my life and wellbeing. I'm not alright. I've been subduing the panic and pain I feel with alchohol and somehow managed to convince my surroundings that I'm well off (I'm not, massively in debt) and they think that I'm  basically a success in all aspect of life, however this as far from the truth it could be.Long story short, my amazingly perfect, and litterly mean that, thinks that I've been paying rent for our apartmentfpr that 9 months but I've literally not made one payment.tommorow at 10AM were getting evictedamd she does not know.im gonna end my life tonight but I'm conflicted about the best way to do it. I really don't want my suiceide to hurt someone, ie.jumping in front a train and scarring the train driver for live so in looking for options.
