running in circles, running in circlesI don't want to kill myself, necessarily. I could never do that to my family. I just wish my heart would stop beating. I wish I could just disappear into thin air. 

How I feel, or rather, the feelings I *lack*, are hard to describe and hard to pinpoint. I feel all alone. I know, I know. Someone out there is going through the exact same thing. I try and rationalize with myself. But it doesn't help. If anything, I feel worse when I think about it like that.

I feel crushed by the weight of it all. Absolutely crushed. Knowing that there are no words I can say to get someone to understand makes me wish I simply didn't exist. 

So why not? Why not die? It would hurt my family, like I said. But how much longer can I live like this? How much longer can I run around in circles? 

I'm tired. I'm so tired. So fucking tired.
