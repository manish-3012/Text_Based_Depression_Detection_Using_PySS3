I wish I was brave enoughIâ€™m so unhappy. I fought and worked so hard to get to a place where I thought I wouldnâ€™t feel this any more but it didnâ€™t work. I hate my job so much, it fills me with so many emotions that I canâ€™t handle it, I am humiliated and embarrassed by the person I have become. I have missed so many opportunities and now I feel stuck. I donâ€™t even want to talk to my family because I have nothing good to tell them and I donâ€™t want them to see or hear me like this. Everything is wrong and itâ€™s gonna be way to hard to fix. 


I see children who have hopes and dreams dying from cancer and all other shit and here I am, healthy, and for what?? Itâ€™s not fair that they donâ€™t get to live. I feel like such a waste of a life. I wish I was brave enough to do it, I donâ€™t feel like I deserve life, I donâ€™t even feel like i want it at this point.
