This is going to get buried. Its not in a throwaway account. But it's ok. I'm giving up. The only reason I'm posting here is so people understand. I'm just a bratty girl from the city. A waste of space. Another dreamer who's been crushed. 

I know I'm too young for it. But the only sex I've had was ointless, on the couch or floor, and kind of a shag and go situation. No one ha ever really CARED. It was all games. 

I'm not smart. My parents and teachers say I am, but it's bullshit. They y everyone is smart. 

I'm not even pretty to even out the stupid. 

Im not good at anything. Literally. I'm shut at all thw things I love. 

My grades are shit. Finals are in two weeks, without good grades, I won't get a scholarship to the one college that's accepted me. I'll never get to major in photography. I'll forever be looked down upon as the 'hipster with an expensive camera'. 

I cost way to much money. I can't afford to buy my own paper and chemicals so I use up all my schools darkroom supplies. 

I'm boring. Everything that's happened to me is just boring. Sex, drugs, rape. 

I'm not worth it. To anyone. I'm fucking pathetic. Lucas was right. My life isn't that bad, I've got everything I could ever want. But I'm sad. All the time. The one person who makes me happy, is forbidden to see me. 

EDIT: New plan. I've decided to just make everyone hate mr. Should t be too hard, most people do already.
