So sick of being poorI'm almost 17 and I cannot remember a time when my family wasn't struggling for money. I've never really cared about it until now - it's to the point where we can't afford food.

But I don't get it. We still have cable. My stepdad goes out to eat for lunch. They both still smoke and buy soda just as habitually. My parents still buy "treats" for our family. The other day I asked my mother if she could go to the store and buy food (for meals) and she came back with graham crackers, goldfish, and crackers. Nothing else. My mom complains and complains and *yells* at me when I try to wrap my head around things, and I ask her why we still live like this when we can't afford meat, can't afford fruit (can't remember the last time we had some in the house), can't afford vegetables. My parents live off packaged noodles. *I'm* the bad person because I want to eat healthy.

Can't afford therapy for my (increasingly severe) depression. Can't afford medication for me *or* my mom (and she has seizures!). Can't get a car for me so I can't get to the city to get a job. We're losing our house. 

I really just want out. It's too overwhelming. I don't want to do this anymore.
