Offing yourself isn't that easyPlanning to off yourself is annoyingly intricate. You have to figure out where and how and when. Where can you go that no one you care about will find you, but someone else will. How are you going to do it? You've Google searched "Least painful ways" but where will you get the supplies and how will you keep anyone from finding out? 

The most complicated piece to me is when. Should you do it before or after your family vacation? You wouldn't want to ruin it for everyone, but it seems phony to go along. Do you have enough money saved up so your husband can still pay the rent for a while? You did just sign a new lease last month. Do you have time to touch base with the people you'll miss the most and let them know how special and important they are to you. 

Should you write a note? If it doesn't work are you prepared to live on under worried, watchful eyes and heavy prescription that makes you feel even emptier than you already are? 

You don't know how people can just pick a day and step off the side of a bridge.

You keep telling yourself, "Next week is the week. No more procrastinating. It's not rocket science." 

In the end you'll probably just postpone it a little longer. Not because you're afraid to do it, you're not. You're just to afraid to leave any burden on all the hearts left behind.
