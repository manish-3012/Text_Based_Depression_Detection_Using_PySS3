I just need a stranger to say something nice about me.Okay, I have suffered from depression ever since my mom died (she ODâ€™d herrion when I was 11). I never get to see my extended family unless itâ€™s a holiday, and I really love my cousin. Recently me and my dad moved in with his girlfriend (I had no say in this) within 2 months of meeting her and her family, this is when my depression got really really hard to deal with. One day my dad came in my room and said we need to move out tomorrow but we never did, this happened about 2 more times, but one day he said pack your things, weâ€™re moving out. I thought we would move to our old house, but instead we moved our stuff out and stayed at a friends house for a couple days and immediately moved back to our new old house. Living here is total hell, I have no spare clothes, no computer, and no bike, that bike was the only thing that let me get away from here and now itâ€™s gone. Also, I came out as bisexual to my family and they were okay with it, which is bad because I just want some excitement. Living with depression, thoughts of suicide, and ADHD is not a great life. The only reason I said stranger is because my family is supposed to say nice things and I just want my nonexistent social life back. I know where my dads gun is and Iâ€™m thinking about all the things I could do with it, just someone say they think Iâ€™m nice of they love me or anything.
