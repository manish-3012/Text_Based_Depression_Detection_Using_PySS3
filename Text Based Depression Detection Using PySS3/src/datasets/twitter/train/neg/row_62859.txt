It's not worth itEveryday has been worse then the last night I've been struggling with this for years and it's only gotten worse. I have no friends and haven't for years at one point i was able to get in a ldr that was 4 hours away so we visited a lot and it got to the point we were making future plans together and we literally did about everything we could together. After 2 years she left me and ever since i just have constant nightmares now i wake up everyday crying or terrified. I'm always in physical pain because of different medical reasons and i throw up everyday. I'm also now struggling with addiction and i can't leave the house at all from agoraphobia. The only reason I'm living is for my family but i can't do it much longer
