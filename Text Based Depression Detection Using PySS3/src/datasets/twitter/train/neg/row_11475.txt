The message is clear money is more important than life!Better to die than to live broke. 

They care? Who is they because when I look I never find them. They don't care and neither you the person reading this. How do I know? Simple I would ask for you to give me a Â£1. And if one hundred thousand people did that I would 100k. But I don't. Because they don't care enough to even give Â£1. Therefore the conclusion is money is more important than life. They don't even value your life at Â£1 amount.

Sick of living, unwilling to die....and you know who but filling in the blanks I would rather leave up to you. For it doesn't matter who you put on the list because none of them would be missed.
