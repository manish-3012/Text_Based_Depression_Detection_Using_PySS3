Don't see a point anymoreMy whole life, I've striven to succeed in life. From elementary to highschool I worked my ass off to make my parents proud. They always pushed me in school, sports, anything; I always got them what they wanted. I graduated highschool with a 5.2 GPA, I played varsity soccer for my highschool. I got into a top 25 university. Now after my first year of college, I'm struggling. A close friend of mine had died a couple years back and it continues to haunt me. I barely managed a 3.0 my first semester and now I just cried on my way back to my dorm after taking my exam knowing that I didn't do well. I had aspirations of going to medical school. But now, I'm struggling to even manage a B+ in a class. My dream was to be a neurosurgeon but clearly I dreamed too far if I can't even make a B in a chemistry class. There's so much pressure to succeed but all I'm doing is failing. I used to be the bright student and I made my parents proud everyday. Now I'm ashamed of myself. I study consistently and try to balance my life out but in the end it comes to getting good grades. I'm not doing that. Everyone's doing better than me and here I am, barely getting by. I know I'm disappointing my parents but more importantly I'm disappointed in myself. I had such strong aspirations and I always pushed myself to be the best but the best isn't enough anymore. My parent's still love me but I don't love myself. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm cracking under all the pressure and stress to succeed, to make my parents proud, to make myself proud. I know my circumstances aren't as bad as many others who think about suicide which is why I feel terrible for even thinking about it but it seems so simple, one swift action and all the pain, the stress, everything is gone. I'm a sham of a human being knowing the circumstances others are in. I would in a heart beat give up everything I have to someone who deserves it more.
