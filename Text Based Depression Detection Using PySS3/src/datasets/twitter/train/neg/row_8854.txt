I need help on preventing my friends suicideOne of my close friends just cut herself for the first time and sheâ€™s been getting worse over the past couple months, sheâ€™s tried multiple times to end her life and Iâ€™ve stuck by her side and tried to help in every way I can.
Sheâ€™s been talking about ending it and I really donâ€™t want to get her family involved but Iâ€™m running out of ideas and I really need help on how to stop this before anything more happens.
