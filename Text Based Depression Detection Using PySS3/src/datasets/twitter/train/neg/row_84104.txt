Holy shit. It got better.I feel like the storms broke.  I was convinced this time that they wouldn't.  I was convinced to the point of suicide.  Holy shit.  I'm happy.  And my life is becoming what I want it to.  It's becoming everything I want it to become.  And it's incredible.


The last 4 months for me, have been a day in and day out struggle of mental agnoy.  I agonized each moment I was alive and I prayed for death.  There were incredible experiences sprinkled in between, but the moment they ended, I was back to this agonizing state.  It was the closest I ever came to suicide.


Today I just saw everything differently.  I can't explain it.  I see the answers to my problems.  I've been implementing those answers recently, and shit, they're working.  And my life is becoming wonderful again.


I just wanted to share this.
