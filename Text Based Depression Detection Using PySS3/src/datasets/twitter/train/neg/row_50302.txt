JumpHey everyone..thanks to anyone that reads this post.  I'm thankful for reddit and the different opinions on this board, I've felt blessed my whole life to have the internet available to me.  

I'm 24 and it hasn't slowed down..world just continues to crush me, I know there are people who would tell me to persevere, to get through it, but it's hard.  I've disappointed my father so much.  I don't have any real friends, just acquaintances, and most people I've lent money to, they don't return it, etc...so throughout life I've never felt very valued by anyone that didn't seem to be obliged to value me (dad)

Speaking of which I'm still in uni, and have all these credits going towards random things..never followed a curriculum properly.  My dad believes in me and pays for my school, hoping that I'll get it together but he shouldn't.  And it's hard to work towards a future you can't see.  Not you won't see, but you're blind to.  I could go on and on but I just wanted to write this for myself and express my dearest appreciation for anybody who has read this and felt sympathy.  I intend to jump off the 16 story building I live in. Thank you.
