It doesn't matter what I do..I work out a lot, eat healthy, nofap, meditation, yoga, tried meds, tried therapy, tried venting online to people. I know I will die forever alone, which im used to now so i don't get lonely much. Idk man. All these mental illnesses, how i look, how bad my memory and drive is, its just torture. Every. Single. Fucking. Day. I won't get descriptive but fuck death calls me sometimes, and when it does it feels so damn natural and strong these urges.
