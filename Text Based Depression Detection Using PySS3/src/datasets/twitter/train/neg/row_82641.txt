I have nothing to live forI just realised that today. My social life is pretty much nonexistent and can't make new friends. I tried to tell the one I have how I feel and they either did not took me seriously or only cared for a day and that I should be healed by now. I told my mother and she was just yelling at me. Everytime I visit my parents she just complain how I have no guts. My brother and father just don't care. I lost interests in my hobbies and nothing interests me. It takes me everything to get out of bed in the morning. Also I have a couple bad injuries and I cannot workout anymore. On top of that I am too ugly to date I have been told and it"s not like I feel like it. I have seen therapists and ai am on medication but it's not enough. Meds just make me able to go to work...  I just silently cry of despair. I live to work and me being alive is just pure suffering. At first I did not wanted to die but now why not? I am ready for it and it seems the best option. I will go on a car ride
