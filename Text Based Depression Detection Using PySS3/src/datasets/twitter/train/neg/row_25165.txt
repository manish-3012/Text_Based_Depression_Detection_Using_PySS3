911 call for suicidal thoughts?Hello all, my (22f) husband (23m) (we have been apart since Monday following some issues in our marriage) called me around 1am EST &amp; told me he was going to shoot himself.

I know he owns a revolver &amp; with everything going on between us I did call 911. I was still on the phone trying to talk him down when police arrived. He was staying at a friends, I knew the street name but not the house number so it took them a second to find him.

I heard them call his name, and then I hung the phone up. My question is- what normally happens after police respond to a suicidal threat? Will they *automatically* take him in to the psych facility based on my accusation? Iâ€™m afraid he maybe really didnâ€™t have his gun &amp; afraid he will lie to the police to avoid going to a psych hospital.

Can they take him in w/o him having the gun on him? Will they take him if he does have his gun? Etc etc etc. any details can help, Iâ€™m beyond stressed right now.

Thanks all
