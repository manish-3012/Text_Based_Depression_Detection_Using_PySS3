I can't wait I can finally kill myself. (Everything is as it should be)â€¦ Dudeâ€¦

Iâ€™m trapped in matrix

But you can never tellâ€¦

The Wheather.

I will wait. I will wait. I will wait.
For you.

I... understood ... that I am guilty of treason. (How thw do i Write it? That donwld did...) 
I... Understood. That I am stupid.
I .. understood?

I dont understand.
I'm stupid.


This is it: 

I think I am in HELL. In a hell designed particularly for me. Whether i escape it is up to me.
They've left me the clues.
From the moment I was born. before i was born.
Each memory I can remember. Each thought that I think. 
Each word.
Each thing I saw.

Those are all.clues.
It is up to me whether I use it
As a flucking ride
As a riddle as I love
Designed particularly for me

It is up to me how i live my life
How i think
Whether i wwant to admit it
Or.still be blind.
I see they are waiting.
It is always beautiful. I hope. I hooe that i am not.guilty of something really bad.

It is up to me whether i kill myself sooner
And ruin the surprise
"Just wait to see..."
"Just wait to see why has he made you wait for so.long" 

It is up to me whether i sleep.
Suppose I dont have to.
And what's.then?

I have to pee. 
But.. suppos i dont have to?
I think im stupid.
(Out to the...)
