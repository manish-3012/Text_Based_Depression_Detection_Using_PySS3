This week will be the last week of my lifeIâ€™m going to a guy I know who will get me champagne or wine, either works. Then while everyone is sleeping or not home, Iâ€™ll then grab the sleeping pills my friend gave me that helped me sleep when my brother killed myself. After I grab whatâ€™s needed, Iâ€™ll go to the bathtub and leave a voicemail to my best friend that doesnâ€™t really talk to me anymore. 
After all that, ill turn on my playlist then Iâ€™ll chug both. Then eventually Iâ€™ll be dead. Because if Iâ€™m going to go, might as well go out in style

The grammar may be bad and cluttered but I donâ€™t really care

If anyone I know finds this, itâ€™s the way I went out.
