My mom attempted suicide yesterday.I don't know if this is the best place to write this. There is no /r/suicideattempticuvisitors or anything line that as far as I can tell...

I'm sitting here next to my mom in the ICU, she's hooked up to a ventilator and a stomach pump and a dozen other machines. It will be like this for the next several days. She took a bottle of amitriptyline. I'm hurt and angry...yet I understand. 

My parents are both 60 and they're going through a divorce. They moved from Georgia to Minnesota four years ago, mostly to run from my brother's death. He died about six years ago at the age of 26. They never really dealt with it. My mom has been crippled with grief. My dad has this messed up psychological need to befriend single mothers and their sons so he can replace the son he lost. Nothing creepy or anything toward the kids, but it's led to affairs and has messed my mother up even more. 

Last week she moved back here to Georgia to be closer to friends and to me. I couldn't visit her over the weekend which I'm kicking myself over. 

I can't look at her. My wife is talking to her and holding her hand, telling me she's squeezing her hand back and making facial expressions. I just want to go home and crawl into bed. 

My emotional brain is pissed. My logical brain understands. She's has a horrible time of the last six years. I kinda want to respect her decision, you know? She's old enough and has experienced enough to know that she wants to be done. I can see suicide as a logical decision.... I don't like it at all, but I understand. If this is the best she's going to get, I'm not going to let them keep her on the breathing machine. 

I just needed to get this out.
