I Don't Know What To DoI'm 13, so I everyone I know just thinks its hormones. I lash out uncontrollably at the ones I love. I think of suicide every day of my life, and I know if I tell someone in my family they will tell me I'm being dramatic. When I was 12 and 3 fourths, I stole a knife from the kitchen to end it all. Everyone in my family searched everywhere except my room. I'm getting to the point where I pick up the knife and slowly trace my wrist with it. It's changed who I am. I went from decently skinny and social to fat and antisocial. I make stupid faces and noises. At school I laugh at my own suicide jokes. I do a bunch of weird shit. I used to be normal. Now all I am is a walking joke for the rest of humanity.

I'm thinking sometime in the summer is my deadline. Soon enough that it will be an option, but not so soon I don't get a chance to do some stuff first.
