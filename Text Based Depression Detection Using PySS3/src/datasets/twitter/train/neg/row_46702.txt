Friends, my first grade came inI just ruined my GPA with a fucking gym class. No idea why gym is even required. If I get A's in all my other classes I'm going to fucking kill myself I hate this stupid state. But if I don't get all A's in my other classes, I might as well kill myself since I'm clearly worthless. I should feel better since I don't have to try-hard anymore, but I don't. I know my happiness should be based on more than my GPA but I don't have any friends and it was pretty much the only thing I 'cared' about. 

Ironically, I didn't actually enjoy any of my classes. I took English and History which were almost as worthless to my major as Gym was; I took Anatomy and Statistics which were pretty hard, and related to Nursing which I'll probably go into. I don't even really want to be a nurse, I just want money and I'm not very interested in other high paying jobs. Gonna end it before I'm 30 anyway, so I guess none of this really matters. 

So yeah. Fuck school for being stupid and fuck me for being more stupid.
