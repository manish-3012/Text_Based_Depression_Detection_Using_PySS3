Got compared to the Virginia Tech massacre guy today. I feel horrible about myself.I am at Virginia Tech. For the past two months I've been attempting to get a refill on my prescription (that has not gone well). I e-mailed my advisors that I was at the end of my rope and for them to have patience with me while I try to get it sorted out. Well, they took that as me being flippant about my situation and took me for a walk around campus. 

They showed me the memorial for that day and said "this is what happens when we don't take mental health seriously". They were comparing me to Cho. Saying that I could kill someone. Honestly, the first thing I thought was "Well I'd kill myself before I'd kill anyone else" but I obviously didn't say that so I didn't get taken away. They made me feel like shit for not trying hard enough, even though I felt like I was trying everything I could and nothing was working out. 

I wasn't a victim, I was a suspect in that moment. I don't know how to feel anymore. I don't even want to go outside because I'm afraid everyone looks at me like a bad person now.

I completely understand they have to take those precautions to prevent things like that from happening in the future, but it shot my self esteem down so low that I don't know how to recover from this. 

I just want someone to talk to that won't make me feel like this is my fault.
