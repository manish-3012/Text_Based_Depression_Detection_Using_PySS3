I'm probably not going to do it if I'm honest. But I want to. It'd be easy.Gun loaded upstairs under the bed as usual.  I think the only thing holding me back is the mess it would make and that someone would have to clean me up.  I'm gonna get blasted tonight and maybe it'll give me the courage to blasted another way haha.  Life's a meaningless hell and now I'm alone in it so not really anyone I should objectively care about.
