At the very edge right now.Hey Reddit.

I don't necessarily have much of a preamble for this sob story, so I'll dive right into it.

About me: Been in the Army for over a decade now. 3 deployments, Iraq and Afghanistan.

My knees, back and shoulders are in constant pain. In the past decade I've lost 5 friends to suicide, and 4 to the War on Terror. I've punched holes in my walls, driven dangerously, went to the gun range more times than I can count, even had a few sleeping fits where my wife was injured.

My family is scared of me. I'm scared of me. I'm currently living two states away due to the Army and my wife not wanting to go with me. 

I pay for an apartment and a house, my mortgage went up by $900 a month. I can't afford either. Had to sell my truck for an older one, now its having issues too. Rent on my apartment is due, late with associated fees so I can save up for the house. Its about to go into foreclosure, and I have exhausted any financial resources available to me. I don't know how these people expect me to just magic money out of nothing.

Crying as I write this, I'm currently into my 6th beer of the night. I have a shotgun next to my little bed and it looks more attractive with each drink. I can't do this anymore. Between the Army and financial issues, I feel my self control and discipline fading, my willingness to push through the issues is being overwritten by the desire to just end the whole fucking thing.

I'm looking back on everything and see all the opportunities I wasted, all the time ill never get back, all the hard moments telling myself that it will get better and it just fills me with anger. 

I have two daughters, and I know it will devastate them to learn about it, but at this point I've hit such a low that the guilt of it doesn't even phase me anymore. 

Can't even think of anything else to write, so I guess this is it.
