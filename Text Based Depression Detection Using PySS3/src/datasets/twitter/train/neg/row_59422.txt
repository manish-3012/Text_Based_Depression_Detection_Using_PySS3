Why even bother?Why bother being alive just to become a 30+ year old loser when I could just kill myself right now at 19 years old? Dying young always seemed better than living an entire lifetime of misery. I donâ€™t give a fuck about wanting to stay alive to see adulthood. Life only goes downhill from here and I sure as hell donâ€™t want to do anything to change it. If I donâ€™t want to do anything, why bother staying alive? I should just fucking die and have a more productive member of society replace me. I imagine that it wonâ€™t be too hard to find someone to replace me anyways
