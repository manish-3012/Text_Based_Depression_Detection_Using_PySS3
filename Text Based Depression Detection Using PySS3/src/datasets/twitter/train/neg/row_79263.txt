Hello world. I'm having a really bad night.I'm worried tonight about impulse decisions... about doing something stupid tonight. I've been really unfulfilled in life for a while. I'm letting my relationship decay. I'm unchallenged at work. I just go to work, come home, and sit until I go to bed and do it again. It's been going on for a really long time. It's gotten significantly worse over the last year. I dont socialize outside of work. I've completely lost my sex drive and gained about 20lbs. Work even wants to promote me if I'd just make a decision on what I wanted to do... but I have no motivation.  I just want to sit by myself and cry. I feel really empty, disconnected from people. I dont even know if I can form a close relationship even though I've been dating someone for 4 years now. I cant bring myself to talk to them about any thing important. I dont even see the point to. Last time I had a best friend was also about 4 years ago but they died suddenly from a heroin overdose. I didnt know that they were using again. I want to disappear. I'm so tired of being tired.
