Iâ€™m deformed.Iâ€™m 25 years old and have been anxious/depressed for as long as I can remember.

It turns out iâ€™ve been a â€˜mouth breatherâ€™ my whole life and my face is deformed. I never noticed because I didnâ€™t care about my appearance but if you google the features online, thatâ€™s me. Add to that the left side of my head/face is less developed and my flat and long on top.

I went to a music festival 2 weeks ago and people were staring, laughing, jumping out of the way, â€œwhat the f**k is that?!â€, â€œlooks like an owlâ€, â€œis that a man or a womanâ€ - nearly every single person I walked passed had the same shocked/disgusted reaction.

Everyone laughs/stares/double takes/avoids me in public now - no direct insults yet but surely only a matter of time. My family are in denial about it, doctors donâ€™t consider it a medical issue.

I wanted to sort myself out and wanted to be â€˜normalâ€™, I canâ€™t do that if I look like a freak, life doesnâ€™t work like that.

Suicide is only a matter of time for me, this is probably my last week.
