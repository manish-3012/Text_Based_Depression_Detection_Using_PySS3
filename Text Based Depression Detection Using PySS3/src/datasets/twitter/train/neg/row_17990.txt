My girlfriend is suicidalSheâ€™s tried to kill herself before (always around October) and this year one of her best friends committed suicide. We talk about mental health a lot and her current â€˜strategyâ€™ for this October is to not leave the house much as she says if she goes near a train station sheâ€™ll always think about jumping, the same goes for main roads etc. Sheâ€™s also going to be wary about drugs but will 100% take them at some point (Iâ€™ve said Iâ€™ll go sober with her, she says sheâ€™ll think about it).

This will be my first October with her and all I want to do is help because I care so much. If anyone can help me help her or give insight into coping mechanisms / what helped you I would be eternally grateful x
