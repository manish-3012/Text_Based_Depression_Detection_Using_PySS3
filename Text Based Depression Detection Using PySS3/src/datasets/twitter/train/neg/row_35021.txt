It never gets betterIâ€™m trans and I thought coming out to my school would make me happier but I still just want to kill myself. I get harassed misgendered on a daily basis. I just hate everyone and I feel like I would be doing everyone a favor if I killed myself. I havenâ€™t made a change and Iâ€™ll never will. I just feel so trapped.
