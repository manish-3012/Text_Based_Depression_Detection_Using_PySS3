FUCKI feel like on the inside my brain is exploding into a million pieces while my soul is simultaneously being ripped apart but on the outside I feel nothing but a deep simmering anger. I can't take this life anymore.

I might not kill myself in the next weeks, months, or even years; I just know that I will almost certainly do it eventually. I feel like I'm just waiting for that one final thing that will send me over the edge.
