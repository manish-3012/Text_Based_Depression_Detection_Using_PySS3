â€œFunny when you're dead how people start listeninâ€ - Band Perry, If I Die YoungI remember when I was in third grade, I heard this song and it struck a chord within me. And when I heard this lyric, it made perfect sense to me. I told my older sister about it and how it just made sense. My first thought went to Picasso and artists and how their art works gained value over time. And the same for any piece of art: music, literature, etc. Then I though about influential people. The more violent - JFK, MLK, Lincoln - or tragic - FDR, Romeo &amp; Juliet - their deaths, the greater the impact they have on the world. But then I thought about myself and how as a third grader, I was just a young kid who was forced to shoulder a heavy burden and can see the dark cloud forecasting the coming of even greater pain and suffering. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for as long as I could remember but I it was then I realized the harsh irony of life; it is only after we die when the help and resources and love that we were missing in life procures itself.
