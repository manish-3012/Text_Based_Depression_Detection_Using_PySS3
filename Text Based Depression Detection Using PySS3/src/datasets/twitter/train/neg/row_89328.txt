Posted here before, still feel awful, considering it Monday...I've been thinking I might stay up all night, take alot of melatonin, then fall asleep in the running car in the garage. It's strange... I feel excited to just fall asleep to never wake up._x000D__x000D_  I never felt very useful to anyone... I never seemed very good at anything. I never had any aspirations, no sense of purpose. I've never know what I've wanted to do, and I feel tired of trying to find it._x000D__x000D_I feel anxious to end it all.
