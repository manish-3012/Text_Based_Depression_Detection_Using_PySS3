Relationship break up with a person I thought was my one bit of happiness in life. Majorly suicidal. Anyone else feeling this bad want to chat?Finding out my partner was cyber cheating, a compulsive liar, gambler...and not the person I thought they were after 3 years. 
I have no hope or desire for life now. I donâ€™t want to live and Iâ€™m too scared to die even though I think death would spare me future pain. I donâ€™t know how people do this life thing. 

Iâ€™m painfully depressed, anxious and lonely. If anyone else feels crap and want to talk to me, feel free to message me if you like. Thanks for reading.
