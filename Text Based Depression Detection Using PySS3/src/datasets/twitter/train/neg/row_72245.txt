i want to die:.

(14) don't know what to do.. i'm stuck.. in failing, i'm stressed and the only person i love in this word isn't alive anymore.. i don't see a point in continuing.. i'm not going to college, i'm not getting married or having kids.. and i don't see the point..

i just want live to be over.. i'm not gonna hurt myself bc i don't have the strength to, i just wish and hope something bad will happen in my sleep and i never wake up, or someone runs me over or something.. idk...
