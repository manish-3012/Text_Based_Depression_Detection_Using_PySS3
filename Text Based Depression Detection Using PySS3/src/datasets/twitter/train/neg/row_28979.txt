Sudden realization about suicidal peopleYou know what really fucking sucks, is that suicidal people actually CARE, they're sensitive,  they have feelings and can empathize,  the exact sort of people we need in the world, while there are heaps of braindead wastes of space that don't give a shit about anyone, willing to do or say anything to fuck someone over if it benefits themselves, and  would never EVER consider offing themselves because of their massive fragile egos,  when really they  should do the world a favor.  This fucked up place is completely ass-backwards.  That is all.
