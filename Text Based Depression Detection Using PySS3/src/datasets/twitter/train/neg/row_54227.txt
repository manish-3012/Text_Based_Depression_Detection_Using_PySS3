Was having such an awful day and thought I could talk to my mother about it and she told me I need to get over itSeriously I canâ€™t even fcking express how Iâ€™m feeling without getting a response like that. 

This is exactly why I have issues opening up to people irl. 

I hate having to complain about it all the time but how can people who are so emotionally distant and cold, be allowed to raise kids.

Iâ€™m so sick of having to try with her and expecting her to be any different. Iâ€™m also sick of people telling me I shouldnâ€™t call her a bitch because sheâ€™s my mother.

SHE IS A FCKING BITCH.

She really shouldâ€™ve done both of us a favour and had an abortion.
