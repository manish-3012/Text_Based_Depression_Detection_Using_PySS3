Well, everything is shitI don't know how to look for a job. And I'm unqualified. _x000D_
I have no connections and don't know any people and that's how everyone gets employed here. _x000D_
I wasted an entire year trying to be something I'm not and trying to impress people from my uni classes._x000D_
I'm rooming with a pretentious "artist" and his retard sister. _x000D_
Everything is annoying and bad. I'm depressed. I don't know if I should study for my remaining tests because I'm gonna drop out anyway. I don't feel like studying, I don't feel like doing anything. I want to die._x000D_
I think I'm never going to have friends or feel happiness._x000D_
I'm 20 already, it's too late to start building a social circle._x000D_
_x000D_
Because over here everyone knows hundreds of people by the time they're 20. Everyone I met here already has so much friends. I don't and they see it. And they think less of me._x000D_
_x000D_
I'll have to go home and I have no friends there. And I can't any friends there because all those people there are rednecks. No one wants to be friends with a fag._x000D_
_x000D_
I can't get a job here. And if I could, I don't want to keep living where I live right now._x000D_
_x000D_
I'm going to kill myself.
