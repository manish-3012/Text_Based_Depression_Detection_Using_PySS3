My mother is being hurt because she canâ€™t make me happy. Just another reason to end it.Sheâ€™s trying to give me hobbies and activities to make me feel better, but she doesnâ€™t understand depression and its lack of interest. I know it makes her feel bad but Iâ€™m also frustrated. If it was that easy Iâ€™d have done it. But I know Iâ€™m going to die within the next year and maybe I wonâ€™t be there to keep a constant pain. Mine will end and I wonâ€™t be a burden.
