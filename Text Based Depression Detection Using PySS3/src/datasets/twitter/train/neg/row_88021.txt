Will we ever find some Peace in this world?I've been in this world for 30 years and I swear every time things are seemingly going well a problem just appears outta nowhere to bring down my sanity, spiritual and body health. It's either a fake friend that uses you, crazy neighbor that listens to you sleep and jumps up and down with shoes to wake you up, family death or suicide and when your there for them in their time of need they're to busy or building their relationship with their families and gives me the cold shoulder.    All this negativity made me stronger but I'm getting tired, I'm getting colder, sadder, angrier. I hate being like this I wanna leave and never come back but I'm tired of running. Where's God if so many humans believe in him he must exist right?. Does all of this even matter is it worth anything. Trying to find meaning in life, isn't it pointless if we're all gonna die. This world Is so confusing and random and we're just here for the fuck of it is ridiculous to me. I've always thought if you keep fighting you would eventually win the war but you never do, the war never ends it's rigged for us to lose. I'm pretty sure non of us on this sub has found peace yet but I don't believe suicide is the answer we can't give up. There has to be a light at the end right if we keep fighting and searching. For those that have it worst keep fighting this a stupid permanent solution for a temporary problem we gotta keep fighting ,right? Going to sleep to wake up into another war good luck everyone.
