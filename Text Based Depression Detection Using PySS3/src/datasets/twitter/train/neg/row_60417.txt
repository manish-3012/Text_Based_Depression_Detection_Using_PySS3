exhausteddont have the energy to explain myself anymore im so, so tired of telling myself everythings gonna be ok how can i stay optimistic if that optimism is based on a faulty foundation tonight im aching i feel like a fraud im so cowardly i wish i could change the way i am there are parts of myself i love then there are moments like these where i realize im lying again i am so sorry towards my friends i believe them when they tell me they love me but your love doesnt fix me your love is not a cure i dont even want answers its like im filled to the brim with emptiness
