Iâ€™m really depressed but I donâ€™t know if I can go through with itI wake up and just feel so depressed my work in school is meaningless I tried welcoming someone new into my friend group and that essentially broke it up. Iâ€™m lonely school is horrible and I donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t kill myself because I donâ€™t want people to be sad but I just feel like all I do is make people happy and forget about myself. I have no personality what is the point in continuing in life.
