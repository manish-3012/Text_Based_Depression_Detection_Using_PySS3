NOT MEANT TO BE HUMANDoes anybody else feel like they simply shouldnâ€™t be human? Simply shouldnâ€™t exist in a world like this? Im autistic and feel like a alien that shouldnâ€™t be here. I donâ€™t understand anything and i donâ€™t understand how everyone is just natural at being human and natural at everything, they are just human, while iâ€™m just fucked and lesser human. I feel like if i kill myself i might hopefully go to another world as a being that actually fits and enjoys the life in the new world. Im missing out on this life and i just want to go somewhere where iâ€™m actually living.

Am i the only one? Am i alone?
