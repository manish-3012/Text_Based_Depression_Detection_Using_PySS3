What do you do to stop the suicidal thoughts?I basically just listen to a playlist of songs I enjoy, drink coffee obsessively and then every other day I cut myself. With this combination (moreso after the recent introduction of cutting myself), I don't tend to get overwhelming thoughts of ending my life. 

But /r/suicidewatch, how do you personally stop yourself from committing suicide?
