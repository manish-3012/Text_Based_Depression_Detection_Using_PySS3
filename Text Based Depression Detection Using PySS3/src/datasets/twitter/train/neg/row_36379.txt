Give me one reason to keep existing"Because people will miss you!"

I don't fucking care if people miss me. I'm a fucking asshole who probably wouldn't care if they all died. I just mooch of them anyway so I'd only be sad that I lost shit when they're dead. They don't matter to me anyway.

I've nothing to offer the world and my loved ones are slowly leaving me due to disappointment. I'm just gonna end up a worthless NEET taking from the world and offering nothing back.

Even by asking for help I'm wasting time that could be going to other people. If I kill myself now I'll never have anyone hurt by me again. I only hurt and take from people, I shouldn't exist.
