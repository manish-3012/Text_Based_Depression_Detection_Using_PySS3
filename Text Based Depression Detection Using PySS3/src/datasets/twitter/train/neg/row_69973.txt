Pleae tell me what to doIve had suicidal thoughts for the longest time, but ive always pushed them away, but for years now ive been incapable of being happy, ive tried everything, but i just cant find enjoyment in anything, im always left with a emptiness feeling, ive never really had a lot of friends, and quarantine has made that feeling emptiness just start taking control, quite frankly i would have kms already but i worry about how it would effect my mom, and only her, but now that im by myself more and more, the urge has been getting stronger, ive tried therapy, and being hospitalized, but the thought never go away, and my happiness never returns, im tired of being sad all the time, even tho i have no reason to be, i just want it to stop and ending it seems like the only solution at this point, can someone please, please help, i just want to be better, i want this to stop
