I just want to be alone.I don't want to hear another lecture.

I don't want to hear another argument.

I don't want to hear another door being slammed shut.

I don't want to hear small talk.

I don't want to hear people eating.

I don't want to hear laugher.

I don't want to hear a phone ringing.

I don't want to hear dogs barking.

I don't want to feel you next to me.
