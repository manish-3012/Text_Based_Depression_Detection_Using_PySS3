I'm afraidIt's never been like this before. I've spent the last few days thinking about it obsessively, planning it. I'm planning messages and letters to leave for my family, my friends, my daughter.  And it scares me because when I think of all the people who will be hurt if I kill myself it only makes me want to hurt them as much as I'm hurting so maybe they'll finally see what its like to suffer and maybe it'll change things for someone else who is suicidal and they'll be treated with more compassion than I have been.

I have no more options left. I'm really scared.

Edit: I have sought out treatment at an inpatient psychiatric hospital. Thank you all for your concern.
