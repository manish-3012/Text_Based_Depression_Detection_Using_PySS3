By the time anyone reads this I will be gone. goodbye world.I am almost 40, never had a girlfriend, never had a date, no one wants me. my own family never even wanted me.

I am a guy, and age 5 to 8 I was raped and molested by my step dad, age 7 I was forced to have sex with one of my cousins by her dad, from age 7 to 12 her and I had sex daily. From age 5 to 17 my step dad would beat me till he was either tired or I was bleeding. He would sometimes even chain me to a tree and leave me there for days without food or water.

My mom never cared, all she cared about was having someone to have sex with and to be with. I have no siblings, no one. I am utterly alone in this world. I am on disability for PTSD and Severe Chronic Depression and Severe Social Anxiety.

I have witnessed over 10 suicides in my life from family members to strangers, I have seen 4 of them end their lives right in front of me and unable to stop them. one of them was a friend of mine when I was homeless, he pulled a gun out and shot himself, bled out in my arms and died.

I was never allowed to go to school as a kid or watch TV or play Video games or anything else, I was forced into slave labor by my step dad to do lawn work on 10 acres of land. At 18, I ran away from home and was homeless for over ten years. by the time I turned 29, I was on disability, SSI/SSD, unable to work because of my mental issues and having arthritis in my back, legs, hips, knees, feet.

I just don't have it in me to keep going and to be alive anymore. I don't have it in me to keep living. especially without having someone there beside me who wants me and loves me. there just isn't a point in it anymore.
