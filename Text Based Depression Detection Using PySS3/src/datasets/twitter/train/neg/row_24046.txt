I'm mad as hell and I don't know why.For years, I hate what I am and I don't know why. It's not as if I had a horrible life, quite the contrary. I try to understand why I can't get satisfied with what I have. I made â€‹â€‹great progress. Now I can talk to people around me. Not about me of course. I hate talking about myself. If I do it now it's because I drank a lot tonight. It's just that nothing ever happened to me and I'm 26. I lost interest in what I do for a long time. I try to end my days when I don't drink enough to fall asleep for 8 years already. I'm not very good at it. I don't know what to do.

Please help me.
