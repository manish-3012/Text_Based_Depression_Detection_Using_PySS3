Question.Ok, so here goes. For a long while I just went wild. Drugs, booze, all round poor choices. Never been in any real trouble with the law even though there were numerous occasions where I should have been.

Now Iâ€™m clean, Iâ€™m sober. Trying to build a life. Be a productive member of society. But Iâ€™m having a seriously hard time getting over some things Iâ€™ve done in my life. People Iâ€™ve wronged/used/abused.

Iâ€™m not that person anymore. I donâ€™t condone any of my past actions. I donâ€™t want that lifestyle. I feel like/hope that Iâ€™ve put that part of my life to rest. I donâ€™t ask for much out of life. I just want to be a good father to my daughter. To be a potential husband to my girlfriend. To have a simple calm life. Nothing fancy, just the loves in my life and a home to live life.

These past few months I just canâ€™t seem to shake my past actions. Nothing in the way of getting back into old habits. Just memories and nightmares. So much so that Iâ€™ve been strongly contemplating suicide. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know how to bring this up to my partner. Iâ€™m just a little lost and confused. How do I let go of the hurt that Iâ€™ve caused myself and others of my past? How do I get over this and continue to grow and work towards my lifeâ€™s goals? 

Why is it so irritatingly easy to just want to give up and end everything? Why am I like this? I donâ€™t want to be the person I was as a young adult. I canâ€™t hold on much longer. Thereâ€™s only so much I can take.
