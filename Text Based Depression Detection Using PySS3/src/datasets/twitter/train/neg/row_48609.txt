I wonder what it feels like to be loved.Not by your SO. Not by your friends. I have neither. By your parents/family. I feel so jealous of the people whoâ€™s parents love and care for them. When I finally off myself, I likely wonâ€™t get a funeral. Or family mourning over me. Theyâ€™ll be happy Iâ€™m gone. That they donâ€™t have to deal with me any longer. I donâ€™t care if I seem childish. Iâ€™m 15, for chrissakes. Guess what? I am a child. I should have at least one parent who cares enough to make sure Iâ€™m functioning. Dear family: Iâ€™m sorry I couldnâ€™t be born normal enough for you to accept and love me. Iâ€™m gonna be out of your hair now, arenâ€™t you enthralled? I posted here a few days ago. Unfortunately I didnâ€™t go through with my plan. I could have saved myself a lot of fucking pain if Iâ€™d have just done it sooner.
