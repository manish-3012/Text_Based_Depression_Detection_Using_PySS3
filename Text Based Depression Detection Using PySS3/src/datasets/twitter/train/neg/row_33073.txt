iâ€™ve always known iâ€™d kill myself.since i was a kid iâ€™ve always known suicide is an option. itâ€™s something thatâ€™s always is the back of my mind, if things ever got too bad i could do it. iâ€™ve only tried once, i guess iâ€™ve lived through my hardest days but just the thought of knowing i can feel that way again, that its going to happen. i do not want to live life, i donâ€™t want to feel pain. im weak. life is too short i donâ€™t care to even live it all the way. iâ€™ve lived most of my life feeling this way. i know what happiness can feel like but it doesnâ€™t stay long enough. why would i want to live if i know i have to feel this way, this anxious, uncomfortable, gross draining feeling that people never understand. it has ruined so much and all i can think about is how much of my life is wasted, just as i continue to waste it now.
