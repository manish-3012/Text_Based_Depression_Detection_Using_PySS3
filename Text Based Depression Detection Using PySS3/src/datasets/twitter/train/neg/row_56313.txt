Dying with my friendHonestly I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m thinking, Iâ€™m so deep in this hole Iâ€™ll do it.

I have this friend, sheâ€™s my best friend and weâ€™re both very suicidal.  At first she didnâ€™t want me to do it and I didnâ€™t want her to. But now weâ€™re contemplating the possibility that we both will do it at the same time, via jumping off an abandoned building.

We havenâ€™t set a date, and Iâ€™m not even sure sheâ€™ll agree.

We also have this dilemma, where we have another friend, and if we both die we donâ€™t want her to be sad. The thought of leaving her pains me so much. But Iâ€™m so tired of this I want to do it so badly.
