My ex-girlfriend (24) told me that she has suicidal thoughts every now and then since she's 14.She told me that a few months ago when we were still together. I'm not sure if she meant it seriously or if it was just an excuse she came up with to get away with her cheating on me. (She kissed another guy on a trip in another country). She basically told me that the night she kissed him she was blackout drunk and also tried to drown herself later that night. I forgave her that back then and she told me that she has suicidal thoughts since she's 14. Not constantly but every now and then. I wanted to go to her parents with her but she never wanted to do that. She overall didn't seem to take it all that serious so I thought that It was just something she came up with. Now we broke up a few weeks ago and this came back into my mind. It kinda feels like unfinished business.
