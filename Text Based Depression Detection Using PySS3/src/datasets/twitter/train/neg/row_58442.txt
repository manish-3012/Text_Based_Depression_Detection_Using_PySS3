I come here with great shame...Hello Reddit... I've explained my situation a few times in other subreddits looking for advice and help. I am at a point where I am so exhausted with everything. Drained mentally, physically, and emotionally... I have been having trouble taking care of myself as of late with lack of sleep and food. I have no real support systems. My medical insurance is too much for me to pay to seek therapy or some kind of support. I have tickets and fines from accidents and I have to go to court soon. I have a lot of debt and literally live day by day. I am at the end of my rope and if you look at my previous posts you can see I am out of options resources and hope. I dont know what to do anymore and I am having large copious amounts of panic, anxiety, and depression. A lot of which stems from my PTSD and depersonalization over the years. My hours at my job are inconsistent and I dont know how I can get another job with my instabilities... The ground is falling underneath me and I have nothing to hold on to but one person... and she is so far away and I feel like Ill never get to see her... I have had many attempts at suicide and was hospitalized for a few.. I am considering my other options at this point and dont know where to turn... Please help... otherwise I just dont know how much more I can take... 

I know I am all over the place but I cant seem to get out of being scatterbrained and unfocused... I am lost in all forms... 

Im this close to giving up...

Financial problems, relationship problems, no support, everything... I just want to die.
