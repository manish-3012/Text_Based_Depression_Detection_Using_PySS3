Lost tremendous amounts of data, I need helpMy flash drive ejected somehow and now a massive amount of data is gone. Luckily I saved most of it on my computer, but work that I've spent 13 hours on is now gone for good with no way of retrieving it.

It's 3 in the morning and I can't call anyone, and I'm really considering giving up. Stress and anxiety has been piling on for me, and I've been wallowing in loneliness for the past 8 months, and this was the last thing that should have happened.

I'm desperate for help. I feel like I have nothing to live for.
