I feel like I will kill myself eventuallyHi, I guess I just want to share. I don't really see this resulting in anything but what the hell. This will be a bit of a ramble so I apologize if what I write here seems a bit scattered or my grammar is off. I have dependent personality disorder I guess, I say "I guess" because I'm not sure if I trust everything a Psych says seeing I've been diagnosed with autism and then un-diagnosed more than once. I'm a 25 year old male. I leech off my mother and am too scared of failure to hold a job.  I've tried to break out of this a lot. Tried really hard in college but my depression and sense of being empty made me fall astray into becoming Marijuana dependent. It all went down hill from there though I believe it always would have ended this way now. I'm lucky it was Marijuana instead of anything else.

I really hate myself. I have since I was young. I've given up or made excuses for everything I've wanted to get good at in life. I've fallen into the same cycle for years and I don't want to do it anymore. I feel like I've lost faith in everything. Every day I feel like useless trash who obsesses over inane bullshit while I leech off my mother. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't have it in me to do it yet but I 100% believe that I will if I never get out of this. I at least want to play Devil May Cry 5 once before I go, one of the only things I'm excited for anymore.

So yeah that's it
