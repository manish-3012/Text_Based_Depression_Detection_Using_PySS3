UselessHonestly what is the point anymore? Iâ€™m tired, weak and unproductive. I feel legitimate pain in my entire being when I wake up, I canâ€™t even put it into words. Everyday I am so alone in my own head thatâ€™s being flooded with toxic thoughts 24/7. I starve myself everyday to try to make myself happy. I canâ€™t even look in the mirror anymore and when I do I want to cut my skin off because I am so disgusted with myself. Iâ€™ve grown to hate myself so much and itâ€™s becoming unbearable. Everyday I tell myself that itâ€™s going to get better and it never does. Iâ€™m constantly dissociating and I feel like Iâ€™ve lost my entire grasp on reality.

In January, my significant other committed suicide. It has been the most painful thing to go through. I hate sleeping because every night I always have a dream with him in it. I always felt like sleep was the best escape but itâ€™s not anymore. Iâ€™m haunted by memories of him every day. I just want to be happy again. I want to love myself again. At this point I donâ€™t think itâ€™s possible.
