my boyfriend wants to dieI donâ€™t know if this is the right place to put this but I honestly donâ€™t know where else to go. my boyfriend is very suicidal and I have no idea what to do anymore. heâ€™s been getting progressively worse and he feels like a failure and he told me that the only reason he hasnâ€™t killed himself is because heâ€™s afraid to hurt me. but every day he gets worse and today he almost jumped off the balcony. he feels like nobody but me is on his side and he thinks he ruins everything and itâ€™s killing me knowing that I canâ€™t help him because he doesnâ€™t want help. his ex killed herself and blamed him and he says he has her blood on his hands and I canâ€™t convince him itâ€™s not his fault. Iâ€™m terrified that heâ€™s going to do it. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I feel like Iâ€™m doing everything wrong.
