I just want my brain to shut up.I just want a day where I'm not plagued by thoughts like "you're a burden", "no one cares about you", "you're a horrible, disgusting, worthless piece of shit", "you deserve to be in pain", "everyone wants you dead."

I want a day where I can wake up in the morning and feel something other than a crushing weight on my chest and tears in my eyes. I want a day where not talking to my friends doesn't automatically make me think they hate me. I want a day where I'm not constantly thinking about all the different ways I can harm myself. I want a day where I don't feel like a waste of space when my friends leave.

I want a day where I'm not constantly afraid of everything and everyone. I want a day where I'm not second guessing myself and wondering about hidden meanings in everything, or wondering whether I'm just a burden on everyone. I want a day where I'm not consumed by my self-hatred and loathing for myself. I want a day where I don't feel like scum. Like garbage.

But it never comes. The only way it'll come is when I'm dead. I have an appointment Friday, but I doubt I'll make it anyways. I need support and I need company but I don't have it and I don't deserve it so here I am instead. I want my friend to hug me and tell me I'll be alright, but I can't be such a burden on him. He's probably sick of me already anyways. I'm just a stupid waste of space and I don't deserve him as a friend. He deserves better friends. He shouldn't have to put up with me.

I'm so tired and I'm so sick of being alive. I'm sick of existing. There's no point in my life anymore and I'll never get out of this rut. I'll never get better and I just want to die so badly that it's suffocating me. If I kill myself it'll all finally be over and that's all I want. I just want to stop feeling so awful. The urges are so strong. So so so strong.
