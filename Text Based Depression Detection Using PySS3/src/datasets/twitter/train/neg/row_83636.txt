Am I actually suicidal or am I just looking for attention and a shitty person?The last few years I've started having a lot of suicidal thoughts, along with these thoughts I've also found myself thinking about how my family, friends, and co-workers would react and imagining their reactions. I find this really fucked up and sick and it honestly bothers me I keep having these types of thoughts where I find that I almost get some satisfaction imagining them. Am I actually depressed or am I just an attention seeker?
