Everyone hates me and I want to kill myselfI'm 19 and I haven't had a friend since I moved way back in grade 10. I stopped talking completely after that and haven't found someone I could make friends with, which is my fault. From there I was just bullied, by the people around me and by my family (as always with family). I've been thinking about it, and it's been the fact that I was hated by everyone since primary school. I had friends, but they didn't really like me. I didn't watch sports or anything growing up so I was at a disadvantage in that regard. My dad's an asshole that thinks yelling=teaching, and my cousins literally make fun of me every time I see them. I think I'm just somewhat obnoxious without fitting into any group. Everyone around me has always had a pronounced dislike for me. It feels like people get stinged when they see me. I think the only way to fix that is by hanging myself. I'm really not sure why I'm making this post, probably just to formulate my thoughts.
