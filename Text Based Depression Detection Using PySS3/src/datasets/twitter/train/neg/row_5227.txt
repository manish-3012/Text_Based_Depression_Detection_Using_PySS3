I need reason to liveI don't want to give a lot of details, but I'll say this: I'm a high school student, I have abusive parents, my friends have left, and my grades are too poor to get into any colleges. I've thought about it for a long time, and it's not a decision I made easily, but it just seems like the only way. I can't find any reasons to live.
