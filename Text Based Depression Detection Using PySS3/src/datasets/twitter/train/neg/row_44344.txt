Need help.I want to end it all and have for years everything keeps getting worse. Im just totally over being alive. I can't deal with it anymore. I've had one decent attempt putting my car into a pole years ago which didn't work just fucked me up. Now I have a kid and I can't bring myself to end it all but I can't stop wanting to. I'm stuck in this limbo with no option :( what can I do. Nothing fixes all my problems. I've tried doctors etc etc... Im stuck.
