severe tinnitus and hyperacusis, and why i probably won't make it another year.my name is matt.  i'm 24 years old.  this year in September i started experiencing a painful, sound reactive spasm in my left ear.  this spasm happened every time i spoke and every time i heard high frequency noises.  the pain was like a hot dagger in my ear.  on a scale of 1 to 10, the pain was an 8.

at the beginning of October i noticed how loud the world was becoming.  doors closing (not even slamming) started sounding like gun shots.  a dog barking was enough to make me drop to the floor in pain.  i had to stop working.

throughout October my ears started to ring.  throughout November, that ringing got louder.  throughout December, it got even louder.  it currently sounds like a dentists drill combined with microphone feedback.  it is the loudest, most shrill sound i hear in any environment.  this is 24/7.  it's like a cruel joke.

my life has absolutely collapsed as a result of this.  i live with my parents.  i'm on medical EI that will soon run out.  i can't work.  i can't socialize.  my mind has turned into mush.  i feel disconnected from reality.  i can barely communicate anymore.  there is no help.  doctors don't know dick about any of this.  i absolutely cannot take the noises in my head anymore, let alone the sensitivity i have to normal situations.  this life is lonely, boring, and pathetic.

i'm done.  that's it.  can't do it anymore.
