food for thoughtI'm putting this very bluntly 

people don't care about you in real life and in the internet.

Want to discuss something without getting shamed for it on the internet? Nope not allowed

want to have some fun for once with your family? 

Nope, they don't want you and even if they did they don't give a shit about your feelings.



people just don't give a shit anymore about each other 

If every human in the United states suddenly exploded nobody would care- hell it'd probably be taken over in less than a day.


We live in a world where if you're not good enough, it's acceptable to give death threats online 


it's acceptable to die alone in a facility cause hey! You're making them money.

it's acceptable to strangle a man to death in broad daylight, after all he doesn't matter at all.


If I were to take a knife, completely destroy my wrists (which I'm not to so chill)
 And die

My online "friends" and poor family wouldn't give a shit

my online friends would probably just unfriend me in all honesty 


What a fuckin world we live in.
