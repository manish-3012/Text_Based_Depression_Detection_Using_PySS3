I sometimes feel I may be too consideratePerhaps too rational would also be appropriate, just considering the illogical nature of my title.  I lack few close, meaningful relationships.  I find that I have some friends, but I don't want to strain a relationship with people who don't know me too well.  I probably need a psychiatrist, but I don't want to burden my family financially.  I want to self-harm, but don't want to cripple myself.  I want to kill myself sometimes, but realise how awful my family would feel, especially after already losing one child to drugs.

I am not financially independent, and I would be too embarassed to ask for a psyhciatrist.  I don't feel comfortable calling an anonymous line.  I suppose all I can ask for is help with my first problem.  Do you have any advice on forming a meaningful, trusting relationship?

Edit: I don't even want to cut myself or blow my brains out just because I don't want to leave a mess for whomever may find me.
