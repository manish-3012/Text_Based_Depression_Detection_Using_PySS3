Can someone talk to this guy in r/confession?Someone posted a confession on r/confession about their intent to kill themselves [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/confession//comments/rp823/im_going_to_kill_myself_and_nothing_is_going_to/). All the comments seem very counterproductive to me, and it would be excellent if someone with experience could weigh in and help this person out. I know nothing about suicide prevention myself, and I feel I'd do more harm than good by trying to talk to this guy.

Not sure if this is the right way of addressing the community in r/suicidewatch, please let me know if there is a better way.
