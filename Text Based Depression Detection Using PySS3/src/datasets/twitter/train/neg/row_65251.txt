Having a really tough time. Suicidal ideation is taking over.Going to counselling. Doesn't help right away. Feeling a really low low right now. I say dream about dying in different ways. About my boyfriend coming home and finding me lifeless. It all just seems so pointless. Why am I here. I didn't ask for this.
