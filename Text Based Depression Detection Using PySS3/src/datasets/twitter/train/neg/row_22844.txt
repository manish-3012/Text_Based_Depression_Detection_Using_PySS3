College has beaten me.I love my parents and they currently pay for my college but because I'm a lazy sack of shit who doesn't want to talk about math trouble. I failed my math class and because of this my financial aid won't pay for me anymore. I know my place, I don't have a job anymore and I know this will hurt my parents finances when it's already running thin because of this epidemic. I'm really just tired of it all. 


Excuse my grammar it was a work in progress.
