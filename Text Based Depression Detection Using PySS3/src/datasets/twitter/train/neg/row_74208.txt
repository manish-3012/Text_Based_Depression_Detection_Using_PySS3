Fuck me.I'm kinda uncomfortable typing this, and talking to someone about the shit that I'm going through. I feel like people are going to laugh at me or not take me seriously, you know? Or they will assume that I want attention. But here it goes. I'm not close with anybody at all, not even my family infact they have so much hatred for me, it's unbelievable. I can't figure out why though. My mother didn't want to have me and wanted to get an abortion, but sadly didn't. But she's the only one that I really care about. Things weren't so bad when she didn't have cancer. But since she got it everything has been depressing. It fucking hurts to see her in the hospital and everything. And at my shitty home I'm with my dad who doesn't give a shit about his kids and two abusive sisters. I fucking can't handle it anymore, everyday is the same, getting cursed out by my siblings and taking thier abuse. I can't do anything about it, can't even defend myself. I've been getting involved in self harm, and my siblings laughed at me when they noticed my cuts and bruises. I can't even go outside because of the virus. I haven't been eating good in the past months and I've been getting very skinny, up to the point where you can see my bones. I can't get any sleep either, which is ironic because I'm always tired. I've been begging to talk to myself in my mind a lot, but like to an unhealthy amount. It's been getting to the point where I have conversations with myself that last hours. Everything has just been getting worse and worse. I fucking hate living like this. I'm thinking about killing myself, maybe in a week or so. Sorry for the rant
