It's not going away and I don't know what to do.I've been walking up every morning with thoughts of suicide for the last 8 months.  A couple of months ago I started therapy.  Nothing is getting better.  I have this crushing feeling in my chest and my brain is malfunctioning.  I can't live like this anymore.  I'm studying to take the bar and need to find a job.  At the same time I can't function.  About 30 times a day my brain shows me an image of me killing myself or I think I should.  I'm now eating regularly, exercising, doing breathing exercises etc. everything I've been advised to do and it's not getting better.  I can't live like this.  If I don't find a job in the next month or so I may be homeless and have no one to turn to.  I want out.  I'm hoping the 'out' is out of my present situation, but I can't manage to find a job.  I'm lost and have no clue what to do.  Consciously, I don't want to kill myself, but my subconscious just wont let it drop and I'm scared.  What can I do?
