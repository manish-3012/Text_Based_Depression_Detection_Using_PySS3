I'm scared... Im broken.I'm scared I'm pushing away the love of my life. I'm scared to feel. I feel so weak and pathetic. I feel hurt and worried. I don't know what's wrong with me. Even exercise feels so empty to me.

I don't know who I am. I feel like I'm a monster playing human. Sometimes I just...

Fuck... I can't believe I'm spilling my guts here on the internet.

I'm dead inside. Hollow and empty. Yet I am in love and im scared I can't be the man she needs me to be.

If I lose her I can't take it... The pain of life doesn't stop. It doesn't stop hurting.

Im broken on the inside. I don't deserve the people that care for me. I wanna be better but it's so hard and I have so much work to do.

I look at guys like special forces operators and I think to myself. How did they push through it all... How did they become so amazing? What's the secret? To become the master of yourself. They must be perfect. They must be masters of what they feel.

I just.... I want to be perfect so bad. But I don't know how.

I had a breakdown yesterday. And I hurt my loved ones again.

Someone... Please. Im so tired.
