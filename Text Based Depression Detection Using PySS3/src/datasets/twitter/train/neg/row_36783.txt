I'm so fucking close to just buying a shotgun and picking it upIdk idk, everything seems so fucked. I just left my job because it was shitty and now I'm scared to find another. I failed a calc test and am doing shitty in my other classes besides one. The only person I've ever really trusted said she didn't have feelings for me and now wont ecn talk to me. It's my fault everything's my fault. I'm tired of fucking over myself I'm so fucking sick of not being able to enjoy social experiences. It's all too much right now. No one even give a shit, unless I reach out no one gives a fuck about me.   
It's too much, I've felt so shitty for so long its unbearable, I just want it to end I just want it to end.  
I can't take this any more.   
I hate the person i am and everything about me, the rest nothing good about me I'm nothing ,vermin I'd be doing everyone a favor.
