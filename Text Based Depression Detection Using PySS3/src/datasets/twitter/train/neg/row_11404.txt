I feel awful, for each and every minute life just gets worse and worseMaybe Iâ€™m overreacting but I canâ€™t even get any sleep anymore, I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and feeling awful, I wish I could get at least a little sleep for once, to feel normal and not to feel like this mentally unstable freak.
