Is anyone else just too tired to keep doing this?Iâ€™m not angry. Iâ€™m just desperately sad and Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™ve made myself so small that the effects of my death would be minimal. I donâ€™t feel things right and I know itâ€™s me, not the world. Something in my brain doesnâ€™t have the capacity to feel happiness or even neutrality. Not even low grade depressed. Iâ€™m in pain and Iâ€™m tired all the time. I work and try so hard just to keep going, itâ€™s survival...but I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m doing it. Iâ€™ve been trying to get better for decades and Iâ€™m failing. Iâ€™ve failed. I donâ€™t want to keep going and nobody who depends on me. Itâ€™s cold and dark all the time and Iâ€™m ready to stop. Iâ€™m not being rash and Iâ€™ve thought everything through very carefully. Is anyone else just tired and uninterested in everything it takes to keep living?
