I really want to attempt but Iâ€™m too scared that everything will just be magically better right as I stab myselfFor the past few months Iâ€™ve just been in â€œoh shit Iâ€™m going to dieâ€ mode. Iâ€™ve been doing everything I can bring myself to do that will positively affect my mood even if itâ€™s only for a little while. My parents are confused as to why Iâ€™m just disobeying them and my dad is getting even angrier at me daily. This disobedience has only made them take away things that helped me. And the worse my mental state is the more desperate I am to try to bring it up to even the slightest bit. I donâ€™t have the strength to tell them how bad Iâ€™m doing and I canâ€™t afford help even if I could get to it. Talking to my friend has helped a lot but Iâ€™m still getting worse everyday. I feel like Iâ€™m in quicksand and everything I do to try to get out only makes me sink myself even further down. I donâ€™t believe I will survive two more years of this. I wish I had the strength to get help. Iâ€™m wasting the opportunity for a cheap higher education by tanking my grades because I donâ€™t have the energy to do anything. And every time my parents see my grades Iâ€™m reminded how much of a failure I am. And to top it all off I get to be dysphoric too as of recently. Fun.

Sorry for ranting

Tl;dr I want the pain to end
