I canâ€™t do this anymore i just want the pain to stopI recently started cutting again and i just feel so hopeless. I just want the pain to stop. The person i love doesnâ€™t love me back and Iâ€™d rather be dead than live through that. Any day now i just will go to sleep and donâ€™t wake up. i donâ€™t deserve love. Please just make the pain stop
