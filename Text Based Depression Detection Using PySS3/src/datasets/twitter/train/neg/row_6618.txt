I doubt this will help.This isn't a pity party buy I think I am actaully ready to die. Life has been shitty pretty much since childhood for me and I've tried throwing in the towel before but this time is different. I am fed up with the pain I'm in and believe I should be allowed to end it. I've had a date set for a while now and every day it gets closer, I keep hoping something will change but it never has. I finally informed a family member of how I felt but they didn't care at all. Didn't even respond to me so at least I know if I'm gone they won't miss me. I don't even know why I'm doing this but I'm ready.
