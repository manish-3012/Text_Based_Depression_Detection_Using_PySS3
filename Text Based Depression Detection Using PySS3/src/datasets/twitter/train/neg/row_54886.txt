I've screwed up too muchI'm in my mid 30's, and a teacher. Teaching is all I ever wanted to do, and it's the only post-college job I've had. I love it, but I'm horrible at it.

I've been fired from multiple schools. I used to think I just had a bunch of awful principals, but now that I'm about to be fired from my fifth school, I finally realize the problem is me. I've trained with great mentors, read books on education, attended workshops, but apparently I still just don't get it. I'll never get better at the only thing I want to do. 

If I'm interfering with the learning of students, then I can't be in the classroom anymore. But there's nothing else I can stomach doing, and I can't face a life without this. I'll find out next week if I'll get a contract for next year. If I don't, then I'm ending this all.
