This has nothing to do with the fact that itâ€™s Valentineâ€™s Day.Just the fact that itâ€™s February. I started talking to a girl around this time last year, and we stopped talking 7 months ago this Tuesday. I know thatâ€™s not a long time to be talking, I really donâ€™t know why after all this time I still havenâ€™t moved on but I havenâ€™t, and now things just seem like theyâ€™re getting worse again. There hasnâ€™t been a single day in the past month that she hasnâ€™t been on my mind from the moment I wake up till I fall asleep at night. I spend all day fantasizing about her and at night I dream about her. I donâ€™t feel like I get to be happy at all anymore. Sometimes I feel that deep, **deep** sadness literally from the second I open my eyes in the morning, and then itâ€™s not long before I start wishing I could just turn back time. We had a pretty unhealthy relationship, but I donâ€™t even wish I could go back and do everything differently, I just wish I could go back. Iâ€™d go through all the pain again just to relive one day with her.

Anyway Iâ€™m addicted to codeine, and on Tuesday Iâ€™m moving up to morphine. Probably the only reason Iâ€™m not dead already is because itâ€™s really hard to overdose on codeine. I used to take 1200mg a day of codeine, Iâ€™ve had 840mg of codeine at once and not died, but I know morphine can kill you. Iâ€™m thinking about it.
