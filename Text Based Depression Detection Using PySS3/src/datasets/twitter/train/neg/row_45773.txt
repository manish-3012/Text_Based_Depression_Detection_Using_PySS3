I'm all set on my plan... other than one thingSo I'm all set on my plan of how I'm going to do it.  I'm not scared, I'm actually looking forward to it.  A few months ago I was in a car accident and totaled my car. I got an extremely bad concussion, and moved back home with my mom and my little sister (I'm 22).  Since I no longer have a car I've been working for my mom.  But I have to take care of the property and spend a lot of time in the barn and around horses.  Only problem is that I'm allergic to horses and get an excruciating migraine everyday I'm around them or the barn (Which is almost everyday).  To top that off I have insanely bad insomnia, and nothing that 2 psychiatrists have tried has worked.  I've been on every antidepressant, antipsychotic, and hypnotic you can think of, nothing has worked.  I can't sleep and I can't eat.  The only thing that ever helped me was marijuana but thats not an option anymore. Even before all of this I had very little will to live, and contemplated ending it all.  So I've got my plan all set.  The only issue is I am worried about what will happen to my cat when I go.  I hope my mom would take care of him, but my little sister is slightly allergic.  I don't want him to miss me or be sad, but I literally cannot go on anymore, I'm exhausted and haven't wanted to be alive since I was 16.
