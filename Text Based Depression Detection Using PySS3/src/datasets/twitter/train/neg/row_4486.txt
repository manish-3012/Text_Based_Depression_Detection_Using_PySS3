Seroquel OD?Good plan, bad plan? That plus a bit of trazodone are all I have nearby. And I guess my fluoxetine. My original plan was to jump off a nearby bridge on April 20th (discharge date from my PHP) if I'm not better yet. I don't think I can hold out that long. And wouldn't it be better to get it over with sooner so my husband can go ahead and start grieving?
