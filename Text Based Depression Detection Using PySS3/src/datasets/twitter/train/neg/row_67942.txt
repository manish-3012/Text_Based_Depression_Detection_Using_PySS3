I have absolutely no friends and it makes me wanna dieItâ€™s my own damn fault. 

My Depression made me isolate myself and push people away. 

I think part of the reason why I pushed so many people away is so there would be less people sad over my death when I eventually kill myself. Witch could be any day now, Iâ€™m just waiting for when I finally breakdown and canâ€™t handle it anymore
