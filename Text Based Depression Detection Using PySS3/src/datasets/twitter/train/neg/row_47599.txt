LonelyI spend most of my time alone. I have friends and people who care, or at least people who say they do. Most of my family hates me because I accused my brother of raping me and my uncle of molesting me. I feel like an outcast all of the time. Even right now. I was granted permission to stay late in my residence hall and now all I want to do is lay in bed, in my unlit room, and be depressed. I see all of my RAs and their friends walk by every now and then. I wish they would invite me to hang out, but I get it that I'm pretty lame. I just keep thinking about all the ways I could kill myself.
