LonelyIâ€™m so tired of feeling lonely all the time. Iâ€™m in college and I barely talk to anyone. Iâ€™ve had a lot of issues that have made it difficult for me to create friendships. I got invited to a get together at college. My friend from back home was visiting and I asked if we could go. Itâ€™s late at night and we do have to get up early in the morning. I say we could go for a couple of hours just because they seemed nice. I end up feeling really comfortable there and I want to stay until midnight instead. My friend just gets kind of annoyed and keeps elbowing me to leave in front of them. I didnâ€™t think staying longer was unreasonable but my friend made it so obvious she wanted to leave that now I feel like I made a bad impression. It was the first time I felt like I had a group of people to talk to but my friend also brought alcohol but then said to me sheâ€™s not getting that back even though I asked her if she was okay with bringing it. We just ended up leaving but I know I just missed my chance at being friends with them and I heard her saying she was pissed off to my roommate when I was in the bathroom. I love her as a friend but the thing is Iâ€™m still here to deal with the aftermath. Iâ€™m so lonely I just wanted friends here. People to talk to. People who arenâ€™t here are busy in their own lives at home. Sheâ€™s not going to be here every week. I understand itâ€™s my fault but Iâ€™m just so desperate for friends. I canâ€™t deal with this loneliness again. Iâ€™ve made my decision to not go home and kill myself. The thought usually makes me unsure or questioning but I feel at peace right now. The worst feeling is the emptiness and loneliness. And Iâ€™ll be able to stop that if I can just leave
