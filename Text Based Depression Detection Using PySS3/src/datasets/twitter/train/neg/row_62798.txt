Can you be suicidal but not depressed?Hi. so I have a tendency to be long winded, but I need to sleep/ study for finals, and no one wants to read pages of sadness, so I'll do my best to make this short. 

I'm 21, about to graduate from a good uni, I have a fair amount of good friends, and work and school are going really well. My life looks good on paper, and honestly I'm happy about 80% of the time. I don't think I am depressed, and I have not recently been diagnosed. I was depressed in high school, but that mostly felt like numbness and sadness, which is **not** how I feel now. Like I said, I feel good most of the time, but I often have wild mood swings that makes me really suicidal, like I get so overwhelmed by something that I wish I was dead, and the feeling persists long enough and happens frequently enough that I have come up with a good plan. Although I have no 'intention' to execute this plan, I'm starting to get pretty worried that I would muster the intention impulsively in the event of a bad mood swing.

The things that set off the mood swings are usually pretty mundane. For example, the other day I had a really good idea for a piece of art, and I started doodling it out, and it was looking really cool so I got unreasonably excited, praising myself for my bomb art skills ;). While still doodling, I realized that my friends were going to be taking grad pics and I couldn't be at the event unfortunately, and I started thinking that I shouldn't even bother trying to execute the art idea and I should just kill myself. I know this progression makes no sense, but that is what happens, it comes out of basically nowhere.

If this had happened only once, I would not be writing here. Even if it happened once a month or something, I would not be that worried. But its at least 4 time a week, and sometimes multiple times a day. its really exhausting to be constantly pulling myself out of a near-suicide attempt. If anything, I am starting to become depressed because of the suicidal thoughts, not the other way around...

I guess my question is, does anyone know of some mood disorder/etc that is characterized by wild, short term mood swings? I know bipolar disorder is characterized by mood swings, but they usually last for days or weeks, whereas my mood swings last for a few minutes to hours.

Many thanks to anyone with advice, similar experience, or info on the topic!
