I can't hear myselfWhen I sit down and think about it, my rational voice figures out that it isn't worth it. Then when I decide to do something about the negative thoughts, they roar back to life.

It is so loud and violent that I can't hear my rational voice. It takes so much energy to suppress the negative that by the time I can cope again I feel I could sleep for ages. I would give anything for five minutes with my rational voice figuring out where I can get help.
