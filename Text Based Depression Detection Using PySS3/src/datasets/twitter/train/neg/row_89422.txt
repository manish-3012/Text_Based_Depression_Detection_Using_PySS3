I just don't want to exist anymore.Recently, something happened to me which involves the law, and it could potentially ruin my life, at least in my eyes. Between having my mother pay for my expensive lawyer, and having everyone I know close to me find out what happened, I am just mortified with my life. Even though my lawyer said he could take care of it, I still feel disgusted with myself and I know I disappointed my parents. I feel as though I have no purpose anymore, because what's the point when my life is such a joke. Though I have a family, an SO, and friends that support me, I still feel hopeless and alone. I can't sleep, or even eat, and I feel disgusting and ugly. I don't know what to do anymore. I cannot focus on school now, and I am currently a senior in college trying to graduate very soon. I just want to go away forever. But I'm too much of a fucking coward to go through with anything. I hate myself.

(After this all happened, I was sent to counseling from a hospital, and I was diagnosed with General Anxiety disorder, as well as Clinical depression.)
