Im all aloneIm all alone I have no friends Iâ€™m a highschool drop out i have nothing going for me Iâ€™m all alone Iâ€™m in my room locked away I just wanna kill my self but Iâ€™m to much of a pussy I canâ€™t take it anymore no one cares no one loves me Iâ€™ve been left to rot all my friends have forgotten about me I have no job no talent I have nothing all I have is pain anger and a death wish my heart is broken
