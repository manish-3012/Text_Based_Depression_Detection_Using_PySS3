I raped a girl I love. I confessed on another sub, and the response was so overwhelming that I know I'm better off dead. Please take the time to read my r/confession before replying. [I accidentally raped the girl I love and then acted like a dickhole to her afterwards out of fear and shame.](http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/wvb29/i_accidentally_raped_the_girl_i_love_and_then/)

In a nutshell, I fucked up SO BADLY and what hurts the most is that I didn't even fucking realize it. I ignored my actions for month. When confronted, I ran away. To top it all off, I am scared because I am not even sure why I confessed in the first place. I think I just wanted to get it off my chest and feel ok. 

I learned that everything I did after my horrific deed just further illustrated my terrible actions. I consistently perpetuated something already bad. I even introduced an innocent party to my fucked up woes.

Now I feel like it is my duty to speak to the girl and help her. When she finally receives the catharsis she desperately needs, I will kill myself, and I really don't think anyone will be disappointed. 

I truly feel this is what will be done. I don't think any amount of therapy will make me truly get over what has taken me so long to realize. I always thought I was a decent guy, and the shattering reality of it all is too much. I think I have done too many terrible things in the past year.

I am not seeking sympathy, and I am not throwing a pity party. I completely own up to what I did. Sometimes, the world is a better place when someone evil removes himself. I know I am the shittiest person alive, and I refuse to endanger anyone else.

It won't be today, tomorrow, next week, or next month. I will dedicate the rest of my life to that girl until she can look at me and smile again. I will die knowing I have one thing to be proud of. I'm okay with that.
