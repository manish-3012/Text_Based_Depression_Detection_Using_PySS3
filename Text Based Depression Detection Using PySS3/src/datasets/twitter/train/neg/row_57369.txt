Rock bottomHello.
I am a student , i'm 25 and i live alone.
I always supported myself and i have lived with my bestfriend for about 8 years until he tragically chose to take his life on the 22nd of August last year.If life didn't beat me down until then....well on that day half of my soul was ripped from me.
I tried to keep it together and battle my depression ever since then and I did ok for a while but at the begining of february i started having exams and I quit my (under minimum wage ) job to study full time because next year is my last year and if my grades fall under the score of 8 i would have to pay full tuition ( 1500$) money that i could never get living in an Eastern European country.
I have to live off of aproximately 0.70$ for the next 11 days and i just went to sleep hungry and woke up hungry...all the while , while having to study full time for exams .
I am...in a very very dark place , 1$ is 4.2 currency units in my country and even 7 or 8$ can provide me a full day of food .
I have tried reddit/slavelabour or reddit/forhire but with no luck.And i don t have enough karma to post on reddit assistance or reddit/borrow.

But I can barely sleep anymore from all the anxiety and i....i have nobody to ask for help .It's a rough patch and i need help going through this.

If anyone wants and can give me any advice or if they feel kind enough to help with any spare bucks on paypal that they might not need right now...it would mean so so much for me.
I just can't go on
