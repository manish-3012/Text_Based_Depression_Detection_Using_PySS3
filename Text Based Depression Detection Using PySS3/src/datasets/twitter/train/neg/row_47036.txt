My best friends just saved my life.So Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression since about 2016 and my parents have known about it but not the extent of it. I had a couple of friends I thought I could trust but recently theyâ€™ve been making fun of my mental health and that fact that I have come really close to killing my self. Today I thought was the last straw. I was finally going to end it. 

I told my 2 best friends that I know I can 100% trust that I was sorry I was such a failure and I was finally going to end it. One of them is a huge 80s movies fan so I told him â€œHasta La Vistaâ€ and then deleted my Snapchat. Little did I know he called my brother about five minutes before and so my little brother told my parents (whom Iâ€™ve had a lot of issues with in the past).

I was laying in my bed praying for an answer when my parents both came in my room crying theyâ€™re eyes out. We sat down and had a 2 hour conversation about how sometimes they donâ€™t show how important I am to them and how they donâ€™t always show it but theyâ€™re so proud of me. On top of this they addressed some recent fights theyâ€™ve been having which was part of the reason I wanted to kill myself.

I now realize how loved I am, by my parents and my true friends. Iâ€™ve found a purpose in life Iâ€™ve been looking for since 2016 and Iâ€™m doing better than ever. I will forever been in debt to my friends that contacted my brother. I love you Griff and Jag.
