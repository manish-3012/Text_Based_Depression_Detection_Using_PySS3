I'm alone and going tonight. Can someone talk to me while I wait?Ive been ready to go for some time but have been unsuccessful in my attempts. I want to leave this life, the carnival of pain that it has been. I want my soul to be set free and to find peace. I've lost count, so whatever number this attempt is hopefully it's the lucky one. 

I'm scared.
