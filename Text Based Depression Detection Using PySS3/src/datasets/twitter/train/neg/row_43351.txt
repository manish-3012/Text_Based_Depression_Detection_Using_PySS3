You look so much better!I have been seeing a trend where everyone (including my psychiatrist and therapist) keeps saying I look so much better, but I have been drinking my face off for a week in a row and have gotten barely any sleep in that time period. Also I think about suicide more and more. Do I look the best at my most down? I don't know anymore but I feel like saying I look great isn't helping.
