Screaming into the VoidEvery personal relationship I've ever had has been a lie. I mean EVERY personal relationship. Even my familial relationships don't see me as a person, but a familial obligation. I believe my parents love their son and my siblings love their brother, but they don't love ME. I'm a person. I should matter. Anyone who wasn't my mom who told me they loved me proved in a short time that they don't. I'm disposable. I'm a utility whose affection is allocated based on what I can do for them, not who I am, and what I can do is never enough to keep me around longer than a year or two if that. Everyone would be the same or better off without me.

I'm so alone. Always have been, always will be. It doesn't matter what I tell myself or what I convince myself is true.

I should just end it all.
