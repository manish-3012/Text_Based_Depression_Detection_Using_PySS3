NopeI've come to a decision and I'm pretty sure I'll end it. My life has been the same for 6 years, except for my depression getting worse and worse. My social anxiety is so bad I barely can talk to people anymore... My family doesn't seen to care, they know I have depression but just ignore it as if it will go away by itself. I just can't deal with this, I feel stuck. People have been telling me it'll get better and my life will change, but nothing is happening. I'll give it 1 more week.
