I don't understand why I should liveEverything bad that is happening to me is a cycle. People despise me and ignore me because of my depression. I'm lonely all the time so I become depressed. Literally all I do is work and lay in bed. Whenever I try to spend time with someone, it's like pulling teeth. My family and former friends avoid me and wish they didn't have to include me in anything. People hate me and I hate them back, and yet I'm filled with a cruel sense of loneliness and isolation. I don't understand why I am alive. I think they'd all be really happy if I killed myself because then they wouldn't have to ignore me, and then they could rant about how selfish I am. It's a win win, I'm gone and they get sympathy and to tell people how stupid I am. Why is this a bad thing?
