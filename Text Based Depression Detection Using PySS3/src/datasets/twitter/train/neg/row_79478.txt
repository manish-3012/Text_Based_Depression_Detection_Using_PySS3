I took 7 pills. Half of when you're recommended to call a doctor. Debating whether to keep going.22 is the apparent minimum lethal dose for these pills. Maybe being small and frail will actually fucking work in my favour for once and 22 is _more_ than enough needed for my small body? I dunno. Random ass post. Never even finished writing my note. This might be my last words lol.
