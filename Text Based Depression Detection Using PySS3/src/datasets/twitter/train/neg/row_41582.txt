My father killed himself last yearI have a family. My fathers suicide hurt my family. But his pain is gone. They will forget what happened in the coming years. It will pass. His pain is similar to mine. It's not a passing pain. It will stay until death. Health issues. Looking for someone to give a reason not to.
