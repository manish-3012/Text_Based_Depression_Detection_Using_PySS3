I feel like i don't belongI've lost most of my friends and of the ones left, only two actually talk to me. I feel so lonely all the time, I feel like i just don't have a place in this world. I've been heavily considering suicide despite not wanting to leave the few people who make me feel somewhat happy. I really don't know what to do. I've been to therapy for years and it just never helped. Maybe I'm doomed to be in an endless cycle of sadness. I wish i knew, I wish the person who knew what to tell me was still in my life.
