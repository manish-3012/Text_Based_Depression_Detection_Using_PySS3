Fuck this shitIm not really suicidal but not living would be pretty nice. What's the point of doing anything on this earth if we just eventually die. Even if I find a purpose for living, I still don't really see a point, nothing we do matters. I don't even like any of my friends, and I find myself being an asshole to them for absolutely no reason. I am capable of experiencing happiness but in the end I just realize it's temporary. I probably feel like this %70 of the time. My life isn't even hard, if anything it's too easy, I have nothing to be passionate about and I don't feel like anything in this world offers me any emotion to feel.
