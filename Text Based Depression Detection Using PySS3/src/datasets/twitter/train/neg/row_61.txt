Not good enoughDepressed for like 10 years.

School has never worked for me, the only job I ever got was thanks to my dad, but I had to leave it.

Place is stagnant as fuck, staying here would make it all worse but I have nowhere to go.

I hate myself. I hate everyone else, too.

I have no future, by living I'm just postponing my own death anyway. There's nothing in between. No one cares.
