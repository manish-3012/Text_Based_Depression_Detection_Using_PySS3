Just about thereI'm 32. Something that happened today has pretty much pushed me over the edge. I'm thinking it's about time. I have been losing multiple friends over the years. I have purposely pushed several people away including two friends I am talking about today. I have been having problems with substance abuse for a long time. I push other people away to ultimately hurt myself. 
Today one of my friends who has helped me through my thoughts told me to do it. Kind of a shock coming from her, but it has me thinking she might be right. Another friend cut me off recently. Both have been there to help me with my thoughts of self harm but everyone has a limit. I'm just finding it hard to believe I'm worth anything if these two friends disowned me. I'm thinking I might finally do it. I know one of these people may not believe that I feel this way and that it's about attention only. I know the police may have told her there were no signs of self harm during the welfare check they did on me (she is the one who called them to my place). But I was very serious on a couple occasions when I told her I was close. It felt safe to tell her as she wasn't too close of a friend. Other times the thoughts have been passive and not very urgent. But the thought of her not believing me has me in a place where I'm very tempted to do it.  Normally I'm a low risk but these last two days have me very close to making a plan. The other friend who told me to do it today put me over the edge. I'm wondering if she's right. And if both of them are giving me signs that I should do it.
