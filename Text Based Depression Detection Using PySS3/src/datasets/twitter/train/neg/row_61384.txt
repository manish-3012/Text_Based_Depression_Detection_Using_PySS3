Well i dont knowTheres always something to suggest there could be a way out of this mess but realisticly there may not be. Ive had 2 suicide attempts in my life so far i dont want to go for a 3 rd because i remember promising myself it will be 3rd time lucky and ill make sure of it somehow even if it means getting ridiculously drunk, seem to have better implusiveness that way
