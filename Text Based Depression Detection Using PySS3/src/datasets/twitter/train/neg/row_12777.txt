It's just a matter of timeIf I think about it, I think I should just kill myself
even when I try to think logically and practically

i think all ive ever wanted is a good relationship with my family
parents mainly, and especially dad
but it is just not possible
i thought the lockdown had improved everything, but its clear now
that all this time ive just been a haggard dog just waiting, hoping and pleading for a split second of kindness, or attention
and when it happens i feel like a well loved pet
but when I approach them myself, in playfulness or otherwise, thinking I'm close enough//loved enough to get up on the couch or sleep on the bed, i'm kicked off the bed

and like any dog who has figured out that this is not a bond of love and affection, but one of circumstance and just.. convenience(?)
i must lay hidden in a dark corner of the house, only rise when asked to fetch the newspaper or something. take food and treats when given them but never ever expect any... even if I think I deserve them

i'll try to do this, but I don't think I can do it for very long

I'll do this till I figure out how to kill myself
