Piece of shit.I've done some really bad things in my life to myself and others. Really bad. So many awful sins. Lied about it. Looking back I'm so ashamed of myself. I started over in 1993, but can't live down this shame. I don't put myself above anyone, even a serial killer, cause wrongs can't be compared. I've been a doormat and a runaway. No drugs or alcohol, but a life wasted on sexual impulses and no self esteem. I'm a grandma now, how do you live this shit down? some legacy. I finally came out and told my adult child I was no good, but loved him and we are all sinners. What else can I do? Just when I had a glimmer of hope, it all came tumbling down.
