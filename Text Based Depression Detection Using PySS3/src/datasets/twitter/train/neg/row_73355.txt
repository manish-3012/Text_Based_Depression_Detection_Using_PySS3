Mental ProblemsYo, has anyone legitimately reached out for help as far as you possibly can, and realized that there isnâ€™t anything that can help, no matter what you go through, psychologist, psychiatrists, hospitalisation, fuck ton of drugs that sort of stuff, no matter how much â€œlife will get betterâ€ gets forced onto you it never gets better, dont truly want to die but seems like its the only thing left? Idk, shitâ€™s frustrating.
