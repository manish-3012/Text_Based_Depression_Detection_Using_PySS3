I don't know what I'm doing wrong.First off, I'm not suicidal; at least, I think I'm not. I've just been thinking about how I can start to make my life more enjoyable and I feel like I'm stuck in the bottom of a deep pit of loneliness. I have a group of friends that I talk to everyday at school, and I try to make myself a likable person and for the most part I succeed. I try to make everyone laugh and make them happy, and I feel like it works well. But despite all the work I put into these social situations, I feel like no one actually cares. I'm always the last one that anyone thinks of, I get picked last for everything, I have to force myself upon people for them to acknowledge my existence. I try to send text messages to my friends all the time but I honestly cannot remember the last time someone actually initiated a conversation with me. People tell me I'm funny when I'm in a conversation, they look at me with admiration, and they seem to think I'm intelligent, but outside of class it's like I don't exist to them. This has made me feel like a small insignificant person. People are happy to put the weight of responsibility on me and take advantage of my good will but they don't offer anything in return. I feel like I would be happier abandoning social interactions completely but I've tried that and it doesn't help at all. This feeling of insignificance has erased any confidence I felt before and the thought of actually approaching a girl to ask her on a date terrifies me. I feel like as soon as I'm out of school where people aren't forced to interact with me, all interaction will stop. How do I end the loneliness?
