Depressed for no reasonI have had a good life. I loving family. Parents still happily together. Siblings I got on with. I wasn't bullied is school, always had friends. I've never been abused. I've had a few relationships that were good and ended amicably. But I get so fucking depressed for no fucking reason. I'm driving to work and I think I could just not turn the fucking wheel I could not brake I could drive straight into that tree and it would be an accident. I'm too much of a fucking coward to actively kill myself but if it was an accident that would be ok. I don't want my parents to blame themselves. They did everything right. I'm just fucked in the head for no fucking reason
