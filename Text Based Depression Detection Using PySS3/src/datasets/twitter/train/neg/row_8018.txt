Iâ€™ve pushed everyone awayIâ€™ve pushed everyone away in my life. Iâ€™m a burden to them all and only make it harder for them. Theyâ€™re all better off without me. 

I donâ€™t really have anyone now that I can say goodbye to, so I guess thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here. I feel like I should say it to someone at least. 

Iâ€™m really sorry. Iâ€™ve been fighting this for over a decade now, but I just canâ€™t do it anymore. Especially not after today. I just canâ€™t cope. Everyone is better off without me anyway. Iâ€™m just a nuisance and a burden. Iâ€™m sorry.
