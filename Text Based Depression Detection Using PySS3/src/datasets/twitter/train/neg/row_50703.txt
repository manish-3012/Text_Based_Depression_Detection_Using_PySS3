Really don't want to live anymoreI don't have the balls to kill myself but I really can't live anymore. 

I don't know why I feel this way because I don't have any direct reason to, but I really don't want to live anymore, I hate this world, I feel (and honestly am) completely alone, nothing will ever change except for my life getting even more stressful, I'm not looking forward to anything, my own mom doesn't love me, I'm worthless and too weak to live apparently and I wish I was never born. I've been feeling this way for a long time, and self isolation, courtesy of Corona, has made it ten times worse. I'm really struggling to find one reason to continue living, because I'm too cowardly to off myself and I don't want to be remembered as that crazy girl who killed herself and have my mom and relatives live with that stigma.
