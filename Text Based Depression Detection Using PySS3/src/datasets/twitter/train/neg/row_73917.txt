Some help in getting better would be great.I'll try to keep this as short as possible:

I'm basically stuck in a toxic environment, can't work, can't get a degree, can't even leave the house without a 5 day advance notice to parents on whom I'm thus financially dependent. In a middle eastern country that isn't even my 'home' country so if I try to escape I'll just get put on a plane to an even worse place. Basically my whole life is planned out for me and it sucks camel balls.

A previous attempt at suicide got me a zoloft prescription and a therapist that I can't even talk to (she's a family friend which makes it awkward and told me that prayer was the best cure - so that limits how much honesty I can spew out in a session)

I got a tattoo a few years back (easily hide-able) just to remind myself  that I shouldn't give in and accept a depressing fate. I'm basically self-taught and really clung on to the belief that I'd get myself the fuck out somehow, seems less and less likely as each day passes.

So basically, if anyone's ever escaped such a situation or has any idea how to, I'm all ears.
