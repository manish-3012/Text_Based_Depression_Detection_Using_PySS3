I'm so tiredI've tried to kill myself and been hospitalized before. I've been hospitalized to prevent suicide attempts before as well. I'm not showering, not brushing me teeth or my hair. I wear whatever is easiest for me to find in the morning. I'm currently skipping class so i can take 10 klonopin and drink and skip the day. The only thing stopping me is not knowing what would happen to my animals. Maybe i'll try to rehome them, and then I'll have nothing left to keep me here. I've been suicidal and medicated for 10 years, and I'm just tired. I drink to feel better which just makes me feel more depressed the next day. For the first time I am seriously considering wrapping up my responsibilities and just ending it. Either that or just stop eating until I waste away.
