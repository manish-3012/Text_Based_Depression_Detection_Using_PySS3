Socially awkward, not good enough for anything/anyone, and depressed to the point of not being able to bring myself to do the smallest of things and I'm planning on ending it soonI've been living like this for at least 5 years now and thinking that everyone who's normal is just talking to me just for some joke, not being able to fond any sort of love, can't get a job, and most of my relatives are just there to remind me how i'm not good enough for anything. I'm planning on grabbing some pot and a bottle of methylphenidate, getting high then swallowing the bottle soon.
