I think I might finally be at that point. I am not happy with anything in my life. I feel I have ruined my relationship, lost my family, and let myself go. I can function some days but it's getting to the point where I don't even want to function anymore. I just want to disappear yet let everyone in my life know it's for their own good. I don't want anyone to be sad about it. I love someone with all my heart but lately I can't even confide in him it seems. He dances around my depression because what else can he do? If he talks to me about it, then he'll be sad also. I don't know what to do. I'm tired of having borderline personality disorder, because it takes up so much of my energy. I find myself resenting my boyfriend because he's happy and able to enjoy life. What the fuck is wrong with me? I see no point in going on.
