I'm planning on killing myself soonI really dont have much to live for anymore, and noone can relate to the problems I have. I have terrible acne, I'm really short(I'm male), and I get judged all the time for my skin color(I'm black) I feel like such a loser, I'm even crying while typing this. Why is my life so awful. I want to kill myself the most painless way possible with messing up and ending up living with life long issues(ie being paralyzed) 
I'm thinking of trying a variety of different ways to go about doing it
Overdosing on pills, hanging myself, or jumping off of a tall building
I just wanted to vent about it before I do it
I wont write a proper suicide note before I do it because no one will read it or will miss me when I'm gone
