Losing my mindIdk anymore and idc anymore, feel like Iâ€™m only living for my grandma and younger sibling these days. Iâ€™m a 22 year old man, and just feel done with life. My mom wants me to get a gf, but these days idc about anything. Only living because I donâ€™t want to hurt my grandma and younger sisters. I talk to myself repeatedly. I was abused pretty bad when I was younger, and feel like I canâ€™t even live anymore. It affected me mentally in so many ways. I donâ€™t dance, sing or socialize. I hate the thought of suicide because I know others have had it worse, but idk anymore. Tbh I donâ€™t even know what to do anymore.
