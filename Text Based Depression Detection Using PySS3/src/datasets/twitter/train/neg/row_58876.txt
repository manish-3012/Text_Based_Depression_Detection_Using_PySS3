Fuck it. I am sick of the bullshit.I am 21 years old, living more than 1000 miles away from my family and friends. I find myself forced* to work nearly every day by a boss that is so out of touch with what it is like to not have millions of dollars that he could never understand. I haven't had a day off in over 3 months. I just want all the bullshit of being forever alone and constantly working ot stop. JUST FUCKING STOP! STOP!!!!
