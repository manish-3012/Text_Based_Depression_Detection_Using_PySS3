What could possibly be so good at the end that it's worth all this suffering?Like, what possible thing could be worth all the shit I go through and all the fucking nights in which I just can't think anything besides how fucking shit my life is? Why should I even carry on if in the end there is no point at which I will be like "carrying on was worth it". Especially if it never fully goes away because apparently depression is something I'll have to deal with my whole life. I'm not exactly thinking of ending my life any day soon, but sooner or later I probably will. Why would I even bother to live if it means I'll feel like this every day? I try to be the best I can be every fucking day but then life decides to fuck me over like that. Seriously, that's just so fucking unfair
