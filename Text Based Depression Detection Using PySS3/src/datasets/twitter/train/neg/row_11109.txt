I have a questionLittle bit of background on me. I'm very empathetic. "Happily" married. I have a job as a one on one for an adorable sweet little boy who is non verbal and has multiple disabilities. I love this little boy like my son. We communicate in ways thru showing love, patience, being very observant for his cues, etc...

Okay so my husband and I have been having issues. I am now suffering from situational depression. But trying to press forward. 

Last night, I was having a low night like I didn't want to go on but was trying to  whether I'm more of a burden or impact. Burden was winning. When I started to figure out what to do what I had to I thought about everyone close to me. I could rationalize how they would be better off. Then I though of the sweet boy I work with and realized he wouldn't understand where I went, he wouldn't know I wasn't coming back and maybe even feel like I gave up on him. I felt bad because no one really gets him like me and I decided to keep pressing on. 

So I tell husband (after hours of arguing) how bad I really was and when I told him the little boy kept me here he got so mad. Like really insulted that I wouldn't keep on for him (husband). I do understand where is coming from but in all honesty he(and situations) is about 80% of the reason I feel this way. And he knows this too. He knows he messed up and keeps messing up. 

Okay my question is (and again I think of things differently than most people) but why is he is mad at me instead of being thankful that the little boy is in my life and grounding me back.

Please don't insult me or give me a heard time. I'm really fragile emotionally and insecure at the moment. 

Thanks.
