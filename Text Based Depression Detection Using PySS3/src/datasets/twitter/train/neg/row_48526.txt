Do I need medication?I canâ€™t tell if my suicidal stuff is medical or not (15M)

Iâ€™ve always had a lot of anxiety and guilt and I go from feeling awesome to a complete failure in seconds. I have a very loving family but I remember wanting to die when I was 5 or 6 bc I felt disappointing. I have hit my head on purpose many times very hard which has given me headaches, I have cut myself and ruined relationships.

Anyway I got a therapist but I donâ€™t tell him all the bad stuff bc I donâ€™t want to disappoint him. I get violent urges to hurt myself whenever I feel like Iâ€™ve messed something up.

The weird thing I feel like I want to be this way and I can stop whenever but I never do. Itâ€™s maddening. Also I have anxiety around even my friends and can never seem to act normal or keep my hands away from my face. A lot of this stuff I started doing on purpose (I guess I wanted to seem less confident??) and I canâ€™t stop

Also I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m going to be able to survive in the real world and it would be easier just to die.

Any help is appreciated!
