BedlamWhen someone uses the phrase "it was bedlam in there" it refers to a mental institution in england which has been around for hundreds of years where the patients were put on display as circus acts for money. I just realised when i watched a few vids on youtube of people filiming mentally ill people for laughs likes and share's that we havent changed a bit in those hundreds of years, we just have different tools. This just wants to make me kill myself even more.
