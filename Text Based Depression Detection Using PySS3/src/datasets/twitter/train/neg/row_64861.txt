I've had enough, I'm living a nightmareHmmm let's see what we've got here:

Failed high school twice

No girlfriend

No matches or likes on online dating

Ugly

Short

Dumb

Anxiety

Depression

Poor

No talents or skills

No friends

Horrible nightmare past

Always jealous of others for being happy

&amp;#x200B;

And yet I'm expected to act as if everything is okay. Well everything is NOT OKAY. This isn't a life, this is a nightmare. I feel trapped and helpless. And no ones cares, what a cold, cruel world :'(
