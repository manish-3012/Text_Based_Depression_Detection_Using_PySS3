I can't fill this void growing inside of me, I think this is how I die. (pt2) So I decided I'll keep an update until I decide to finally off myself. Here's to the last few days since my last post:

My boyfriend came back from Baltimore, he traveled with a few friends a few days ago and go exploring. I missed him so much, but I think we might break up. He acts so distant and so far and I feel like I keep fucking up. My jaw works good again, but my skin not so much. This void of endless guilt, suffering, and loneliness seems to have gotten worse. I want to die already but how? I'm so scared of what happens next. WHATS AFTER DEATH? That's officially the only thing holding me back right now. I keep getting fucked up, this past few days were seriously so crazy. I want to see how far I can go, maybe this will help me just say fuck it to what happens next and just find out. FUCK.

This empty feeling in my chest hurts right now as I speak, why wont it go away.

I just want it to go away...
