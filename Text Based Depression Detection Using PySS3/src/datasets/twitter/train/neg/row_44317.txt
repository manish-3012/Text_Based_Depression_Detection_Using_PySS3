Awareness of life causes the realisation of the complete inevitability of it allI try to remember back to the time before I became aware of how pointless my life is .. yes in earlier years previous times of despair the contemplation has always been there to consider but now it like itâ€™s the answer to everything why not? Of lifeâ€™s so shit and you donâ€™t see it getting any better then why not ? I donâ€™t want to hear all the platitudes Thera morning that can bring my brother back or stop me questioning the why didnâ€™t I say this or try that or try harder and then thereâ€™s people genuinely suffering who want to live and like living and I am just poo-pooing all that with my lowdown moods and nothing to live for itâ€™s true that no one really genuinely cares I didnâ€™t really genuinely care that my brother would do what he did or he wouldnâ€™t have done it so now I have to prove this Iâ€™ve told people Iâ€™m going to kill myself ... the fact that Iâ€™m still alive gives them a false sense of hope that somehow Iâ€™ve miraculously just got better ! Nothings changed and yes Iâ€™m stubborn now brothers gone Iâ€™m just waiting for my mum to go ...thatâ€™s literally the only thing keeping me alive Iâ€™ve told the crisis team and everyone so I guess theyâ€™re happy for me to just exist until she goes by which point hopefully I can then go to .. is anyone else able to relate to this?
