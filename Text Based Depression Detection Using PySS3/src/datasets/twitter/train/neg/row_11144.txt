I haven't left my bed for 2 daysMy family keeps coming into my room to ask me what's wrong and just showing me a whole lot of love I just don't deserve.

But no matter how often they ask what's wrong, how the hell am I supposed to tell my mother I want to jump in front of the day every day I'm at the station? That u want to hang myself from my bed using my belt?

I can't do it. It would break her heart, and depending on her reaction it might also break mine. I can't tell anyone.

I have to keep this to myself. I have to get up. I have to pretend everything is alright. I was just unusually tired for 2 days. But it's alright now.

I'll just keep pretending it's okay. But it's not.
