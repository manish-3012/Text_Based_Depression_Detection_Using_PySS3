I'm only alive for my dogs. I will kill myself when they are goneOne is 12 and I worry about him dying. the other just turned 6 and I know he will be devastated when his brother dies. I love them and want them to live for as long as possible, but I really really want to die. I've been ignoring it because I just can't kill myself right now, but it's the truth. It's always been like this and always will be. I love my niece but she would be alright after some time. I'm hurting physically/mentally and I'm tired. Family only wants to help and love someone when it's too late.
