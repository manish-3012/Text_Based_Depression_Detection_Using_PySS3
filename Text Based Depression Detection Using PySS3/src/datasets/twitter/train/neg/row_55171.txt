help...my friend has ASPD. she is a sociopath, borderline psychopath who has attempted many, many times to commit suicide because she says she hates not feeling, and is now talking to me about wanting to end it for good. 

for one, it triggers me with my own history of suicide attempts. secondly, it's also soooo fucking exhausting to constantly stop her and track her down to send cops and EMTs to her on a weekly basis because she's drank or taken something.

what should i do?
