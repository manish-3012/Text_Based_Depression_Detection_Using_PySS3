I just wanted to be happy..Hello. Currently I'm in London. I'm from Poland. I'm 19. 
At first I'm writing that I just moved here three weeks ago, and  I also have bipolar affective disorder since I'm 15, but no pills etc. 
Today I woke up ready to go to work. I got message from my boss, that today is my free day in work. That's strange, I thought. But the problem is,  he didn't give my salary. And that's why I begun to be so depressed. I'm lying in bed thinking about ending. I have enough of this in my 19yo live. My parents are dead, they overdrunked themselves half year ago..  I did everything alone. I got money for moving to London alone, I did everything I could to enjoy my life gain my dream and move to London. Once I moved here I got so inspired that I wrote 5 songs in short period of time. I'm proud of it. But I have enough of fighting. I'm looser. I risked everything in my life to move here, and now I'm looser. What, what the hell did I do to be in such a hell like this..  I helped everyone as I could.. I did everything the best I could. I learned English fluently just to end up in other country, with no perspective just with my dreams to sing.. 
I don't want you guys, to write ' don't to this'  because probably I won't find courage to end my life. But just in case.. Before loneliness and every problem here kill me..
