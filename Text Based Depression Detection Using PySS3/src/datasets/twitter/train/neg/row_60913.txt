What's wrong with me?Why do I fuck things up? Why am I such a burden? Why do I make issues out of nothing? Why am I so insecure? Why can't I stay on my meds? Why do I make myself unhappy? Why do I self harm?
Why do I stick around?

What's wrong with me?...

Sorry, having a really bad day and I just needed to vent. Depression sucks. It's like this huge scary binding monster that follows me around even when I think things are good. I don't want to lose this battle of life but man it gets so hard sometimes..
