Why?I was at the mall with some friends having a good time when they introduced me to this cute girl 9.1/10, way out of my league, we got along pretty well but had to part ways at some point. Hours later, I see her group of friends laughing a bit far from us from where I was, so I get closer to approach them but they go somewhere else and I see her sat there, where they were laughing, crying. Her "friends" had made some nasty joke on her and left her. So I stayed with her trying to make her feel better and convinced her to go for a walk and, right when we got up, she got close to me to get under my right arm and walk like that. I managed to make her feel better, so we were going to eat something.

That's when I woke up.

I don't have any friends, have social anxiety, ugly af to death and that girl doesn't exist.

I'd would have been the perfect death if I died during that dream. Sadly, good things never happen to me.
