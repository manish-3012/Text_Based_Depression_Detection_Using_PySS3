What if...I know suicide is selfish, but I feel so far gone from any kind of individuality. I donâ€™t know what I am because Iâ€™m dead to myself. My family loves me more than anything Iâ€™m sure, but we havenâ€™t enjoyed our time together in a long time because Iâ€™m not who I used to be. Most of the time Iâ€™m a ghost in the room with nothing to contribute because my soul is gone. I donâ€™t enjoy anything. At this point Iâ€™m not sure I have the empathy required to understand how my family might react. Extreme grief for certain. Lifelong pain like I feel now. They donâ€™t deserve that.

My treatment has been ineffective for 5 years. Thereâ€™s nothing I feel for enough to hang on to.

I used to cope with drugs and cutting. In 2016 I made a promise to my mom to stop cutting permanently. I intend to keep that promise. There  is nothing else that makes me feel. I have no momey for drugs.

It is either a â€œlife sentenceâ€ for me here on Earth, or I pull the plug and devastate my family. Iâ€™m done with meds, hospitals, therapists, psychiatrists, etc. They havenâ€™t helped, not for lack of trying.

Hypothetically, what would happen to my 60,000+ dollars in private and federal student loans if I end my life? How could one dampen the effects of the loss their family would experience - to any extent? I probably sound like an awful person. This just isnâ€™t for me, no amount of rewiring of my mind has changed that at all.

It has occurred to me to stage a sort of going away from my family and manage a move somewhere contact would be limited for a time to let them adjust to life without me before I go for good.

Iâ€™ll probably just take the considerate route and put my head down and keep to myself as long as I can. Nightmares gnaw at my composure, though. Every. Single. Night. Traumatic experiences that probably would sound mild to most people eat at me. Dying sounds awful, death sounds blissful.
