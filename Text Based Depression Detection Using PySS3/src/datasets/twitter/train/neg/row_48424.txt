The only reason I haven't done it yet is because knowing my luck, I'd probably survive.I haven't had a not-suicidal day in years, literally. Nothing really takes away the emotional pain I have, and I've tried. I've been in psychiatry, too, and the medications I used to have only made me lose so much focus that I failed out of school. I'm back in a somewhat shitty school now and I'm scared of failure. If I don't at least pass everything this semester I'm coming up with a concrete suicide plan. I don't think I'm ever going to be as successful as I hoped or assumed I would be when I was younger.
