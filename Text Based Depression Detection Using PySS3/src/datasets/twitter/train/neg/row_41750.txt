End of strength and patienceI can't do this anymore. I've been lying to myself my whole life, kept telling myself to keep on going, that it gets better... And it did. It did get better at times, I either found a thing or a person that kept me going sometimes, that gave all of this a purpose. But then, the same thing happened, over and over. Each time I found a thing or person that kept me going, it didn't last. It never lasts. I'm tired of starting over. I'm tired of climbing back up only to be kicked down again. I also have to live with myself, having done some things that disgust me, and now I have to live with the guilt of those things. I hurt people who truly cared. I always end up hurting people. And they end up hurting me. It's some sick, twisted cycle. I'm tired. I'm thinking of a deadline to set for me to end it all. I'm thinking maybe this Friday will do. Would be quite a matching date, seeing as it would be three weeks since I terribly hurt the person I care about most.
