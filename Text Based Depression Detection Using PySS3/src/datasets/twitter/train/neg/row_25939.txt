When does it endI keep hitting myself and different things more and it seems like itâ€™s getting worse. I decide random, trivial occurrences are great opportunities for me to hurt myself. If I get a phone call while Iâ€™m doing something, Iâ€™ll start punching myself. Iâ€™m doing terrible in school and might fail my senior year. Not even enrolled in school anymore as Iâ€™m doing it from home. I just want to yell fuck as loud as I can and just disappear. My one friend probably hates me. My teacher comes over to test me on my finals tonight. My FUCKING PHONE IS FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW AND ITS MAKING ME SO MAD. I canâ€™t even type on a suicidal sub Reddit without getting pissed. I started coming off of my antidepressant not long ago and itâ€™s caused rage, depression, insomnia, and other hellish things. I just wanna fucking jump off a roof and die painlessly. FUCK
