My sister wants me to kill myself and i agree and dont blame herFor i deserve to be disowned and punished. Death would not suffice for i have betrayed the trust of my loved ones beyond what is redeemable. I am a selfish, lying, lazy, procastinating, hypocritical junky-ass bastard. I should not be writing this on the internet but i am coward stuned and well beyond pity, advice  or help. A garbage person. For the past ten years i have chosen to abuse drugs. J droped out of collage. I have waisted a lot of money that i did not have on em. I been bailed out before. Today my family found out that i am debt again.  Waisted any chance at a fresh start and ended up in the same self-deception train every damn time. I could not control myself and now its beyond my control. I am the only one to blame so i never looked for real help. Dont make the same mistake as me. I wanted to die since the 1st or 2nd grade and  now i made it indisputabley an inevitable conclusion for anyone to make.
