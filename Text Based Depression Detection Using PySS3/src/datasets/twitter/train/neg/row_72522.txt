Routine Suicidal Thoughts and Self Harm, Looking for Coping Mechanisms25M in CA, USA

For the last 4 months I've been prone to impulsively harming myself. Generally a series of bad conversations and circumstances pushes me instantaneously into a depressive mood where I feel like a burden, I feel like I'm being told I'm fundamentally awful in an unchangeable way, etc. and to alleviate the torrent of anxiety and helplessness I find myself driven to slam my head into walls in an effort to achieve unconsciousness. A month and a half ago, I started cutting myself - the pain and terror of blood distract me from the sadness and replace it with terror and shame, shitty but much less shitty than risking suicide. I fear that if I leave this acute anxiety alone without attempting to mitigate that it will escalate to a full suicide attempt. In these moods I exclusively think about suicide and self harm, and for days afterwards suicide is a haunting whisper in my ear. The trigger for all of these is conflict with my girlfriend. I've talked to her about how I don't feel I'm not in a position to change my reactions (and I don't even fully believe that's possible) and that I need her to approach conflict differently, but whenever things get heated all bets are off and the same old shit leaves me on the floor, slamming my head into something, slicing myself with the nearest vaguely sharp object. This severe reaction I have to certain methods of conflict (notably raised voices, interruption, perceived condescension, and negative commentary on things that can't be changed) is not unique to this gf, this goes back to my father and I've had similar issues with other gfs in the past, but as I get older it gets worse and worse and this is the first time in my life that I regularly practice self-harm about it.

Any advice?
