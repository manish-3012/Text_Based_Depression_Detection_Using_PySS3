i've had enoughi've seen enough. i've gotten through life longer than other people have and i'm grateful for that, but i want to punch out now. i've seen too many friends be abused and delve into addiction to think that it gets better for all of us. not everyone can be saved. i'm fine with "becoming a statistic," as all of the hokey anti-suicide PSAs say. i've had these problems as long as i can remember. i know myself and i know that all the therapists i've seen and pills i've been on and friends i've had (especially since 95% of them have left or don't care about me anymore) won't help me truly get better and have the life i would have had without trauma, abuse, and mental illness. i've had a good run and i've had some good times, but i want to be done now and i've wanted this for many years. i won't be around to care about the slim chance of hurting people beyond my immediate family and best friend because i'll be dead. i don't want to be committed again.
