I need to get to Wednesday, please helpI made a promise to my psychiatrist to get to Wednesday alive. It's when I have my appointment with her.

I keep thinking about it. About ways to do it. I'm this close to snapping and doing it. I can feel it.

I need to get through tomorrow and Tuesday while going at work. Wednesday morning is when I'm gonna give up control. I'm gonna drink before getting there. I wrote a note on my phone saying that I can't go another day and other stuff in case I'm too drunk to talk coherently.

I'm a piece of shit for doing this but I need someone else to make a decision for me. I feel so guilty for putting the burden on her but I trust her and she's a doctor. She can definitely make a better decision than what I would.

But I need to get to Wednesday and I don't know how.
