Too muchI've had a rough couple months having recently lost a mom. I live with an abusive father who emotionally tears me apart whenever we talk by telling me that her death was my fault, that I am a failure, etc. As a result, we aren't on speaking terms at all. As an only child without other relatives, I don't really have any family to talk to. I sort of exist at school but don't have any close friends. In all, I am alone. I've been a really bad person lately. I have my demons. I hate that about myself. I want to be a kind person but nobody returns the favor so I give up. I am forgetting what love feels like. It's as if I have an ever expanding void where my heart used to be. I'm tired of feeling like nobody cares about me mostly because I know that it's true. I am going to tie up some loose ends tomorrow and leave.
