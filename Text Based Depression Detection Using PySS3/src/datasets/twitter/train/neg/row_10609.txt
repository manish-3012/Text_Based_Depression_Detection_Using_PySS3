Do suicide dreams happen to anyone else?I'm not really suicidal, but I've thought about how I would do it. But recently, I've been having these dreams where I formulate situations that are the straw that broke the camel's back. I then end up telling whoever caused it "I quit" and steal the family car to go do the deed. I wake up in tears because my brain keeps replaying it trying to come up with the "perfect" scenario. What's wrong with me?
