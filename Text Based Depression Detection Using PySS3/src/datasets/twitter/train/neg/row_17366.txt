Anyone successfully "run away"?I'm at the point where I want to end everything or just "run away". I say that in quotes because I am not a minor. I'm in college and it's just too much stress. Math is really the only thing I am very bad at, but even other classes put on so much stress to get good grades because I have a scholarship I am trying to keep.

I've never had a job. Haven't ever been able to get even a minimum wage job because I entered the job market at the wrong time, and nobody was wanting to hire just for the summer. However this would make starting fresh feasible because I wouldn't have any other obligations so I could work full time.

I do a couple of odds and ends for money, but I only have about $200 now. I could sell off all of my possessions for maybe $500, and with this I would be able to just get up and move somewhere and get a temporary place to sleep.

I have no friends and I guess I probably have some form of social anxiety but I've never been diagnosed. I don't like my family or really most people and my family's rather indifferent to me.

I just have to much stress and I dunno, anger maybe, to just keep sitting here.

I don't have any street smarts though I don't know that I'll need them. I have stuff I can put on a resume, but no references (the only "formal" "employer" I had died) and nothing impressive, but hey you don't really need experience to get a minimum wage job. It'd also be shit living for a while I guess, but I'd feel better I think and could eventually work my way to doing something I want.
