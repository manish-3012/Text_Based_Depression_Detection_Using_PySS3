I almost did it.There is a bridge, when I come back from my therapist's office, 400ft tall, Every time I go past it I think about jumping off. I really wanted to today, Yesterday, 6 of my turtles escaped, they are the only thing I live for, they are my whole world. Half of my world, gone. (I have 10 turtles)  I cried for an hour straight. Then, 2 hours after, I got into a fight with a family member. I did terrible things. This isn't new, I cause them so much pain, emotionally. I wish I were dead, just so I could end the pain I cause them. Losing my turtles almost pushed me off the edge. I looked for my blades, I couldn't find them though. An online friend made me promise her I wouldn't kill myself. Today, on the way back, I went on the bridge, I thought very seriously about jumping off, but I didn't, something held me back, I don't know what it was. I have autism, depression, anxiety, social anxiety, no IRL friends, lonely, anger issues, and more. I am a failure and disappointment to everyone. Yeah, I have a hard life.
