â€œSo, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.â€I find it strange that even in times that I've felt much much much sadder and felt no joy or happiness, I still have not felt so compelled to just end it. Not sure if that makes sense or if anyone else can relate.
