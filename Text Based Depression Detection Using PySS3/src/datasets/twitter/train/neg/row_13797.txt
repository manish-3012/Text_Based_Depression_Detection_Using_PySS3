i am a fake and i just want attentionI'm a trans woman and i just graduated high school. i have a couple self diagnosed mental health issues that have literally gotten in the way of me being able to get help and when i try and talk about it with anyone they brush me off and discredit what im talking about. it is so strenuous to hold a conversation with someone and look functional i honestly dont think i could even make it through therapy and communicate that i have problems being alive and need help to manage them. 
i had a therapist years ago the last time i was having trouble, and since i was 14 and dissociated every time i visited her office i was unable to sincerely discuss my issues. i fucked it up and only brought up personal squabbles with my brother and how i felt like everyone was supposed to hate me
i started seeing a new therapist last week, since i was terrified i was gonna find my previous one, who was actually really great, was gonna be transphobic but they're apparently both friends and both tolerant. so i feel like an ass about that. but th epoint here is that i'm extremely symptomatic and i dont think i can actually get through therapy, that its not going to help me and i'll have wasted a lot of insurance money and time and energy. 
i know for a fact that suicide would end my shitty pointless turmoil, and that my therapist probably isnt going to believe me anyway because i dont know how to communicate how im feeling or literally even remember it by the time i've been driven to her office. and i cant drive because its sensory hell and i literally miss half the signs the last time i tried. and i cant work because i can't drive. but my parents expect me to drive and work and its hellish to try.

piling onto everything else im a fat hairy autogynephile and this world doesn't want me. im a punchline, im a waste, and im gross.
