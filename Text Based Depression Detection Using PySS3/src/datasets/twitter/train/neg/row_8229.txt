I'm so tiredThis place seems like a good outlet to let out a secret I've been holding onto for too long

Sorry in advance for the wall of text.

I want to die but am too afraid to commit suicide. I've wanted to die since my early teenage years and have told noone.

I have a perfectly normal family situation. I have plenty of people who care for me including my family who loves me very much. I have plenty of friends who care for me as well but sorry to say I can't say I feel the same way. Although I fake the emotions well enough to be deemed as a caring person. And these aren't even those fake people many people call friends, these are childhood friends who've I've been through thick and thin with. 

I'm in my mid twenties and just wasn't happy back home so I got a degree, moved abroad, and have a stable job and for anyone else this would be the perfect life.

But I feel even more empty here. I've never had a girlfriend in my life so I decided to exercise and be more social here and began to try to get into the dating scene.

But it seems like no matter who I meet no one seems to want to start a relationship with me. And I've been here in a new country alone now for half a year.

And it's not that I have a shit personality, 
everyone I meet says I'm a kind person.

If I were to do it I'm sure everyone around me would be shocked. Saying typical things like, he was never that kind of person. Or I would've thought he would be the last person to do something like that.

I think I just have shit luck. Or maybe life wasn't meant for me. I'm so done, and just want to give up. I don't want to try anymore. 

At this point I'm becoming more accustomed to the idea that suicide might be the answer.
