Failed attempthello again 

So I didn't manage to kill myself the last time around. My primary means wasn't viable so I had to come up with another solution which didn't work. I didn't think I could sink any lower and yet this failure to die occurred ... 

So I happened to chance upon some videos about Nietzsche's thoughts on nihilism and it made sense to me. So I'm just gonna try to find a purpose in life before I attempt suicide again. 

And thank you to whoever pmed me after my first post here.
