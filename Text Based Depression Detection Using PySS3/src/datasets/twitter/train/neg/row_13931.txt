I cut myself but never too deep.Hello I wanna die, but Iâ€™m too scared of pain. Iâ€™ve cut myself before but itâ€™s not deep enough. I feel so alone. I have no one to share my thoughts with anymore. i hate waking up everyday hating every part of myself. I feel like iâ€™m so close to actually ending it even though im afraid of physical pain. I think its gotten to a point that it doesnâ€™t really matter anymore since Iâ€™m gonna die anyways.
