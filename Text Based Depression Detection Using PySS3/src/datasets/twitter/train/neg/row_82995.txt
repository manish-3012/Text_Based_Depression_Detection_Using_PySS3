I seriously want to kill myself what is wrong with meI'm 17 years old, in my last year of high school, but I absolutely hate myself. I'm dumb, I have no talent, I'm ugly, I'm short and simply, everyone's lives would be much easier if I didn't exist. I don't do anything and everyone around me is so productive with their extra-curricular activities. I find it genuinely hard to sit an exam without getting distracted. I don't know what is wrong with me. Sometimes I feel if I were to just end it all now, everything will be just simpler. But also, I don't want to be one of those lost causes. What do I do. I'm currently doing the IB programme and everyone around me is telling me that I'm going to fail (teachers, head of sixth form). And you know what, at this rate, I probably am. I may sound defeatist, but I don't want to. Help. Please. My TOK essay was due a couple of weeks ago, and as usual, I leave it until the last minute to complete it. I was so tired by 1am that I accidentally plagiarized it. I didn't do it on purpose, I swear. The head of sixth form called me in today, and yes, I confessed that it was bullshit. I thought I cited everything, but I apparently I didn't. Why am I so f****** stupid. You may be thinking this is petty teenage problems, but I have had the thought several times in my life but I'm always like nah, everything will work itself out. The school called my parents and my parents got mad. Obviously. So now I am typing this while they think I am writing my re-draft. Oops. Is there any way to fix how I'm feeling? Or at least, with the plagiarism thing? I've been a terrible student, I keep repeating the same patterns and honestly sometimes I think it would be easier to end it all.
