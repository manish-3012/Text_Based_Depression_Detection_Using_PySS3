People lieEveryone says they're here for me. Until it gets bad. My partner is currently on tour as he's on the RAF. He's a pretty sexually active person with new kinks that I was used too. But have made an active pursuit to satisfy him. 

I've been dealing with health issues for over a year and today I just broke down. I pre warned him I could feel an episode coming on. He yet again makes another sexual comment. 

When addressing this is not the time. He turns on me. He turns on me all the time. And makes me feel guilty. He tells me im melodramatic and that I need to wise up. 

I dont miss my previous partner. I just miss the support on days like this where I can escape the bad thoughts. 

My current partner is 4 hours behind and has now turned his WiFi off. I've tried reaching out to friends. No one has replied. I have sat in my room crying and trying to talk myself out of harming. 

So now I'm here. Because I have no one but strangers...
