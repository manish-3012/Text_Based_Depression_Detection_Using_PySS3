i constantly get existential crisesno religion do i take comfort in because i do not believe nor does my family

one day the earth will be engulfed by the sun and i eventually will be recreated seemingly instantly because you have no concept of time while dead

but no matter how many times i cycle through this will i see my real parents

i feel like humans are just objects like everything else but we get more attached to them for some reason
