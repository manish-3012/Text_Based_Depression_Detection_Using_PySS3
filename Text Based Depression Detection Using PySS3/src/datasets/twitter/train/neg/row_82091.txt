I don't think I can keep this up.I feel like things keep getting worse and the help im getting just isnt enough anymore. I have messed up so bad and I just got out of the hospital 5 weeks ago after an attempt.  On meds I feel nothing without them I feel everything. I'm currently diagnosed bipolar 2. I want to stop taking my pills so I can feel something even if its pain and now that im here I just want to die. I don't have children, or a real job, or money, or a place of my own and im 30.  Im going to kill myself I don't have a date or a time but im guessing within a few months if i last that long.  there isn't anything anyone can do to help. Yeah I have people who love me but i have never felt love or loved someone.  The closest thing i have to love is infatuation which is dangerous. I don't see a point in trying anymore.
