I just need to talk to someoneI have been struggling with chronic depression and generalized anxiety disorder since I was a teenager. I am a veterinarian in a busy mixed animal (both dogs/cats, horses/cattle, etc) just outside a large city. All my coworkers and my clients say then can tell how much I love my job and how passionate I am. Everyone says theyâ€™re jealous of how happy I am all the time. Looking in, it appears I have a perfect life.

Itâ€™s all a lie. Iâ€™m good at the facade. They probably wouldnâ€™t believe me if I said I was suicidal. My career has a pretty high suicide rate.

I hate my job. Every aspect of it. I snooze every morning until Iâ€™m almost late and then at work I count down the hours until I can go home. Iâ€™m so exhausted from faking happy at work that I just immediately go to sleep when I get home. My job requires between 40-65 hours of work a week. I forget to eat a lot. Iâ€™m losing a lot of weight. I want to start another career but even staying in-state for college I accumulated $220k of student loans and Iâ€™ll be paying that off for the next 20 years. I feel trapped.

My anxiety is constant. It makes me nauseous. Everything hurts. I canâ€™t focus on anything. My prescriptions for my other chronic conditions just got re-shelved at the pharmacy because I canâ€™t even get myself to go pick them up. Those diseases are another story themselves. Iâ€™ve seen a counselor before back in vet school but I had a hard time talking with her so I stopped showing up. If I canâ€™t even talk with my closest friends about my problems, how can I talk with a total stranger? I suppose thatâ€™s another symptom of my anxiety. But you guys, itâ€™s getting so bad. A coworker committed suicide last year and I wish it were me. At my last general doctorâ€™s appointment, my entire goal was to discuss my mental health under the guise of a general checkup. I broke out in tears when I asked if he had any recommendations for counselors and couldnâ€™t bring myself to express how severe my illness has become. He told me to call the number on the back of my insurance card and speak with someone about a counselor or mental health provider in the network.

Iâ€˜m afraid to call. Iâ€™ll just end up crying like a child when I try to say anything. Even typing this up under an anonymous account has me in tears. But I feel like I might crack if I donâ€™t do something soon. Because I have trouble articulating my feelings, Iâ€™ve composed an essay of my feelings, concerns, and my goals, however it is extremely personal and I canâ€™t just send it to a stranger. I am aware that I have a disease and I need treatment. But I just canâ€™t bring myself to make the call. I guess what Iâ€™m looking for here is someone to talk me through it, idk.
