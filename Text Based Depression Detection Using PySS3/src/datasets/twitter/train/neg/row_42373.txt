Need help pleaseI've been having a really rough go of it lately, and have been struggling harder than usual to remain positive/not - suicidal (a problem for me the past few years). I know I can't talk about methods but I am ready and keep thinking g about doing it and I'm scared and guilty and nervous and sorry and ughhh.

Sorry for the rant :(
