A girl who likes me says she's been feeling suicidalShe texted me at 1-2 in the morning that she has been feeling suicidal and wants help. I immediately called her best friend who lives on the same street as her and they talked for a while in the night. They said she is okay now but I'm not sure. She hates herself with a passion saying she is worthless and stupid. She also says no one likes her at all or wants to be her friend. I have tried a lot of things to help her but she stays convinced that she is worthless. Any help is appreciated
