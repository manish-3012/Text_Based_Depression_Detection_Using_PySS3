overdosehi guys. im planning on killing my self tonight. I have 390 mg of codeine, 400 mg of benadryl, around only 150 mg of dxm, and access to lots of alcohol. Has anyone had experience from overdose before? Or does anyone know if taking all of the drugs and a considerable amount of alcohol will ensure my death?
