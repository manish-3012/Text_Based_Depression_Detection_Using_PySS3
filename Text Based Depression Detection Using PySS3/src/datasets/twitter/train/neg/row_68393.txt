I dont take life to seriously,And my dad told me to kill myself.I am 13 years old, I failed my finals and now i have to retake them,
recently i found out i have ADHD, and i am taking medicine for it.I somehow dont take life seriously. I always loved my dad and always try to make him love me too. When i went to school for tutoring on my retakes my dad picked me up he started yelling at me and told me I am stupid and I dont know the value of time. He told me that i should kill me self(he said it many times before).I have been getting suicide thoughts before when he said this but now i just shocked.
