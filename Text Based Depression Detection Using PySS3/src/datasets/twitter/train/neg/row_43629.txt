I think I'll do it soonIt's the only way out at this point out of the bullying, self doubt, being a shut in. I have no one that loves me. I feel my time was up when I was seven because thats when people stopped loving me. (I know this is all over the place but try and bear with me) I feel everything is my fault someone gets angry I feel I got them angry, someone is sad I feel I got them sad, someone kills them self I probably drove them to their breaking point.
