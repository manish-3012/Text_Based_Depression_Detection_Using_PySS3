Feel like Iâ€™m the worst person out there at times I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing with myself my councillor appointment got cancelled my best friend saw my scars and asked me while I was on FaceTime with my boyfriend and honestly I donâ€™t think I can be fixed I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m loved nor cared about sometimes it would be so nice to be dead u know? Iâ€™m damaged so much Iâ€™m useless I was pulled out of class today asking if I â€œcut myself â€œ they couldâ€™ve dealt with it better and using a different word for it not oh r u cutting it just puts me off and it makes me useless even more maybe Iâ€™m just not cut out to be alive anymore Iâ€™m being lied to Iâ€™m running back through memories all over again!! And I canâ€™t get rid of it would anyone love me enough if I had a disability? Would anyone love a chubby girl like me? Would anyone wanna ever date someone like me? I donâ€™t think so..always getting bullied always getting it when I get home Iâ€™m now changing and I donâ€™t know what to do I go to bed I can NEVER sleep! I get about 1 hour sleep then I wake up struggling to breath I go to school and have panic attacks I freak out so much Iâ€™m not wanted and Iâ€™m starting to think there right Iâ€™m pathetic that doesnâ€™t belong here I never did and maybe now itâ€™s time Iâ€™m half way from it just fingers crossed itâ€™ll be over soon enough hoping itâ€™ll be my very last day of survival hoping I never have to go through hell again bc I donâ€™t think I canâ€™t make it any much longer ðŸ˜­ goodbye.
