I don't want to be suicidalI fucking don't. I was fairly okay yesterday, but woke up with an anvil on my chest and about a million traumatic memories buzzing around in my head.

Didn't drink. That's something. I know I've got things to be grateful for, but I'm so, so exhausted from the constant pain and bad circumstances. I'm so tired. I know there will be ups and downs, but the ups are not looking promising.
