I just want to stop existing, thanksI ask this every time I end up in the hospital -- why does it matter if I don't want to live? My life is beyond miserable, I'm out of options, my mental health issues and chronic pain are just so fucking unbearable.

I keep getting the cops called on me whenever I allude to being upset on Facebook. And then I get billed for an ambulance showing up. And I'm already broke and you trying to save my life actually just made it harder for me to live. 

I'm constantly going through withdrawal from my meds (like right now) because I can't fucking afford them. 

It gets better? I'm almost 30 and it consistently gets worse and I've been depressed since the second I was born.
