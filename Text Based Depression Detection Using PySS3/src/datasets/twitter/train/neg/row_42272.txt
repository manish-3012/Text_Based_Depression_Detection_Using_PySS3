Backup planDo you feel like this (suicide) is a backup plan? Like no matter what you â€œseem likeâ€ on the outside, in the back of your mind is always a voice saying, â€œor you could just stop. Now.â€

I want to know if everyone has this or if itâ€™s just one of the many signs of depression. 

Like being able to distinguish between â€œwanting to kill yourself,â€ and â€œnot wanting to be here anymore.â€

Iâ€™m exhausted on an infinite level and I donâ€™t want sympathy. Just to know if others feel this.
