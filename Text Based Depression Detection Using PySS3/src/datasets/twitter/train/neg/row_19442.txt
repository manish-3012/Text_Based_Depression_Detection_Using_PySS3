I don't feel happy anymore.I've been failing school, gaining weight, losing friends, being more mean,relapsing every five days, having so much fucking misfortune, ending up breaking everything due to frustration of my misfortune, hell I bet all of are probably gonna down vote this and start calling me a pussy, go ahead I'll be dead oh I'm living the dream. For nine damn months I've been like this, feels like I could just punch someone. Today I got my steam account hacked, my sister gave me her best speakers to use for a while, I was such a damn idiot and ended up breaking it just to fix it. I only got $40 in my wallet, where the fuck did my $250 go? Please I don't want to be in this fucking world, every dick head cock sucker have amazing lives, they have relationships, they have popularity, and they have such good luck. Sure I have a lot of good things but they seem too annoying and I'm trying way too fuckin hard, I feel like I will beat someone up tmr, who knows?
