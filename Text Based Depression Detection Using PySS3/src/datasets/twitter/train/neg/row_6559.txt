Once I get the opportunity after graduating High School, I'm going to tell my family that I'm moving away to "discover myself" or something, then I'm going to kill myself.I have just hated myself for the longest time while also being perpetually unhappy. The only reason I haven't done it yet is because it would deviate my family. So I'm just going to tell them I'm moving away, and I'll end it in the most remote place I can possibly think of to avoid them finding out what happened.
