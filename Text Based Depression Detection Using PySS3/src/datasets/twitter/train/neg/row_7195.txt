I can't do this anymore (23F)I was physically, emotionally, sexually, and verbally abused for almost 6 years. I got out in November of 2014. But since then, I've been having panic attacks, anxiety attacks, and I have PTSD. I'm scared of the dark, loud noises, and being alone. 

I have no money. I work all the overtime I can get and I still have no money. I have to pay for a mortgage and all my bills alone. 

I have a boyfriend who supports me. But lately, my mental issues have been tearing us apart. Tonight, I got scared at a party and went to the bathroom to cry. And he left, walked to a friends house and said he would talk to me tomorrow when he cooled off. (There's more to the story, and we live together. But I don't feel like explaining it). 

I cry everyday. My life is horrible. I can't make anyone happy. I can't make my boyfriend happy and he left me. He won't answer the phone. I've been drinking captain Morgan and I've taken 3 ten mg hydro condone. I have more sitting out that I will eventually take. I have a note ready. I don't know what else to do with my life. I can't stand this anymore. God help me.
