Derealization is taking over now. Suicide increase by 20% and i'm 90/100% to suicide...Everything is becoming more unreal for me now, as i choose to become more depressed. I even forget things, like when you are high on cannabis. I just appear, and think why i'm here, in just a random familiar location. 

I also stopped feeling everything. No more fear, anxiety, anger, etc.

Well the past is gone, fun is gone, childhood feeling is gone, everything is harder now, boring, etc. 

Could anyone relate? Just wondering if i'm the only one like this. I see reality like a 100,000 year old dream, that i've been dreaming of every night, non stop, until 100,000 years. I'm just way to fucking feeling less for anything, basically.
