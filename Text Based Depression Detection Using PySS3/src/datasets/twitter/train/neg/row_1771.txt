Life is a boring endless cycleI'm not sure if I have depression but recently I've started to feel like everything is boring as hell and there's no point in living when I'm going to die anyways. Playing league of legends used to be something I enjoyed but now all I see it is as something to pass time. Every day all I'm looking forward to is to sleep. It is the only period of the day where I feel non-existent. I'm also an introvert and a "pussy". I can't approach girls and have no idea what to talk about if I do approach them. Honestly, even hanging around with my friends is really boring. I don't feel happy when I'm with them and I feel as if I hang around them just to look less lonely. My self esteem is also pretty low, I honestly think that I have no future and will not benefit society. My existence is just a waste of resources, money and time.
