Someone please talk to meI was going to kill myself this morning but I got way too scared. I don't understand why time has to fly by and never slow down. I wasn't ready to leave highschool and now I'm failing college. I don't know what to do. Everything feels so scary. Can someone please talk to me. I might be slow to respond but I will eventually.
