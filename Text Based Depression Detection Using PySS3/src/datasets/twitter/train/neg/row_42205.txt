Why can't I feel happyThat is how I feel. I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m actually at a subreddiy like this but itâ€™s getting worse. Iâ€™ve long felt I was depressed (my entire life), but this is the first time Iâ€™ve actually called it quits.  I love life and the experiences of living, I just hate my own life and would wish it upon nobody. I think the only reason why I havenâ€™t succeeded in killing myself is because of my amazing 3 year old husky. I have to outlive him. But once he's gone my expiration will be soon after. Probably the same day.

There is absolutely nothing wrong in my life with the exception that I donâ€™t fit in.. anywhere. I try to be social, I try to meet new people, but it always fails. I've tried so many different jobs, and education paths, including the military. Nothing ever worked in the long run.  I feel I have a curse on me.  Thereâ€™s only so many times where you can tell yourself â€œitâ€™s not you, itâ€™s themâ€. Iâ€™m long beyond that point.

If you knew all about me youâ€™d probably tell me to shut up my life is fine and wonder what my problem is â€“ and I completely agree with you. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me  I think Iâ€™m a pretty regular guy. Iâ€™m in decent shape, attractive, I make ok money, I have no debt, zero health problems. I have my mom (my dad commited suicide when I was 13) and part of me feels like I'm doomed to follow in his footsteps. Like I can almost understand how he was feeling now. Every day is redundant  Iâ€™m bored to death. I work a job I hate, and then sleep. For what? Whatâ€™s the fucking point? 

Iâ€™ve tried group activities and other things with friends but it always leaves me feeling worse, wishing I had never gone out to begin with.  I canâ€™t tell you how many times Iâ€™ve actually made new friends, only for us to lose touch within a few months. Iâ€™m not a bad person at all. I donâ€™t know what I do wrong. I think I have some kind of social phobia / anxiety. Sometimes I do feel great when I get out and things go good, but those days are so rare.

What brought me to the subreddit and the desire to speak up is lately Iâ€™ve been picking up unhealthy habbits and ignoring my responsibilities because I just don't care amymore. :/

I just donâ€™t feel that Iâ€™m needed or wanted in this world. If I were gone, nobody would miss me.  I donâ€™t matter. With the exception of my husky..
