I just want someone to truly care and to be just a little okay, but apparently thatâ€™s too much to ask for.Title about sums it up. Iâ€™ve lost everything and everyone, but my senior dog and my sick grandpa. Iâ€™ve come to terms with the cold truth that when it comes down to it Iâ€™m just not anyoneâ€™s priority if Iâ€™m even my own and it doesnâ€™t matter because Iâ€™m insignificant in the grand scheme of things. 
Iâ€™m not going to kill myself to spite people although I almost want to. I canâ€™t blame anyone, but myself for making the choice, but I do just want to say that Iâ€™m sick of being abused by other people, working myself sick only to still get turned away, having to slit my wrist to get into a hospital for more than a day or two so I at least get some help, and giving everything, everything Iâ€™ve got only to get nothing out of it if I donâ€™t still somehow manage to lose more. 
Iâ€™m terrified of life getting any worse than it is because Iâ€™m already so miserable I donâ€™t ever want to be conscious anymore.
