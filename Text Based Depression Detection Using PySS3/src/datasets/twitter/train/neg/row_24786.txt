I have talent with no use for them. Always an other option on my mind.I didn't even know about this sub-reddit. 

I'm not very good at explaining especially with a keyboard. But I'll try so you understand what I'm feeling.

When I was a Senior in High School I was given the dream position. School announcer. Monday through Friday doing my thing. Not to boast but I was pretty good. The teachers, students and staff thought so too. I made so many friends because of being the announcer. 

For me, (not to surprise you or anything I just want to throw this out there as well) an autistic 20 year old. Who was bullied all his childhood. Being shown this amount of love, respect and appreciation. School was my paradise, Val Halla, etc.

School ends. And with it. All my momentum, drive and ideas. The week after I graduate. Downstairs family and friends having a party. Upstairs me alone. Having a blank mind. Knowing that I wouldn't be able to do something I put so much work into. The next day I broke. Cried. That was the day I legitimately felt useless. Thought about just killing myself. (I'm a wimp I know)

Just to speed things up. First job was horrible. Second was good but the hours were bad.

I am now struggling to even find a job. It's become so stressful I don't want a job. All my talents and interests have zero possibilities, (I looked very hard for careers with zero results).

My only escape is music and lot's of video games. Lot's meaning I spend about 10 hours on my computer a day. I don't go out with friends. I'm not very active. I like being left alone to spend all day on the computer. Sometimes all night. 

I'm posting this because I feel like people who do have lives have some sort of advice for someone like me. Someone who doesn't have a life worth living.

To anyone, thanks,
