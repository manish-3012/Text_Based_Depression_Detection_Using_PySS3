End of my tetherJust completely tired of existing. It's not so much that I want to die as the fact that I don't want to exist anymore, just sick and tired of feeling completely drained of any emotion whatsoever.

Only reason I haven't gone through with it yet is because I know it would completely devastate my parents, but I'm sick of living just for other people. I don't know how much longer I can last.
