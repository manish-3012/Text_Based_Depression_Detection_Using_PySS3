Please just stop hurting!!I'm trying my hardest to keep my head above water. I've got a history of self harm, but now everything bad is rushing back and I just want it to stop. I've got the means but I'm too scared. I know that the people I want to care just don't. They may have once, but certainly not anymore. I've already lost a sibling and I don't want my parents to go through that again but I can't go through the constant pain of knowing I've screwed up everything, lost all but 2 friends and have almost certainly ruined my future.
