I am about to turn 27 and just feel like an absolute failure of a personI was abused a lot as a child, pretty much turned into an alcoholic in my early teens, around the age of 20 I got a huge anxiety problem, massive OCD and panic attacks, ever since I have been housebound and worthless. 7 years now of just being useless. I am trans as well but too afraid to do anything about it, I started hormones then got scared and quit. I had to move back to my hometown recently due to my gf starting university and us not being able to afford to rent as well as study. Plus me being on Disability Pension makes it hard to afford anything.

My whole family, my siblings, everyone by my age had bought a house, accomplished something. I haven't got a house, I haven't got a degree, I am on disability. All I want is a house of my own, obviously that's not a simple thing but it'd at least make me feel like I have something in my life, I do have my girlfriend and she means the world to me, but I really want to feel like I accomplished something. I dunno, life isn't worth living, I am probably freaking out because I turn 27 in 2 weeks but man, I am scared of always being trapped in a little aboriginal town in Australia and never in the city where I want to be. I swore to myself I could never be in my mid-20s and still be in this town and now I am heading toward my late 20s and I have just moved back. I am useless.
