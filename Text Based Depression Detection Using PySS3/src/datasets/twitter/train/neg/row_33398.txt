Can't keep going like this.I can't go on the way I am. I just turned 18 about a month ago. I got kicked out and I stoped going to school because im so depresses. I just want to end it all. The one person I trusted. Is trying their hardest to hurt me. I'm currently at a show choir competition held at my school. Sitting in the bathroom crying like a bitch and deciding how I want to go about this.
