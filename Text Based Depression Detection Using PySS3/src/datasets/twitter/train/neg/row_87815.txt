The Two year clause is almost up.The two year suicide clause on my life insurance policy is almost over and the inevitable seems to be getting closer and closer. I can't imagine the heartache I will cause but I hope it is some sort of concilation to my family that I waited until I found a way to take care of my financial responsibilities and leave a little extra for my wife to get a jump on life. It is a dog eat dog world and I can't seem to convince people I am capable of a middle class worthy job with my lack of self-confidence and mild cerebral palsy. I do feel like I have fallen through societal cracks as there is not much help for me unless I just give up and try and get on disability. But I'm not going to burden taxpayers. 5 years ago I was more hopeful and could even keep up with others in physical labor. Yet as I approach 30, I can no longer hide my limp. My left side becomes more stiff and my joints ache daily. Everyone says I need to use my head and get a desk job. I've done that and I am prevented from advancement because I am a slow one-handed typer and in pressured interations, my speech disfluencies emerge. Wish I could go back in time and make better choices.
