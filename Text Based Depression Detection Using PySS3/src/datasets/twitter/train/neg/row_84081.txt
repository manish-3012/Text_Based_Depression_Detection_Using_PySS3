I think its my time.I have had such a shitty life and things arent getting better. I have never had a best friend. I have never been able to open up to anyone. Nobody has given me a chance although I am always open to other people. In the past year I have lost so many things. About a year ago I got a divorce because I found my wife cheating on me. She hates me even though I loved her with my whole heart. She occasionally calls me and says things that put me over the edge. Today she called me and told me she is seeing a new guy. I knew that it would happened and I wasnt surprised. She then proceeded to tell me that he looked like me but was better looking and was more fun than I was or ever will be. She knows I have had suicidal thoughts and I don't know if she is trying to push me over the edge. I moved away from her to try to get my life in order, but nothing is right. I live alone in a big city, have barely any human contact, and just feel like things constantly are getting worse. I need an escape from life. There is really nothing holding me back except for the thought of my little brother. My grandfather commited suicide when I was younger and I will never forget that day. I know he will go through the same thing I went through. I can't do that to him, but I can't deal with this pain anymore. I really have lost all will to live and function.
