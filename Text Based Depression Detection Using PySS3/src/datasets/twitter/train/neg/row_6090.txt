Today is the dayWhere can I find decent information to help me decide how and where to hang myself? The choice is made; today is the day, so none of your Christian bullshit scams (that look like valid advice) are going to stop it. It would be better for my family if good advice was out there. But here goes. BTW I am it some punk kid experiencing adolescent angst, and my girlfriend didnâ€™t leave. I am 65 years old and ready to leave. Today is the day.
