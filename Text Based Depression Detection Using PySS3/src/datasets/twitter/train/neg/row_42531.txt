Iâ€™m doneI have tried and fought for nearly a decade now. I have survived three attempts and yet I regret it. I got help and it didnâ€™t last. Iâ€™m pathetic. I donâ€™t want to fight anymore, I just want to be free of this burden. I give up team. Thank you for this rant I just needed to be marked down for something besides my life. Cheers
