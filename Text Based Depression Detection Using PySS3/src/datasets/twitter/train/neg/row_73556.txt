What's the point of living a life you hate?I don't enjoy life, I haven't in years. I think it's stupid to do something you don't want to do when you could simply not do it. I don't want to live anymore, and if I kill myself I won't have to. I don't particularly want to die, I just don't want to live. I wish I could dissappear.

Therapy doesn't help; talking about my problems won't make them magically go away. Besides, not even my therapist understands. People say it gets better but I don't care because right now I'm in pain. 

I truly think I'd do the world a favor if I killed myself. My presence doesn't matter, it wouldn't make a difference if I wasn't here. Nobody would miss me. Maybe two or three people would be sad, but it'd last less than a month and then they would continue to live their lives like before. Plus I wouldn't have to suffer anymore, basically it would be a good thing for everyone. 

I just wish I actually had the courage to do it.
