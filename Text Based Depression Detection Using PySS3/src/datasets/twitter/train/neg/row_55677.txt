Shit happensMan I've been trying to get over my two years relationship and just can't it's been 9 months since we broke up and I still feel so much pain and got my brain stucked thinking of it, I'm just sick of standing it anymore I just want to end this I hate it so much it's so much emotional pain and the thoughts of not being able to do anything are unbearable, just wish this could go away easily I find myself thinking of ending my life often because the memories just won't go
