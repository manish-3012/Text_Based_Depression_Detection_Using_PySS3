People I know have spoken of other's and my "cries for help" with both disgust and disdain. Honestly it's exactly why I want to die.I feel like there's no such thing as empathy anymore, if the general consensus is that we should shame and guilt people we "love', if they don't try hard enough to kill themselves properly the first time.
