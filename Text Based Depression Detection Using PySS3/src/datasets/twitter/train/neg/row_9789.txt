It's been yearsIt's been years since the last time I wanted to kill myself, but I've been fighting mental breakdowns for months now. 

So I'm here wanting destroy myself again, trying to figure out how to convince myself that I'm not a worthless failure of a human being and I don't know how to do that. Everything I say and do is a mistake. I don't know why I'm here anymore. I'm a mess. I'm a failure. I can't keep doing this anymore.
