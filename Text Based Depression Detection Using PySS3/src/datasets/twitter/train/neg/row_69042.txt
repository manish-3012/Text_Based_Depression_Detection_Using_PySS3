I'm so lostIs it true when people say a suicide attempt with anything less than a shotgun is a cry for help? Because I guess I don't want help when I finally go through with it. I'm scared to die. I dont want to either. But this pain wont stop. Everyday is just worthless. I spend it doing nothing waiting for the time when I can enter a blissful unrestful nightmare filled sleep. The only thing keeping me going is the hope that shell take me back. When that Hope's gone, I know itll be a spiraled impulsive decision to do it. Why arent I strong enough to handle a breakup? Why when something goes wrong do I turn to suicide so quickly and so determinedly? I've got 1 month. Less even. When she pulls that hope away, I know it's the day I die. I've already emotionally died. Itll just be a good time to catch up physically.
