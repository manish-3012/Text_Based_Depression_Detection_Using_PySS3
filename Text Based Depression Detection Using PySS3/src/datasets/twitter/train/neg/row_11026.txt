Didnâ€™t think iâ€™d be here again, but fuck itoh wow, its cHrIsTmAs. i fucking hate the holidays. I hate the presents, food, fAmIlY and all the other shit. Something always goes wrong for me or my family. Last 4 years my little sister got strep. This year,  my sisterâ€™s boyfriend is sick, so they couldnâ€™t make it. Everyone else felt like shit because of it. But i felt like shit because i couldnâ€™t do anything about any of it. -i mean, i feel like shit all the time, but,, yknow- I almost passed out three times because of anxiety and im still overwhelmed. And im a fucking dumbass for ordering my friends gift too late and i have no goddamn idea when itâ€™s getting here. We usually call each other n show what we got, which i canâ€™t fucking do because i feel like hell and i dont want that to be seen. I feel like a shit friend cause im never able to do anything cause im fucking unstable. There was so much food for **4** people. I ate **one tiny** brownie and it made me want to kill myself. Theres another reason holidays are hell. My fat ass gets dragged into eating it so that my family thinks that im â€œokayâ€. 
Iâ€™d be fucking bulimic if i wasnâ€™t such a pussy with vomit. I fucking hate food man. Its disgusting. But **of course** i live with an Italian family, because just my fuckin luck innit. Weâ€™ve had pasta **twice** this week. Add today and tomorrow, four. fucking. times. I hate pasta, i hate sauce. I hate living and i hate pretending i dont hate living, just so i can appear sane. Fuck you, and fuck christmas.
