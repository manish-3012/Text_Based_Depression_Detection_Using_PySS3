I'll never be a real manNo matter what I will always be some loser boy. 

I really hate myself, my life, everything. 
I will never be a man, both physically and as a person. I'm really short, I have slender wrists and girls always tell me I have nice, soft hands. As a person, I'm weak, sensitive and lazy. 

I see these other men with confidence, great jobs, hard workers, brave, mentally/emotionally strong and it's very demoralizing. 
I stand next to an average guy and I feel like a kid and inferior. 

I know this is silly, stupid, petty to others, but to me it's a huge deal. It's very depressing.  

I could work out, have confidence, a great career, but that will never change the fact that I'll never feel like a man. And physical attributes do matter in this society, even though people say they don't. 

Oh well. At least it's comforting knowing that when I reach my breaking point I'll have the guts to buy a one way plane ticket to see the ocean one last time. And I'll finally end it all.
