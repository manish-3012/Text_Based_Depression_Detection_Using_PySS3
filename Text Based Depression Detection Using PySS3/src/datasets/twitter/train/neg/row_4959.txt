Happy To Do ItI wouldnâ€™t call myself depressed, but a part of me wants to commit suicide. Not for any good reason, not that there is one, but I kind of just want to end my life out of the blue. It sounds morbidly appealing to go through with some plans I had years ago, orvto just make up a decision at a random point in the day.
