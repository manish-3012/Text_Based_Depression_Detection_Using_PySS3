I think itâ€™s my time to go...Iâ€™m in my first semester of college, I told my mom that I didnâ€™t want to go to school yet because I turned 18 in August and I really just wanted to take some time off but she forced me into school and now Iâ€™ve failed every class Iâ€™m in. Sheâ€™s going to be so mad when she finds out and I honestly donâ€™t think there is any other option than killing myself, Iâ€™m so fucking stressed rn I canâ€™t even think..
