I just can't do it anymoreDay after day the only thing i do is "work, self-harm and sleep", the same as always, it doesn't change even after so many time, i've tried, but the only thing i think of all day is long is to jump in front of car/bus and hope that i die. I just let everybody down, i'm such an waste of potential, but i just can't gather the strength to do anything, if my father saw what i've become, what i do all day, the way live now, he would be so disappointed at me.
