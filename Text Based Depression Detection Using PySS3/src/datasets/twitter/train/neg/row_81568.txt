New medsIâ€™ve been on Wellbutrin for over a year and have been doing well on it with the exception of a slight downswing in March/April. I was put on Paxil over the weekend for recent anxiety and now I canâ€™t stop thinking about my near suicide attempt a few years ago. I was going to jump from a bridge and even though I canâ€™t access that bridge right now Iâ€™m just wondering if I should find another. 
Iâ€™m going to call my doc tomorrow because I donâ€™t want to kill myself right now, but any suggestions on what to do in the meantime? Iâ€™m so frustrated and feel like Iâ€™m never going to beat this and be stable and find a good balance.
