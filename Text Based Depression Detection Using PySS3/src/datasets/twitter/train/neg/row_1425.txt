Suicidal tics and intrusive anxiety.
Dunno if this is the right place to post and forgive me because I've been awake for a few days now .
Ever since my young teens I've had real bad trouble with suicidal thoughts. It's almost like another voice telling that it needs to be done. 

As I've gotten older and my life has fucked up even more I've developed these fuckin weird suicidal tics that have recently began to get really strong. 

I don't think anyone has ever caught me in detail but I've blurted out in people's company before. I just end up loudly talking about how much I want to end my life and it comes out of absolutely nowhere. Most recently I were jumping around my bedroom smiling at the prospect of killing myself. Has anyone experienced anything like this themselves?

I'm pushing 6 days being awake and the other day I took a fuckton of pills and vodka without even thinking about the consequences I dunno everything is a bit fucked
