I really fucking hate studying in college.Apparently I wasn't allowed to even do my physics exam and right now I am not allowed to do my math exam because I skipped many classes in the past and didn't feel going to them. I also absolutely hate physics and math since I really don't understand anything about them. Even though if I was allowed to do exams, I would probably just fail them anyways. So, what is the point of this?
