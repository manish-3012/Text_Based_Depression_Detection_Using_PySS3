Help me save my friendSo my best friend got dumped by his long term girlfriend because of his depression and their dependency on each other for happiness. They were very much in love and she was his whole world. I've talked to him countless times about the future, and staying strong because it hurts right now, but the more time he spends away from her the better it will get, and he seems to be aware of that, but he can't seem to give himself that time, he just talks about how much it hurts and how he can't live without her. He keeps relapsing and texting her telling her he needs to see her or he'll hurt himself every time he starts to get better. I noticed yesterday he had cuts on his arm, and he told me half of him wants to just end it all, because he can't stand the pain of her not being with him again, and I just don't know how to help him, please help me save him.
