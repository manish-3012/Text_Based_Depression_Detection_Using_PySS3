Kinda urgent. Need advice on a situationI'm not sure I posted on the correct sub but I need advice on how to talk to a friend who attempted suicide recently.

I was chatting to a friend just 10 mins ago and I asked him if I could drop by his house tomorrow with my girlfriend. He said "yes, anytime" and then he casually revealed that he recently tried using a jump rope and said that OD-ing is still the best way to go since the jump rope hurt so much. At first he meant that he started working out again and that the jump rope was hitting his shins/foot that why it hurt but when he said that OD-ing is still the best I got the picture. I asked him what made him try using the jump rope and he said that he got low and wanted a way out. He also said that he still wanted to look good in the coffin that's why he didnt like the jump rope.

I then asked him how he's been these past few days and he said that he remembered that he wanted to survive 27 (he's 27 years old). I then asked him what he has been feeling lately and he hasn't responded yet.

Should I just keep talking to him casually? Get his mind off of negative stuff until tomorrow or should I talk to him seriously?

I need help on how to handle this situation properly and not say anything wrong. I'm not sure if this is the right sub for it but I want my friend to know that I'm here for him and I'm not taking him for granted. I'm thinking about just visiting him by myself instead of with my gf since they're not that close yet and maybe it's better that way but im not sure. I'll be bringing him a shit ton of food and maybe take him out but I dont know yet.

EDIT: He still hasn't responded. How do I illicit a reply properly?
