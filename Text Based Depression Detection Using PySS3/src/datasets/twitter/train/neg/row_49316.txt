Life is meaningless, I might be the one whoâ€™s supposed to color in the drawings, but Iâ€™ve straight up been given an empty stack of papers instead of a coloring bookYeah the title is a reference to that one r/showerthoughts post that Iâ€™m not gonna link because Iâ€™m on mobile

I [17F] am currently having probably the worst and longest breakdown of my life. Through my life Iâ€™ve always had periods where I just wanted to stop existing. But right now... right now I just want to kill myself.

I canâ€™y find any meaning in my life and the only thing that has made me happy recently is also the one thing that I will never have. School has been really rough, I donâ€™t have any friends, I donâ€™t see myself in the future, my country is messed up and run by man-children, and the planet is fucking dying and I canâ€™t do anything about it.

Literally the only reason that I can find to not kill myself right now is that the Be More Chill broadway cast recording has been recorded and will drop eventually. Itâ€™s a stupid ass reason but I wonâ€™t die before listening to Will Roland nail the entirety of that album.

I donâ€™t even care that my parents would be sad, Iâ€™m not going to pretend that they donâ€™t care about me, but I definitely donâ€™t care about them anymore. I donâ€™t want to actively kill myself, but I wouldnâ€™t mind it if tomorrow while walking to school a car run me over, just saying.
