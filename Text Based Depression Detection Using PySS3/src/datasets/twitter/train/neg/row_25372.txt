Does one ever truly get a chance to start over?I'm 26 and I feel like I've fucked myself over. Big time. I'm trying hard a new job, I've only been there a month and shit is already hitting the fan. I've got no allies it seems like and all of my friends live out of state. I want to just pack up and go. I have no insurance. I don't have any real social skills and life in general just sucks right now. I don't know wtf I am doing.
