.iâ€™m sorry this is probably unreadable garbage, iâ€™m not good at typing a lot. i think itâ€™s all gonna end soon. 2020 is my breaking point. all my old friends abandoned me all at once just a few months ago, and i think my current ones are about to too. i remembered more childhood trauma too along with my dysfunctional family getting even worse and i donâ€™t think i can deal with this anymore. i truly feel i was born to crash and burn. i havent been truly happy or experienced true joy in years. itâ€™s all fake, like iâ€™m putting on an act for everyone around me. i have no interests. i hsve no hobbies. i have no one who likes me. i have nothing that should be keeping me going. the gender dysphoria, crippling delusions, and untreated adhd is going to be the end of me. iâ€™m at my limit. i dony want to deal with anything anymore
