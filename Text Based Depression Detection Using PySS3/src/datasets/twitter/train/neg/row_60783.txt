I hate myself so much I hope I dieI hate how I look, and I can't control it. 

Im 220 pounds and I hate myself I'm so fucking ugly. I have a huge stomach and thighs and an ugly ass. I will i was 100 pounds at least. But the problem is I think I have BED and i cant get help. I was on prozac and my mom took it from me cold turkey and now my cravings are insane. I beg and Beg for help but she just ignores me. on top of that, she and my brother always make comments about my weight which cause me to get depressed and eat more. 

I hate myself I wish I was a size in the single digits literally i would be so happy if i was. But it's so hard and i don't want to live anymore because the pain is unbearable. I'm so depressed and empty and alone. I hate my life so fucking much. I was raped at 17 because he fetishized my weight. and i've been bullied my whole life for my weight. if i could be 100 pounds everything would be fine but no. the universe had to give me BED, 

I think I ruptured an artery in my neck the other day and I need to see a hospital but i dont care. I hope I die. At least I wouldn't be this disgusting ugly mess. Pretty and skinny people don't get how lucky they have it. I would kill to have a body like that. I just want to die so I don't have to see myself anymore.
