Not Doing WellI hate myself so deeply that itâ€™s killing my drive and my will to function. Iâ€™m worthless and pathetic, but I canâ€™t talk to anyone because theyâ€™ll think Iâ€™m a psycho or a nutcase or both.

Part of me wishes I could be normal, but most of me knows I deserve to be messed up.

I wish I had someone I could talk to.

I just feel sorry for all the people Iâ€™ve disappointed and the waste I am.
