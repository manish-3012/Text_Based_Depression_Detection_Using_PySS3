I just feel like giving up now.Life is going terribly wrong and I really feel like giving up. My parents fight so much I'm sick and tired of it. I try to be strong to motivate my mom, but I can't do it anymore. The only reason I don't hurt myself is because she doesn't deserve any more pain. It's not just my parents though, I also have very bad issues with my self image. It's just so many years of stress and crap have me tired. I know I have mild depression which does't help with anything. I don't know how to stop this urge I feel to kill myself. Help.
