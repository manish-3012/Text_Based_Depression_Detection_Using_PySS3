been thinking of suicide for awhile now but i finally boiled over tonightshit all started back in february when i started going out mainly just to skate and shit. then like my friends started getting more &amp; more toxic. which wasnt great. then covid came round and i started self harming to deal with feeling alone. around this time my perants started cracking and aurguing a shit ton my dad would kick off at me for all the little things and my mam bassically took away all my privacy. like the bathroom no longer has a lock on it she goes through my shit im not even able to sleep or sit in my own room anymore. so like set back to march this girl cheated on me it tottally fucked with my self worth and made me feel like shit. june comes round i meet this boy were close turns out he just used me for his needs and now im known as easy. i started doing pills round this time too i thought it would clear my head but it did for a little bit im on a tolerance break right now and its given me alot of time to think. i want to top myself like i dont want to be here anymore i have no one to talk to i feel so alone and i just want to end it.  sorry if this sounds dramatic or cringey or makes no sense im just tired and sad and just sll of this fucking shit.
