How long is the wait supposed to be for the Suicide Prevention Lifeline?I've been on the chat's website for over an hour and it still says "You're now in line." Is this normal? Shouldn't it tell me how many people are ahead of me in line? I just need to talk to someone about all the issues I'm having.
