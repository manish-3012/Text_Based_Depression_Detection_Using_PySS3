Crash into tree.Iâ€™m on my learners license so I have to drive with my parents in the car. Every time we hit the open road I feel like just flooring it and running into a tree however I have my parents in the car. I feel like stealing the car one night and just going into the country and just crashing it. Before I go I would down a lot of drugs trying to OD so I can hit 2 birds with one stone. I donâ€™t know when I will do this but I have been thinking about this every time I get in a car.
