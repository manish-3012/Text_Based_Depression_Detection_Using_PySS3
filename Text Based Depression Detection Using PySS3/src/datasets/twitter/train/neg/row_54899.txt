Iâ€™m not happy like this..I donâ€™t want to hurt you, I donâ€™t want you to try to cheer me up. I never wanted that, and I never will. My well-being shouldnâ€™t be a concern to you, youâ€™ve got a whole life ahead of you. Youâ€™re a wonderful person, and I thank you for being with me during some rough moments in time. Thatâ€™s doesnâ€™t mean you should help me, that doesnâ€™t mean I want your help and to see you hurt when it dawns on you that.. that Iâ€™m scared and Iâ€™m only showing you surface level depression. Look any further and youâ€™ll see darkness, the darkness can swallow you whole. The few times before, and the moments when I was less restrained with hiding how I really feel. It upset you, you talk about crying.. and creates further darkness and an almost tangible regret.

Iâ€™m not happy with the way things are, and Iâ€™ve told you that.. I know what happiness for me is.. itâ€™ll always be out of reach.. Iâ€™m not a strong enough person yet for things to be different. I want to achieve that happiness, Iâ€™ll always thank you.. but really I donâ€™t want you to do this, or help me. I canâ€™t stand the thought of dragging you down. You deserve happiness way more then I do.
