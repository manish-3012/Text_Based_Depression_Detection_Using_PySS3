Canâ€™t take the stress anymoreI want to live more than anything but i canâ€™t live how Iâ€™m living right now. I have visibly enlarged lymph nodes everywhere which I worry about daily and now I find a much bigger one under my arm. On top of that I have pain everytime I eat to the point where Iâ€™m now in permanent pain (there seems to be like a lasting pain that gets much worse after I eat)I was going to go to the er for it and then get an ultrasound on the new lymph node but Iâ€™ll just end up worrying again bc I canâ€™t get a straight 100% answer for the lymph nodes. I have dreams which I want to achieve and Iâ€™ve always been optimistic all throughout my life. Without all this I would be the happiest person ever but I canâ€™t take the stress anymore.
