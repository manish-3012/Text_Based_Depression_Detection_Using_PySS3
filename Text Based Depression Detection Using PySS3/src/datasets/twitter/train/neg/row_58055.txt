I wanna stop existing.I've recently had alot of VERY stressful events happen to me which has made my life harder than I can handle. I feel like my stress is contagious and everyone around me is slowly having a harder time in their lives because of me.
   
         I've wanted to talk to my therapist many times about how I feel, but I fear they'll think I'm dangerous to myself and others when I'm not. I just want to stop existing. I'm not really suicidal I don't think? It's more of an extreme urge to want to stop the stress and sadness and just leave it all, which probably sounds like I'm suicidal tbh.

I'm not sure why I'm posting this here or at all, maybe to just put it out there in the world and say it out loud (figuratively) for once.  I've never tried to talk to anyone about this mostly in fear of being locked up or judged about my feelings.
