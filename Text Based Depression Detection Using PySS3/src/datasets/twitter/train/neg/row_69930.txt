Weird Coincidences Leading Me HereI got this sudden urge to read a book I read a while back (I read this book maybe 5 years ago). The book had a lot of weird instances where the girl took paths in her life as I have. So much so I have happened to end up in the city where she ended up taking her own life. It's not that I have been seriously considering taking my life recently, but it is a background thought and has been for years. I just have this weird feeling that fate brought me here, and I don't know why. But maybe fate brought me here to end it.
