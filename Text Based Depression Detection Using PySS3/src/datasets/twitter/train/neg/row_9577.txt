Clock is tickingSlowly but surely, approaching every day the scheduled date.  


Still trying to fight every day, trying to figure out a way to live.  


It's annoying to think of the peoples I'll hurt when I do it.   


Those who believe in me. I kinda wish they cared more while I was around.  


There's nothing that can be done to bring someone back to life, but there's so much that could be done to make me hold on.  


And yet nothing's going to happen.  


I like saying all that here. It's like I'm the tree falling in the forest, and no one heard a sound, but there was a sound.
