Is it normal to cry for 6 hours?So, this is my first post, I'm nervous. So, my usual night routine is laying down and staring at our ceiling for hours. I can't sleep, I try to close my eyes and sleep but it doesn't really help coz my overthinking is just getting worse. I've been crying for 6 hours for no fricking reason, nope, I think maybe because I'm always not enough and not needed, feels like nothing wouldn't even change if I suddenly disappear one day. So, I just wanted to ask, is what I'm feeling depression or anxiety? I've been like this for 3 years, it just got worse this September. It's like everyday I feel empty, I don't think it's that criticial but yes, I've done self-harm plenty of times. Suicide is also on my to-do-list, but I'm not really certain if what I'm feeling is depression, coz I can still laugh it out and no one could have noticed that I'm hurting myself or maybe I'm just good at pretending? I'm thinking if it's just temporary or nah? Coz its been almost 4 months. Should I ask for help?
