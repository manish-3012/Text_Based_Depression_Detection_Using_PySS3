One more thing before I go to sleep (ha ha right)I just wanted to say to everyone planning on dying...committing suicide...

I SAW Death himself in the room when  I was at my worst last night.

That was terrifying.

My mom (passed away 2008) and/or my grandma (passed away 2013) had pulled me away from him. I'm not religious but I believe I was saved by them...and that is humbling.

I have a dilemma now. Do I go to the Psych Unit and "play the game" as in tell the doctor I am fine and no plans to harm myself...or do I be honest and tell him if I were in a room with a sharp object or even pills that I wouldn't hesitate to kill myself? I know y'all will say be honest but its causing me inner turmoil and I can't sleep because the thoughts are SO loud.

Sigh. I hate this feeling.

So confused.
