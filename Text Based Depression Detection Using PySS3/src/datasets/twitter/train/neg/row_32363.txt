I feel too disgusting to stay aliveAbout a year ago, my boyfriend at the time raped me for the first time. I was 13 years old and it's the most traumatic experience I've ever had. I felt like I had to rip my skin off to ever feel clean again. It's been a little over half a year since the last time it happened but I still feel as disgusting as I did then. I've stopped going outside. I can't be in normal social situations anymore because I don't feel clean enough to touch or be near people. After about two dozen failed suicide attempts I gave up on trying for a while. And for a little while, I felt like I was getting better. But I wasn't. And I'm too scared to be around people to go to therapy. I can't live like this anymore. If anyone I knew cared I would be saying this to a friend, not to redditors. I'm done disappointing people and I'm done being this goddamn depressed. I think I'm gonna do it tonight.
