I hate the fact that Iâ€™m still alivei hate it. i hate it so much. why do i still have to be alive? nothing i do matters to anyone, i hate this. why do i have to wake up everyday and despise my own existence 

i hate myself so much that im honestly disgusted that im breathing. someone else could put this air to good use. my life doesnâ€™t matter and it never will. i could be easily replaced by anyone. 

im sick, im depraved. i love hurting myself, i love looking at the cuts on my arms and it being covered in blood. because itâ€™s what i deserve. thatâ€™s all im good for, bleeding out. 

i wish i was never born, then it wouldnâ€™t hurt just to live
