Soon...I feel so silly, not being able to talk to anyone. The last few years have been a nightmare. 

I've grown up with metal illness in my family. I've had abusive parents and I'm the oldest our of four, so I've spent most of my life taking care of my abused mother and siblings. 

I married at 19 with the first man that ever showed me love or affection. I'm now 34 and miserable. I have 2 children. And for the last 3 years I've thought about suicide everyday. 

Long story short, we were super happy, I gave up all my dreams and aspirations to be with him, to support him and his military career and when I needed him most to support and love me, i found he had someone else during a deployment...it broke me. 

I was working as a wedding photographer and I loved it so much. It was everything, I was always artistic and i loved seeing people in love. And now I do a wedding and I cry...I'm more than sad. It hurts. 

Now everyday, I pass by a man I loved and live with him just to keep our family together. 

I'm not perfect, after the infidelity...I let myself loose. I didnt care anymore. Which made me feel worse. Because I'm not someone who lies or keeps secrets. 

Right now I'm in love with a very sweet man. He is very successful in what he does, hes genuine and kind, yet I'm still married because when I tried to leave my husband tried to off himself. Now I'm trapped and lost. The only way out would be if I wasnt here anymore...Even though im in love love with this other man, I know he can find way better than me...

I just want to not be in pain anymore...I dont want to be conflicted...I don't want to hurt anyone. 

SO I've decided that soon I wont be here. I talked to my kids today about thier dad finding a new mom. And my sweet C. Will be fine finding someone else. 

Soon...
