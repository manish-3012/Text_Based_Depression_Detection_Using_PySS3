StuckIâ€™ve been trying to form a social life for years. 10 to be exact. 

Iâ€™m 26 and it just keeps getting worse. Everything I try ends up leaving me more isolated than the first time I showed up. 

Things Iâ€™ve tried:

- therapy. Four different therapists over 10 years who have diagnosed me with 5 different things, none of them agreeing

- meds. They help with the worst part of depression, but Iâ€™m still tired and depleteted. 

- asking around. People I know introduce me to others but they never like me. 

- meetups. Same thing, just ending in isolation

- volunteering. Same Deal. 


Iâ€™m not introverted. Iâ€™m not annoying. I like to think Iâ€™m charming and friendly, but apparently not. 

Iâ€™m just tired and done. The more I grow older the harder this shit is and Iâ€™ve lost all hope.
