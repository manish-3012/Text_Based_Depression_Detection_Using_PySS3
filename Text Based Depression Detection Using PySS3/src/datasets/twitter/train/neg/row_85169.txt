Almost 5 years free of cancer, but I wish it took me awayMarch 4, 2013, I was diagnosed with Stage 2B Hodgkins Lymphoma. I went through 8 rounds of IV chemo, and on August 8 I was declared in remission. In three months, Iâ€™ll be declared officially cancer-free. Despite this, I wish the lymphoma killed me.

During treatment, I began smoking marijuana twice daily to help with nausea and pain. It ended up doing wonders for my depression as well. After I went in remission, I kept smoking. Iâ€™m now pretty much dependent on it.

I lost my job (pharmacy technician) two years ago because of a mental breakdown. My coworker was sabotaging my work, deleting phone call records and shredding faxes I had sent and saved. I brought it up to management, who ignored me, and I threatened to kill myself one day in the parking lot, which prompted a hospital visit. 

About eight months ago, I had another mental breakdown and threatened suicide in front of my wife, who called the police, and I was taken again to the hospital. This time, I was deemed 5150-necessary, and had a 72-hour stay in a psych facility. I was boarded with drug addicts and patients with psychosis/dementia, and I feel I didnâ€™t get the help I needed.

I was assigned outpatient treatment, which I completed, and I never followed up with any of my doctors because I always feel ignored. I havenâ€™t been to a therapy session since last October and I havenâ€™t had my meds refilled in about two months.

Iâ€™ve completely wasted the second chance I was given in life. Iâ€™m still jobless, basically addicted to marijuana, and aside from my wife (who works 60-hour weeks to support us), I feel like no one is truly here for me, and even she is starting to break.
