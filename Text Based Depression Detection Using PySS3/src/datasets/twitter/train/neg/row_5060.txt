What's the point of living?I'm anyways probably going to live the rest of my life with regret. I'll hate myself. I made a dumb fucking mistake. I don't have friends. I dont have anyone talk to. I dont think i can take it anymore. I dont want to be a failure. I have lost hope and faith in myself. My dreams are ruined
