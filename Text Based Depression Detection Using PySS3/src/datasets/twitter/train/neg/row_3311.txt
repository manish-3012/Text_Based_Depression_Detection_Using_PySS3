At my wits fucking end!I am 30. Due to my current circumstances, I am completely isolated.  I have no vehicle of my own. The only person I  am around is my partner. I have been in therapy for 7 months, but have had multiple set backs. My partners last words to me were â€œI canâ€™t fucking stand youâ€ and then he left. He has gone no contact with me and is completely stonewalling me.  I have no friends. I am truly losing my fucking mind. I have struggled with depression and BPD most of my life. I have a history of self harm &amp; im haunted by the fucking scars daily. How the fuck do you pull through?!?!? Itâ€™s so hard
