Alone in a crowded room. Tired of BPD. Just let me go.I have borderline personality disorder. It's exhausting. Everything I feel, it's like I'm not strong enough to stand the waves of my own emotions. I'm ruled by them, constantly straining against them so they don't unleash some sort of tsunami that wipes out all my friends, trying to figure out a normal response and pasting that on my face so nobody notices I'm drowning.

And why is it so hard to ask for help? I've been really lucky to connect deeply with a few wonderful people, but I feel like I'm just begging for attention if I talk about this or how I feel like I don't deserve to live. Or that I struggle to see the value in living sometimes. I'm sorry, internet strangers, I'm sort of rambling and not making much sense.

I feel like a prisoner, and the only way to be free is to let go of the life that's keeping me hostage. But to do that, I have to part with everything I've ever loved and that's loved me. I couldn't do that to them. But how can I do this to me? I'll save them from a few months of feeling sad, in exchange I'll go on suffering my entire life. 

I make enough to survive, and that's it, and that's the way the ruling class wants to keep it. I don't make enough educate myself and finish my degree, or move as I please to a place that offers better opportunity--I live with my entire life dictated by a job I hate. They decide my waking moments, they even decide when I get to see my family.

I'm nothing more than a pawn for a corporation, which I could stand if it were just for a short while, if I could ever get to the end of the board and start accomplishing things important to me, but all my energy goes to them and for not even much money.

I'm so trapped. It feels like there's only one way out. Everything is so beautiful but I hurt so much.

I don't know.
