I'm in High School. VENTING. Anyone to talk toI never had friends and never really understood the concept when I was younger. All I think about is wanting a serious relationship with a person and I'd actually have someone, something real. I was abused when I was younger, both ways. My mother left me 3 years ago and just left. My childhood was way worse compared to my siblings as I was abused more. I am doing pretty bad in school but it was kind of on purpose but I'm not gonna explain. I don't like anyone in my family, I always loved my mom way more than them. Last night I cried and wanted to kill myself since I hated life. I did have planes but I don't really care tbh. I did runaway before. There's way more bad stuff in my life especially before. I have anxiety and thought about killing myself a lot before than just yesterday but that was when I was younger. The thing is no one even really knows me at all I faked my whole life basically to everyone. I still feel the warm cloth my mother washed my face with as the times she kissed my forehead when I was younger. Everyday I don't look forward to waking up but never truly did. I'm gay also if anyone was curious or whatever.
