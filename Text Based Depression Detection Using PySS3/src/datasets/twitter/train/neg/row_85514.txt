What is the meaning of life. I no longer have a reason to continue living this lifeItâ€™s been almost 2 years since I started fighting my depression. Every day itâ€™s getting worse and harder to take off the suicide Ideas out of my head. The only thing that makes me feel better is thinking how Iâ€™m going to end my life. 

I'm just a failure, a loser. I'm 25 M how hasnâ€™t achieved anything in his life. I'm a student how's going to be kicked out of University with a big study debt. 
Even im my private life I'm a failure I was never in a relationship because the only one I truly admired and loved, disrespected and humiliated me in public. Since then I lost my self confidence and I grow fears of being rejected. 
I even lost all of my friends because of this depression No one stayed by my side no one cares about me.
Thatâ€™s make me questioning my life. What did I do wrong to end up like this but it doesnâ€™t matter anymore now. I know I will never be happy in my life, I know I will always be alone and no one will ever care about me. 
My entire existence is meaningless and I only have this solution left to end this and to find peace. 
And the best part is no one will ever notice or cares about my death.


The last thing I want to say is: I'm sorry mum for letting you down. I'm sorry because I failed you. I'm sorry because I wasnâ€™t able to make you proud. Please forgive me.
