I've succeeded in making this difficult for myself.I had gradually become suicidal from 2017 through 2018 due to my developing mental illness and worsening drug abuse, and i was well on track to throwing my life out and giving it a first attempt until i met my girlfriend who saved me from all that.

We built a life together, and during our relationship I learned she suffered PTSD from losing her best friend to suicide, I got a new job (after losing my old one) we moved to a new city, she started studying to be a nurse while i pay rent, and things have generally become quite cozy.

The catch is though, Im permanently mentally ill and i still think about suicide a lot. As my condition has worsened its become more and more something i want to do, but on the other hand ive set my life up such that my death would financially, academically, professionally and emotionally devastate another person who has given me everything and who i care so deeply about. I think about ways I can get out while causing minimal damage to her, solving it from every angle like some fucked up puzzle. But damn it, i cant come up with anything. I've trapped myself in a good life.

 I've thought about wrecking our relationship to make her want to leave, but she's very persistent and would know its my mental illness acting out and not me. I'd have to do something that hurts her so bad it she'd have to decide im not worth it, and unlike killing myself i dont have the guts for that.
