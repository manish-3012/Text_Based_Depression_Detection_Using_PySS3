I hate being disabledMy life is so useless, I have a genetic condition that causes poor muscle tone, inability to exercise, and a whole host of problems in nearly every system of my body. I lay in bed all day. And the condition caused autism too. I'm a mental and physical dud. And its a double edged sword to have normal IQ and look fairly "normal". I hate being self aware. Because I can articulate myself well, but I wasnt even able to finish middle school. I look and sound just "normal" enough to get held to expectations i can never meet, get treated like shit, and be called a liar. Ive been depressed since early childhood. Im angry that I was born and ive been saying that since age 5 or 6. They said id grow out of it or that things would get better, but things got objectively worse each year. No psych meds work on me how theyre supposed to because of my weird genetics, everything reacts poorly, causes severe side effects. "Exercise more" to help depression? if I try I faint. Walking is hard some of the time. If I had even one friend or acquaintance im sure it would help, but I cant understand or connect with people and I get everything wrong. I hate having autism and I hate having my body. Im too much of a pussy to work up the courage to kill myself, but I need to so badly because its torture to live like this

Sorry to rant, and I know I have a bad attitude. But all I can do is rot away in bed until I die
