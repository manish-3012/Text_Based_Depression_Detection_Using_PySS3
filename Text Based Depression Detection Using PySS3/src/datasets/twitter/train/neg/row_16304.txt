I wonder how long it would take people to realize I was dead.Iâ€™m away at school right now and I have no friends here. I keep up with some high school friends but itâ€™s few and far between. How long would it take them to realize that killed myself. 

I feel so lost. Iâ€™m taking anti depressants and theyâ€™ve done nothing. What if Iâ€™ll never stop feeling this way? I never thought Iâ€™d make it this far because I thought Iâ€™d just kill myself. Looks like the plan still stands? 

What can I do? Iâ€™m tired of weighing down my friend with my suicidal bullshit and making him feel like shit for not being able to help me. I just want to end it
Iâ€™m sorry
