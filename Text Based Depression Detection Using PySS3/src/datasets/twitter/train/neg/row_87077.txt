just donethis is my second post in probably under an hour but I just really don't have anyone to talk too and this is a good vent. honestly for maybe 5-6 years I've been depressed and lonely and am tired of life, I usually run on what I call emotional autopilot around others were I just act like what others would do (smile, laugh, crack jokes, ect.) but I'm not sure I can go on anymore. I really don't give a shit about life anymore I really only play Xbox and watch Netflix and YouTube to distract myself from what I feel, but even then I just sit there not really laughing or feeling anything. most of the time I feel like a burden and with my family always calling me a dick or I am rude it feels like I actually am.
