Everything feels brokenMy mental health has been getting progressively worse for the past decade and I'm only 18. All my friends are growing up and moving on to college and the work force but I failed my last year of high school and haven't even had my first job yet. I can't stay sober. I've relapsed in self harm. Even if I avoid suicide my substance use and disordered eating will kill me before I'm 30. I can't even imagine making it through the next month, let alone the next year. Everything is so scary right now with the pandemic and all the bullshit going on with the US government. Friends and relatives keep saying they miss me and I miss them too but I can't hold a conversation so there's no point in talking. I'm not sure I can even think anymore. I feel disillusioned with all the things I used to use to make myself feel better. I feel like somewhere something in myself and/or the world is irreparably broken. I just want to die and reincarnate so I can start over and get a better outcome next time.
