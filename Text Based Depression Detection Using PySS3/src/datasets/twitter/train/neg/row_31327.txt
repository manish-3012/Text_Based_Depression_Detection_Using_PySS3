About to turn 21, want to kill myselfBeen depressed since Halloween and no matter what I do I just want to die. I feel like I have everything I have ever wanted but it just isn't enough. I try to reach out to friends but that only makes me feel guilty for making them worry about me. I just want to get some sleeping pills, take them, and just go into some water and knock out and drown.
