ffsIt doesn't get better this fucking sucks!!! I came so close to slitting my throat a few days ago, the only thing that stopped me was a friend sending me a meme completely out of the blue. I'm so sick of the CONSTANT anxiety, I hate being alive, I hate how I'm never enough for anyone around me, including myself, and knowing that I never will be. I don't want to hurt every day anymore, fuck.
