I wish I never made it this farI honestly which I killed myself by now, I hate life, I hate being alone, I hate everything and person toxic in my life, I hate being around... I was exposed to Covid19 start of Dec and I survived that which I really wish I didn't. I just want to be gone I just want all this bad feelings, bad memories, everything gone. 

I just want to be dead....
