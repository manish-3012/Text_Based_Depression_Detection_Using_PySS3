My team leader challenged me to kill myselfIm posting this in r/army also. So im in the army right, Ive only been in 6 months as a 11b. I got to my duty station 3 months ago at FT Wainwright. After getting to my unit I received the normal smokings/hazings of being a new infantry private. I understood it and it only lasted about a week. But this one E-4, im an E-1, decided that smoking me everyday for no reason was the right way to indoctrinate a new member of the team. Getting treated like a piece of shit for no other reason than being new took a toll on me. I started having depression about 2ish months ago and it built up to me overdosing on feb 28th on proprananol. I was prescribed proprananol for my hyperactive thyroid which is another story. So i overdosed 28th got sent down to Joint base elmendorf richardson to be a patient at the bhu. Spent a week there. It really helped i was happier than ive ever been in the army. Mostly because I was away from the toxic enviroment. I got back here yesterday night. Today my Team leader and i were talking and he said he did not believe i took all the pills and that i only took some of them just to get attention. And he then said why would you not just use a gun and proceeded to imply i was a pussy for not using that method. Then babbled off how people in my platoon have gone through much tougher things which I agree with. I guess im just weak. And i asked him then if he was challenging me to kill myself which he didnt say anything and we proceeded to sit in awkward silence. I would just like to hear what you have to say on the situation im not looking to get him in trouble he PCS's in a month anyways. And even though ive only been back for a day i can tell im going to slip back into a depression quickly. My mother and my sister is coming up here on the 26th so ill try to hold off until then
