NormalI have a job, I have my dreams, I have friends, I have everything basic but just I donâ€™t want to live anymore. I just wonâ€™t be loved, I always have that suspicion even my friends donâ€™t love me, I wonâ€™t be rich (actually it doesnâ€™t have any meaning when you got old, when you throw away your university life because of working, your friends has everything they need but you wonâ€™t unless you werenâ€™t working like a 3 fucking year while studying bachelors etc.), and today I realised my dreams wonâ€™t came true. I cannot leave this shitty country, I will always feel like a garbage in my social life and I wonâ€™t earn enough money, itâ€™s just it. I finally lost my hopes completely today. I have no place in here, Iâ€™m useless and I cannot change this even I done everything right and believe me I will fail even if I try. Iâ€™m in the limbo since years, trying to finding lies or stupid thoughts to move on and motivate but letâ€™s be honest, everything is just gonna be worse or same. Some of us born lucky, and sone of us didnâ€™t and Iâ€™m tired to change this. I cannot, and I donâ€™t want to live this inequal world. Maybe it looks spoiled but no, I had to realise this and I did.

I will do it, just I donâ€™t know when. Iâ€™m going to write my will tomorrow. At least New York should now this battle that I lost to when trying to come her instead of fucking kilometers, money, luck, mood and chance. I wish I will end up there but I wonâ€™t if I make it, so Iâ€™m gonna became dirt in this fucking islamic middleeastern dump.
