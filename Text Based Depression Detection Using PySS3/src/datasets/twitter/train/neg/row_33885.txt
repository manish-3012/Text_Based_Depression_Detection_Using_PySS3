Life is AbsurdLife is absurd.  There's salt everywhere and the sun's heat stings.  My fair skin won't last long here.  I've walked a thousand nights searching for the sun so I can live to loathe the next day.  A slave with two masters - torn in half daily from the feet up, neither able to walk forward nor into the shade.  I've laid here in two staring at the sun for months.  My face burns and my eyes are shut - I'm tired.  Nature, more powerful and methodical than Kasparov on Adderall, makes us fight like betta fish.  We're born into suffering with liberation as a belief.  I don't like beliefs - they're top heavy.  I'm tired.  Responsibly, before drifting off, I think to plan my day tomorrow.  Should I learn to walk with just an arm and a leg?  Or do I have skin cancer.
