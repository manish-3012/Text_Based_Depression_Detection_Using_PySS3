Is it normal to feel suicidal if your'e disabled?Im suicidal because im disabled (autistic), im afraid of poverty. Because i think i'm unemployable, or atleast i can't get a decent education and job i think. Because its too hard for me. The other problem is that i have anxiety too. But is it really impossible t oescape poverty if you have no education, and if you're autistic? Am i lost? Or is there still any hope?
