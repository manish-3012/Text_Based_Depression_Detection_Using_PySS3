Will somebody please be my friend?Throwaway account for some strange reason I still care about my image... I don't know either.

I'm lonely and I only have one friend. He's a fucking emotionless machine and more dead inside than me. He's hopeless in the literal regard and I don't understand how he hasn't killed himself. I can't confide in emotions with him. 

I went through a breakup months ago and I really don't know what to do anymore. She used to be my sole friend. She was my girlfriend, best friend, and only friend (had 4 at the time). She left me. I didn't fight it. I regret that a lot. 

I don't know what to do with my life. I just work and go to class. It's hard to motivate myself to do school anymore. I want to quit my job. I dislike my roommate.

4 friends went to 3 with the breakup. After the breakup, I found out one of my friends I found out wasn't. So 3 to 2 friends.

My 2 friends turned to 1 recently again. She was moving on and removing all the darkness from her world.  

I'm lonely and I don't know how to make friends.

I've struggled with depression for over a year. I've been on medication for antianxiety and some for depression. I can't afford to pay for the medicine anymore so I quit well over 6 months ago. 

I'm lonely. 

I'm a shitty friend. I really am. But I'm trying to be a good one. Will somebody please be my friend?
