Homecoming week is killing meIâ€™m slammed with tests right now, I went from a 4.0 GPA to a 2.7 and it just keeps getting worse, Iâ€™m underweight and my mum is taking me to see a doctor tomorrow. I donâ€™t wanna do this shit anymore, but thereâ€™s only an unloaded handgun and I donâ€™t think I could even shoot myself right so Iâ€™ll probably end up jumping the quarry.
