I have no good reason to want to kill myself, therefore I'm shit and I deserve to dieI don't know if anyone else has felt this way...
My life is fine, I have a good family and friends and I am only 2 semesters away from getting my bachelors. I have no real reason to act the way I do and affect them the way I do. I have no trauma, no difficult upbringing, no reason to be such a burden and such a whiny bitch to those around me. This just reinforces the fact that I deserve to die. My friends don't even take me seriously when I say I am feeling suicidal. So I figure I should stop telling them and just do it, it's for the best. I have no justification for being the way I am and to me that means I deserve to die for being such a bad person. Wondering if anyone else has felt this way or can relate.

I feel so guilty that I am even posting this. I guess I am at the point where I just don't care anymore. I am a sick sick person and I should just let natural selection do its work.
