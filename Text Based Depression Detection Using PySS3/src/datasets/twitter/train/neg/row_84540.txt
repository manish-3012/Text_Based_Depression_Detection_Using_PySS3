Does it really get better?Ive been thinking about killing myself for the past couple days, Ive thought about it before but it was never this bad. Over these past three years iâ€™ve lost so many friends, and never got any others, after awhile of thinking its just something that happens, Iâ€™ve come to realize that it was me, and i cant understand what it is about me that keeps driving people away. I feel like i barely know myself and each day i understand my intentions and motivations less and less. At school i seem to be avoided by most people and my current friends and i arenâ€™t super close. Its getting lonelier everyday. I donâ€™t think itâ€™d make much of a difference if i died besides from my life at home. The only people i really count on are my family, and thats the worst part of it, the fact that it will devastate them if i decide to kill myself is probably the only thing keeping me. I have a great family, i have a roof over my head, yet the thought keeps coming back to me.  I feel selfish and weak for wanting to do this, since i donâ€™t have it as bad as others. Im only in middle school so i guess i havenâ€™t lived long enough to see the truth or something, but i just really want to know if its true that things get better, and that it isnâ€™t just something that people say. I donâ€™t have the heart to ever tell my family this, because they will be confused and sad and i especially donâ€™t want that to happen so close to the holidays, but i just donâ€™t think i can wait that long and i feel so hopeless. Thank you for reading if you did.
