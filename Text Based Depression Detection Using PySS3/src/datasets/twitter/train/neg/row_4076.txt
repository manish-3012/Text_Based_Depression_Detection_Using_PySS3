Need someone to talk toIm not sure where the appropriate subreddit is to post this, but this is the closest I can get to of my knowledge. 

I just have so much shit going on in my life and I need someone to talk to just to fucking vent. I dont want to call a suicide hotline...
I used to text to "741741" (a suicide hotline through text) but I haven't had good service through there and they take forever to respond back. 

Doed anyone know of other hotlines I can *text*?
