I donâ€™t want to be dramatic but Iâ€™m not sure living is for meLiving seems like a lot of work. Where is the motivation to do anything in life? Why should I get out of bed? To uphold some kind of meaningless pride? I donâ€™t understand how some people wake up each morning. I donâ€™t understand how some people decide â€œtoday I will complete a difficult task.â€  Itâ€™s very impressive. I donâ€™t want to live anymore, but I feel like Iâ€™m being whiny and dramatic. My situation in life isnâ€™t bad, Iâ€™m just lazy. So incredibly lazy. I canâ€™t even get out of bed. I canâ€™t even eat. I think the only things I find myself doing is picking up a guitar and playing with my back on the bed. Sometimes itâ€™s a little too heavy to pick up. Iâ€™m incredibly unmotivated. Where does motivation come from and how do I get more of it?
