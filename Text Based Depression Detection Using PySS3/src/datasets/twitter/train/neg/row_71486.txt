I just deleted a year worth of self-made music.Making music is one of the few things that makes me happy in life. I had about 200 amateur songs recorded on my laptop from the past year, and I just deleted all of them (on purpose).

Now that all of my work is gone, I feel better about ending my life. I didn't want anyone hearing my songs after I die.
