I fought with my husband and now I'm alone in our apartment and all I want to do is dieI just need some perspective. I know I wont want to kill myself tomorrow, maybe not even 6 hours from now but right now it's all I want and I want it so bad. My husband said he's not mad anymore but he left somewhere, I dont know where he went and I was going to go to work to get away (I'm not scheduled today but we can always go in) and he told me not to because when I'm this upset I could make mistakes. And he's right, mistakes at my job could mean a patient dies. So I'm home and I want to die and I just dont want to feel this way anymore
