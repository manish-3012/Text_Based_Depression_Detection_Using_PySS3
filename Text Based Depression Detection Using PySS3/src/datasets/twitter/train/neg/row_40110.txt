i can't cope with who i am, i'm evil and i need to stop myself before i do any more harmEvery day my throat closes up. Every day I have to find somewhere to hide when I can feel it rising and the tears start coming. Sometimes I don't hide. Sometimes I cry silently at my desk and nobody notices. I go home after work to my little room. I live in shared accommodation but I never speak to anyone. I close the door and cry. I have panic attacks at random times. I can't let myself be near people. I am terrified of what I might do to them. I am twisted and evil. I am psychologically manipulative and emotionally abusive. I don't know how to get by or interact with the world without causing pain so I've stopped. I have been living with constant internal pain and chaos for nearly two years. 
The thing is, living like this is pointless. I have tried to move on healthily. I have read articles about how to forgive myself but they all sound fucking stupid and idealistic and naive. I've been to a doctor, she told me I'm not depressed and I don't need treatment. She refused to refer me. 
I don't know what to do except for killing myself. I will never be happy like I was in the past because I chose to shit all over it and throw it away like it was less than nothing. Now I am a severely fucked up mentally ill woman who is 28 years old but the dark bags under my eyes and my entirely grey hair make me look 20 or 30 years older. I look like a meth addict. Nobody could love me. Nobody should.
What's the point of toiling on through this awful life i've built myself through my evil choices and actions?
I'm such a coward, I don't know how I'm going to bring myself to actually do it. I really want to gas myself but I'm so pathetic I can't even drive. I wish somebody would murder me. Every day, I wish that.
Please come and stab me and throw me into a deep valley where I will never be found
