I've always wanted to be happyI've realized that I've never truly been happy, my childhood was spent with worry and chaos. I wished to have a happy life with every birthday candle I've blown, but that never came. Its become clear to me that I was never meant to be happy, how could I? I'm ugly, disappointing, stupid, fat and every other horrible word that exist. Many times have I failed my parents, the same people who gave me everything, the same people who love me without a motive. I hate myself even more for thinking of just taking myself out the picture, but I still have other siblings and younger cousins, they wouldn't feel sadness for too long. I could be replaced with someone a whole lot better, some one to be proud of. 
Everyday is just filled with anxiety, self hatred, stress and constant thoughts that never leave. I never have energy to do anything, I sleep the days away, I barely eat and drink - it all just feels useless, why feed and grow a person who wishes to go away? I just want to sleep forever and never wake up, god if only it were that simple.
