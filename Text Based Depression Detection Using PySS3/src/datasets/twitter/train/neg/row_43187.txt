I really donâ€™t want to live anymore, my appearance has held me back my whole life.Currently 22, balding, acne, huge crooked nose, and short. Iâ€™ve never kissed a girls or even been on a date. I really hate my appearance and itâ€™s really put my life on hold. Balding especially has really taken its toll on me. Iâ€™ve been on finasteride for 2 years now but I havenâ€™t received any regrowth. I hate going out in public, I always wear a hat, and my skin is always breaking out even though I have a strict skincare routine. Honesty, I just donâ€™t want to live anymore. Nobody respects me, no one wants me. I hate looking in the mirror. I donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™m too much of a coward to actually off myself. I know the whole argument about living for my family, but whatâ€™s the point if I always have to suffer. No oneâ€™s probably going to read this. I hate genetics, and I hate how genetics determine the amount success, sex, and respect you get out of life. Fuck it all.
