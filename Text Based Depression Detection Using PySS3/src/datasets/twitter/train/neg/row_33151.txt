How do I tell my friends I am suicidal?My best friends have been everything to me despite not coming from the same school. I had no friends in school and survived 2 suicide attempts which resulted from bullying and sexual assault which went untouched. I'm glad to have these friends but as of a month, since I lost my job, I'm dealing with depression ever since, but now it's gone to the point where I am hopeless because no matter what I do, I will always end up as a loser. We have great moments and tell jokes at each other, but my friend has just laughed at me for something that is causing my suicidal thoughts and crossed the line. Me being a loser, sums up my life! Why the fuck am I alive if your own friends do this to you?

Why is the world so mean? Why the fuck nobody cares?! I live to regret staying alive, I should've died 7 years ago. The way it seems, my ashes should be put in the sewage because nobody cares about me, not even my family. My family have done all they could to get me here today and I'm glad for that, but they have barely helped me with my social life ever since I started school. Maybe I shouldn't talk no more, I should make it 3rd time lucky and do it!
