I have my method, I'm almost ready.I've just decided on my method. Once I'm finally ready, I'll go to the pharmacy, buy a bottle of insulin, and inject a few hundred units. I'll go hypo and never wake up. It will be completely painless, I've already accidental my went hypo before. My life has completely went to shit, I've lost everything in the past 3 months, and think of suicide basically every minute of every day. I wish there was an other way, I wish I could live the life I had, go back in time.. But that's not going to happen. My time is coming soon.
