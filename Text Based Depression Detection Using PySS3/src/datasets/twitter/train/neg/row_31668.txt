x-post from /r/depression "How do I talk to my doctor"I've been suffering from crippling depression for the past 8 years. I'm 26 years old with no hopeful future in sight. I'm tired and every day I think of taking my own life. The worst part is that I pretty much stopped taking care of myself physically as well as mentally so I'm in bad shape. Overweight, sickly, and with poor hygiene.

Something inside made me finally try and fix this before I do something I can't undo, yet I'm terrified about talking to someone. I have an appointment with my doctor in 4 days and I was planning on brining it up but I don't know what to say or even how I'd broach the topic without coming across as a crazy person. I know I need to speak to a psychiatrist but I think the doctor might be able to point me in the right direction? 

Am I doing the right thing? Should I even talk to my doctor first? How do I even discuss it with him? I'm so scared of this appointment that I can barely sleep. I'm just worried that there's nothing I can do to fix myself, I don't even know where this tiny sliver of hope came from or if it can even save me.
