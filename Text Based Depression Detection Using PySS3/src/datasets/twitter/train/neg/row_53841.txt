Has anyone found the one reason to keep living when you hate your life and it s not gonna get better?Seriously, the only thing keeping me alive is the fear of pain. No, it s not gonna get better any time soon and there is nothing I can do about it. No, I can't go to a therapist rn and when I went it didn't help me.
