Pressures as the youngest child nowMy parents never really paid attention to me growing up and didnâ€™t put much effort in my academics. They focused their time and resources on my older sister who was a young prodigy. I struggled with this initially but I learned to like my overlooked status because I couldnâ€™t handle the pressure they put on my sister.

Although my sister is very smart and got good grades in HS, got into competitive college programs etc, she chose to go to a different university of my parents choice. She also now has declared a humanities major (philosophy) and has prioritized her part time job much to my parents dismay. They are extremely disappointed as they always thought sheâ€™d grow up to be a doctor. My dad always seems so nostalgic of how â€œsmartâ€ and she used to be and it breaks my heart.

As the back up child I never thought I had to step up before. After years of slugging along I donâ€™t think I can live up to my sisters lost legacy. I wasnâ€™t meant to become a doctor. I hate the position I am in right now. My mom wishes they stayed in Bangladesh so we would have been more academically driven and brought more honor to the family.

I know my failure is inevitable and Iâ€™m okay with it. But I canâ€™t live to see my parents disappointment of two â€œfailedâ€ kids. I just want to go to sleep now and not have to worry about this weight.
