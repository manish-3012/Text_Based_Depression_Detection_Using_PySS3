I feel empty anger, and I don't know how to get rid of it.I feel anxious and angry all the time. Little things set me off and I hate that. I want to hang out with my roommates (friends) without seeing red. Sometimes I just feel like I've been kidding myself into thinking they actually like me, and that they are just hanging around because I'm useful. It would be so much easier on every in my life if I just didn't wake up in the morning. I just want to stuff my face with the foods I love and then just pass away without any pain. 
But I'm too scared to leave my fiance. He's the one person I know wants to be around me, but sometimes I feel like he would be better off without me.
