Last night, I gave myself permission.I chambered a round in my revolver and spun the wheel, perhaps practicing and building up the nerve.

I've been wrestling with this for years. I've been alone for so long, and ghosted by so many women I was interested in, I don't want to feel this pit in my stomach anymore. I'm tired of having to put up a facade of confidence when I'm scared to death for fear I'll no longer be attractive to her. I'm tired of waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm tired of being so goddamn scared of being alone for the rest of my life.

I've decided that if I really do want to go this route, I have my permission, just so I don't have to keep feeling this awful whenever I get even remotely close to someone, only to watch as they lose interest and vanish -- even after promising not to, even after I've remained aloof.
