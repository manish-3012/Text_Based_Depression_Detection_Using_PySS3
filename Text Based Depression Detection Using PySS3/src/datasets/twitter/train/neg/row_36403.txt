Literally waiting to die
Im assuming like most people on here, I don't know where to start. "Please excuse the throwaway" seems to be popular, which it is so please do. Also, I already see a therapist so please no, "you should get help." Over it.

I already know when and how; its the only thing that brings me solace. I've been familiar with death since a young age and would really rather accept/force it than the alternative. Obviously I'm hurt/depressed/anxious and I have been managing for 26 years. I don't think I can manage anymore. The only problem is that my brother died 4 years ago and I can't put my family through that again. Although I'm not actively trying to kill myself, I'm becoming more reckless with my daily actions and decisions in the hopes I will "accidentally" die. I know it's pretty much the same as just doing it, but I'm pretty super at keeping up the happy-go-lucky faÃ§ade and wouldn't want my family thinking anything different. Four years later and they still blame themselves for my brothers clearly accidental overdose. I'm essentially waiting for my immediate family to die so I can also. I don't know. 

This was written well, but then it deleted, just what I need when posting to r/suicidewatch
