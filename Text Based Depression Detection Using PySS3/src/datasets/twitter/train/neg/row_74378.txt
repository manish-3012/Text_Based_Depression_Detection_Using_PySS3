18 and thinking about suicideI have autism and have been through a rough childhood life. I am now living alone and sometimes I still act aggressive like a toddler. My mom doesn't allow me to work because she claims it will ruin my Social Security payment of $200-$300 a month. However, my dad, completely different, he said he wants me to work because I post too much on social media and he thinks I should get laid. I haven't found any friends and I have only been living in my city for two months.

My mom also doesn't want me driving because of my behavioral issues that still affect her. I cannot even do the things that most 18-year-olds do. My mom told me that I'm not most 18-year-olds because I'm autistic. Recently, I threw a huge tantrum outside of the house when I was told my yellow shirt was wrinkled after I told her I didn't see it was, and she said ohh it ok its just constructive criticism and I didn't believe in that bullshit. Another time was over a month ago when my mom's second husband (my half brother's father) yelled at him when he was calling me when I thought he yelled at me, and I immediately yelled and run away from my door and "knocked" (actually banged) on a neighbor's door and he was threatening to kill me and call the police, and I called him the n-word when my mom was on a phone call with me (note: the neighbor is white) and she said oh its ok calm down.

My soon-to-be-former step dad is really aggressive, closed-minded, violent, extremely sexist and homophobic, and not racist (but his family talks shit about my mother and anybody who is black or Mexican). My step dad's brother and his wife used my mom and reveal secrets about other people, so my mom won't let my brother near his cousins anymore.

My mom's family and my stepdad's family consists mostly of Armenians, including those of Lebanese and Syrian birth. My dad's family also consists of Syrians, but also Jordanians and Palestinians.
