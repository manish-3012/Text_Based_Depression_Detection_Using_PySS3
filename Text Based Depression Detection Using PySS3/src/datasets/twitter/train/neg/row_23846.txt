I feel old and worthless, I hate not being attractive anymoreWhen I was younger, I was diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder. I'd spend hours looking in the mirror because I liked what I saw, I was obsessed with my appearance and proud of it, I seeked professional help because I wanted to stop looking in the mirror all the time, I was happy to look that way and I was happy to be confident, but that obsession was obviously not healthy and I wanted to get rid of it and lose that habit. Today I look at my old pictures every day and I wish I still looked like that now. I want that nose, that jawline, everything back. Unfortunately, I don't. I look in the mirror and Isee an old, wrinkled, fat lady. It's hard for me to accept that I'm not attractive anymore. I feel even my husband isn't attracted to me anymore, which is understandable. I have two sons and I feel selfish when I think about suicide.
