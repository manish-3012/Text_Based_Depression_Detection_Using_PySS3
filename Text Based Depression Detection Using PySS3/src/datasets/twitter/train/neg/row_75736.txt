Why?Why do people always kick you when youâ€™re down? 

I posted on here earlier expressing how I just donâ€™t want to do this anymore, and someone PMd me wanting to talk. We chatted I thought they were just concerned for my well being but it turned on that person was just preying on me while I was vulnerable. He asked me if I wanted to be his submissive and that he could make me happy if I did. Just so unbelievably over the people in this world. Iâ€™m sick of people always having some agenda. They throw you out if youâ€™re not beneficial to them.
