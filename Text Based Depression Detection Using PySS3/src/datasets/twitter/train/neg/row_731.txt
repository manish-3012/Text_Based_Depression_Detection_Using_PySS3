A conversation we could both benefit from. I myself am not suicidal. But I have been before. 
I'm here to talk to whoever would love to talk to someone.  
I'm a 22 year old female who has been blessed with good opportunities in life. I had a terrible bout in high school where I felt I went insane. I felt I had no control over my emotions, thoughts, and at times my own actions. I was put on medication and was almost sure I self-diagnosed myself with BPD. Fast forward a few years and I quit the meds and am mentally stable, even truly happy. 

But the last month or two things have been dwindling it feels. I have always been a daily bud smoker, but my alcohol consumption upped and I'm feeling best when asleep. This morning I woke up feeling empty, nothing. I couldn't get myself out of bed and had to call into work. I spent all day sleeping because being asleep is almost like not being alive... a small coma. I wouldn't consider suicide these days, but also some days I really wouldn't mind not being alive. 

I'm a wonderful listener and a very open person. If you feel the need to speak with someone, I would love to give you company and support.
