Made it out of my 1st semester of college just barely scraping by with the gpa I needI completely isolated myself and have reached new levels of social anxiety and depression. Didnâ€™t attend class because lectures do nothing for me, instead watched Khan Academy. I devoted all the time/energy I could to schoolwork and still barely made it through. 

Which means Iâ€™ll have to do this same this upcoming semester. I will probably end it, I canâ€™t take anymore stress
