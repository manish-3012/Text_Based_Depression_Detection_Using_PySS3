Does it just completely demoralize anyone else that no one in the media cares?Everyone's so quick to jump to red herrings like gun control so they can push their political agenda and they don't care about real problems.  I think that the incredible increase in inter-connectivity in the world is allowing more people to speak their mind but no one is willing to listen.  The only time people listen is when bodies drop.  Then people glamorize them and make it a competition in a way to see who can shoot more people.  I know it's really messed up, but I think the only ways that any of this will change is if someone shoots up a news agency, or people start to care a lot more about, and listen to, youth, not just in America, but around the world, are hurting.  I personally don't see the latter 
  
Those are my thoughts.  I'm so glad this Subreddit is here.  Let me know your thoughts.
