Feeling oddly calm leading up to tomorrowI'm gonna write my will, and give all my stuff to my cousins. I'm going to go on a bike ride and when I get home play all my favorite video games, listen to my music, watch my sports highlights from when my life had meaning to it, and once my grandparents go to sleep I'm going to take a lot of pills, whichever ones are available. It doesn't matter if I feel pain, I'm not even worthy of feeling it
