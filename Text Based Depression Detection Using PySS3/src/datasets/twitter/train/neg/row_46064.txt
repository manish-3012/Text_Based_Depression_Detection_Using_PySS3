I don't know what's happeningThe past 5 years have been living hell for me . I've been struggling with my mental health .
I have so much on my mind  that causes me to have anxiety attacks at time's . I recently had a break down and i started selfharming which I have never done before . I still can't explain what happened to me that day I really wanted to kill myself . There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about suicide . The thought of harming myself gets stronger. I have no one to talk to about my feelings or what I go through I've always been alone . It's scary to me not knowing if I'll get through every year that passes .
