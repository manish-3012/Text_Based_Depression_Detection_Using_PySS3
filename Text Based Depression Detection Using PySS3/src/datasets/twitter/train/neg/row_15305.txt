Well, this is it guysFinally brought myself to learn how to tie a noose, and I have a tall enough tree to hang from. 
This really is it, no more disappointments, or bad feelings, or anything, and Iâ€™m ok with that
Iâ€™ve got this far and donâ€™t want to leave my self â€œhangingâ€ so to speak 
Iâ€™ve really had enough of the whole life thing, 16 years changes a person, and it really changed me. 
Iâ€™m just going to do it, whoâ€™s to stop me?
