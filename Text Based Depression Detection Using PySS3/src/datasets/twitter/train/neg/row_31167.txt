Have depressed feelings and suicidal thoughts.What's up?I am making this post in hope of finding some help..First of all,i am a 16 year old boy who absolutely loves his family,football and until now has has goals for the future and motivation to work hard for them but about a month and a half ago i remembered something bad that i have done.I was about 13 years old i think and a friend of mine,he was a boy aswell,was trying to persuade me into having sex with him.I still don't know what i was thinking and did it.For a few days i think we were having sex and i wasn't realising what i was doing.I continued living my life normally having forgotten about it until about 1 and a half month ago i remembered it and it shocked me.From then until now i have been thinking about my future and how guilty i have been and will feel about it.I can't imagine how my friends and family would react if they knew it.There is no way i will tell them just because it will make them so sad,but on the other hand i cant continue living sharing such a secret with just myself.For a lot of you it may not seem such a big of a deal but trust me for me it is.I wish i could delete it from my memory or even better go back in time and not make that mistake.I just cant stop thinking about it.The other reason which is making me feel soooo horrible are the thoughts that i am having for life in general.I just don't have the motivation to do anything and nothing seems to have a meaning.I imagine myself of going on with my life and doing all the things that are considered fun and exciting but none of it excites me.Note that i have been eating a lot of food and i want to sleep a lot more than before.That is all i wanted to say.Please,i am begging you,if you can help me in some sort of way do it,if you know something that will probably help me please tell me that.I cry everytime i think of the results of my suicide especially in my parents and i don't want to do it but on the other side i just can't keep on living with feelings like this.Anyway,thank you for reading and i am sorry for any mistakes made as English isn't my natural language.
