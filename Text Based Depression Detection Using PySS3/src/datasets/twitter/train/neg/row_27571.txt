[T-139] I sold my gun todayI think I'm going to use this account as a journal of sorts now. These are the last 139 days I'll ever have, so I figure I should have something to say about each of them, even if no one ever reads it.

I was originally planning to go by gunshot, but decided that I didn't want to leave that kind of cleanup and didn't want to be responsible for losing everyone else their gun rights in the future, so I've switched my method to an exit bag instead. I sold the gun, maybe someone else will have fun with it. Put the proceeds in a trust for my nephew. Maybe he'll have better luck here than I did.

I hope everyone else's day went alright.
