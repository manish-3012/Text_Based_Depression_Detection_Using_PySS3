I can't stop crying and I need help to just calm down. I don't knowI am male, 21 years old and have had major depression since at least 16. I have been surviving okay but my girlfriend who I love very dearly recently left me. She left very suddenly and with little explanation, almost 2 months ago now, and has made it pretty clear we have no chance of dating again. I have controlled my sad feelings for most of the time but lately I have been having episodes of severe depression/anxiety where I just sit in my room, cry uncontrollably and just kind of writhe in pain. I clench my fists and sob in anger/sadness and it's just out of control. I really don't want to call a hotline to talk to someone about it, even if I wanted to I would probably be too loud (I live in the guest bedroom of my grandparents house and don't want to alert them to anything more about my depression.) I am not planning on suicide, but it runs through my mind day-to-day, hour-to-hour. I don't know how to control these fits of sadness and I'm worried I will think about suicide more and more as an option to end this behavior. I am really afraid of being taken away to a psych ward or something like that because I just don't know what to do with myself. Also I am in therapy but it is only once a week, for one hour. I really feel like I need therapy every day, maybe multiple times a day. That is just how depressed I am. I am on Wellbutrin but have only been taking it for about a week, and haven't really felt any effects from it.

TL;DR - How do I deal with fits of depression, nearly non-stop crying, seething in anger, etc.? Thanks
