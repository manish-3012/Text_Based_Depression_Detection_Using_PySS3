a bit of a trainwreckit feels like no matter what i do, who i try to be around, thereâ€™s just this pit inside of me, screaming about all the ways iâ€™m not enough. iâ€™ve asked for help,, sought counseling and medication and al the things youâ€™re supposed to do, and still all i want seven days out of ten is to carve out my own heart. sometimes it gets better, but iâ€™m so tired of slipping back down the same slope. i just wanted to put this out there, and know that at least someone of you know exactly what iâ€™m talking about, that you wonâ€™t read this and get this look in your eyes like â€œhere we go againâ€.
