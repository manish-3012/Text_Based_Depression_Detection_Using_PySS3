I think I'm finally ready to admit that I can't do this on my own.A week ago I got really drunk and let my new gf (4 months) see my dark side. She knew I was depressed, but not to the extent that I am. I told her the real reason why I keep a loaded shotgun next to my bed. It's not because I'm worried someone will break in, it's just that having it there and knowing that I could do it at any time kind of relaxes me and keeps me from actually doing it. She's a good woman and she's willing to fight me for me, although she doesn't understand what's it's like to be this way or why I can't just "be happy". I've tried to explain to her that my body doesn't produce the right chemicals in the right proportions to be happy, but as someone who doesn't live in this reality she can't understand what it's truly like. She loves me, I do believe that. About the only thing I believe these days

When I was a kid, my parents took me to a child psychiatrist because my teachers thought I was slow. As it turns out I was just bored out of my mind. I remember her asking me about my life and if I was happy. I remember having these kind of feelings then, but knowing that if I told her I thought about suicide things would only get worse as my parents freaked out trying to fix me. She retired when I was in high school, but still took select patients at her home. I went there 2 or 3 times. I recently stumbled across her name searching for local psychiatrists. Apparently she started practicing again, but still only sees kids. I've been thinking about seeing if she would see me, if only for a consultation and referral. I haven't seen her in over 15 years, but I think having someone I already know and have a connection with and someone who already knows me (at least a version of a younger me) would be the best place to start. 

I want to be happy.
