i have never been this suicidal in my lifein 18 years i have never thought about suicide as much as i have these past few months. itâ€™s like itâ€™s the number 1 thing on my mind all the time. i donâ€™t have any goals anymore. my dad doesnâ€™t understand what iâ€™m going through and he really doesnâ€™t even try. i have no idea who i am anymore, i look in the mirror and donâ€™t recognize myself. i am struggling and nobody seems to notice. i have my plan ready to go i just have to stop being such a pussy and just do it. i cannot continue like this. itâ€™s just agony. 

(i donâ€™t care about the grammar and punctuation)
