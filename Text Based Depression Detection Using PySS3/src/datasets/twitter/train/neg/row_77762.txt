A roller coasterLifeâ€™s a roller coaster and I desperately want it to de-rail, I canâ€™t handle it the flood of emotions. I hate my mom, Iâ€™ve told her I want to kill myself multiple times and sheâ€™s done nothing about it, I tell my dad and he wants to fix it immediately. I hate to sound as edgy as I am but my mom legitimately does not understand me and I want to die for it, 4 years in the hell of a household Iâ€™m living in is awful. My dad doesnâ€™t have a fucking job and he lives separately so 90% of the time itâ€™s hard to talk to him, having four brothers would be nice if the one I shared a room with didnâ€™t get fucking kicked out of school for having weed then not gave a shit and continued to yell at his games, his at a new school now but at least he canâ€™t get his hands on weed. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because apparently inhaling carbon monoxide is painful and thereâ€™s a vent in my garage leading to my room and I donâ€™t want the brother I share it with to die, he may be annoying obnoxious and ignorant to the severity of his actions but he deserves a life because heâ€™s willing. Iâ€™ve wanted to die since the 5th grade and I had a dream about suicide in third so maybe earlier but I canâ€™t handle anymore I donâ€™t know how I havenâ€™t broken down in school. Iâ€™m just hoping high school is better now because Iâ€™m about to fucking lose it if I havenâ€™t already. I donâ€™t want to hurt my family but I canâ€™t take it everyone deserves a life but I want to finally take the entire thing into my own hands. I honestly hope no matter how selfish this is for a shooter to show up so I can run into him and try to die a hero if I do anything. Iâ€™m impossibly scared at the thought of dying but also enticed by it. To re-iterate thereâ€™s nothing worth living for besides preserving the sanity of my parents so my mom doesnâ€™t force any of my other siblings to suicide. But I think my younger brother might end up doing it while Iâ€™m in college. I think he might resort to carbon monoxide with no one there for him
