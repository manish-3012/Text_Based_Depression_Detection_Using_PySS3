Iâ€™m insane and afraid to ask for helpI feel like I donâ€™t belong anywhere. Nobody really loves me. Each relationship I have with friends and family ends bad because Iâ€™m a terrible person. I have frequent psychotic symptoms and Iâ€™m afraid that Iâ€™m going to kill myself. Drugs are the only thing that make me feel ok. I just want to stop feeling so lonely. I want to overdose sooner than later. 

To be honest Iâ€™m not even sure why Iâ€™m posting here. Deep down I know nothing will help and my time is coming up.
