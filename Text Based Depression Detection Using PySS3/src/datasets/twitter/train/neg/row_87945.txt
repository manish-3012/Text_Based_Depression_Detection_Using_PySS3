Car crashI am a mom of three. I love my life and my kids. I have high high blood pressure and deep deep deeep depression. I can not convince myself to take my Paxil or my blood pressure medicine. All I want to do is get on my car alone and drive. Fast. Very fast and hit a tree. I feel like itâ€™s about to happen. I donâ€™t want to die. But I feel like itâ€™d be best.
