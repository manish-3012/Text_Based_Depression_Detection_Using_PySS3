More on my mindSoon to be a drop out. Always ended up eating my words. No real home to go to. Mom chose abusive step dad over me. Gained weight and ashamed of myself to a point where I didn't go to prom because I didn't want to feel like a fat fuck dress shopping. Depression. Anxiety. Cut myself off from most friends. Don't see things getting better. Future bleak, and wondering if it's worth it.

Not particularly suicidal... But it's been on my mind a lot more recently. Last week wasn't in right state of mind and took 7 Asprin. Was trying to, but stopped when I came to my senses.

At the end of my rope.
