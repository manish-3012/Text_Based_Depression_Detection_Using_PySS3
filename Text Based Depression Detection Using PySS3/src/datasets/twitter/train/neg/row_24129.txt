Can anyone relate?34 , single, due to covid I lost my job and moved back in with my parents . It seems all my friends and everyone around me has their shit together , a good job, their own house , married or a partner , kids, good social life. I havenâ€™t accomplished anything this year, Iâ€™ve just lost everything and back to where I started . This is not where I thought I would be at this age and I canâ€™t see how I can improve this anytime soon if at all. All I want to do lately is stay in bed and feel shit. I guess I just wanted to see if anyone else out there was in the same situation?
