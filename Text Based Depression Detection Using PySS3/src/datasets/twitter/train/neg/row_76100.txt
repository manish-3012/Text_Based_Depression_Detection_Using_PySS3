Iâ€™m sick of living the exactly same day every day, it looks like Iâ€™m stuck in a nightmare.Ever since I lost my mom Itâ€™s exactly the same every day, I wake up, have some breakfast, and then go about the day, wanting to die every second... Death is all I see for my future, and honestly , nobody would give a fuck if I died today. Thereâ€™s no hope left. Nobody loves or cares about me. Iâ€™m a failure, I canâ€™t even kill myself, I failed the last 2 times I tried with pills. But soon Iâ€™m sure I will succeed in doing it with a more effective way.
