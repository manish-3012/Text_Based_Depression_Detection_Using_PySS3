Losing my battle with BPDI was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder early last year, got onto a Ketamine Trial for Suicidality, and after a year of treatment, I felt like a new person. I felt like I had a life back. 8 weeks after the trial has ended and I feel as though the effects of the ketamine have worn off and Iâ€™m back in hell. 
I canâ€™t live like this. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m never going to escape this hell. I wish I could just go without hurting anyone.
