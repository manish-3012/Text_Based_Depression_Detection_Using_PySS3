I canâ€™t go on anymoreEvery time I think things are getting better I keep getting dragged back down to rock bottom again. Iâ€™m so young and i feel like my life is already over

Iâ€™m a failure in every aspect of my life. Everything I once enjoyed has been ripped away from me. People who I thought I could trust always end up using and abusing me.

The pain is just too great. I know thereâ€™s people that care about me and Iâ€™m probably selfish but I canâ€™t take this anymore. Itâ€™s all too much.

Years of therapy and countless medications havenâ€™t done shit. I just never get better no matter how hard I try. Why the fuck should I keep going if Iâ€™m just going to be in searing emotional pain the rest of my life. 

I just want to leave...
