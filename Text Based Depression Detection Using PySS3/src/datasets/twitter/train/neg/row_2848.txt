Worthless shit with nothing ahead of meI have come to the conclusion that i will commit suicide and that soon, and the reason for it is that i have absoloutely nothing ahead of me.

I am absoloulely nothing, i'm not smart, can't sing, act, dance, draw, good at sports nor anything. And on top of all that am i very ugly (big nose, acne, fuckdp up face honestly) and iam not even tall or anything . I don't have a single thing do live for and that's making me even more depressed because i feel like there's no place for me in this world. Nothing can make me happy when i always will know that i am ugly and that nowone ever will even consider wanting to be with me and i am not really sure if im gay or not.

I actually made myself an promise that before i would kill myself was i going to ask a girl i liked out, but she.........bye
