Help. I think about ending my life regularly but have no justifiable reason.I donâ€™t know where to go. 

Twice maybe three times a week I think about ending my own life, the way I would do it, how and when, in detail. Iâ€™m an outwardly confident 24 year old man, 6â€™1, well built, tattooed, with a good history of partners. Why do I feel this way? Whenever I face an issue, I feel like taking the easiest option and it just doesnâ€™t make sense to me. I understand peopleâ€™s plea for help, when they feel reason, but I canâ€™t understand my own.
