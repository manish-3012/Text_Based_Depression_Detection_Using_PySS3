I accept a lonely deathI just remembered that sex and relationships exist, and that I will never get to that, due to a load of reasons. But, I just, don't even think about it a lot. The few things that I care about, are some coping mechanisms that keep me alive, and I even struggle with using those properly. So, uhm. Idk. I guess it's just a fact that I will die alone. And nah, I can't even date people. I'm a uneducated trashy "tranny", so my chances at meeting people casually are minimal at best, with the only solace being that I don't live in russia.

But it still makes me consider to hang myself, I'll be honest. Cause I'm a lowlife freak and all. Sometimes I dehydrate myself on purpose, or set myself up for a sunstroke, just so that I can forget my pathetic existence for a while, at least. Lol. Thinking bad. I wanna die...
