Does writing notes help?I haven't decided one way or another yet, on if I'm actually going to do it or not yet.

I want to leave notes, saying good bye, and talking to certain people one last time, but I'm afraid to write them out.

Is there a chance that writing the notes out will make me see thigns from a different perspective, and maybe help me stop feeling like this, or will it most likely just be one more thing off my bucket list, and make me feel like I have nothing left to do?

Sorry to the other person asking about notes, your question inspired mine.
