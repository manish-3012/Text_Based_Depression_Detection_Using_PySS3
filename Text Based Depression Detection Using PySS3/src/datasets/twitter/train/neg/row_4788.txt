Why is it so badI hate myself and everything that comes with it. My jokes dont sound like jokes so everyone just assumes I'm being rude all the time and now my bf sister hates me and wont tolerate me. My boyfriend because of this thinks I yell at him all the time and now I'm all toxic. Well fuck me. I'm saying goodbye to my kid almost jumped out my car on the free way till bf stopped me and now being told I have to go out..... doesnt matter how I feel or want just as everyone is happy. I'll keep my mouth shut.
