Is wanting to die unhealthy?I was just reading through the submission that has made it to the front page about the guy who has a girlfriend that has been diagnosed with cancer. Reading through all of the comments made me come to a realization that's both grim and eye opening. I actually want to die.

I am not suicidal and absolutely cannot picture myself actually doing anything to take my own life. But the idea of having a set amount of time left in my life is one thats absolutely fascinating to me, and I find myself actually wanting to be in at situation. I won't go into great detail, but my life has been horrible lately. I've had a chronic case of bad luck for years, have had terrible things outside of my control continually happen to me, and I realistically have no way of turning my luck around. If I knew I had just a year or two to live, I could unburden myself with the disappointment of life and just blow at all my savings on checking off my bucket list in that time.

Surely this isn't a healthy thought, right? Or is it? I'm not sure and wanted to ask advice about it.
