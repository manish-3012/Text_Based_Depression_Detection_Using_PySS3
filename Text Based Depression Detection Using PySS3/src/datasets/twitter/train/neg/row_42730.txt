Life is suffering and I don't want to continueI am 24 yo and practically nowhere in my life - I had to take a break from university for 1 year because depression wouldn't let me concentrate, then I hade to take another year becaue I had an accident that destroyed my knee to the point that I will have problems with it if I will live old enough. Earlier I had to repeat one year because I was drawn into drugs. I am virgin, I am not only shy but also I am not well endowed and little guy also bears scars from phimosis surgery, I am too stressed to even talk to women - now I am crying even going into the internet and reading what women think about people like me - that we are failures; maybe they are right. I am also fat which wouldn't be that much of a problem if not aforementioned thing. I live with my parents and because of this leg I can't even get a job - so I am 24 yo unemployed virgin living with parents without education who is also not attractive physically. I think there is no sense in even continuing it anymore, every day all I feel is despise for myself - how much I hate myself - shame before normal people that achieved something and wondering why I was ever born. Those might be my last words, I just wanted it to be known.
