I was doing so so wellI really was. There was a span of 3 months where I only had the tiniest, fleeting thoughts of suicide, maybe once a week. That was the best. That nice combo of therapy that works, a happy relationship, and a good job, shit, that was the shit. Not anymore though. Its been a solid 2 months of thinking about it every day. It was fleeting, now it's running rampant in my brain. It's been a while since it's latched on this hard. I haven't made a plan, nor will I (if I stay sober), but it is getting to the point where I'm thinking about all the ways I COULD do it, which is a def sign of one of my critical points but.. whatever. I'll figure it out I guess, or it will work itself out, who knows. On to another depressed, anxious, nothing can ever go right day.
