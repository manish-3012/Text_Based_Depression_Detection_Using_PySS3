I was close just now to doing it.I've been on Reddit for a few years and I have read a lot of posts from here and decided to make my first post here, with a different account, (didn't feel comfortable using my regular account).

Anyway, I've been depressed and feeling slightly suicidal for a long time, even attend support groups and have one to one sessions but still feel down.  I'm about to turn 35 still stay with my parents and hate it.  I did manage to get myself a start in a job, starting this week but it's not really a dream or job that I would've taken normally, just doing it to get off benefits.  I find myself often getting annoyed by how my parents do things, probably just small unimportant things but annoy me just the same and this is another reason for me wanting to get away from it all.  Just an hour ago I was all set, I had a Toaster, a sink full of water and a basin with my feet in it, thinking that was make it easier to conduct the electricity.  I stood for a good 20 minutes thinking things over and then I pulled the tab on the Toaster to turn it on.  I was about to go push it the sink and then I just chickened out, turned the toaster off, emptied the sink and basin and just went back up to my room and decided to turn to here.

I don't know what to do.  I start this job on Monday, don't get my first pay till end of April and still have to stay with my parents until I can afford to move out.
