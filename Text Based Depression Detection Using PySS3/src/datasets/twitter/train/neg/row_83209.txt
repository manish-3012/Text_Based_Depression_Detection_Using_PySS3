Getting help outside of the USA?I don't know how any of this works where I live. Do people even care? If go to a hospital right now saying I'm about to kill myself, will anyone be able to do anything meaningful to change my mind? I live in Brazil and honestly with the chaos of things atm... It's hard to think anyone would have the patience.
I'm just tired of medications and therapy sessions and having no changes in these past 5 years... I've lost most of my friends and ruined my reputation. Ruined my life. I think it's a good time to go but I can't stop being scared.
I said to both my psychiatrist and psychologist that I was on the verge of trying again and they just nodded their heads. Not even paid professionals care anymore. Everyone is done and so am I. If only I could have the motivation or impulse to just end it all...
