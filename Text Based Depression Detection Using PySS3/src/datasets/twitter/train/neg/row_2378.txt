If I had the means to do it tonight, I would.I've been depressed since I was a child. I go through a few months where everything is okay and I feel strong and maybe even stable, but I always know I'm eventually going to be staring over whatever emotional pit I will fall into next. Everything makes me tired, every interaction with others is painful, I am so ashamed of myself. I wish I could be happy with my life and be appreciative for all the opportunities that have been made available for me. I feel so pathetic.
