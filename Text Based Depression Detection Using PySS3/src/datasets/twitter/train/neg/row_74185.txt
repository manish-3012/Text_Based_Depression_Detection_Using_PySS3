I think i'll be dead in a couple hours.Hey everyone.

My English may be a little bit rusty, because it's not my mother language, but i'll do my best.

I'm a girl, and i have 18 years old. I battle with depression and anxiety since i was 12/11, so i've been depressed for a long time. I think about suicide every fucking day, and this is killing me.

Living turn out to be very painful to me. I also suffer with desrealization and despersonalization, which makes things worse. My friends, my family, my house, my life, nothing seems real enough for me. It's like the whole world is made of glass and one single step would broke it in a thousand pieces.

I'm in great pain right now, not physical, but emotional and mental. My friends don't respond me and I think that they hate me a lot for thinking about suicide, but what can I do? I just tell them how I feel and they get so mad at me for thinking Â about kill myself.

So i stopped talking. If they ask me how i'm feeling, i just say i'm fine, and i've been lying for a couple weeks.

I made my decision today. I will be home alone in a couple hours, so I will kill myself. I will cut my wrists and, hopefully, bleed to death. I just can't take it anymore, and this world seems so unreal that it hurts. And hurts a lot.

To Meg, I know you will not be able to read this, but i want you to know that you're my best friend, and I feel so sorry for not being a good friend to you when you needed it. Love you so much honey.

To Let, I'm so thankful for you show up to my house when i begged you for help and for take care of me, butÂ i'm afraid that this time things will be different. I'm so sorry. I love you so much.

I'll be looking for you two in the clouds above, i promise.

Thank's for reading my history. Goodbye.
