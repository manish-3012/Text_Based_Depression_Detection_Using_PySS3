But no one will listen...I'm a 26 year old female who never intended to live passed 25. I have 2 kids (I didn't want but was raised to belive abortion is the epitome of evil and that I'd be disowned if I ever did adoption, not like my husband would allow it anyways) and a husband. I have severe social anxiety, depression, PTSD from a traumatic childhood, sensory processing disorder, gender dismorphia, seizures, back injuries that prevent me from being mobile much (require a walker or wheelchair to get around but don't have a wheelchair and walkers aren't made for outdoors) as well as another handful of issues that would take forever to explain.

Well, here I am. No one will listen to me, if I speak my pain, the absolute, horrible pain of living I get told 'oh but you have beautiful boys and husband' like shoving my life mistakes in my face makes it any better. My shrink asks me "what keeps you going" and in all honesty, nothing. I have nothing keeping me going, which is probably why I have so many physical issues, I want to die. I've been wanting to die since I was 5. My first attempt was when I was 7. My last was 3 days ago. I have to think of others, I'm not allowed to think of myself. That's selfish and disgusting, I have to think about the kids and husband his coworkers and the neighbors and family and friends and the pets and everyone else but myself. I cannot do anything for myself without feeling extreme amounts of guilt. I'm almost 30 and have tried to kill myself (seriously tried) about 15 times. 
No one understands the turmoil, the pain, the suffering because no one acknowledges the torture it is to be forced to birth 2 humans you didn't want, you begged to not have, you cried to not have because you knew you couldn't be a parent. Then add on the gender dismorphia...there isn't a part of me that I have worth saving. 

And I have no one.
