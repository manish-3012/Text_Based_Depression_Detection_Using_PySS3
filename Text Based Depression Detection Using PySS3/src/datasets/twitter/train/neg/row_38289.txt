My expiration dateUseless.
Worthless.
Waste of time and space.

For the past 6 years I have struggled with depression and anxiety, and for the last time I canâ€™t take it anymore. Countless therapist appointments, counselor appointments with my community college that I canâ€™t even attend to because of my psychotic ass, arguments with my mother, stressors, unmotivation, the list goes on. So much testing and reaching out but to no avail. 
For years I have gone on life in the shadow of myself. I have attempted suicide multiple times, Iâ€™ve sat on my toilet black out drunk, Iâ€™ve spent weeks on end  high, trying to escape this feeling. But I canâ€™t, I just canâ€™t. No matter what I do it always comes back and it always ruins what little I have built up for myself. I canâ€™t take this, I canâ€™t anymore. I am trying so goddamn hard but I canâ€™t do this. 
Iâ€™m searching for new jobs. Iâ€™m scheduling for doctors. Iâ€™m trying to workout. Iâ€™m trying again at community college. But I canâ€™t fucking do this anymore. I am such a burden, a waste of time and money. All of my resources that I have used are essentially temporary, leading up to moments like Iâ€™m having now. Itâ€™s a cycle that I canâ€™t do. Iâ€™m so sick and tired of crying, so tired of being tired, sick of being worthless. 
Iâ€™m done. I canâ€™t go on like this any longer. I am giving myself to the end of the week.
I have a bottle of Xanax and a bottle of a high dosage sleeping pills. Right now Iâ€™m writing apology letters to my boyfriend, my grandmother and my best friend. 
Iâ€™m so sorry. Iâ€™m so sorry.
