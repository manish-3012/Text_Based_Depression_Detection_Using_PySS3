StudentThe pressure of trying to succeed in school and becoming an adult is always getting me down, I feel like that I'm not going to be anything that there's no point in trying anymore. Just because I'm not the smartest or hard working person does not mean I try, and that's why I always feel hopeless why don't I have the effort to do it? I have great friends who support me and I do the same for them, I'm really compassionate but there's always these thought of nothing down the line, like mabey living a full life isn't what I want. 

Iv been searching on reddit stuff like this for a while and my reason is so stupid but how am I going to cope in the future I don't want to suffer and I'm considering that I should end it because it's easier on my part.
