Don't even know what to sayI started writing a post 5 times for a week but I'm never doing it cause I feel like nothing I write makes sense and it's all just cringy, dramatic shit.
I don't want to kill myself. I'm not going to do it. That's what I decided. The thought of the possibility just calms me down. I'm just thinking about it.
I feel so detached from this world. I hate it. 
I feel like I'm sitting in a cold, dark room without doors or windows and I can hear the voices of the people and the sounds of nature around me faintly outside. But I can never escape. I don't even know how I am, what I want, what I like, I know my name and my age but it doesn't feel right. I'm just lost. I feel alone even with people who love me. I didn't feel this sensation of warmth and secureness in years. I was so desperately searching for it but I can't get it back.
