male 22yrs, did nothing in life. no work, no experiences, no love, almost no friends, wasted college, thinking about how to die fast everyday.I lived all my life in illusions. Daydreaming about how my future would be, when i would travel around the world, get the perfect girl, have lots of friends... but never did anything to achieve any of these. I spent and still spend my days trapped in home at the computer, seeing worthless stuff on internet, eating crap food, dreaming about being successful, watching pornography and any other things that can be used as an escape from my wasted life. I'm in a college, but talk to nobody and it seems nobody wants to talk to me neither, the grades are the worst possible and i'm one reprobation left from being expelled. If this happens i'm convinced i would put an end in my existence in the same day. 

I have no motivation, courage or force to do anything. I'm driven by anxiety, depression and fear. I see my only two friends i have since highschool growing, building things in their lives, meeting new people, maturing in body and mind, improving themselves, and i'm just still here. Stuck in memories of a dead past, being fed and pressured everyday by my parents and a few family members, feeling like i'm dying everyday. Everyday i ask to my self when i go to college "how would be the faster way to get rid of myself?" "how could i destroy myself and leave this hell instantly?" "would anybody cares?" "why i'm still alive, just making my family waste money with a worthless thing like me? i have to put an end on it". I think about it everyday, sometimes all the day. If i had a gun and just one bullet i wouldn't be here writing this post.

I don't know if this is the right type of post we can write here, but i'm not seeing any light at the end of the tunnel, just a dead end.
