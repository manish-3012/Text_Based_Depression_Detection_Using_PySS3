Its gonna be soonThe next couple of weeks I think. I keep going back and forth through my mind trying to figure it out, but I think i have.  I'm tired of working hard and getting where i want to be only for life to take it all away again. Took me 16 years to find love and she let it die in half that time. I tried to reason with her but she doesn't care... I think she was just using me now she's using something else as an excuse. I just want to end. Everyone tells me to stop torturing myself I think I'm finally starting to listen.
