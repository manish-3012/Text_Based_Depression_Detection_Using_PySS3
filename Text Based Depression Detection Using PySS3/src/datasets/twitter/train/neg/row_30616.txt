We're all addicted to Negative thoughtsHave you ever tried to think positive for a day and couldn't? It might be because we're all secretly addicted to negative thinking. Our brains are so used to it, that we need our fix. When we feel tired of thinking positive or just can't find the discipline to it is withdrawal from the addiction. Just like a heartbreak, you think about the person you once loved and you feel hurt. You're addicted to them and they're toxic. Our brain needs time to heal from these negative thoughts and it takes time to. We can't always be positive though, but we can try and show gratitude for everything we have.  So please. Call someone if you need someone to talk to. Dont hold in the pain that you're addicted to it can either destroy you or it transform you just like mine did.
