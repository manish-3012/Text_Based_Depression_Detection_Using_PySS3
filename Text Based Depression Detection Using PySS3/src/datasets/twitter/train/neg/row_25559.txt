People will judge you, no matter what you did or did not do.Parents will swear at you, at worst possible way that donâ€™t even make sense anymore. And the rest will ignore you. I only have two hands, yet you expect me to make Einstein looks stupid. Iâ€™m talking to you mum. Get your shit together, or you will regret.

I donâ€™t wanna get married, so what, I wonâ€™t allow my kid have less attention because Iâ€™m busy at work. Thatâ€™s what you did remember? Why do I come to this world anyway? Fuck
