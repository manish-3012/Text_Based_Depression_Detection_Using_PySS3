WHY SHOULD I EVEN BOTHER. FUCK IT.There's no point to reaching out. I don't even know why the hell I'm on here. I either end up getting abandoned, ignrored, or ridiculed. I already know how much of a failure I am, there's no need for you to keep reminding me. I'm tired over being treated like a worthless piece of shit, and I want out, and you can't stop me.
