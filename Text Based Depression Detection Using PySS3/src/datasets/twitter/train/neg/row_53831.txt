From hero to zero...I was studying engineering and had 2 years left. Everyone I know held me in high esteem. For various reasons, I've done poorly this past year and am about to get kicked out of university. All the work, sacrifice and stress that I've put to reach this point has suddenly gone out the window and I don't know what's gonna happen. Although I do have abilities in other things, there's *nothing* else I'd rather be than an engineer. It's that or nothing.

At this point, I'm just mentally and physically exhausted. I don't even have any emotion in me right now, but am extremely disappointed for having failed and feel really dumb for wasting time/money (and then venting about it over here) :/
