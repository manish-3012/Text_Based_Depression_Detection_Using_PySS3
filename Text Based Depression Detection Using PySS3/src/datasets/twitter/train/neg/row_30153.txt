Ready to give upThe only thing I want from life now is to die. I'm just too tired and I don't want to go through this anymore.

My job is beyond awful but I can't get anything new because I have no valuable experience. I have no money. I didn't figure out what I wanted to do in college and got a useless degree. I gave up on my dreams after 4 months. I feel isolated and alienated from my friends and family even when I have a good time. I can't just stop and appreciate anything. she's moved on. I'm constantly talking to myself in my head and the other voice is starting to win. I can't make a good thought last anymore. I can't afford counseling or therapy.

I don't want to spend the rest of my life going to some job that I feel nothing for, but I know I'm not special or good enough to succeed at anything worthwhile. any dreams or goals I once had are in the past and my motivation is gone.

when I think about the future; the possibility of family, love, growing old, experiencing new things. I don't want any of that. I just want to die and end it all for myself.
