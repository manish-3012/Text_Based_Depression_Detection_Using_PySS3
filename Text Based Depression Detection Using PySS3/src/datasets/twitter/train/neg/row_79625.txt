Don't know what to do...Reddit, I'm about at the point of giving up on everything. In high school, I was a straight-A student, valedictorian, plenty of friends. In college I went from As to Bs to nearly failing out senior year. Despite all that I managed to land an amazing job, and now have thrown that away. I moved to a new area for this (now lost) job, and have no friends or family up here (or anywhere, for that matter). I constantly lie to my parents to not worry them about what's going on. I've been on depression meds for a year but have stopped taking them because they didn't really help and I no longer see the point. The only thing in the world I take pleasure from is video games, and even that is fleeting. Used to play in bands/orchestras and I think I enjoyed those, but no longer have those options available to me being out of college. Reddit, ideas?
