Can't even Google how to kill myself painlessly anymoreThis sucks, if you Google this or try to find information you get bombarded with the bullshit suicide prevention hotline. I've called it once before and it only made me more convinced I should kill myself. Sick of being trapped here. 

Anyone else very close to doing it? I'm fairly close. Closer than I've ever been in my life, shit.
