Planning my suicide is probably the only reason ive made it this far.Between writing my final words to people making sure I leave nothing left unsaid. Running to the store to get envelopes, tarps, etc. Cleaning and boxing up all my belongings. That's probably what has kept me going for all this time. Feeling really at peace with death. Would be lying if I said I wasn't a bit scared, especially when I'll finally have the barrel against my chest. My gun has a really long trigger pull and that's probably what worries me the most.
