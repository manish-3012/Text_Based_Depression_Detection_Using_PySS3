Im tired of being aliveIt's the same shit everyday i wake up, go to school, come home and waste my life on youtube.    My body feels heavy and my brain feels blank. Its almost like im already dead and i dont know it yet.  My brain is just a giant spiral of negative thought screaming at me that life is just not for me. 
I feel empty and like a complete waste of space. Im a bother to everyone and i can never get shit right. Im fucking pathetic.
