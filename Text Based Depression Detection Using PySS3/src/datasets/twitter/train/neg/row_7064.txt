Not me but a friend.A friend of mine who lives in another state and who I can only contact virtually is suicidal and attempted suicide last night. She's just got out of the hospital as of two hours before this.

What do I do to help? Is there anything I can do at all to help her? Or should I worry more about myself and other friends and keep them okay?
