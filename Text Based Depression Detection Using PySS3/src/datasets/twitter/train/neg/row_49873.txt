I'm not so suicidal anymore, but I find that my end goal and ambition is just dying.I know people joke about 'just waiting for the sweet embrace of death' or whatever, but that's how I feel right now.

I want to die, but it's either going to hurt me, and others no matter how I go about it. So I'll just wait it out, since that's what everyone feels I should do.

I want to die in a comfy armchair sipping something nice, and with Doctor Who playing in the background. I want to feel really tired and doze off to never wake up again.

I've fantasised about this more than hanging, or running into roads, or jumping. Probably cos I can't achieve it right now so there's no sense of impulse, just impatience.
