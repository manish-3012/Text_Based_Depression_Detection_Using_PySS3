I feel disconnected from the people around meI donâ€™t know what it is, but I worry my friends and family donâ€™t like me, as much as they assure me they do. I just feel like Iâ€™m alone, and sometimes I feel it again, but usually I just feel empty. I donâ€™t wanna admit I need help, but I do. Iâ€™ve never wanted to give up more, Iâ€™ve never been more angry, mean rude, etc. most of the time I donâ€™t even feel like myself, and Iâ€™m constantly questioning myself and my reality. All I want is to be better, and every day is better or worse. Iâ€™m losing weight, Iâ€™ll be starting a new high school soon. Everything should be perfect, but I feel so lost, and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore, I donâ€™t wanna be broken. I feel like such a burden to my friends and family. I look around and see such amazing people and all I can think is how useless I am. I donâ€™t wanna ruin everything by admitting how I feel, but I also donâ€™t know if I can keep trying to do it alone.
