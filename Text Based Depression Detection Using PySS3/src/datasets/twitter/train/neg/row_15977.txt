How did you do it?Let me know if this isn't the place for this, I don't want to offend anyone or make anyone feel worse than they already do. We all have enough shit to deal with....

I have been very suicidal over the past two weeks. A lot of it was the result of a change in medication plus a rough MDD spell. The meds finally started working a little and I feel less suicidal and I realized today that I'm really proud of myself. When I was planning things or started preparing, I gave my husband the code phrase so he could help me until the urge passed. I went to work, even though I didn't achieve almost anything, but I still went (will deal with that aftermath later...). I held on. I still desperately want to die, but somehow, I'm also a little proud of myself for not dying?

If anyone is willing to share, I'd love to hear how you kept yourself safe or resisted.
