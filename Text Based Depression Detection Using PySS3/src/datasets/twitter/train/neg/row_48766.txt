Does anyone have any scientific articles supporting personality over physical attractiveness?I found some scientific articles supporting the existence physical attractiveness.

Then I read some  comments on reddit that personality is better.

Whatâ€™s true? Can someone please share scientific article that personality makes people attractive over physical attractiveness? I believe it will give hope to people not kill themselves and that it is not hopeless if you are born ugly.
