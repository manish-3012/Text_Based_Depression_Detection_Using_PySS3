Everything I do is wrongEverything I do is wrong. I'm nothing but mistakes. I'm a mistake. I'm always wrong. I can't do or think anything right. My head is a fucking mess, I can't think about anything. I'm causing trouble for everyone else. I need to leave this fucking existence. It's better for everyone.
