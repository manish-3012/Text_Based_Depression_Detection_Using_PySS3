Canâ€™t keep going because of PHYSICAL issues, not mental onesIâ€™m not getting help from any doctors and time is not helping me heal. At all. Iâ€™m in so much physical pain and discomfort with no end in sight. There isnâ€™t the option to just quit my job and spend endless amounts of money trying to fix all these issues. I donâ€™t know what to do and I canâ€™t even get pain relief prescribed. This isnâ€™t life and hasnâ€™t been for the past several years Iâ€™ve been suffering through this. Enough!
