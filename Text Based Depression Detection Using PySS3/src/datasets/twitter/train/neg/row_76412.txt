I cant stop thinking about killing myself. I dont know how this will endI've planned, researched and bought materials for my suicide. I've written notes and accepted death for the most part. I'm so fucking scared but i don't see any other way. I've talked to therapists, been to mental hospital, I'm taking medication, my friends and family have done everything they can. I even go out and do things but nothing stops the thoughts of suicide. My life is destroyed and I just need to leave this world. I'm tired of laying in bed alone knowing she's out there somewhere, I'm tired of fearing that I'm going to jail, I'm tired of everyone around me bothering me and trying to "help" me.
