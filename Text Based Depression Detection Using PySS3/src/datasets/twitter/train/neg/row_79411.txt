I Plan On Killing Myself This Weekend.I really can't handle this cruel and merciless Earth any longer. Like a lot of other people, the world has been less than fair to me. As soon as I was born I was given nothing but obstacles that I was forced to live through.

"Things get better" they say, and here I am, 16 years of age with no signs of improvements. In fact, my life has done nothing but grow worse the further I live on. I can't take anymore pain and heartbreak, I really can't. It hurts too much.. Everything does. 

My life right now is literal hell. Due to a condition of mine, I can't stand or walk for more than five minutes without feeling like I'm going to pass out, and I can't sit-up because it hurts too much. All I can do is just lie down in constant agony 24/7, as I cry myself to sleep. 

I have lost all sense of hope. My life will never improve. The world has already proved that to me.

Instead of living through more future pain and heartbreak, I'd rather die soon to escape the eternal darkness that is my mind.

I never asked to be born. I never asked for pain. But since I was forcefully brought into this world, don't I have every right to decide when I leave?

I have so many methods that I would like to be the cause of my demise, but I've decided on one.. I think it has a high enough chance to be successful. 

I've thought of killing myself for years. A disgusting parasite like myself doesn't deserve to live anyway. I'd honestly be doing every single person I know a favor if I died, even if they don't even know it yet. They'll notice that a huge weight has been taken off of their shoulders. They won't have to deal with an annoying asshole like myself for much longer.

The thought of no longer breathing honestly comforts me. It's something that I've wished for for so long, and soon, that wish will become reality.
