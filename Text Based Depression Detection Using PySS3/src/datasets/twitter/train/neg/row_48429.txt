Please someone talk me through it, Iâ€™m thinking about going to jump from a bridge right nowI just got this text from my only friend, he blocked me everywhere, please someone help me. Iâ€™m blocked everywhere imaginable, I need help. 
I told him it might be my last week and I just wanted him to be nice to me. 

â€œI respect and understand why you want to die but I cannot be a part of it. Iâ€™m not ever ever going to support you killing yourself, even by just â€œbeing niceâ€.  At this point, at best Iâ€™m failing to help you, and at worst Iâ€™m making you worse - as long as you have the option of contacting me youâ€™re going to say things to get a reaction out of me and drive yourself deeper into a hole and further away from getting better. Please please believe in your own beauty and worth before itâ€™s too late because when you donâ€™t itâ€™s beyond frustrating to those who love and appreciate you. Bye, good luck, take care of yourself xâ€
