Iâ€™m a 19 year old alcoholic suicidal college student with little to no idea of what comes next.Itâ€™s hard, and im tired. Really fucking tired. I canâ€™t function anymore. Iâ€™m a complete alcoholic at my age, and canâ€™t function without it. I get blackout almost everyday of the week by myself. 

I canâ€™t make rent this month, im short a couple hundred and am already knee deep in personal and payday loans. I am more poor than ive been in my entire life. 

Iâ€™m failing school, friendships, and relationships. Both my relationships with my parents have failed (divorced) and Iâ€™m stuck. 

Iâ€™m just stuck, and really fucking sad. If anyone wants to talk just let me know. 

I have no plan on killing myself, I just donâ€™t want to be me anymore. Someone please help me get through this.
