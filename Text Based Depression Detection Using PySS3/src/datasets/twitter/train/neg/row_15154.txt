RelapseFor the first time in a little over a year I'm having genuine thoughts of suicide again. The depression never went away, but the suicidal urges did, and for a while I thought I was doing better. Lying in bed last night all I could think of was taking a sharp knife from my kitchen and cutting my wrists. I fantasized about ending it all and embracing the sweet allure of ending the pain.

I don't think I'm in any immediate danger. At the moment they're just thoughts, and they would need to last much longer than a couple of nights for me to actually act on them. But right now I feel defeated, broken and alone. I don't think I will ever be able to love a "normal" life, the way my brain is wired seems to be too big of an obstacle to conquer.
