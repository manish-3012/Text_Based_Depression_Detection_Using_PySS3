I'm so fucking done at this point.I'm 21 years old and I'm gonna kill myself soon. I'm fucking fed up with the fucking realization that nothing I can do, I can do right. It's been fucking painful enough for me getting this fair but I don't think I really want to go much further until about the end of this year or so. 

Is anyone else feeling like this right now?

I am so tired and so fed up. 

I really am and I can't keep up explaining myself to anyone close to me. I self harm and it's not getting anything apart from in the moment and just worrying people around me if they spot the marks. 

I am so fed up I'm at the point of not caring. 

The past year I've felt like something big has to change but nothing is. 

I really really don't want to continue with my life. I'm so fed up, weakened and fed up. I can't get anywhere without crippling anxiety about anything I ever do and it hurts so much. 

I don't feel as if I love anyone close to me because if I did I could tell them and they'd understand. 

I'm so sick of of worrying of how I'm viewed and how I can improve myself but I don't have the strength physically or mentally or improve myself. I don't have enough money to leave or go away. I'm so fucking young but I'm hurting so much I can't get past it. I've tried medication, I've done so much therapy, I've done self harming, I've done drugs, and I have a partner who love's me but nothing is helping. 

I'm so scared and afraid of what may happen if I carry on.
