Don't have the courage to kill myself but tired of livingI'm just internally broken, i've even been thinking of drinking alcohol to numb the pain.

I'm 22 years old, i hate myself, my appearance.etc. I'm a 5ft 6 male, not in great shape and i inject myself with insulin to do what normal people do daily, eat food and function.

7 years ago i was diagnosed with depression, did counselling and therapy but nothing improved. I tried the gym, being more social and positive. I had a thing with 2 girls both of whom cheated on me. 

Since then i've lost all my friends due to reasons, my life is basically working a job i hate and playing Xbox/PS until bedtime.

I hate myself, i've tried to embrace it but im ugly and have even been told so. I act confident but i know deeply i have no worth or purpose. I look at people my age and see the fun they have, then i look at myself and ask "why me?".

I want to go, i want this pain to end, the cycle of boredom but i have no courage, i just cant take anymore of this honestly.
