I canâ€™t keep being strongReliving some pretty horrific traumas. On top of that, my friends all stopped talking to me, my husband basically treats me like a maid and mother instead of a wife. My job sucks. It seems like some people are just made to suffer and not be happy to remind happy people how much worse it could be. I want to believe it gets better, but 25 years of experience makes that seem impossible. Iâ€™ve tried for so long, but I canâ€™t see a way up anymore. I help everyone around me, but when I need them thereâ€™s no one. I feel like a garbage person who is so easy for other people to throw away that I donâ€™t deserve to be here.
