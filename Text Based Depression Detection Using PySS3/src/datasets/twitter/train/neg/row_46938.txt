Suicide thoughts on birthday nightTomorrow is my birthday. But here i am watching videos of suicide survivors.
I don't wanna do it. But all the stress and how life is going, How time is ticking.. every bone in my body says i should leave this place. I have no space here. I don't deserve to be here or I don't belong here.. same thing.
People may get sad. But that's it. They'll move on. Because i never had any special place in anyone life. 
I really wish i leave before tomorrow comes.
