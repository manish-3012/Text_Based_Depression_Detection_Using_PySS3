How do you manage to survive ?Hey... I'm 23 and I really feel like life has been already far too long to cope with.

I have several plans to end myself but I don't feel like I have the guts to execute the plan(s) right now.

I don't know what can relief me from suffering instead of drugs (alcohol and medication included of course)  I just wonder how normal people do... (you don't have to identify as a normal person to answer this don't worry, it was not adressed to you subredditors)
