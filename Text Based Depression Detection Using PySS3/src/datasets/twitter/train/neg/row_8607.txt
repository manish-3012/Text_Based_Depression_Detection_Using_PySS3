In the end, all I really want is...Having been in and out of depression for the last 5 years of my life, I have come to accept the fact that I am depressed. However, this does not bug me anymore. I have gotten to the point where I see death as the light at the end of the tunnel. Death, to me, is the ultimate freedom; freedom from this world. I see death as a beautiful thing.

In the end, I do not want people to feel sorry for me, I don't want people to miss me. I do not want people to tell me that I am going to hell for this, or that I should just give it some time. I have given it a lot of thought already, and I see the end as the ultimate peace. 

In the end, all I want is the people closest around me to understand that I AM going to kill myself, and to accept it. I just want to them to say, "I don't know what comes after death, but I wish you luck in the next life, if there is one. I will miss you, but I am glad you will finally become free." 

Hearing those words, and then becoming completely free of this world, would be the best thing that could happen. 


At least, in my point of view. 


Anyone else feel like this?
