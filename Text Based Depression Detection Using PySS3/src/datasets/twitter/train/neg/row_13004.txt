Unfulfilled potential.24M. 

Have spent all of my life miserable about the hand I was dealt. Over the last few years my goals+self expectations have become non existent and all I think about is how fucked I am. Realizing all the years I spent miserable ruined me even more. And Iâ€™m too far come. Iâ€™m drowning in imposter syndrome. 

The real kicker, is I am a self isolationist which makes me just more toxic to myself. Have a hard time bringing myself to a therapist, cause itâ€™s fucking exhausting explaining the intricacies of my past. (Communication/stammering issues + short tempered + BPD = shite communication) so I just sit in my room and talk to myself. Being alone is all Iâ€™ve ever known. 

Iâ€™ve been the star of a broken family, but Iâ€™m just shot. I have no idea how to keep going. My arrogance and shit communication just got me laid off (interviews make me wanna end it lol). 

Not in any real danger atm cause mom/brother but have been planning it when Iâ€™m older (40-50s for a while). Slowly giving up on my family, meaning I just want to end it. Fuck slaving away another 20 years miserable. Iâ€™m exhausted.
