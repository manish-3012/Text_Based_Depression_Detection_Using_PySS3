Alone foreverI don't feel right in the past 2 years ,I don't feel right ,I feel like I just wanna kill myself but I can't do it it's just too hard I feel like I wanna disappear forever and just see what the fuck happens after I die,who would care.I'm in 8th grade,14  but I don't think it's just a phase... I feel like I'm going to be like this my whole life I don't feel like anything would change everything is the same every fucking day. I'm very social awkward and anti social I don't go outside even if "friends" or classmates or neighbours call me to get outside I tried to but I just don't feel right I feel like I'm useless I just look at the ground and say nothing I can't be happy ,3 days ago I had my 8th grade banquet thing I just stood there the whole time I didn't even eat. My everyday life is just wake up playing games on my pc or watching memes or anime and watching YouTube just wasting time,I also go to sleep late. When I go to school I just get bullied by classmates that when they see that I'm sad or just being alone for the whole day they bother me and they think that they are my friends again but I don't even consider that ,I just act like I do just so they don't get mad at me for my fake personality with them. I'm a failure for my parents I can't learn anything I got exams on 12 and 13 June and if I fail them I'm going to become more depressed. I tried to kill myself when I was like 11 I tried to jump off the balcony from floor 3 and took some sleep pills in a row recently. People don't talk to me because I'm awkward but I just want to have someone to talk with about my problems in real life . I might end it all soon
