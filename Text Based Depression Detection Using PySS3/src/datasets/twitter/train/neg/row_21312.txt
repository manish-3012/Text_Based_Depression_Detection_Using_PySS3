I need helpI know that maybe this isn't the sub for this, but I need help.

Just broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years. She's the only person in the world I had. I don't have any friends or family.  I don't believe in myself anymore, in my ability to have any impact on my own life.  I used to, but life beat that hope out of me.  I can't do this.  Does anybody have anywhere I can turn to? Resources? anything. 

Where do I go from here.
