Please tell me it gets better.I'm 33.  

I was fired from my best job ever 8 months ago for reasons that were not my fault.  Even the unemployment judge agreed and decided the case in my favor.

I took a huge cut in pay just to find work.  I can barely pay my bills, I can't afford real food to eat.  In that regards, I can't afford to go out and socialize, which means I can't meet new people.

I haven't had a date in almost 5 years.  I can't even get people I'm interested in to talk to me.  I'm roundly ignored everywhere I go.

I never finished college and can't afford to go back because I owe a crippling amount of debt to a university for unpaid fees and can't attend anywhere else.

Almost all my friends were at my old job, and now none of them ever speak to me unless I initiate the conversation, and even then they leave out as soon as they can.

My only two real friends are my roommates and they spend all their time playing WoW together and ignore me for the most part.  One of them just got an interview for a job that I told them about that I also applied to but didn't get the interview.

No one seems to be interested in what I have to say.  No one shares my interests, and those that do talk to me like I'm an uneducated idiot.  People who don't even know half of what I do about the things I love, talk to me like I'm ignorant.

I can't seem to catch a break at all anymore.  Since the beginning of last year my life has fallen apart and the few things I had going for me all faded away.

I feel like I peaked a long time ago, I have no prospects of it ever getting better, and that no matter how hard I try I will not get out of this hole.

I'm afraid of sitting in some welfare hospital somewhere dying alone and unloved when I'm 70 with no friends or family at the funeral because I have none now.

Please someone tell me it gets better.  Please.
