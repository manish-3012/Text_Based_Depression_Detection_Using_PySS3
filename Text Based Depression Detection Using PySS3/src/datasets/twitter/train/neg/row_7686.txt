FUCKI dont know what else to do. I don't know what I expect from posting this. 

I only have one thing to live for, and that is my best friend. Every time I go to slit my wrists or jump to my death, all I can see is an image of her reaction. I want to die. I genuinely think it's for my own good. I've no future, I'll never be successful, I'll never not suffer. That's not up for debate, that's a fact. I can't forgive myself for hurting my friend in the past but I know killing myself will destroy her. All we have is each other and she insists I'm the only thing that keeps her going. I have an overwhelming urge to kill myself right now, but I know in a few days it will pass. I'll get my hopes up and start looking forward to things for about a day and then find myself right back down here. This has been the cycle for years. I have no way I can not suffer without hurting the only person I care about. I love her more than anything and I cant bring myself to leave her no matter how bad I want to blow my brain out. But I still suffer. I feel like a monster. I wish she would die so i could die too
