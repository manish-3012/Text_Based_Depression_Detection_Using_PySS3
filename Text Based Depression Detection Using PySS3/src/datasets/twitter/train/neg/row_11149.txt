Six hours a dayI'm diagnosed bipolar unspecified, and I am taking medication for it. I see my therapist in about 10 days, but I don't know if I can last that long. 

Six hours a day I want to die. Three in the morning, three in the evening. When I wake up, the first thing I see in my mind is my suicide. Over and over, again and again. These daymares are so vivid I can almost smell the blood. Then, in the three hours before I go to sleep, the same. 

I used to smoke pot to make both the visions and the suicidal thoughts go away. Three days ago, my parents caught me smoking and took everything I had. I'm just finishing my second day without, and now I want to die every second of the day. I'm afraid that one of my visions will become reality real soon. 

They expect me to go to rehab. It's a condition of living here. I'm not an addict. I'm in pain. I don't need rehab, I need treatment for my pain.

Help me hold on. I can't do this alone.
