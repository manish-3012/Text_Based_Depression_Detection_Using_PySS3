Iâ€™ve made up my mindIâ€™ve always been depressed, even as a kid (around 7 or 8) and Iâ€™ve never truly been happy. Iâ€™ve attempted before and ended up hospitalized but Iâ€™m finally home alone and I can get the job done. I havenâ€™t told anyone and Iâ€™m new to Reddit, I also donâ€™t know anyone who has a reddit account. Idk.. I guess Iâ€™m just ready to go, Iâ€™ve been wanting this for a long time now
