It's been 5 years...Five years of hating myself off and on, of struggling to want to wake up in the mornings, of realizing I have a problem and never getting help. It's been five years of misery and sadness. And I want it to be over. The last two weeks have been especially bad, with school and work piling up and keeping me from being social. I don't want my job, I don't want a college degree, I just want it to all be over. I'm tired of pretending this all exists. It's been 5 years and I'm not willing to live for another 5 days. Good night and good bye.
