I'm a schizophrenic alcoholic and I'm throwing in the towel.Hello. My name is Cameron, and I'm a schizophrenic with autism and severe depression. I've lived with depression for well over ten years, and I think it's time for me to go. I've thought for a while now that I'm only alive by chance, and I should have died long ago. I feel I have overstayed my welcome in this world, and my story ended already. I want to make this statement as a final message. 
I'm sorry to those who I let down. I felt I'd do great things in this world, but I lack the ability to. I'm unable to keep a job, keep track of my memory, and keep my alcoholism at bay. I'm sorry to my mother who I've lied to, and said I'm okay to. I'm sorry to my father who has fought though it all, and I wish I connected with you more. 
To my brothers, I understand this will be hard to take in, but you will prevail. You're both far more intelligent than I ever could have imagined, and I hope you succeed in life. Talk to eachother though for gods sake. 
To Beatrix, I wish the best for. I wish we could have been better, and I still love you dearly. I know circumstances came about that caused us to grow apart, but know that I care about you deeply even still. I hope you have the best in life. Goodbye.
