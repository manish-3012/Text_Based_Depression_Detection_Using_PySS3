Please help meIm in a troubled spot between wanting to die and trying not to hurt anyone around me, but it's been difficult as all hell from a multitude of different things. I've been selected as my friend groups support guy, I got dumped in a very destructive way a few months ago, and I've started long distance dating someone in Canada who is more actively suicidal then me. 

The girl I'm dating is extremely suicidal like I said, but she messages me everyday about helping her become not suicidal, how it's not working, and how her pills arent doing anything even through shes not taking them and needs the dossage upped. I'm floundering and it's just too much to handle along with everything else.

I'll explain on everything else if yall want.

But can someone give me advice on how to like die with no one caring?
