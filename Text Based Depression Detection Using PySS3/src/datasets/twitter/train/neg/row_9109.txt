Why are you still around?I asked this another sub but didnâ€™t really get anything, so Iâ€™m trying again here. Iâ€™m looking for reasons to stick around, at least for a little while. I originally planned to commit this month, but im not sure if Iâ€™m totally ready yet despite how badly I want to go. I know Iâ€™ll do it eventually, unless my depression and anxiety and ptsd somehow gets cured and I actually start enjoying being around. But until then, Iâ€™m looking for things to do to make me want to live.

Some songs make me want to go on adventures or sit on a roof and watch the stars or dance with a partner, but those things will never happen. Iâ€™m just sixteen and have overprotective parents so Iâ€™d have to wait until I move out to do anything worth while, for now itâ€™s just school and homework and hating myself and being alive. Some books make me want to stick around, too.

Iâ€™m sorry I sound so whiney and crappy and stuff in this post, just feeling pretty bad today and want to figure out how to enjoy my existence a bit more. What keep you guys around? I canâ€™t really think of many good reasons to stay, except for the obvious â€œmy family/friends will be sad and angryâ€ and â€œmy dog will be sadâ€ but I want solutions, things to make my life more livable. Thanks for any replies, Iâ€™d really seriously appreciate it.
