Iâ€™ve done everything right... but here I amIn the past 2 months Iâ€™ve had 2 suicide attempts. 

After the first one, I decided to reach out to my friends and family, I let them know how I was feeling, and they listened or cried. Thatâ€™s all.

My second attempt was a week ago. It wasnâ€™t completed because I wasnâ€™t sure if I had enough time and stopped. During the attempt I had no fears or regrets, so I decided Iâ€™ll repeat this method in one week.

I told the people I was with about my attempt, my best friend and another person. They looked at me and continued their argument. I repeated what I said but they shrugged. 

Today is the day. Iâ€™ve been shredding papers, recording voice memos, uploading pictures on flash drives, and arranged for my friends to gather and meet each other 2 hours after. 

Iâ€™d like to mention, Iâ€™ve tried everything in regards to getting help. The best private mental wellness retreats in Europe, multiple shitty month long hospitalizations in the US, and a psychiatrist who I saw for a year consistently (medication included).

I think Iâ€™ve done everything Iâ€™m supposed to? Nothing worked for me and I canâ€™t imagine how people without with the financial means or access to help survive. So strong.

Small note: Iâ€™ve really enjoyed life the past week. Iâ€™ve given many people great memories and hopefully theyâ€™ll learn a few lessons too.
