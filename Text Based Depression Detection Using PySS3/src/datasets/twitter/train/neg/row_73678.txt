Preparing for suicideIâ€™ve bought a long belt to hang myself and decided that over the next week Iâ€™m going to try isolate myself and sever ties with friends and family in order for it to be less painful for them. Reality is, while my friends have said theyâ€™d be sad if I died, I doubt theyâ€™d even notice if I isolate myself and stop seeing them and even if they do notice theyâ€™d probably just be happy to not have to deal with my depressed ass. They say theyâ€™d be sad but the reality is thatâ€™s just because itâ€™ll be a death and itâ€™s one theyâ€™d gef over quite quick. Unfortunately I know itâ€™d devastate my family but there isnâ€™t too much I can do about that. But yeah just though Iâ€™d share as I need to get it off my chest, thanks.
