My anxiety has gotten the best of meI won't allow myself to do anything I want, all I can think about is what will go wrong and how I'll let everyone down. Im a 23y.o guy that's in fairly good shape, I have a decent job, I'm a musician, and I feel like I'm pretty sociable. I've gone on a few dates over the years but the minute I start to feel close I back away because I'm to afraid to ruin a good thing. I haven't been intimate in 7 years and the more I feel like I'm getting better the more often I look at my life and realize how much of a waste of space I am. I live in south Florida, everyone's worried about Irma but I just hope it takes me so at least my family doesn't have to hear that I did it myself..
