I hate myself, and I'm tired of living with me.Hey everyone, I uhmm I'm not a very lonely person I have a family that loves me and I have little brothers that I adore. However as a kid I was often beaten, and I didn't have a really normal childhood. I was kind of ignored and let passed in school, and I never had luck with women. I've given up at this point (Please no more stuff about improvement and trying it pisses me off more.), I always wanted a gilfriend but I only had one or two women interested but it didn't work out. A few weeks ago, I decided to give it one last try by making a shit ton of dating accounts. I didn't get much, however I matched with this one particular girl on Tinder and we had a wonderful conversation I began to like her. However recently it seems as if she's ghosted, and I'm okay with it I expected this to happen. However I am very sad, and disappointed this opened a gateway for me to start bringing out my old problems, I realized I hate myself I hate myself for being so pathetic as to care about a girl I barely met, I hate myself for going to a shitty school and struggling in the class, I hate myself for being such a pussy, I hate myself for being stupid. I just wanna end it all, but my parents already loaned out money to pay for my degree ... I just don't want to deal with myself anymore, I am a shitty person and I made stupid decisions that got me where I am now in life.
