Why Suicide And Depression Define MeFor some reason, I am inherently unhappy, it seems. My life, on a very daily basis, revolves around how I can avoid this very physical feeling of despair and hopelessness that sits just beneath my level of consciousness. It rears its abhorrent head randomly, but often. My every day actions are done so in order to avoid this incredibly uncomfortable and sickly feeling. 

Let me keep this clear and straight. On paper, I live a wonderful life. I feel talented, handsome, secure financially, and loved. I have a girlfriend who loves me very much. I have parents who care for me very much. I have brothers (three) who want only the best for me. I even could be on track to be a physician and have graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry. I have a bright future.

Yet, I am miserable. I am bored, I am essentially unfulfilled, I feel paralyzed by anxiety, despair, and depression, and even more so, I often just want to kill myself purely because I know that whatever path I will take in life, I will have deep regrets. Being alive feels essentially like suffering; as in, when I think of what has defined me most, I think of depression. I just want to feel passionate again instead of feeling like killing myself.
