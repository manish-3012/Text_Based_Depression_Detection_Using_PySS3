FailedI just found out today that I got kicked out of my schools art program, because my adhd makes it hard for me to know when I'm too loud and because I messed up one of my projects. I'm planning to steal my mom's firearm( she is law enforcement ) and going to my art class on Monday and blowing my brains out. That art program was the only reason why my mom was proud. I'll never be an artist. I'll never be anything now.
