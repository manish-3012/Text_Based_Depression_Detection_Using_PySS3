It's my right to say I'm done with life.I don't want or need to talk about my problems, all anyone needs to know is that I tried, I fought hard and brave, but I lost, I don't want to feel like this anymore.

I'm 24 hours into VSED once again (basically suicide by dehydration) and I'm hoping to actually keep it up until I die this time.
