My younger sister has been suicidal for a long time and of course, I have always tried being there to help and be her punching bag. When am I allowed to give up?My sister (20) has been suicidal/depressed since she was about 13 years old and she has only gotten worse. It began when her closest friends in high school ditched her and turned everyone in her class against her. Since then she hasnâ€™t ever really recovered - did receive some help around then. She now refuses to seek any more help, says she will deal with it on her own and if it doesnâ€™t work and she decides to kill herself â€œsheâ€™s tried her bestâ€. 

Because of this decision and her being vehemently against any sort of help (she cut our parents out of her life because they tried to make her get help), I have been the only one she can turn to. 

She recently stopped being friends with her last remaining friend. I talk to her whenever she feels like it but it always seems like whatever I say makes her angry when all Iâ€™m doing is trying to help. Her reactions arenâ€™t that of a normal person so itâ€™s really hard to try and be there for her and making sure I donâ€™t make her angry while doing so. 

At this point, it really is affecting my mental health (have been working through my own depression) and I have no idea what to do. I canâ€™t imagine if the only person I could talk to decided to leave and would never want to but I also canâ€™t be her punching bag forever. She also says that if I try and make her get help she will hate me and cut me out too. Do I just let her?
