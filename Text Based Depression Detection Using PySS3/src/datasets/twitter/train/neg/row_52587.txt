Iâ€™m so far behind in life then the rest of my peers I think whatâ€™s the pointIâ€™m so far behind in life  Iâ€™m 24 dropped out of college. Only making 400 dollars a week. I went out last night for the first time in forever and felt so out of place it was unreal. People younger then me are talking about graduation and getting a good job. I wasnâ€™t ready to go to college my first time around. I dropped leaving me in a depressed state for almost three years. I became lazy and just not give a fuck about anything anymore. I regressed back so far it felt like I was 15. I lost weight and became  so weak. I have a hard time connecting to people. Girls think Iâ€™m attractive but they look at me funny when i start talking, like Iâ€™m crazy, which I donâ€™t blame them. Everyone else is growing and Iâ€™m still stuck at the same mental state. I want to go back to college but my gpa dropped so low during the start of my depression it would be a miracle for me to graduate. Also my brain just is not as fast or strong as it use to be. I would have to start over from scratch. Iâ€™m just about to give up and end it all.
