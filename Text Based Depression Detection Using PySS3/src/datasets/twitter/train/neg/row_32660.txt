No skills, no education, no hope.I'm done. I have no chance in this world. I'm in no way capable of ever getting a career, let alone a job that lets me live a good life. If I find one I'll hate it and be miserable every single day of my life. There's no reason to even try, no reason to fight anxiety for 60 years only to die poor and alone or in debt up to my neck. I'm only 23 and I've already given up on my life. I just want to die and be at peace.
