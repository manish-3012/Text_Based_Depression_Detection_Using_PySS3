LonelinessMy thoughts are plaguing me. I keep thinking about suicide and self-harm, but my conscious keeps telling me to not do it. And honestly I probably never would do such a thing, because I know two people who have committed suicide and I've seen the pain it caused.

But I feel so lonely. It is KILLING me.

No one on here knows anything about me so I'll dive right in. I am a 23 year old male. I've had confidence issues in the past, but I have done a damn good job overcoming them. So I like to say I am happy about myself. I think I am an attractive person. I have plenty of friends and a family that loves me.

Ok, there was the positive. Now the negative.

I have never had a "real" girlfriend. Real is in quotes because I've dated a few people, but it never turned into anything serious. I'm technically still a virgin. I say technically because of oral sex. But for the most part I'm very sexually inexperienced for someone of my age and physique. It's frustrating because I think anyone would be lucky to be with me. And then I see other people find SOs like taking candy from a baby. Earlier this year I went on a few dates with a girl, and I started to really like her. I even got to the point where I thought something would happen between us (stupid of me to jump to conclusions like that). We hooked up a few times and it was wonderful. Then one day I found out she's into my best friend.

I tried so hard to move on, and I did. I knew they were hanging out and hooking up regularly. But I said fuck it. Now they are dating. Every time I see them together it STINGS. I HATE hearing my friend talk about it. I've hung out/gone on dates with other girls since her but NONE of them are as good as her.

This felt like the final nail in the fucking coffin. After so much trial and error, I believed for YEARS there was "something wrong with me." And after so long I FINALLY convinced myself that was not true. And I finally found someone who I just felt... different about. And my friend steals the fucking show. He has everything I want and have wanted for so long. Every night when I go to bed I feel so lonely. And I have other friends getting engaged or into serious relationships whereas I'm always at square-fucking-one. Where I have been for years. At times I feel like such a loser, even though I know I'm not. I even stopped looking at those forever alone memes because they got too depressing.

I'm not asking for dating advice or any shit like that because I don't need that kind of advice. **This loneliness still stings.** And considering all of this went down in late August/early September, I should be over it by now. I'm not. I haven't told my friend because he'll think I'm an obsessive psycho who's still hung up on his girl. I love my friend. he's one of the best friends I've ever made and I don't want to end our friendship.

But I keep failing with women and it's KILLING me. I am so fucking far behind everyone else my age and I have learned to not give a fuck about rejection or failure or incompatibility, but **after a while it fucking gets to me.** I keep working to meet people and people like my friend just has shit fall into his fucking lap.

We as humans long for companionship. When we have it and it's taken away, we go through withdrawals. And it's something I have just never had. A voice in my head keeps telling me to end it. End the pain. Make it fucking stop. Then I chime in and say "no thats ridiculous." And then I find myself doing crazy shit like trying to figure out how to hang a rope from the pipes on my ceiling.

Do I want to die? No

Do I want the sting of loneliness to go away? Of course

When I take a step back and look at it all, I think "are you insane? you're going to throw away your life like that?" Then I think "Just make the pain stop. I've had enough." These dark, haunting thoughts won't go away.

Loneliness sucks out my soul.

Help.
