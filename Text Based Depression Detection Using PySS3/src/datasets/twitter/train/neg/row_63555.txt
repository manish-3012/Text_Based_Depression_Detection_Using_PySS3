My father killed himself 2 years ago. I have come to the conclusion that my life will not improve.I don't want to scare any of my family or friends. I am 24 years old, live at my grandparents, have contributed nothing to society, had a failed career in finance, and have been contemplating suicide for over 10 years. My life has never been good, i have had no consistent periods of happiness, and my girlfriend kicked me out over a year ago because of my depression. As i said, my father killed himself and told me he was going to get better 24 hours before he died. He knew. My mother has battled with depression and has even been hospitalized due to her depression. I had 4 aunts and 1 father. Only 1 aunt is left. I have experience the best of life, penthouses in Grand Cayman, and the lowest of life, homeless shelters etc. I have seen everything this world has to offer and the only thing that makes sense is this 9mm and wine in front of me. I have held a gun to my head multiple times. I have never told anyone of my suicidal thoughts. Hopefully someone has something to say.   

Edit: I already have a "good-bye" note written along with my bank account information. The only reason i have not done anything yet has been because of the promise i made my little brother that i would not kill myself. I think i am beyond this
