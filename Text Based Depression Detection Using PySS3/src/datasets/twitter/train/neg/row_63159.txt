Never been so alone.So, I have always had suicidal thoughts. Mostly fleeting but they have been a constant in my life. Now that I am out of an 8 year relationship I feel truely alone. I don't miss her I miss having someone to talk to. But now I have no one and my thoughts are eatting me alive. I write to vent my frustrations and that does help me a bit but now I feel my self falling into bad habits. Not gonna go into detail because I am not sure how this sub deals with triggering subjects.

Not sure what I hope to gain here. Just getting my feelings off my chest I guess. 

I just want to feel something positive again.
