My girls are gone in the morningI'm losing my girls in the morning and I don't know how I'm going to be ok with it. Their dad was abusive and barely ever spent time with them and I can't go with them. I've tried everything I could to get the money I was short to provide for them after our life was flipped upside down when my landlord was convicted of violent crimes against children and adults and he had pictures of them in his phone. I'm freaking out.
