so much pain. idk what to do anymoreim 26, employed full time, earn 23k/yr and cant afford to take care of my health issues. my teeth have all rotten and they are starting to become unbearable. Cant afford insurance, actually i cant really afford anything. I live in a trailer in someones backyard because its the only place i can afford. i got myself into big debt trying to save my teeth and for nothing. 
And thats just the new things. ive been wanting to die since i was 10. Never found a point to life. And life never found a point to me. I have no friends, my family dislikes me, never been in a relationship or been told im loved, look like a crack head but i dont even drink. is there really an answer thats not suicide? And why would i want to continue this pain
