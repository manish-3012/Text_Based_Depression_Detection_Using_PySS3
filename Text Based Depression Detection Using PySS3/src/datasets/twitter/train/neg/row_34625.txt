I fantasize about my family and loved ones disowning/stopping caring about me so I can end everything and be at peaceYou're selfish if you end it for all the mess you leave behind but no one understands how hard it is to be okay sometimes. I've tried medication. I've tried therapy. I've felt like this for as far back as I can recall. More than a quarter of my life is over.. I'm just going to drag it on for as long as I can and end everything. I'll never not feel alone and pathetic. I want to feel nothing. I want to stop waking up in tears because I've been crying in my sleep again. I want to stop being disgusted with myself. I know how I'm going to go out. I don't want to talk about that cause that might trigger people. I don't know why I made this post just that maybe talking to internet strangers would make me stop feeling this soul crushing loneliness.
