I don't have the energy to make a throwaway accountI'm so tired and sad an I feel like nothing is worth it. I'm too tired to talk to anyone so I'm turning here. I spent the last hour looking for ways to kill myself but I can't find any that will work so maybe that's a sign of something. I guess. I have severe clinical depression and anxiety so everyday is unbelievably hard. I just don't know if I can do it anymore and I really need lifting up. I hate asking for things but if you could just leave a saying or something that might make me feel a little better please do. Thanks
