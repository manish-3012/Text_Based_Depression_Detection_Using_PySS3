Iâ€™m exhaustedIâ€™ve been sick for 6 years and it got worse cause my retarded mother made me stay in college when I knew Iâ€™d eventually fall apart. The worse part of it all is my memory loss, physical insensitive ( I barely feel the morning smell of dew, the cool air of the night, pain) Iâ€™m exhausted all the time, Im a charity case at my cousins restaurant, learning slow as shit as a result. The only thing barely holding me together is my girlfriend who has gone for a trip for a week. I cannot be selfish, so I havenâ€™t tried to talk to her and let her enjoy her trip. 

Iâ€™m fucken exhausted, fuck my mom fuck this shitty specialist doctor that messed me up. Fuck. 

From the beginning of my life all I wanted to do was join the military get myself killed saving others and now I just want to end it. Now she is here holding my humpty dumpty pieces together with elmers glue that fall apart without constant care.

I just google how to end it painlessly, oh my god I donâ€™t want to do it but Iâ€™m so damned exhausted, i made a promise with her and thats the only thing Iâ€™m have. These frail words. Fuckkkk living is so hard when everyday all I remember is pain and exhaustion. Like that film where he cant remember the next day and has to solve the murder of his girlfriend or something with jake gyllenhaal or something. Iâ€™m crying my eyes out typing this fuckkkk.

All I wanted to do was go to the military to get my poor ass out of poverty and then medical shool, but if I wasnâ€™t sick I wouldnâ€™t have found my partner fuck life is fucken unfair
