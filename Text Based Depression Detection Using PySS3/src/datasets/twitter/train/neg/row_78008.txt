What I was going to do with my last $300I live in a major city that just had its gun ban lifted. I can't tie knots so the timing seemed perfect.

I'm 28. I was fired from my job and my girlfriend is leaving to get her masters. I had both the job and the girl for 3 years. Unfortunately, this is the 3rd time I've gone through a fired + dumped cycle like this.

Since college I've been on/off various antidepressants (Paxil, Wellbutrin) and anxiolytics (Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin). I've also been on ADD medications (Strattera, Adderall XR, and Vyvanse). 

Early this year I was feeling blue and my doctor put me on Cymbalta. This med was the beginning of the end for me. My productivity at work plummeted and I couldn't talk to anyone. I would lay in bed and do nothing; hide from the phone and avoid email. 

After fucking around with the dosage for a couple months, my doctor finally had me start the withdrawal process. Good news, Everyone! SSRI discontinuation syndrome (the "Zaps") is alive and well for SNRIs. (Props to Lilly for convincing the FDA to call it discontinuation instead of withdrawl).

Anyway, I don't have the $300 anymore and am being ambushed with $35.00 overdraft fees. My health insurance will end this month since I can't pay the COBRA dues. An eviction and car repossession are imminent. My savings and 401k are drained and I have no family to turn to.

TL;DR -- I've been fired/dumped 3 times in the past 7 years and don't have the energy or resources to rebuild this time.
