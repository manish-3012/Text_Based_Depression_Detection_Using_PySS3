I can't take it, I'm doneI've been suicidal for the past 4 years on and off. I can't do it anymore. I've tried therapy, medication, and it's just not working. This depression is too much. 

Not to mention, there is nobody who would be worse off if I was gone. It would benefit some people, like my family. I'm a huge financial burden on them. I'm in college, so that's a lot of money. I can't seem to get a job no matter how hard I try. I cost too much. That money would be so much better spent on my younger siblings. I want them to go to good colleges and do well in life. I want everything for them. I don't matter to me, but they do.

It's not like I have very many friends anyway. I have one good friend, and I feel terrible for doing this to her, but I feel like I have no choice.

I don't know how I want to die, but I want it soon. I'm thinking possibly tonight, or tomorrow. I'm done, I just feel so done with life.
