Is there a point to living?What if you can't work or go to school, what exactly is the point of being alive? Without those it seems you can't live a normal life. No I'm not going to work for minumum wage. I can't even relate to people cause they all are consumed by their job. What if you don't want to work for the rest of your life? 

I really see no point in staying alive, I think the small amount of people who care about me will understand as well. People thought I needed Zoloft at a young age and all that did was permanently ruin me, I was a test rat for the many anti depressent meds. I get literally every side effect for every drug, what the fuck is the point of a drug when it gives you another problem you will have to take another drug for?
