My friend shot himself last week.Me and this guy lived together for two years splitting an apartment.

One night he stabbed his girlfriend, ran to our place and shot himself while I was in the restroom. I cant even imagine why anyone would do that.

I've felt suicidal before,but after witnessing that it's given me a new perspective on it. I saw what it did to his family and friends. 

I just really miss my friend.
