I'm out of here âœŒðŸ¼Don't feel the need to write a paragraph convincing me to stay, this is the best decision I've ever made for myself. Every single waking up I'm plagued by my mental state. I'm in pain every waking moment. It takes everything in me to hold it together. I've been holding it together mostly because of my daughter but I can't do it anymore I've tried so hard. I don't want her to think that her mom was weak and didn't try, I've tried and tried. It's to the point that my suffering would be detrimental to her upbringing more than the suffering of my loss. Luckily she's only 2 and she won't remember too much about me and luckily I have a decent enough family to look out after her. I hope you all have great lives â™¥ï¸ please bring out more awareness regarding the importance of mental health, mental illness is real and it's a fucking cancer. Time to be relieved from this mental hell/prison I've been living in for over a decade.
