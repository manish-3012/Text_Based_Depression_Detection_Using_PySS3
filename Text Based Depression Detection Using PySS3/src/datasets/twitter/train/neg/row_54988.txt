If I donâ€™t have a job lined up by May 18th Iâ€™m going to kill myself.Iâ€™m in my last year of university and despite all my efforts I still canâ€™t land a job. On paper Iâ€™m doing everything right, I have a high GPA (3.72) Iâ€™m involved professionally in a lot of different professional organizations, Iâ€™m the president of my own society on campus and I regularly host c-suite level executives for events. And despite all that, I still canâ€™t get a fucking job. Every time I think Iâ€™m close to finally landing something itâ€™s snatched right out of my hands. Iâ€™ve been on at least a dozen interviews this semester alone, and made it to the 2nd round for at least 2 of them and still nothing. Iâ€™ve been dealing with this kind of rejection for 4 years straight and I just canâ€™t fucking take it anymore. If I graduate and I donâ€™t have a job immediately lined up then Iâ€™ll be stuck in limbo of non-experience that Iâ€™ll never be able to break out off. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve decided, if I donâ€™t have a job lined up by the time I graduate in May Iâ€™m going to kill myself. Iâ€™ve picked May 18th for the date.
