The lie of "reaching out for help"I feel so trapped. I'm so suicidal, but whenever I encounter hotlines or counselors, I know telling the truth will get me committed, because often I do have a plan. I have tried killing myself multiple times this year.

They always tell you to reach out, and to call this or that number, ect ect. I've tried all of that and I realize that nobody actually cares. I've told only two people, but trying to talk to them about it just ends with them telling me to talk to a professional, which will end with me in a hospital with everything that's keeping me going taken away.

I just tried to talk to my SO about it again, after spending the day researching methods and darkweb markets. SO told me they were "sleeping" although they've been on their phone for hours.

I told my best friend about it maybe a month ago, and they're unable to make time for me when I need to talk to someone.

I realize that this whole "reach out, people care" is a lie. Even if I wanted help, it wouldn't be possible due to the system set up.

I'll be killing myself soon
