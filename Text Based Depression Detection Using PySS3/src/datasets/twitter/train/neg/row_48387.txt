I'm 21, broke and unable to find my spark in life.I'm deeply miserable. 
I thought going onto anti-depressants would help me function as a human being and all it's doing now is making me feel worse than I did before. I wake up each morning feeling like death, I fear leaving house, I fear eating and due to my PTSD caused by the sexual abuse of an ex, I cannot get a normal job. 

Everyone forces me to stick with my degree. They did even after I admitted I was for two years getting continuously abused by my ex and it's gotten to the point where my degree seems to matter more than my mental health. I don't want to be a criminologist. I just want to transfer into fashion design. I love sewing rather than writing essays about rapists, and murderers. 

I just feel maybe if I left life, then people could understand that I needed time to get myself better rather than to keep my head down and study things which make me feel disgusted with the human race.
