My life is crumbling around me.. I don't want to die, but I am losing hope so quicklyI just found out my boyfriend has been cheating on me. He has been sleeping with this one girl on and off the past 10 months, and another girl for a couple months. I'm devastated, we have talked about getting married. He was the one I wanted to live my life with.

My sister is on drugs. She doesn't talk to the family much at all anymore and is with a man older than our mom. I feel partially responsible for not being there for her more, and now she is diving head first into the deep end.

I got fired from my job about a month and a half ago. 

My dog died in December. I found her body. She was my best friend. 

I am 25 and living with my dad and his girlfriend. The girlfriend hates me. I will never amount to anything. My plans have been set on getting a good job and moving in with my boyfriend. I can't believe he's been cheating on me. I feel so worthless. I feel so fucking hopeless. 

The suicidal thoughts are creeping back in. Everyone would be better without me, I wouldn't hurt if I was gone. I don't want to die, but fuck! I don't want to be here!
