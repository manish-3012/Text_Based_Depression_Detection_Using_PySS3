I don't want to do this anymore.I'm just sick of feeling so depressed. I'm tired of feeling pathetic and useless. I was recently discharged honorably from the Navy for depression, and now I'm back home trying to live a normal life. Sure, I'm around friends a lot, but I can't help but feel like there's some hidden disappointment in the looks they give me. I feel like my family is the most disappointed. I try my best in everything I do, but I still feel like its not enough. I've been single for several years now, but I've been lead on multiple times in the span of those years somewhat speeding up my spiral into depression. I don't know why people like toying with me but they do. I must be the most hideous, boring, unlikeable person out there by the way some people look and act around me. I'm done typing now. I just thought I'd try and reach out before I ended my own life, I'm not expecting much response, but I could still try and give myself that one last raised hope before I end it all.
