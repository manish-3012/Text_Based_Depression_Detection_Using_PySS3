I really don't know what to do anymore.Iâ€™m so tired of living, I donâ€™t want to live any longer since for some reason nothing makes me feel alive and everything is so pointless to me.

I donâ€™t want to work for the rest of my life.
I donâ€™t want any friends or nothing.
I donâ€™t want anything itâ€™s all pointless.
I truly just want to be dead, so I donâ€™t have to do anything and just be gone hopefully.

Iâ€™m running out of hope to keep on pushing thru and running out of â€œexcusesâ€ my parents say since I donâ€™t want to do anything.

If only it was way easier to build my courage to just fucking neck myself or any way to kill myself, hopefully one day I just snap and do it.
