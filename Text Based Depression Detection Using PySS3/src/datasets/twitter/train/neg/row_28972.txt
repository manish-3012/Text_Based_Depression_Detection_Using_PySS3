Contemplating on suicideAt the beginning of this year, I was in one of the lowest points of my life. I didnâ€™t talk to anyone about anything and I kept quiet all the time. I came home everyday with parents arguing and itâ€™s always my fault for some reason. My life got a little bit better during the summer and I finally got out of that state. The past couple weeks were so shitty with everything happening right now in my life. I sat down with my mom today to talk about what has happened, long story short she doesnâ€™t give a shit. She acts like she does but she literally doesnâ€™t even listen to anything I say. She will never hear me out because of what? Iâ€™m the youngest child? She likes my sister more than me? I told her I wanted to end my life in early april of this year, she literally just had a straight face and said ok. That shit that she just did pissed me off now i wanna actually just kill myself cuz obviously no one fucking cares if my parents donâ€™t.
