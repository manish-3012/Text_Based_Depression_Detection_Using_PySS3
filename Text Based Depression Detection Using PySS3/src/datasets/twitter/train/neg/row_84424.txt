Iâ€™ve pushed everyone that cared for me away.Iâ€™m scared of being alone dying alone and living along. I pushed all the things that made me feel less lonely Because I was scared of being lonely I donâ€™t know what to do at this point. It feels like the end. Like thereâ€™s no more to life. I need help and Iâ€™ve been asking for help from the people who seem to care for me but they donâ€™t notice.
