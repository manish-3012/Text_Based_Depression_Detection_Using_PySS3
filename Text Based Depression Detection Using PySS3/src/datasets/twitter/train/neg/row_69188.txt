I desperately want to kill myselfI have a vestibular disorder.  I feel light headed ALL the time and now I am suffering from vertigo. I called in sick at work today.  I feel I wont be able to work much longer.  I am useless.  I have sooo many friends and people that love me, I have always been a charasmatic perso  that has limitless talents. To have that potential makes it harder to love this way.

I have also loved with psychosis and depression for almost my entire life.  Everyday now is hell.  I have heard it a million times "dont do it, be strong, think of loved ones." even the tuff love ones.  I have tried everything under the sun to get better. believe me when I say that. i really truly have. my head hurts so bad that even crying is hell.

No doctor can do anything. i have been to every specialist out there. i have had every test done known to man.

I have more or less come to terms that as many people as this will destroy, people who know me are just going to have to live with the fact that I killed myself. I know i cant talk methods of doing it in this thread. I just wish I had a more humane way of doing it the  what I am gonns do, because it takes a LOT of balls to go out.
