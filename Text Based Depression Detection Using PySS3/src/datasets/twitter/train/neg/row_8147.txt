Iâ€™m 17, I want to kill myself, Iâ€™m being bullied, I was sexually abused when i was younger etc. I need help/advice.. just someone to talk to as well I never told anyone about this, but when i was around 6 years old, I was sexually abused by an adult, I was trying to get away from him, but couldn't. He grabbed me and tried getting my clothes off and succeeded, he looked like he was enjoying it, i was scared beyond believe and was in a panic while this was happening, He did things to me, i tried to kick him away, but i couldn't and he did things.. I've never told anyone about this, i tried to put it away and not think about it, It happened nearly 11 years ago and i can't forget that day. I never told my parents, I told no one and the guy got away with it. 

I've been bullied since I've been Secondary school, nearly every day. They never quit with it. I never talk to them, I've never insulted them or been rude to anyone in the school.
I tried talking to a friend but she was uncomfortable with the situation, she was the only one i could trust with this situation. I canâ€™t talk to my parents about this.. because itâ€™s way too hard to open up, Iâ€™ve tried a few times but i automatically think about their feelings and I know what theyâ€™re feeling and i canâ€™t take it. I cut myself a lot, i know itâ€™s stupid to do but i canâ€™t stop doing it.
Iâ€™ve tried talking to a therapist, but I canâ€™t open up no matter how much I try.  I tried switching but it didnâ€™t help either.   Iâ€™ve tried to commit suicide a few times and failed, but the next time i wonâ€™t fail, once i do what i planned,  I wonâ€™t be able to turn back even if i wanted to. I already wrote a suicide note and have it finished, Iâ€™ve deleted my accounts etc sorted out some personal things. 

I made this topic in the hope i could get some help from people, I know i donâ€™t know you people.
But maybe i can open up since Iâ€™ll be anonymous and no one will know who i am. This is my last attempt at getting help.
Iâ€™m hoping for advice and if possible someone to talk to.
