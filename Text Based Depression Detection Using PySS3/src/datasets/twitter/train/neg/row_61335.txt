its so depressing to rememberits depressing to remember how alike we all are when we die. we all eventually have our lives â€˜endedâ€™, even if not by our own hands, it still ends miserably. 

so why do i still want to kill myself with my own hands? i need help, somehow. i cant live this way for too long knowing in the back of my mind that im not fully functional as a human, with survival slowly falling away from my top 5 important things in my life. god, i feel the rage inside, itâ€™s both pushing me toward action and pulling me away from action. is it good or bad action? im past disoriented to figure that out.
