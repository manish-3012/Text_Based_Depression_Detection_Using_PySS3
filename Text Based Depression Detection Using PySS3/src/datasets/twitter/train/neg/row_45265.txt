It would be better to avoid all the struggle and skip to the end right?Last year my parents told me I need to be going to University or have a job by new years or they'll kick me out. Since new years is soon and I can't afford university and I suck at working it seems like I'll be homeless. Since middle I thought being homeless would be fine, but now it seems like it would be almost as hard as working and paying to live. So suicide would be better than living rest of my life homeless right?
