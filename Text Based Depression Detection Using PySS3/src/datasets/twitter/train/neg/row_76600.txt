I don't want to liveLook, if I really do go through with this and cease living, I'd at least want people to know why.

Growing up, I was never the best at anything. I wasn't the best looking, or the hardest working, or the smartest, or the funniest, so what was, or rather, what AM I? I've spent years trying to fit into every mold, pretending to be something that I wasn't. But, I've recently found out who I truly was, and I can't stand it. 

I hate how obsessive I am over my ex, thinking about her day after day after DAY AFTER DAY, holding on to a non-existent thread of hope that she might feel the same way, and STILL not accepting that she's just not into me anymore. You'd think that she'd broken up with me with how much I still care for her, but that's not true. I sincerely believe that there's no girl out there for me, so I treat it like she's the only one that might ever love me, because let's face it, I'm never gonna get into another relationship. I've already given up hope on that.

I hate how annoying I am. I talk far too much when I get to know a person, and talk far too little when I'm trying to get to know them. I'm so socially inept that it's funny. I don't know how to start a good conversation, or how to talk to somebody when I need something from them. I just stand there like an idiot. Why am I typing this? Nobody cares.

I hate myself. I wish that I was never born. I hope that somebody will just come up to me and shopt me in my head. I want to get into a car wreck and die on impact. I don't care about any of the things I own. I don't want to do anything. For the people that do like me, why? Why the fuck do you enjoy my company? I'm a nuisance, a waste of air, a waste of space. A despicable human being that should not exist. I hate living
