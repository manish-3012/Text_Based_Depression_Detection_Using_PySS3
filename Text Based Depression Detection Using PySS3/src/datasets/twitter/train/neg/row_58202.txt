I figure I may as well see a doctor, nothing to loseAfter my recent break up my anxiety has slipped into near depression I think, I've contemplated killing myself but couldn't bring myself to do it.

I figure I may as well go see a doctor, I mean what's the worst that can happen. I can't feel any worse than I do now.
