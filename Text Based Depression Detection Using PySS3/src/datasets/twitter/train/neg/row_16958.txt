Last time I posted my suicide letter it went horribly, so here I go again.No 12,000 character spiel about my life that doesn't explain anything anyway. Gotta do this better.

I had a shitty abusive dad and a cheating whore of a mom who left me alone to live with my grandparents who always treated me like a burden.

I was raped by my cousin brother.

I always wanted to have a girlfriend, someone who'd care while I was suffering, but girls were actively disgusted by how fat and ugly I was.

I tried therapy and medication for 5 years and it made me worse.

I worked out and worked with a dietitian for 2 years and it made me worse.

I moved out to a new college and new city and it made everything worse.

I had paid sex to try and get it over with and it didn't help with anything.

It doesn't get better.

I will never get to experience romantic intimacy with a girl in my life. And so I must kill myself.

TL;DR useless ugly fat kissless 19 year old loser who can't even be a normal incel and harass girls/be sexual because I had my sexuality completely broken and no way out
