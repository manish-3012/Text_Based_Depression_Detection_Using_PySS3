I found my father's suicide letterYep. I fucking find it on his computer. And it was right on the desktop. He didn't even bother to hide it. I know he has some suicidal attitudes but writing a letter? I'm fucking worried every time he is out for some business things. So what to do? Should I talk with mom or I dont know someone?
