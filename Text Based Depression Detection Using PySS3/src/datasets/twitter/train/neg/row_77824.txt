Why is life pointlessAll I do is sell weed... I sit in my room all day long, rude people coming in and out. Using me and stealing, lying to me. Never helping me out and always needing me and I dont wanna do it. Im stuck though. Ive been in this rut since 14 and im 24. Im trying to figure my life out. Nothing interests me or is entertaining. I hate video games now. My parents donâ€™t hardly speak to me or include me(not because of weed) they just dont like me. I dont see the point of working everyday and making money to give it all away to bills to not have a good house or car. No good jobs anywhere. 200 a week doesnt cut it and neither does dealing weed.. whats the point. In working to die anyways... so I wanna just end it.. idc to carry on when Im just working and hating life and everything around me being bland and boring and i cant handle it anymore im empty inside and theres alot to it. I just really wanna be gone. I try to overdose 2 times a week but drugs dont work so well. Im addicted to pills because I try to od and it never works i just pass out.. I hate the world if were honest... i hate how nibody is ever there for me so Im posting here
