Whatâ€™s the point of it?Everyday just seems like repetitive bullshit. If I died today, would anything matter? Sure, my family would be destroyed by something like that but I feel like I wouldnâ€™t be in a place where Iâ€™d care anymore. Hell, theyâ€™ll all die too at some point. 

I just canâ€™t find any good reasons to live for.
