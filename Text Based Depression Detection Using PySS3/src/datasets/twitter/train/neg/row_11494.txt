Friend contemplating suicide - How can i help?I've recently learned that my friend is extremely suicidal. Today she posted on her 'alternate' instagram page that she doesn't know I know about:
"Wrote my note. Cleaned and tossed things, selling &amp; getting rid of stuff. All my money is going towards my friend who is suffering. It's not like I'll need the money if I'm dead anyway."

Having been recently worried about her, I took a quick trip to the town that she lives in (about 20 minutes away) to go for coffee and see how she was feeling. Over coffee she seemed normal, laughing and making conversation, but later that night once I had left, she posted the above quote on her Instagram.

She's been through therapy, on medication, and any number of other options to counter her depression, but I'm not sure if any of it seems to work. She seems hesitant to trust me with anything, only telling me that she was having suicidal thoughts a few days ago while she was tipsy, and refusing to reply further, or pick up the phone when I called her.

Her and I have a bit of a history together. We were best friends for about 4 years. Two years ago we took a step towards being in a relationship together, going out for about 4 months until she ended it due to how emotionally distant she was with me. I didn't understand how she was feeling at the time. I later learned that in the couple of months after the breakup she had become extremely depressed and suicidal. This was all 2 years ago, however, and after I learned she was in therapy I had hoped that some of the outstanding issues would be dealt with.

My current method of trying to reach through her trust issues and help her has been to use an anonymous account on Instagram to reach out to her, as she places more trust in anonymous strangers than she does in any friends or family. What else can I do to reach out to her and let her know that she is loved? Let her know that I need her the stay on this world?

I'm normally extremely good at helping people solve their issues, but this... I don't know where to begin with this. I'm at a complete loss. I'm sorry if this was incoherent, I'm in a bit of a state of shock right now.

Edit:
To elaborate on some of the points made in r/SWResources:

**Does she have a plan?**

Yes. She has access to pills and razor blades that can possibly be used to end her life. She is a known cutter.

**How immediately lethal is her plan?**

I understand that razor blades can often fail, but pills... Not sure what sort of pills they are. I'm going to assume they are deadly, though.

**What is her history?**

I believe that she has contemplated, if not attempted, suicide in the past (within 2 years, if not sooner).

**Outer Resources?**

600 instagram followers, several of whom are extremely supportive of her. She trusts these people.

Myself. She knows that I'm here for her, but I think she's afraid to trust me.

Not religious.

A therapist that she visits irregularly, but I'm unsure of how much she trusts them.

**Inner Resources**

Not too much under this category, I believe she can be extremely strong willed and stubborn if she's in the right mood, but she's extremely depressed and claims nothing makes her happy. 

**Factors**

Her pet dog is close to death, and I believe has cancer. I believe that this will be the turning point for her.

I believe her to be clinically depressed.

Lack of family support for her mental state.

Blames herself for all her issues. This is one I don't know how to deal with - Can i redirect blame somewhere? Can I take away blame? 

Please let me know if you need any more information. I believe that I know her better than anyone else, but I just don't know how to help.
