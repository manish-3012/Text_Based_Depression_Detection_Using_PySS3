Think Iâ€™m done for real this timePeople probably donâ€™t believe me because Iâ€™ve said it before, but Iâ€™m calmer now. Iâ€™ve realised family is fake, I have no friends, no money, dead end job, no career aspirations, no goals, broken car. 

I work in the healthcare industry I witness everyday how hard it is to get help. My lifeâ€™s done now, Iâ€™ll just cherish some good memories I had. But thereâ€™s no coming back now. Itâ€™s torture waking up everyday. 

Peace
