I just don't know what to doFor about 2 years I've had depression, I quit school at 17, traveled around, got a lot of short term jobs. I'm back home now, I hate it, I feel so fucking lonely, I like nothing. I don't wanna work, I don't wanna do anything. I've tried to apply for so many jobs, I have no motivation to do anything. Even shitty jobs are difficult to get with a felony. I set unrealistic goals for myself and I can't set for any lower.
