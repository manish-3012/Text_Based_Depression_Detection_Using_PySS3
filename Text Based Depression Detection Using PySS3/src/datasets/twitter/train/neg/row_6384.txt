In the zone againI wish I didnâ€™t have the guilt of potentially hurting my family if I killed myself. It would make it so much easier to just get it over with and end the suffering. Why do they have to pop in my brain when Iâ€™m trying? Why donâ€™t they just stop? They say they love me and donâ€™t understand the mental anguish I go through everyday. Why donâ€™t they understand that letting me go would be the ultimate kindness for me?  I am the least selfish person in the world and when I try to take control of it and finally do myself a favour to stop the insanity, there they are telling me to snap out of it. Donâ€™t they understand that there are no other options? Did  therapy and took meds. Nothing. Why canâ€™t I be in control of anything?
