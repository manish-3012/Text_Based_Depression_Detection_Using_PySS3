tired of up and downsI have been battling these thoughts since the first time I tried to commit suicide at age of 12, I wrote a note and everything and at that time felt like my family would be better off... less mouth to feed etc etc.

Now I'm 31 and the thought of mortality has been constant. Although I think about ending it from time to time ... I also get scared of death. Its an exhausting thought. 

I have bought up that I'm depressed to my mom, she brushes it off. 
To give you context, in our native country... psychiatry or anti-depressants are a taboo or a no-no. So even from me seeking it as a teen my mother felt like it was not an option so I sucked it up.

It wasn't till my late 20's that I started going to therapy but had to stop because she switched insurance and I'm reluctant to take anti depressants. 

I do weigh the consequences and try to think of accomplishments... but sometimes it feels unbearable, like the voice in my head telling me I'm worthless.... that people at work would be better off because I'm slowing them down.... that I'm a burden to my family.... that I freak guys out thats why I get ghosted on so I'll be doing the male population a favor.... that I don't have much to offer

Sometimes i think about slowly cleaning out my desk at work so if it does happen... it would be easier to cleanup. 

I'm just tired of feeling like this .... I'm tired of feeling so down and then so positive knowing fully well it will be shit again. 

How should I function , go to work ... pay my rent ... try to be social ... when I feel like such a burden... when sometimes I want to put a bag over my head because I feel bad that people have to lay their eyes on me ... that I let people down... I'm just tired
