I know I'm different.  I'm in love with my misery.What if being miserable has been crippling to you for so long that half of you actually has grown to enjoy it?

It's disgusting.

While I cry so so so so hard at night praying to feel better and praying for the sadness to go away, half of me feels incomplete without it.  It makes me whole.  It makes me me.  It has effected my life more than anything.

Depression has warped and skewed and shaped me.  I walk around every day looking at those around me.  When I saw that the r/depression had 5000 something readers, it just made me think how me thinking I had a serious problem and something was wrong with me was just the normal in our society.  Almost everyone today is under the impression that they are "depressed" and need medicine.  I am just another one of the fools that bought into the media telling us we fit the stereotype and need to be medicated.

I have taken many different medications and have gone through many different experiences that have made me grow as a person.  But I know that I want to kill myself.  Depression and sadness has consumed my life.  But unlike everyone else, I want people to see.  I want everyone to know how much I am suffering.  I want to get out of this fucked up world myself.

Whenever I deem myself ready, I am going to end my life myself.  It will be in my hands.  I do not belong here.  Part of me loves the sadness, and it sickens me, so I know I will live the rest of my life unhappy.
