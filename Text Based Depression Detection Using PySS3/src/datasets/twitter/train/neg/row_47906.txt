Just found out that an old friend of mine killed himself a few months ago.He was a good honest white kid who had been dating an Iranian girl for 6 years. Because of cultural differences, the father would not allow his daughter to marry a white man. So she broke it off.

He was devastated. He told her she was going to end it all, but she didn't call the police or his mother. She just left it alone. 

He shot himself in the head shortly after.

His entire family has been devastated ever since. His mother writes to me almost every day telling me how much she misses him.

So... if you are feeling suicidal, or know someone who is feeling suicidal - get help! No one will judge you for erring on the side of caution. And no one will judge you for feeling the way you feel, people are out there who can help.
