Woke up after attemptingI hung myself using the partial suspension method. I thought I did it pretty well and I wrote my note and left it beside me. The last thing I felt before I passed out was ringing in my ears, and a sharp tinglingly feeling in my face and tongue. I think the rope loosened or something cause I woke up with a migraine and pain all over my face. Most people (from what I've read) say it's a "sign" or something. Nah. I'm most likely just going to try it again tomorrow with some better rope. 
Thanks for taking the time to listen.
