Alone and scaredI've been struggling with depression for almost 10 years now. It's always been managable.. I'd have my down days, but after a while I'd be back up again. But lately, I just can't seem to pick myself back up. 

I feel down all the time. I have this constant ache in my chest that won't go away, and I'm struggling to get out of bed in the morning. I've lost my appetite, I don't leave the house except to go to work, all I want to do is stay in bed.

I feel so worthless, like I'm a failure. I hate myself. I have no friends left, because they all stopped contacting me. I have no direction in my life. I feel like I will never make anything of myself. But most of all, I hate myself for feeling this way. I wish that I could pick myself up and be happy. I hate that I bring everyone around me down. 

All I can think about lately is dying. I'm so tired of this constant struggle. I don't want to do it anymore. I can't. I just want it to be over. I'm tired of putting on a happy face and pretending that everything is fine when I'm hurting so badly inside. I want to go to sleep and not wake up. It scares me that I feel this way, but it seems like the only answer, the only solution to all of my problems. I can't hurt anymore if I'm dead.
