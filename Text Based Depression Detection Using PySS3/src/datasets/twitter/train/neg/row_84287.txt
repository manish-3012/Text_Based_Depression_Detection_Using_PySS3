I feel like I need to tell someone, so here.Before this all happened, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, and Mild Depression, making this whole experience worse.

I had swallowed 30+ of just random pills. I don't even know what most were, I just ate them. I have no memory about what happened after I got half way up my stairs, but I woke up in my bed about 27 hours later with such a terrible pain, well, *everywhere* . For a couple hours I couldn't figure out what the hell was going on.

 I never told anyone because I have trust issues about personal things. I continued going to school, and the whole week my grades spiraled down. I would just sit there, and either sleep, or play on my phone. I told everyone that it was just from a lack of interest in school anymore, and I'm pretty sure they all believed it. 

As for recovering from it.. I haven't really made progress from that yet. Almost everyday I'm still having thoughts of trying again, but never go through with it. If I had to be completely honest, the only reason I haven't tried to kill myself again is because mthe cat gets extremely depressed when I'm gone for multiple days. 

I have tried getting therapy, but it hasn't helped at all. I'm not the best at confrontation about issues, so none of my friends really know about it. Well, *one* did, but she's gone now. She moved to another state. I'll add more to this if I feel like it later, but right now it seems to long.
Sorry for the format, I'm on mobile.
