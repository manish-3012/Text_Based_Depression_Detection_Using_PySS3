How can i push myself to do my school requirements????? (self sabotaging)Hi.  I am anon-Q, 

# How can i push myself to do my school requirements?

My situation at this moment: 

* I am new to reddit. 
* I am a grade 11 Stem student
* I recently transferred in home school program.
* I broke up with my girlfriend last year. 
* I just disappeared completely to all of my friends without giving them any reasons. (got no friends anymore)
* I am avoiding any social interactions. (9 months on my room)
* I am not talking to my family not because i don't want to but because they just don't understand me. *(they are not interested and  judgemental.)* 
* I am just in bed for almost 90 % of my time per day. 
* I am numbing myself by either sleeping all day or surfing Youtube videos. 
* Sometimes i don't even bother eating or brushing my teeth.
* Bad surge of memories keep stabbing my mind. 

**and I haven't done any school work for the past 8 weeks now. (projects, quiz and homework) and i really don't care about grades anymore.**

The reason why is   
First: **i'll probably going to kill myself in the future.**  
Second: i have bipolar depression again (8 weeks)  
Third: I am suicidal for almost 8 years now 

and more...  


I self harm and self sabotage and i don't know why. I have dreams and ambition but i always find myself to fuck it up.   
Its like I am hurting myself inside and outside.   
I know discipline is the answer but i don't have any strong reason why to even bother to discipline myself.   
I feel like i am self sabotaging myself so that i can have enough reason to kill myself.  
If the time comes that i fail and got kick out then maybe i'll have enough reason.   
I am not even procrastinating I am just waiting for my big bad day to just push myself to end it.    
The thing with me is that for the past 8 years i am always in a cycle of up and down and i am tired. 

I am just tired.   
why do i even bother if i am just going to fuck it up again. 

I don't know...   
I don't know anymore.   
Maybe i am asking for advise on what strong reason why to fight on this war. 

the war to not kill myself.
