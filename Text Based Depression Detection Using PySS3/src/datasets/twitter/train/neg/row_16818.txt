I'm 13 and i just finished watching suicide squadso i was looking for people to discuss it with, so i typed suicide and was about to add squad but this was the first subreddit to show up, so i went here and it hurts to see people are this broken, well um I'm sorry for anyone that feels this way and hope they get better
