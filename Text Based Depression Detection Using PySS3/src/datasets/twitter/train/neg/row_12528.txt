Suicidal thoughts are comforting meI have been overthinking every decision and am not sure what to believe anymore, my biggest fear is mental health and I have been having anxiety attacks that Iâ€™m going schizophrenic, i over think everything I do and constantly question if Iâ€™m going schizophrenic, I canâ€™t sleep and I am having panic attacks, Iâ€™m drained and am slowly giving up, I am feeling very low then i fell better, itâ€™s back and forth, Suicidal thoughts are so comforting, to finally be at peace, i want to get it over and done with but I also want to live, itâ€™s confusing but this is to much.
