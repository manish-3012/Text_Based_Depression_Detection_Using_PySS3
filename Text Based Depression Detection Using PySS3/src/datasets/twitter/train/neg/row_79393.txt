Told my dad I was suicidal and he did nothingI (20F) often get bullied by the rest of my family (I have four brothers, only girl). For one reason or another, everything is always my fault. 

First off, my oldest brother (32M) wrote me off for good last year because he asked me to give his ex girlfriendâ€™s belongings back to her. He would do this a lot, and one time he asked I didnâ€™t have the time (I was a caregiver and had a 12hr shift). He told me that since he co-signed for my car that I shouldâ€™ve had his back, and said I wasnâ€™t family.

My two other brothers (26M) (24M) live with him and are basically sheep, and took his side. I found out that the 24 y/o actually agreed with me, but didnâ€™t have the guts to say anything. 

The 26 y/o sexually assaulted me when I was a child, and was horrible to me for years. He just apologized for everything a few months ago, so I guess heâ€™s trying to make amends.

My youngest brother (19M), I thought, was my best friend. We frequently get into arguments because he doesnâ€™t have a car and I always take him everywhere. I honestly donâ€™t mind, but he gets into these moods where it seems like my very existence is a bother to him. Last week I overheard him telling my dad how annoying I was, and Iâ€™ll admit, it hurt me. I take care of him like my own (my mom left us when I was 15- she was a drug addict and child abuser).

After the argument, I told my dad that I wanted to die because everybody around me hated me. He said â€œwhy would you do that to me?â€ and criticized me for not getting any help. I did make an appointment to see a psychiatrist, but I donâ€™t know if I can make it to Sunday. Nobody has checked on me all week. I couldâ€™ve killed myself two days ago and no body wouldâ€™ve noticed. I feel so alone and empty, and I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to.
