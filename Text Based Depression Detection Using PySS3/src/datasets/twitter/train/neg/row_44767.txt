*Update* Why shouldn't I kill myself?
Just wanted to make an update on my [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/10sicv/what_will_be_so_bad_about_killing_myself_i_plan/).

After the world kept raping me over and over again, I decided I had enough. I made a post to reddit then attempted suicide. Failed like the pathetic person I am, but that's how life is. You fail at somethings.
So then I had meetings with a therapist and some other doctors.
Made me feel even worse about myself. My family and all my friends turned out to be sad that I attempted suicide and surprised.
So I guess I'll keep on breathing for now, but there's no difference between the people in the cemetery and me. Just posting this to say, I think I'm slowly grabbing my self out of this depressionela quick sand for now. I probably wouldn't be recovering as well as I am if it wasn't for you guys. Thanks.
