It's starting to get bad againI don't wanna live anymore, and all I think about it suicide. From the minute I wake up to the minute I fall asleep, all I think about are ways I could kill myself: casually stepping in front of a bus, overdosing on my prescription sleeping pills, drinking myself to death, cutting my veins vertically so deep that they can't stitch them back up-- it doesn't matter. I was 9 months clean from cutting but just relapsed two weeks ago and now it feels like I'm addicted again: my forearms, thighs, ankles, wrists, and legs are littered with scars, just like before, but honestly cutting is the only thing that brings me relieve nowadays. I'm tired of my meds not working, I'm tired of crying myself to sleep every night, I'm tired of nobody noticing/caring enough to say anything, I'm tired of putting on a fake smile in public, I'm tired of my anxiety, depression and bipolar disorder ruining my life... but really, I'm just tired of living. I'm drowning in my own self-destruction. Life doesn't seem worth living anymore.
