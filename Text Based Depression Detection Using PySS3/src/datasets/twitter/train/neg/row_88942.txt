Someone said they heard me laugh yesterday, so now I'm faking it.A person in the same household who sorta knows i have psychological issues, also knows i went to see a therapist last week. She asked if it worked, if I'm okay now, and if I got more meds. But more in a... "if you go once and have meds, everything will instantly be okay"-kinda way. It didn't sit right with me. So i said, well, it was only an intake talk, and i've already been on meds for a long while. And then she immediately said, "well, I heard you laugh yesterday, so its not like you're still depressed or anything." This... kinda hit me. What if i *am* faking it because I laughed once? Sure, i cut myself 4 times a week, run across railroads and busy highways and stuff, but, if i can laugh, it can't be serious i.. think? I just hate that i have to be this on edge to somehow "prove" i'm really suicidal.
