Suicide by charcoal grillI am considering suicide by burning my portable charcoal grill indoors. However, I live with somebody. He never goes anywhere without me and I don't want to raise any "red flags" by simply staying home when he goes somewhere. This is not a "cry for help". I do NOT want him to know what I am doing if I should choose to go through with it.

Even if I seal off the inside of the bathroom to do this, there is a chance of CO leak. I don't want to put him in danger. And there again also, I don't want any chance of being disturbed.

I considered renting an SUV with one of those flat "trunk" spaces in the back to put the grill on. It's a tiny grill. But I'm afraid it might cause a fire being that a vehicle is so small. 

I considered renting a hotel room, but there again I don't want to hurt anyone else.

So, obviously, my question is WHAT can I do without endangering someone else and NOT raising any "red flags"?

Do not respond with, "Oh, don't do that". You won't tell me anything I haven't already heard. Hearing it one more time will not change my mind at this point. I do NOT want my mind changed. 

Simply answer my question or don't respond. 

Thanks!
