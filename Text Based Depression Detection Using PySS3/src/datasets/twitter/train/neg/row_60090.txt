[16M] I'm worthless in every sense of the wordI'm lazy, I'm cowardly, I'm quick to anger.

I haven't done anything remotely relevant (ignoring the fact that nothing is relevant).

I suck at everything I do.

I don't care for anything, I don't love anyone, nobody loves me.

All my memories are sad. Even stuff that I like, their memories are just...unghhhhhh.....

There's only 3 things that even help temporarily.

1) Video Games. And even then I'm easy to get pissed off and not enjoy the entire evening because hitboxes and whatnot.

2) Porn. And half the time I just grow cold 2 minutes into the video.

3) Friends. Yeah, shame that I'm such a terrible being, they only stay friends with me because I'm just barely better than nothing. And also probably because they like seeing someone who's worse than them, makes them feel better about them.

I'm not sociable, I'm lazy as shit, all my life's achievements are propped on someone else's, I can't appreciate anything I have, I want to matter but I can't, I want to die.
