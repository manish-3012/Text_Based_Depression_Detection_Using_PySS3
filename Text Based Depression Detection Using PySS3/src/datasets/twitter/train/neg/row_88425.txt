I'm hiding my eating disorder from my boyfriendI made this account because my boyfriend knows my personal one. Anyways, I'm 20 years old and I've been having issues with my body ever since I was 13. I was very suicidal and felt like I had no control of what's going on in my life at the time, so I chose that if I could have control over anything it will be my body. I have a fast metabolism already. I would eat what I usually ate and sometimes more, and then throw the food up. I always count what I eat. For example, if I'm eating a pizza, I count how many olives and corns each slice of pizza I eat has. I take forever when eating. I never eat in front of people. I find the weirdest excuses not to eat. My boyfriend is the only person that knows I have an eating disorder. He stopped smoking for me in hopes I stop purging. He's so happy we're both clean from our bad habits (since April). But the truth is I am still suffering from my ED. I'm afraid of telling him the truth. I know if I tell him, he'll start smoking again and it will be all my fault. And, I know I can't get rid of my ED that easily. Thank you to whoever replies.
