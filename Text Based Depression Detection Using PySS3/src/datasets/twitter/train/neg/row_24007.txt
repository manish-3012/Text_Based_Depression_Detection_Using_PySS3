Guys and gals I need a little help.So I tried to kill myself. Again. 3 days ago I tired to hang myself. I won't go into detail but ever since then I have a slight shake in both my hands, it not to noticeable but if i look you can see it. Ive tried to look up Google what it means but i don't know, do you know what it means?
