Sleeping troubleHey anyone reading. Just made a reddit account today to ask strangers for help with life. Ive been unable to sleep well for a solid 3 months now. Its bad too, i either dont sleep or get just 3 to 4 hours and it's killing me, didn't mention in my previous post but my closest friend cut her wrist again yesterday and got stitches, i asked y and she said she didnt even feel sad or angry she just did it. Thats one more thing thats now on my mind. My mind doesn't stop thinking being quite a dark person, i feel stressed rn, im worried about her tho i cant really think of how i can reassure myself that she's ok like she told me, i know shes not but i feel the same so i cant really think of what to say to her that could make her feel happy even just for a bit. Just let me know of some otc pills (in Australia) or working methods for sleep, or even what i can say to her
