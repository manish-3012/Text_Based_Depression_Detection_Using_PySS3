To be or not to be ?So I am trying to figure out whether or not I am going to kill myself.  My life is not worth it and has not been worth it for my life. If my life keeps going like this suicide is the only reasonable choice. For after all if you watch half a movie and leave half way through, who can fault you for leaving. However I am only 22. Although to be fair that would be half my life when life expectancy was much lower. So what can I do to attempt to make my life worth living ? I have my own place, solid income ect. The combinations of method I have picked out guarantees I will die if I decide to and it's completely in my control. 

Here are a list of things that will not make my life worth it. If you think I am wrong feel free to challenge.
1) "Religion will make my life worth it." I am glad that worked for you. However, my brain was not meant to be religious. I have always been agnostic and I can't choose what I believe in. For instance try to believe the earth is flat or believe in a different religion. As you can not make yourself believe the earth is flat I can not believe in any religion. 
2) "Your family will be devastated" That is a very mess argument that is very easy to turn around. For instance I could say "I should be in significant pain so they do not have to suffer much less pain" By the way they would be in less pain if they respected my decision rather than judging it because that makes them feel partially responsible. 
3) "People love and care about you" So what ? I know people love and care about me. Loving and caring does not ease pain.
