My Most Prevalent GoalI'm really not entirely sure what I really want to say, so I'm likely to ramble. Mostly, I think I just want to talk about this issue to someone(s). Such is the effect of mixing alcohol and the internet.

For about as long as I can remember, I've wanted to die. Or, to be more accurate, I quite simply don't want to exist. Truth be told, I don't think I've wanted to exist since before I was ten. In fact, I've really been procrastinating on this goal of self destruction, given that I promised myself that I'd have done it before graduating high school.

Obviously, holding such a position for at least fifteen years can have a negative affect on one's life, and in my case (if you'll pardon the excuse) seemed to cause a feedback loop in which my apathy would cause me to fall further behind everyone else which would then cause me to be even more apathetic.

Thus, I reach this point in my life. I'm a 24 year old alcoholic, who's also a closeted gay guy still living with his ultra-conservative Catholic parents, working a job that's barely above minimum wage and simply wanting to die, just like I've wanted to for the majority of my life that I remember.

I'm sorry if this post doesn't make much sense, or flow all that well. I just wanted to get some of my thoughts out there, since I've already decided where and how I wanted to do the dirty deed. I've been pushing off the "when," but it's been nagging at me quite powerfully lately.
