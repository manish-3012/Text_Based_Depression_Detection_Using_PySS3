If you are actively seeking help do you really want to commit suicide?Sorry if that offends anybody but I don't see how you could be serious about suicide if you ask for help. It just doesn't make sense to me. If you are very serious about killing yourself and have a plan you wouldn't be looking for help. 

Idk maybe all I'm looking for is someone to give me hope and then I won't kill myself. Maybe I'm not actually serious about it and I just want attention. I don't think that the case because there's nothing anyone can say that would give me hope but I just don't know anymore. I don't even know who I am anymore I'm so different than the person I use to be.
