I always find myself back here.Not â€œhereâ€ as in this sub... but here. At the edge of the void, looking into what I imagine is peace.

Iâ€™m not strong enough to keep drawing myself back. Every time, it takes longer than it did before. It requires more effort.

Mopping up blood with paper towels. Itâ€™s an ugly sensation.

I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m just speaking to no one again. Itâ€™s better than leaving it all in my head, I suppose.

Iâ€™ll delete this anyway.
