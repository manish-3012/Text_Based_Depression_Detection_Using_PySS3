For those of you who have a job, what motivates you to work? (read below)I ask this because of the unique situation I'm in.

I'm  not mentally up to par, and nobody here thinks of that optimistically.  There is no "have hope maybe one day you will find a relationship", the  circumstances set it in stone that I won't, especially the population  decline here where everyone I once knew has migrated away. Actually, my  plan A in life was to marry nobody and adopt my children as a single  father as I have so little libido that I wasn't initially interested in a  relationship. However, social services here has been documented to be  rigged against the mentally disabled, and I can provide the  documentation to the skeptical. There are a lot of people with trust  issues with them, apparently enough according to newspapers that it  affects child statistics. And even after looking for one for a decade  now, I have no hobbies, either because nothing matches the aspects I'm  interested in or because I am a tad emotionally numb for hobbies, the  same numbness that makes me apathetic towards luxuries like a house  bigger than a single room.

If you want a  metaphor for working in this life, picture a guy who is filling his car  with gas, but the "car" is a prop and he's just filling up cardboard. My  parents always suggest getting SSI, they're the ones pioneering the  idea. However, I've been denied thrice. I asked "so what do I work for  that parallels your desire to maintain your family" and the old jerk of a  guy said "everyone finds something, why can't you". Desperate, I've  come to you for suggestions, because the alternative is starvation.
