I don't know what I'm doing here.But I keep opening and closing the submission form._x000D_

You probably don't remember me, but I posted here a lot, with different names. I'm that pathetic guy from Serbia, yeah. So I'll understand if no one replies, god knows I'm really a huge attention whore._x000D_

This feels so pointless. Everything does. I've done everything so many times._x000D_
_x000D_
I feel like I missed all my chances. I made sure to alienate every person who tried to help me. I don't have any friends irl or online anymore. I miss them a lot, like I said in a comment here a while ago. _x000D_
They're not coming back, I know. But after that, I really don't feel like doing anything. It feels like I'm already dead._x000D_

None of my plans worked out. I managed to pass most of my tests but I'm stuck here this summer. I was supposed to travel. Looked forward to getting away from everyone. I just really don't want to get out of my room and move from my computer. I know some of those people mean well when they invite me to stuff, but I'd rather they don't. They don't really like me, they just do it out of pity._x000D_

All I ever get is pity. People never tell me the truth because they don't want to hurt my feelings._x000D_
They all made me believe such crap. I was better off when I knew that I was a stupid loser. When I believed that things never change. If I kept being like that, I would have avoided so much disappointment._x000D_

I have two or three years at most, don't I? After that, there's really no chance to do anything. But right now I don't want to change or try. There's too little time left. How do you just start being a different person? I have no friends and no one likes me. I don't get laid. I don't have any money, and I can't get a job. At least not in Belgrade and getting one in my hometown means nothing. I haven't got a car and there's no buses and I don't know anyone really. They know me however, and they hate me._x000D_

There really is nothing I can do. Sorry I wrote all this garbage. Ignore it._x000D_
