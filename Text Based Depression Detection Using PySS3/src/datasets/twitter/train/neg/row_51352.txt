I'm young.Pressures of schoolwork. Little to no friends. Everyone thinks I'm weird. I have family, but we're not really close. I know they care about me though. I finally passed my breaking point. I broke something of someone that I though was pretty cool. I don't have enough money to pay for it. He has tons of stuff to hold against me. I got rejected in the past few years. I've thought about ending it. When it is deep into the night, my mind wanders into darkness. But I keep telling myself, it's just a phase. That always lets me know that there are people who have it worse then me. It's probably the only thing keeping me sane. Telling myself it's a phase. I don't have a bad life. I live in a large house with good education. I feel lost now though. I just need support. I don't wanna die, but I want to be free as well.
