Thereâ€™s only one way for this story to end.I survived and escaped an abusive relationship 3 years ago. Iâ€™d since withdrew from social situations and just doing worse by the day. During my relationship we once had to take my gfâ€™s mom to the hospital because she tried to take her life by medication overdose. Months later, I had to pin my gf to the ground and snatch the bloody knife out of her hands because she was trying to cut her wrists. Once she threatened to frame me for physical abuse I knew I had to get out. Had to move countries, drop out of college. Spent a whole year in crippling depression, gained a lot of weight. The following year I finally thought I was getting back to a decent life. And then I herniated a disc and have no been able to walk properly for about 3 months now. I have no friends. I keep behaving poorly with my parents. Broke all relations with my sister. Have no way to fulfill my professional goals if I cannot walk properly again. I am craving some human connection, a hug, someone to confide in. But all I keep getting is more pain in my back and leg, cannot exercise, trying to quit smoking but I keep failing. Iâ€™m basically a worthless individual right now and the only way this can end is in death. Iâ€™m 26 so it may not come naturally but Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll end up taking my lire one day.
