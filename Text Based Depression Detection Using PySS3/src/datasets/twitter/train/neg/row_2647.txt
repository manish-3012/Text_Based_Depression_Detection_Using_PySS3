Why do I do this to my self.My ex is jobless (Depression and with a kid, but since I'm not a fucking idiot to get diagnosed I actuallyhave a job in another country), stuck in one of the super covid paranoia country.

What don't understand is why am I helping her? I paid of her debts,  send her money from time to time so she could get something nice to eat or cheer up her kid, witch cheers her up. And now after chatting with her I've send her, wit no regrets a 100euros so she could spend Christmas happy.

I wish that someone would slap the shit out of me screaming "WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONT WITH YOU? Nobody is going to give a flying fuck about you yet you care about others?! You deserve to suffer!" And the worst part is she has a boyfriend that I bet is stuck jobless, since he can't even fucking support her, but can't even properly cheer her up... a FUCKING DISGRACE OF A MAN, but it's her choice.

I wish someone would pick me, I'd literally pay to have someone that I could care for, say "Good morning, how was your day, good night". Does anyone know services like that?
