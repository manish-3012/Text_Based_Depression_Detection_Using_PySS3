Does it even matter anymore?I'm 21, in debt to several collection agencies for loans I took out for my mom; only for her to tell me how disappointed she is in me. Asking me why I can't be more like my younger brother. I'm gay but still in the closet except for a few people. A couple of my friends that I did tell just stopped talking to me. One sticks around, but my dumb ass had to fall for him. It makes me hate myself more and more every day. With him, I've done some bad things. For a while, I was on cocaine and heroine. Now, he's around all the time. He knows how I feel about him, so it just adds to the problem. I'm stuck in a dead end job, can't go to school because of my money problems, and to top it all off, I found out that I have Huntington's Disease. I really just want to say fuck it and end it all. I can't see anything positive coming up for me anytime in my lifetime.
