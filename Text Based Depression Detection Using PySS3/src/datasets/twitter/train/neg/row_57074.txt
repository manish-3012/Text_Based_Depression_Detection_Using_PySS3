21, don't know where to go in lifeHey everyone, I'm sorry if this post is a bit all over the place I'm just not sure how to really structure my thoughts at the moment. 

I'm a student from Belgium, currently attempting my second go at college. I failed last year horribly and fear this time won't be any different. Admittedly it's by my own fault, last year I just gave up and stopped attending class. This year I wanted to redeem myself but I'm falling into the same habit. I've barely left my dorm these past two weeks and have neglected both my dorm and myself. I've also completely destroyed my sleeping schedule and often either stay awake all night or oversleep well into the afternoon. My finals are approaching and I'm horribly behind on everything. 

I also receive financial aid from our government and fear that if I fail again they might drop me as I already failed several conditions in the contract. I also don't know if I will have the resources to try college a third time. This is all kinda blending together and I'm afraid I'm approaching a point of no return. I don't feel ready for all this and I'm mostly just scared. 

Thank you for your time.
