I donâ€™t want to live anymoreI wish I didnâ€™t feel this way all the time. Iâ€™m so tired. I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore, I havenâ€™t wanted to in quite sometime but Iâ€™m afraid of another failed attempt. Iâ€™ve been in therapy for over a year now, I take my pills, but itâ€™s still there, just lingering. I donâ€™t want to break my boyfriendâ€™s heart but Iâ€™m so tired.
