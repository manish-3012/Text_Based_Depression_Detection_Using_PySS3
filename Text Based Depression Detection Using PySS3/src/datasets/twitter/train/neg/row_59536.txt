Not gonna kill myself butI can't do this anymore. I'm too much of a fucking chicken to actually kill myself (which is ironic given I'm going to die at some point anyways) but my life is a fucking joke. Everything about it is sheer torture.

Literally, my life is constantly about thinking about my issues (i.e. why I'm a fuck up and what can I do to solve it so I can STOP being a fuck up), and no matter what, nothing seems to work. I'm 24 and probably nothing has changed between age 14 and now. 

You'd think that maybe it's my own perception, my own world view, that's messing with my mind. I thought so too. I went to a few therapists thinking it would help- and they all tried the whole CBT, positive thinking, mindfulness stuff with me- but nothing worked. Nearly everyone I come across thinks I'm mentally deficient to some extent, or boring to the point that they grow tired of me and leave, or whatever. 

I try to move forward thinking there's something for me out there, I just haven't found it yet. I haven't found my "true" self. Unfortunately, I've known my true self from earlier on. There's nothing there but a whole lot of stupidity, ignorance, and selfishness. I don't know what to do anymore.
