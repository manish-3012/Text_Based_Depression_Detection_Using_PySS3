My coworker and friend is suicidal. I don't know how to help, but I want to.Hi there.

A coworker of mine has struggled with depression for a long time (I believe at least a decade), but I have known him for only the last year and a half. He recently entered a relationship with a former coworker, and I'm not sure if she knows but I have never met her so it is not my place to let her know his current situation. The only reason I know he is suicidal is that he posted in here two months ago and I recognized his username. 

Because I'm not his girlfriend and we do not interact on a daily basis, I don't know how to show my support without seeming awkward or intrusive. He plays a major role in the restaurant we both work in, but this has clearly had a major impact on his mental health. 

Everyone's mental health is different. What works for one person (i.e., medication, therapy, support) may not work for another. However, I want to know how to connect with this person and let them know that there are resources available to him, be it our human resource department or some other counselling service.

And friend, if you're perusing this subreddit looking for a sign to live a little longer, a presence to reach out to, this is it.
