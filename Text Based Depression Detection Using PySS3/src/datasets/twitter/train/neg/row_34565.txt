I made it another year. That's good, right?I don't know why I'm so afraid to just do it, but I am. No matter how bad life gets or how bad I feel, I can't work up the courage to kill myself. I guess I'm just waiting for it to happen to me. ("You'll never make it happen with THAT attitude," all the go-go-positive people say. I guess they're right after all.)  


So yeah, another year has gone by. I guess I'm closer to my death, no matter how or when it happens, so that's something.
