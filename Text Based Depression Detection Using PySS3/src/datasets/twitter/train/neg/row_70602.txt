I don't even know anymore.I'm dragging up an older throwaway for this. 

Am I suppose to do background for this? 

I'm 18 and have been majorly depressed for years. I tried medicine a little while back but I didn't like taking it. 

When I was 13 -14 I was raped by a "boyfriend" of mine. My parents assumed I wanted to do what I did and made me to go confession and everything for a long while. 

I've been in a nice, healthy relationship since. Great guy. 

I finally told my parents I'm bisexual a month ago and my mom can't look at me without crying. 

My sister committed suicide in January. 

Depression is a bitch. I try to exercise, but that doesn't help. I try to go outside, but that doesn't help. My home life is not healthy so that doesn't help. I hate talking to people so theropy doesn't help. I've done some self harm before, but nothing detrimating. 

I'd love to be dead and just gone. But my family is already hurting so much and I can't do that to my boyfriend. Also, I don't know if I could physically bring myself all the way to do it. And I don't want to do it half way and end up in a hospital and then phyc or something. 

The thing is, though. Nobody thinks you're serious about killing yourself unless you actually attempt something. I'm screwed up, but I can't tell anyone because it makes them "uncomfortable." I don't even know what to do anymore. I keep going through the motions of work, school, relationships, friendships, and all of that. But it doesn't mean anything anymore. Nothing does. 

I wish there was a way I could end it all without it looking like a suicide. Like if I hired someone else to do it or something.
