Cannot get out of bed. I used to be attractive, and now I can't stop ordering takeout and I'm getting fat, therefore my value is decreased. I'm not talented at anything. I'm useless.I am 21 and a female. I cannot concentrate on anything. I'm taking one online class right now and I can't even do that because I'm not able to concentrate on anything except binge watching bob's burgers all day and eating. I hate moving. I hate exercise. I can't even read a self help book because it requires too much effort. I'm untalented at everything and anything. TelI me why i shouldn't take the bottle of triazolam to me. I'm so done being useless.
