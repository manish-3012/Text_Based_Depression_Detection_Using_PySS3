As a father fighting for custody, I can't fucking talk about my emotions.The last time I told someone I was struggling, it wound up being weaponized in court when we were disputing custody of our child. On the sidelines, I was being told I was selfish and was shamed for feeling the way that I do. Apparently I have to shut the fuck up, sit in the corner, and deal with my emotions like the "man that I am."   


No fucking wonder suicide rates are at an all time high. People are disgusting. I'm being buried alive. The walls are closing in so fast I'm suffocating but thanks to my "support system" I'm not allowed to talk to anyone about it.  


Just me posting this means I'm putting my entire livelihood at risk. This is no way to live.
