Am I intelligent or mentally ill?My entire life I have been driven to near insanity by those around me.  When everyone says one thing it's hard to go against them because rather than using logic and reason to state an argument, they'll attack you, your position, your sense of self worth, and your own beliefs.  I must be an idiot for not knowing how to defend against the constant onslaught that is other peoples' delusional beliefs.  If only I could stop them from trying to ram their stupid fucking opinions down my throat I wouldn't be wanting to kill myself on a daily basis.

No peace and quiet, EVER.  And they have the balls to tell me I'm just mentally ill, take these pills.  Maybe it's not me, and it is them?  Maybe I'm just more intelligent than they are?  Could it be that this isn't mental illness but just an awareness of truth?

Why does everyone want to convince me I'm mentally ill when they won't try the pills themselves?  Why does everyone have an uneducated opinion and confidently put it on display?  How can they be so arrogant and confident?  It makes me feel like an idiot because I'm not confident at anything, because I'm always questioning myself, my line of thinking, my actions, etc., while trying to come up with a reasonable answer.  How do people just arrive at answers and never question anything?  Am I just an idiot?
