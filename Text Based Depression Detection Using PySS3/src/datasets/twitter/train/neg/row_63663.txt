I think I will be dead by the end of the year.

My life is meaningless. I have no hobbies. I'm too tired to engage in anything. My job is just a shit job doing something I don't believe in, but I have to do it because I need the money for bills. I'm just going through the motions day to day. 

I have no hobbies. I'm totally dead in the head. Well, that's not entirely true--I'm bulimic. That's it. That's my hobby. Binge and purge every night. 

I don't have any friends. And before you leap on me saying "oh, you're not alone!" I mean I have NO FRIENDS. I pushed them all away because it's too hard. 

My parents told me they gave up on me. I'm estranged from my extended family.

I loathe my body. I feel nauseous when I look in the mirror. I ask my SO to close his eyes and I won't turn the lights on. Our sex life is hindered because I can't enjoy myself. The way I see it, my body is simply not aesthetically appealing to my liking. It's just shaped wrong, and unfortunately as long as my shape isn't ideal, I will be miserable.

On that note, my SO, bless his heart, is so sweet to me but I treat him so poorly. I'm just so.....numb. Like a cloud. I understand he thinks I'm nice, but he would be healthier with someone without me, he's just caught up in affection or something. I've been there. I get it. But it always gets better, as it would for him if I left.

When I look into the future, I honestly can't imagine myself ten, even five years from now. I've been considering suicide for three years and at the end of the day I have no redeeming values or contributions even to society that wouldn't be better filled by someone else. I'm not living for myself, only to make other people feel okay. So, I see no reason why I shouldn't care for myself and go away. 


But obviously there's a sub like this. So some people think it sa bad idea. Sorry for being selfish with this post.
