Thoughts.I've been suicidal  for a long time. Many bad situations  in life but now its like.... there's nothing for me. I'm not close to family. I don't have friends. I've wanted to die to stop the pain for awhile But now I wanna  stop the  emptiness the nothingness.  I have accomplishments that I did to bring joy....but no one to share it with. There's nothing whats the point?
