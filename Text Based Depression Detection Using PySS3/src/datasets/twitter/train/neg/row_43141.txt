My life is dull.I lived a good life, I was the youngest in the sibling of three, my brother is already married with a cute little daughter, my sister is a successful independent woman that spoils me, mother dearest is a good woman that knows how to nurture a child, father is a hard worker that provides for the family and grandmother is a caring old woman that made good food and shares recipes.

A perfect and picturesque family with a bit bumps here and there, that is excluding me.

They are caring with each other, even me, but I can't feel anything, I only feel like I owe them, but no emotional connection, no bonds like normal people usually share, I just felt nothing.

At Grandma's death and funeral, I felt nothing, I am incapable of empathy, I felt like an anomaly, I did not fit in this, perfect family, I shouldn't even be brought into this world in the first place.

Day by day past and I still felt nothing, when I went into a boarding high school, when I was paired with people as roommates, I can't really fit with anyone, sure I socialized with them, but the situations demands it.

Soon, I got into college, I thought I would fit into the new circles of friends, I participated into social activities in the first year, but it was dulled down, because I yet again can't fit in.

I feel so lonely but I can't befriend anyone without it becoming like an obligation.

I prayed that I die every time I went to sleep, poisoned myself with cigarettes, but it isn't working, so I resort to killing myself when I graduated, at least then, I can make the last family photo.
