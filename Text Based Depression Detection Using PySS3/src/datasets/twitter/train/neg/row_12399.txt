I am stuck in a fucking loop.Ever since I was a kid, everybody would torment me. Rumors were spread, Objects were thrown, etc, etc, etc. The list can go on. I tried to jump out a 3rd floor window when I was 8, and repeatedly tried falling into traffic. My parents have always been assholes, and nothing was every done about the bullying and insanity, at home or in school. Eventually a switch was flipped and I became a rage-fueled sociopath. Everybody went from torturing me to fearing me. I canâ€™t drop out. When I go home, I have to deal with my alcoholic father and my batshit crazy mother. I canâ€™t kill myself because I have no access to the resources to do so. I canâ€™t live like this; I canâ€™t live at all. I have no life. Zero social interaction (and/or zero *good* social interaction) and boiling blood can lead to nihilism and depression, which is exactly what occurred. Fuck everything. Fuck you universe. I canâ€™t deal with this shit anymore, but this shit is all I know about. This is my life. My personal hell where iâ€™m not allowed to live or love, but iâ€™m not allowed to die either. I hope I just fall asleep and never wake back up.
