I'm uselessI'm 20 years old and I've never had a girlfriend, still a virgin, I don't drive, I'm terrible at saving money, my university degree I'm doing is pointless and I've failed my first year of it, and I think about suicide daily. I tell myself I want to change and be better but I can't because I'm too pathetic and I know that if I go, at least all the responsibilies and expectations of me will be gone too.
