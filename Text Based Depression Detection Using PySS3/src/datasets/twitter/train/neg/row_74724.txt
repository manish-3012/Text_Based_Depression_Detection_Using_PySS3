starving/dehydrating myself to deathmy life has been a nightmare for the last few years, today was the last straw when my mother decided to take 200 dollars from me that i need for rent in a couple weeks or i will be homeless and i am in no way going to allow myself to be homeless again so i am stopping eating and drinking anything and will try to update everyday. If anyone has any tips to make it easier please tell me
