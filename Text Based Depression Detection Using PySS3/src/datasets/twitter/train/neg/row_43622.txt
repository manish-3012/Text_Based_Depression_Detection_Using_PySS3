Someone please talk to me. Please. I feel so alone &amp; I need to know someone cares about my existence.I have a good life -  a boyfriend, plenty friends, a good job, money.
My childhood was fucked up. The experiences from my childhood have begun to give me horrible depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder. I feel myself pushing my bf away and I feel myself caring less and less about being alive.
