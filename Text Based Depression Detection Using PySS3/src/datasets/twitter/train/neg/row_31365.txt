Most of my friends have an easy social life, i dontIm tired of life. they all have girlfriends easily , theyre "popular" and able to speak to anybody. i cant stand it , theyre good friends but i havent had a gf in 2 years..  i gooutto party once a month with them event tho they party way more than me. I always end up drinking until i dont think / get sad anymore and i end up totally drunk, the only girls at those parties are my mates' gfs. I cant meet anyon, my class is full of boys, and if im attracted to anyone she probably has boys that are way more attractive, attracted to her aswell, which means i have no chance at anything. I nearly broke down in class today and had to leave early..
