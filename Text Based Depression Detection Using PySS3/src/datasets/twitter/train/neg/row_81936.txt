Honesty is the Best Policy? I'm not sure any more.So at the last psych appointment I divulged that I had been making myself knowledgeable about suicide methods. But no "plan", as people always ask. I don't know if I can go through with it anyway. Probably not; I've failed 4 times. Now I've had to promise to make and keep regular doctor &amp; psych appointments for the foreseeable future else I will have emergency services find me and probably end up in hospital and psych ward. I tried to backtrack but apparently this doesn't get the doctors out of their professional responsibilities. What a PoS I am. Damn it. Last thing I wanted. I guess all I'm trying to say is - maybe you can be too honest... (?) Being a burden makes it all even worse, and I've managed that like a complete jackass. So, yeah - thanks for reading my ramblings.
