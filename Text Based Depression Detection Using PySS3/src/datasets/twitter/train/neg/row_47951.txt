I donâ€™t see a future ahead for myself and I donâ€™t want to continue3 years ago I met a girl that I loved. We spent every single day together. I stopped taking to every single one of my friends and family because I spent literally all of my free time with her. She loved me it seemed. I didnâ€™t see the emotional abuse i was going trough. If I were to go hang out with a friend she would become sad and I hated making her sad. I cut off everyone. I work my worthless job that I hate just to spend every penny I make on her thinking that it would make her happy. 6 months ago she stopped showing me affection but still stayed with me. Not just not even having an intimate relationship anymore but she didnâ€™t even want me to hold her hand like I used to. She made friends while I was stuck with none because I had cut all of them off and now even when I make an effort I get left on read from anyone. I tried to stay with my girlfriend thinking that things would get better but someone that I knew from highshool sent me a message saying that he found my girlfriend on a dating app. When I went to talk to her about it she lied and said that her and her friend made account to match with each other as a joke. I asked to see the account or see if the app was on her phone and she flat out refused. We never said we were broken up but we havenâ€™t spoken in days other than her telling me to mail her her stuff.

I know this is long and all over the place but itâ€™s hard to type, Iâ€™ve been crying constantly. I donâ€™t want to live. I donâ€™t want to go on living this life. I didnâ€™t go to college for this girl because I wanted to stay with her. I turned down scholarships and practically ruined my future. Iâ€™m working a dead end job, Iâ€™m a loser. I used to have so much going for me and itâ€™s all gone. I hate everything. I canâ€™t sleep and I know the reason is because every night she would tell me she loved me before I fell asleep. Itâ€™s hard not to hear it from anybody.
