My Block of cementI feel like Iâ€™m trapped. Iâ€™m motionless. I canâ€™t do anything, but just exist. Itâ€™s like my feet are stuck in a block of cement. Everything around me just happens and all I can do is watch. 

My motionlessness means Iâ€™m a constant obstacle for others around me. I want to get out. Out of my block of cement. But I canâ€™t. 
Rarely someone notices me standing there. A threat to no one. A burden to everyone.
 
One may look at me for a while. But quickly theyâ€™ll set off again. After many attempts of getting out off my block of cement, Iâ€™ve given up. Iâ€™m left here. Alone. Fixed in time and place. By my block of cement.
