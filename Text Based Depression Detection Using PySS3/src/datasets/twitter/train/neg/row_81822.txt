Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™ve hung out way too long waiting for things to get better, and they just donâ€™tIâ€™m tired of being dependent on my mom because Iâ€™m a massive fuck up, Iâ€™m never going to be able to support myself

I have tried every treatment and been in therapy over half my life. Thereâ€™s no hope left

Some of us just werenâ€™t meant for this world and thereâ€™s no fixing it

Iâ€™ve already been systematically cutting people out of my life and I donâ€™t think anyone is going to hurt too bad

Iâ€™ve honestly never felt as in control or as happy as the moment I made the decision

My last paycheck which isnâ€™t even enough to cover more than a fraction of my bills is going towards the supplies to do this right

I have a few things to get rid of, some harddrives to clear and thatâ€™s pretty much it.

Iâ€™m not going to miss anyone and truly part of my motivation is that I want the people who have hurt me to think about what they did.

My only undecided thing is what Iâ€™m going to do with my elderly dog, I wish we could go together so Iâ€™m thinking carbon monoxide. If anyone has good info on how to do this properly and advice on tying up loose ends please send me a message
