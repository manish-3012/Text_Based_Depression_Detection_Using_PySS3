My father makes me feel suicidalHe tells me that I'm worthless, that I'm living in a dream world. That if I sit on the sofa in the living room one more time he'll kick me out. I just wish the pain could dissapear but as long as I'm stuck in this hell I never will. Even my mother has given up on me. So much pressure and stress! I have to do well in school, I have to get a driver's license, I have to stay "normal". My father will later act nice and apologize and hug me, then he starts doing this again. The worst thing is how humuliating and shameful it made me feel, I had to sit in my room while he was saying all those things with barely any clothes on, you know how much that hurt!
