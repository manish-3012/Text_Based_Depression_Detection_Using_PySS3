There is no Place for Me Here on this SubredditThis is SwirlingShadows,

I was madness in the dark but i've come to realize that there is no place for me here. I constantly feel as though no one says "the right things" to me, that i'm almost always offended by what I read. I don't know why this is. 

Maybe I just hate people. Maybe I will regret this later. I don't know what i want from other people. I just more and more as days go by I feel as though everyone is against me. 

I don't know what the fuck that's all about. It constantly seems to me that people lack empathy and understanding in this world. 

From SQL's article i am pulling this third suicide risk factor : 

A deep sense of alienation. We can always do something about this one by making a deep interpersonal connection, and since all three factors are necessary for high risk of suicide, it's only urgently necessary to fix one. This is why itâ€™s â€œall about the rapportâ€!

I don't know if how I feel has anything to do with that. I just feel like almost everything I read here directed towards me is (again) against me. Paranoia? Maybe. The result of a poor knowledge of how to talk to those that are suicidal? Maybe. 

At this point i don't care. I'm going to delete my account now.
