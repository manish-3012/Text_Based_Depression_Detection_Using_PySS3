Constant thought about torturing animals... and I enjoy them.Some backstory:

I have a history of mental illness (depression, bipolar disorder, short-term schizophrenia, psychosis), so I'm almost positive that nothing I feel or think is "normal". With that said, I'm concerned that the thoughts and situations I keep imagining will come true, with or without my consent. For a short while I was psychotic (the delusional kind), and lost touch with reality. I never got help because I've only been able to talk to one therapist and she's no longer an option.

I've also harmed animals in the past -- a few of the chickens we own/owned have broken wings, legs or other bones. I accidentally-on-purpose stepped on a gerbil. These were a long time ago and I thought I was over these impulses. Obviously I'm not, because I keep thinking about various ways to injure or kill my cat. I just now caught myself mentally debating whether or not I should snap his neck first.

I don't know if this is the right subreddit, but I don't know where else to turn. I will answer your questions to the best of my ability.

**UPDATE:** I feel like shit. Other, unrelated drama from earlier this hear decided to come back. I was at work when my phone buzzed with the Facebook message notification. When I got home I killed one of our degus and threw its body off the back edge of our property (a forest). I couldn't stop. I got scalpels a few months ago to make stickers, and I can't... can't stop. I don't want to get into details, for both squicky and personal safety reasons. I need help, and I don't know where to turn.
