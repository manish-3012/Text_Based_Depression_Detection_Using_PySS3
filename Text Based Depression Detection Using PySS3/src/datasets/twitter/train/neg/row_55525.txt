Pseudo attempt #2Well fuck, I chickened out again. 

A few weeks ago I had to have a friend come get all the guns out of my house because I wanted, and had the urge to, go home and shoot my self. Of course this led to an intervention of sorts, everyone around me was distressed, I went up in meds. 
Since then Iâ€™ve felt super depersonalized and numb, like weirdly so. For the past year things have actually been going quite well, for lots of reasons I wonâ€™t go into. Nonetheless, I essentially had a psychotic break. 
Today I wrote my note and left what is essentially a last will and testament that probably wonâ€™t be legally binding. Since I donâ€™t have guns in the house anymore, tonight I resolved to hang myself with my belt after everyone went to sleep. I put on some music, polished up my note, and thought about how to rig up the belt in the door. I wadded up a necktie to ensure less slippage, propped up the trash can, and let myself dangle. Eventually I felt myself unable to breathe, my eyes felt like they were bulging, and my leg started to twitch (weird). The whole time I didnâ€™t feel afraid per se, almost relieved like you would be when you finish a chore. As my leg twitched a bit the rig started to slip so I said fuck it and pulled myself out because Iâ€™m a total chickenshit. Now Iâ€™m going to wake up with bruises on my neck Iâ€™m sure and I have to come up with an excuse for that. Maybe Iâ€™ll just go try again. Anyway, thank you for letting me vent. Iâ€™m just fucking tired of being alive. I hate myself.
