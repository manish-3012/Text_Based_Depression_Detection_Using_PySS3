Do not want to go to doctor or live like thisI can't have sex - penetration is so physically painful, and literally feels like I'm being ripped in half. I have to go to the OBGYN in four days, and I am 99.99% certain I will either get dismissed or told I have vaginismus, which is a chronic condition that basically requires therapy and pelvic floor PT. I'm a trans man, even the idea of going to the OBGYN is terrifying to me, the idea of pelvic floor PT is terrifying to me, and I legitimately would rather die then deal with any of this.

I refuse to live with having vaginismus. I am not living with it, I am not living with a stupid body that has to be ridiculously extensively prepared to have sex, and I am not living being the freak who canâ€™t have sex. Human beings have been having sex since before we became human beings, and I can't, and at this point, I feel so worthless and useless that I want to kill myself. I'm strongly debating killing myself before I have to let some doctor poke around my lower half just to tell me "congrats, you're a human failure, go let more people poke and prod and fucking violate you".
