I hate my fateI had a very bad fate. I find difficult to get a job though I had more knowledge than my friends they all got a good job. I was jobless untill very recent I finally found a job. Now I got a job worst among my colleagues. I have to do rotational shift. Mess up my whole body clock and with no additional perks. I want to refuse this work but I know in pandemic they might terminate my employment and I won't be able to find anything else. I have trained so hard for this job now they want me to forget what I learned in 8 months and start again new on a obsolete tech. Though people with lesser knowledge got better opportunity in the same project. Why I always have be the bottom of the stack.
