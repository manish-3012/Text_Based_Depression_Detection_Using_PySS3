I'm really tired, not sure why to bother anymore.My life feels like it's been falling apart lately. Over a decade long relationship ended recently because I didn't take my mental health seriously, and drank too much, and now I'm living with my abusive mom, who's.. really not nice. Everyday things are getting worse. I'm a complete mess, and I don't have anything really going for me. I'm on disability since I was born to be a waste of space, and I'm just going to have to start over again anyway. Don't really have many material possessions or anything. Pretty much just what would fit in a backpack is all I have, and I'm too exhausted to care anymore.

It sucks but no one would even miss me either. I don't have friends, I'm not close to anyone in my family and most of them don't really like me. Pretty much the only person who talks to me is my mom, but she didn't take long to start chipping away at me. I don't really like being treated badly and it's not like I have any other options.

 The only one that might miss me if I'm gone is my mom's dog. But he's a dog, he'll be OK.
