I'm worried about a friend of mine who recently expressed suicidal thoughts he experienced in the past. How can I help him?My friend, who before this week seemed upbeat and happy, recently told me that he had become extremely distraught. His divorced mother declared bankruptcy, his grades are in the dumps as he attempts to provide for the family on his own and he is worried he won't be happy in college.

I have always been concerned about his mom. I believe she may be an alcoholic, and maybe but probably not abusive. She has sent incoherent emails to friends on many occasions, and is always "napping" when I call my friend. His recent call, and telling me that "I haven't told you everything, I need to keep some things in the dark" (verbatim) makes me worried that he is further down the road to ending it than I thought. I cannot be the only one to help him, I am not an expert. At this point I cannot trust his family to help me. 

Any advice on how to help my friend is immensely appreciated. I offered him a number for the Suicide Hotline and begged him to get counseling, I don't know if there is anything else I can do.

Edit: I should also add that he is very secretive about talking to me, and always needs to randomly hang up or randomly log off of Facebook or Xbox Live.
