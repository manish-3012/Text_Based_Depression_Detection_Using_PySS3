Does the Suicide Hotline always alert the police?I'm struggling with severe depression and passive suicide ideation. I would check myself into a hospital in a heartbeat if I got the urge to harm myself. But i can't shake these feelings of morbidness. Graduate school is psychologically and emotionally crippling me. I just want someone to talk to... but i'm afraid they'll call the police, the week before finals too.
