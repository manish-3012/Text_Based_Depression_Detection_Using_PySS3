I can't do this anymore but I am too afraidI want to not be here. I am simply afraid of dying. What if I regret it in my last few seconds of life? I have family and a significant other; I can't let them down but I truly don't want to keep living. I want to die but without the permanence. Kinda funny to be honest.
