All of this furry hate is starting to really get to meI feel like being a furry shouldn't be a big deal but the more I read about furry hate (such as r/CringeAcademy and r/furryhate) the more angry I get, but it also makes me what to search for it more.

It's a weird cycle. I seem to be addicted to putting myself down and now the feelings are getting too far. I stay up in bed thinking for hours about suicide and now I'm worried I'm going to end up doing it.

I'm trying my best to ignore it. I've even abandoned the furry culture for a while. Liking anthropomorphic animals shouldn't be the reason I end my life. But it doesn't seem to help.

I just want to scream and shout at people and tell them about how furries aren't bad and they get a bed reputation because the media likes to put them in bad light to get interesting stories.

I feel really dumb for caring this much about a hobby, but, I just don't know where to go now.

Honestly, typing this up makes me feel better, but if anyone has any advice on what to do when I get these feelings again, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

EDIT: There are of course other reasons why I get these feelings, but the furry hate seems to be what triggers it off.
