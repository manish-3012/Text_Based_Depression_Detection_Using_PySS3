Contradictionsâ€œIf you really wanted to kill yourself, why would you want to ask for help?â€

This thought has been haunting me for months. Despite having so many suicidal thoughts and plans, I had a therapist to help me talk about my emotions. ( I donâ€™t go to them anymore because of the thought above ). I just felt like my actions were so contradictory and I felt like a fraud. I feel like Iâ€™m seeking attention and using â€œdepressionâ€ that Iâ€™m not even diagnosed with as an excuse to be lazy. Iâ€™m so confused, why did I go to a therapist if I wanted to kill myself? I canâ€™t think straight.

Does anyone else have these thoughts? 
(Iâ€™m sorry that this post is so incoherent, I really canâ€™t think straight for some reason and I feel really conflicted.)
