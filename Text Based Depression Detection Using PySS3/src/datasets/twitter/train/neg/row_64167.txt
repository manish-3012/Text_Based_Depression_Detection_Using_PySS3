I've spent an overwhelming amount of time wondering what the fucking point is and it feels like dying is just the best option.I not going to do anything, but it wears me down knowing that I'm the least important person in my life right now. Compared to my other family members I'm the oldest by 3 years and have achieved the least. I'm 20 and have never had a REAL RELATIONSHIP. I dont drive because im scared, i stopped attending classes entirely and failed this semester, and then didnt hear back from the 2 incredibly promising trade jobs i had great interviews with. Im only living to see my brother, sister, friends and family succeed so I can at least know that things turn out for some people
