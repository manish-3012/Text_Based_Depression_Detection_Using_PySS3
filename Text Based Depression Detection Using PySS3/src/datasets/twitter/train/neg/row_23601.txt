I threw a party and it just reminded me of how truly alone I amIve always hated my life and been suicidal and lonely and I thought I could throw a 21st birthday party and I invited like 50 people an dlike 30 said they were coming, but only about 20 showed up, and then they literally left at like 930 except for like 5 people of them and I feel like a failure  and I spent almost a thousand dollars on everything and they couldn't even stay until like 11 or 12 and it just shows I don't even have any real friends or anything and I lost my old uni group of friends and they were the best friends I ever had but they all turned on me because I'm borderline and they don't like dealing with my mental health issues  and I just feel really lonely and I hate my life and I want to slice my fu kj g wrists
