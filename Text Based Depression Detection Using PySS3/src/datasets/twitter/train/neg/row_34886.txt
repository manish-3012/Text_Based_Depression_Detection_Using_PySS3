I really want to die and have no idea why...I tried to OD over a week ago, went to the hospital, and was sent home 2 hours later. My friends donâ€™t care at all. My family is dealing with the death of my uncle. My work is helping my coworker cope with her own fatherâ€™s death. I feel nobody gives a shit about me and that I shouldnâ€™t care. I hate waking up, and I keep thinking about taking my life again and how Iâ€™ll do it. My life doesnâ€™t suck regardless of this. If I managed to live thereâ€™d be some decent things to come but in the end I know Iâ€™m eventually going to take my own life whether it be sooner or later. Iâ€™ve tried countless medications and I did 4 years of therapy and nothing has worked. 
Maybe life isnâ€™t for everyone.
