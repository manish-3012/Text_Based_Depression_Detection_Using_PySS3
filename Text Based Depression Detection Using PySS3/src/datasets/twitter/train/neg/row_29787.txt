Worried about my cousin.I'm worried about my 24 year-old female cousin who I'll call Rachael. She had a horrible childhood with a neglectful father and an emotionally abusive mentally ill mother who ruined her own life with drugs and died when Rachael was 15. 

I had never met Rachael until a wedding in the family brought us together just a year ago, and she seemed relatively happy and well-adjusted, given her life story, although I noticed she had scars on her wrists from cutting (which she blamed on a cat when she caught me staring). 

Rachael is a college senior in her sixth year, she's dropped a ton of courses and changed her major so many times nobody knows what it is now, she's got a load of student debt and no clear career goals, and she's began to retreat from her social circle, even from family. I believe she's severely depressed, though she flatly denies it and rejects any kind of help. She's not even talking to family now (including me). My mom sort of "adopted" her and became the mother figure Rachael never had, but she won't even pick up the phone when my mom calls. 

/r/suicidewatch, I'm worried my cousin might do something stupid. She has a history of self harm, and at least one suicide in the family (her uncle. Her mother's overdose may have been intentional too). I can see how from her point of view she must feel like a burden, laden with debt and completely blank about the future... and the most insidious kind of self destructive depression is the kind you can rationalize. I just don't know what to do.
