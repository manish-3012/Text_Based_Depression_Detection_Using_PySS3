Life feels boring and pointlessI know, angsty title, but it's how I feel. I'm 31  years old and have a small apt with my best friend. We have our pets who are my world. I'm in college earning my second degree (been in since 2009). I should feel happy, but I don't.

I work shitty job in customer service that I hate (but need my degree for a better job) and have cerebral palsy, so the jobs I can work are limited.

I have "friends" locally, but aside from my roommate I really don't consider most of them friends. I hear from them primarily when they want things. 

I live in a podunk Ohio town so it's hard to meet new people. 

I'm tired of school, hate my job, and most people I come in contact with just annoy or bother me. 

The only thing keeping me alive is that I don't want my best friend to come home and find me dead. She's one of the few people I truly feel love for.
