I found a local reddit post expressing suicidal intentions and I'm not sure what to do.I was browsing a subreddit for something in my area and found a month-old post from someone stating that they plan to commit suicide in the next week (a week from now, not the date of their post). 

I would like for this person to get help, but when I tried looking into it everything I found was about how to help people you know who are suicidal, not an anonymous stranger who is probably in the same city. 

I'm really not sure what to do, can I go to the local police station and show them the post? Will they be able to do anything with this info?
