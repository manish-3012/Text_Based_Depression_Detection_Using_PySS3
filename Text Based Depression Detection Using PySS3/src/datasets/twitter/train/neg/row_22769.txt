Gave up hopeThis is a vent from me, to get rid of my story.

Always had trouble connecting to peopledue to years of bullying and bad friends. Thought I had it finally all figured out. A gf and friends. It was good. Till my gf broke up and I broke down. Asked for friends to come over to support. No one came. I gave up hope of it ever becoming good again. I hope I get assisted suicide through an official clinic. Sometimes it's too much for someone and they can't anymore. I totally get that, I know how it is. I have family but I hope they'll let me go. The pain is too much. I broke beyond repair.
