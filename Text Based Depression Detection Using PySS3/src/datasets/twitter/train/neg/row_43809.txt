My Thoughts. Just rambling.My mind, my body and my eyes. it feels like im walking in an empty vessel, just me and my thoughts. like im a spectator. often the thought of me being dead occurs in my mind and it freaks me out. its pops up from no where. When i work, when i go to train and even when im with my friends. i cant remember not being like that. it feels like i have become comfortably numb 
whats weird is that i got no reason to be like this. i have a perfect family. Got friends i care for and a good job. 
It feels like my whole life i have put on a charade. What could make these feelings bearable, cause i dont think i can sustain this for much longer. 
Note: i just needed to write my thoughts down. So sorry if this is hard to read, my English is not that great
