Important QuestionSo... I wrote this suicide letter (that I never finished) six years ago because I was just too tired that day to actually complete the process. Every now and then I like to look for it and reread it so I can remind myself of where/who I was then, and be proud of where/who I am now. 

Is it wrong that I kept it?
