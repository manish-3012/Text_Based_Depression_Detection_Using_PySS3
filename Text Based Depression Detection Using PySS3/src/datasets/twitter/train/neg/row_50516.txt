I know the truth, stop lyingStop spewing that vitriol of toxic positivity that you all call good vibes. 

Stop telling the depressed and downtrodden you care about them and love them and want them to succeed.

Stop forcing us into a one-sided conversation meant to feed your feel good index as a person.

Stop saying you're there for us.

Stop pretending and lying.

We all know nobody cares. We're waiting to die and some have decided that they've been waiting too long.

Your messages are meaningless text on a screen. They lack all social immediacy. They lack context.

They are hollow words that don't change anything.

You can't save people you don't know with empty platitudes and silver words.

All you do is bring pity which brings shame which hurts.

Stop trying to help me because it's obvious you don't care if you can't even understand that a message of "sending good vibes" and "you are enough" are anything but helpful.

I know the truth.
