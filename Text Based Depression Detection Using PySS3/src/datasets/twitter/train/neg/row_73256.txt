Not suicidal, just asking a question to suicidal and formerly suicidal people: What music helped you get through the hard times?I've posted here many times before but for the first time in a while I can say I'm quite happy and not suicidal at all. That's remarkable for me so I'm taking a bit of time to reflect on my past and what helped me get through difficult times in my life.

Personally music was incredibly therapeutic for me and I found that depressing or somber songs helped me feel a little less alone. However that's just me, does anyone else have any comments on how music plays a role in helping one through sadness, pain, loneliness, etc?

And just to contribute some content: [Murs - Bummed out Blues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzZpDsUCNnQ)
