I'm so close...and I have no one...I don't know what to do anymore....
I'm not sure where to start. 
I'm failing to see the point in living anymore..
Me and my husband are on the brink of divorce, for various reasons. 
I work a full time job 40-50 hours a week, on my feet, and while I love it it's hard work, the pay isn't the best but it opens up doors for better things in the future. 
My husband refuses to put me and the kids as a priority, or even to realize that he doesn't I'm often alone with them on-top of working, and trying to juggle cleaning the house, and everything else. He has been very straight to the point in saying that I will never be a priority, or even worth it. Despite my numerous attempts in trying to make things better I always fail. His friends and hobbies will always be more important...
I can't afford to live on my own as I'd have to choose between rent and daycare, and my children would never have any of the nice things they are accustomed to now. 
My children also don't listen to me most of the time, and are following in suite of there father calling me lazy, etc. Despite the fact I have very little down time, as I'm constantly trying to clean, cook and make things better for everyone. 
Theres a lot more to the situations. 
But I've hit a wall with the latest fight between me and my husband....I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on....the thought that everyone is going to be better off without me is always there
And if I died my children would have everything that they are still accustomed too because he makes far more then I do. And if I'm gone he would then have to step up and he the father that they need. 
I want to die.... And everyday I get closer to loosing the fight or the will to go on....
They would only miss me because there would be no one to cook dinner, or clean the house......and everyone's life's would be better.
