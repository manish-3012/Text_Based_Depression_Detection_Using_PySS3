An anniversary...Today is the one year anniversary of my friend's suicide. He terrorised his wife (my best friend), and his two kids before putting a hunting rifle to his head. When his brother managed to open the garage door, with the police standing in front of it, prepared for something else, he was still alive, barely. And then he wasn't. 
 I was a bridesmaid at their wedding... drugs eventually changed him....made him lose his mind. He was a good person before it took over...

They heard it. They were home. 

As soon as my friend's mom phoned me we drove there. We sat at the house for 4 hours waiting for the coroner to come. My boyfriend had to help them put the body in the vehicle. I saw blood and skull and far more than I should have. I held my friend as she cried and struggled to breathe. I tried to convince her she wasn't dying and it was a panic attack. I took her and the kids to my house and talked....and talked... and talked. 
It stays with me. Its ingrained in my mind, my memories and it haunts me EVERY day. 

RIP CJ....
