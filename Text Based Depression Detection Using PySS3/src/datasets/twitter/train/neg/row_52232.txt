YouYou have this anxiety. To *imagine yourself* dead, but *happy*. Free from any anxiety. What you are makes you suffer. More than anything. 

And itâ€™s the worst suffering there is. You suffer because *you exist.* You want to be dead, because you donâ€™t *love yourself* alive.

You do not know after death what there is. But whatever is ok for you. Anything is better than this day. Because this, like so many other days, is the worst day of *(,)your life.*

Every morning you imagine your body hanging from on a tree. *Your life is* without *light.* Youâ€™ve been thinking about it for years, all day. You waste your time. 

You never die. Because youâ€™re terrified of hurting your family, your friends, and everyone who loves you. 

You have an emotional crisis. 

You come back to this sub to read and write something.

*Youâ€™re not alone.*

You feel better. 

Youâ€™ll be back here soon.
