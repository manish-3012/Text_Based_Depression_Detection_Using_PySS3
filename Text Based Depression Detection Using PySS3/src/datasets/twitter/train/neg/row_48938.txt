Wasting SpaceI'm sorry. I don't know where to go, and even writing this feels like a burden.

I hate myself. I really hate everything about myself. I feel like I cannot contribute anything positive to society, and even when I try I end up negatively affecting those around me. I hate that people have to see my ugly face, and for anyone I've dated I feel even worse for - I can only assume they've participated in any activity with me because they had nothing better to do at the time. I appreciate their pity.

I'm somewhat successful in university and work. But never enough, I do one thing and I must do more. I never feel satisfied, and neither does anyone around me. I feel like often I have to fake my knowledge, my connections, my attention span, and any other positive attribute. I feel like I am a liar, fake, and fraud. I hate that I am like this. I hate that I am not even near perfection.

I want to feel human, I want to feel connected but I only feel like a burden. I don't know how to make it stop. It's been like this for so long now and I'm really beginning to cave under the pressure. I don't know if I'm right or wrong about my thoughts anymore, and I wish there was some neutral party who could tell me. I don't want to talk to my family or friends because family will just be disappointed and I don't want to make any friends worry about me when they likely have so much else going on in their lives and i've already probably complained to them about menial life bullshit too many times before.
