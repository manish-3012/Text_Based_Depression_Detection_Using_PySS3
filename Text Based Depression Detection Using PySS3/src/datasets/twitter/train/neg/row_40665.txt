[NSFW] Embarrassing, superficial, helplessIâ€™ve posted many times about this issue, but still canâ€™t get over it. 

As a bisexual man, Iâ€™ve only ever had sexual experiences with men. I went from being near-incel pre-college to being... the complete opposite. At this point my friends are exasperated at hearing about my insecurities, when the other half of the time Iâ€™m stressing out over triple-booking myself for a Monday night. Iâ€™m getting eye rolls over complaining about â€œoh no, multiple people are interested in me at once, woe is meâ€. Iâ€™m keeping a tally and am halfway to 1000. Itâ€™s a struggle balancing an insanely high libido with a completely fractured self-image whose host is still miraculously alive. 

Im mostly over anorexia and body image issues. But this is being replaced by dick size insecurity. Iâ€™m 5.5â€, which puts me right around average. Iâ€™ve done extensive research too into other options to increase that. Apps like Grindr are entirely dehumanizing platforms, but this is akin to me complaining while dumpster diving. I understand intellectually that no humanity or civility exists on there - Iâ€™ve had very racist things thrown against me, death threats, stalkers, etc. I understand also this isnâ€™t the entire community, but itâ€™s hard to see past that when it is so prominent. 

Iâ€™m very angry with the amount of size queens out there and how people who just happen to have been born bigger get all the attention and love. Itâ€™s almost as if no other quality exists beyond dick size. And I get it, because I understand the appeal. But Iâ€™m also not blocking and rejecting people purely based on size, to which Iâ€™ve experienced three times already just today. 

I hate being superficial and emphasizing this. Iâ€™m sick of sending out messages to 70 people, only for 2 to respond, 1 of which immediately blocks me due to size. I might not kill myself today, but I canâ€™t ever see a way out of this. I generally cope by sleeping with anyone whoâ€™s interested in me, and often end up meeting with good people. But Iâ€™m stuck in an ironic vicious cycle. 

Iâ€™ve shot down any woman who ever expresses interest, because I donâ€™t want to let her down ever and be with someone of average size. Honestly, fuck anyone who makes micropenis jokes. Iâ€™d hate to think Iâ€™d kill myself over this, but it keeps getting worse. I kind of wish I get murdered at my next hookup. I donâ€™t care enough to use a throwaway at this point.
