cool AWESOMEon top of the other shit i am dealing with (check post history, tl;dr i withdrew college and i'm now going to college in my hometown which i hate, and not as important as that but i'm also hung up on never having had a girlfriend, i'm missing out on the human experience)

my brother was mowing wet grass on a hill, his foot slipped, now his bone is shattered and there's a small chance he might have to get his toe cut off

on the way to the hospital my mom hit a deer and mashed the front end of the car in (a car that already has a lot of problems with it that we can't afford to get fixed)

why does nothing positive happen. or if something positive happens it's so incredibly temporary and all of the negative things show no signs of going away any time soon.

i'm really tired of this bullshit. if i had anything i could use to do the job i'd be gone by now. life doesn't get better. i've been struggling since age 12 but everything is out of my power, it's been proven time and time again it doesn't matter what i do, it's completely futile. i'm not even worked up like i was with a lot of my other posts, no anxiety. i've just kind of accepted that i don't want to be here anymore
