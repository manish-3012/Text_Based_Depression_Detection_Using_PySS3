Don't even know why I am writing hereIt is hard, thinking about it almost every day and every day finding a reason not to do it today. Something good which is supposed to happen tomorrow, during the week or eventually.

It is not even about being alone, I know there are people who care, who love me. But I still feel so lonely, I don't know where I am going anymore or what my goal is. Just living day to day, event to event and I absolutely hate it.

I am just afraid, that eventually, I won't find anything to stop me.
