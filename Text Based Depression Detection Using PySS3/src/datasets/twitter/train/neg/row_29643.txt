It's The Most Wonderful Time of the Year2nd anniversary of my Dad dying is in 2 weeks. Haven't felt alive since he died. 

He died on the 16th, my birthday is on the 20th. Dont care about turning 19, I dont even feel like talking about it much less "celebrating" 

I'm an orphan that's not close to my family, so all I have is my boyfriends family. Got into a massive fight with him last night, and now we're sleeping apart. What the fuck does that mean? Are we split up? 

Me and my dumb bipolar ass went off meds so I've been manic for almost 6 days, but this morning it looks like I'm heading into a deep depression. 

Why should I try and dig myself out of this hole? I'm destined to a life of bipolar and broken relationships. 

My Dad is the only thing that kept me from going overboard before. What's the motivation now?
