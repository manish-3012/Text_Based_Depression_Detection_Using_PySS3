I have no clue what I'm doing.Can someone please just reply to me? Just anything.

I don't know what I'm doing but all I know is I'm getting closer and closer to the day. I graduated in 2015 and all I have to show for is a temporary job that ends in September. No one else called me and I've also received a few rejection letters. If this dumpster fire continues, I think I'm just going to leave this sh*thole. 

I know lots of other people have it rougher than me,  I have no depression, or any disorders or anxieties (to my knowledge at least, I never went and saw a doctor for it), but honestly, I'm done with it all. All I want is just a stable job that I like doing but all I've been getting is rejection or flat out being ignored.  

I posted here a while ago only to have no one reply to me. I never knew how much that would've made me feel like sh*t, but it did. 

Can someone just tell me everything will be ok? Even though I don't see this dumpster fire extinguishing any time soon.

I'm probably going to delete this anyways. 

I have no clue what the heck I'm doing. I feel really emotionally down, uneasy and overall I just want to die.

I also feel weak, useless and annoying to ask for help, but I need your help right now, please.
