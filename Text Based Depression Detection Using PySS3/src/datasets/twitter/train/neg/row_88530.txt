I'm scaredI've thought about suicide for a very long time

But it doesn't help that I've got a fairly loving family that cares but has no idea about what I feel

'Friends' that don't care at all

Not having the courage to talk about what I'm going through 

Bieng too much of a coward to take myself out of this life

I feel trapped but this 'cage' I'm in gets smaller everyday

Maybe things will get better maybe not I don't know what to think anymore

Maybe bieng a coward is for the best.
