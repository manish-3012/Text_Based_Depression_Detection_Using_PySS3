i'll get there somedayi'm just so empty and numb all the time. i can't feel anything and worry about ruining the connections i have with others because of it. i just snap at people all the time and get so frustrated with them. i don't want to be here anymore and think everyday about taking all my pills and floating away. almost did it earlier but i was too tired. i'll be there soon hopefully
