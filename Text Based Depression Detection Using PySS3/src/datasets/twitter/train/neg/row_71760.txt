I want to kill myself, but I'm too afraid to.Everything is going to shit in my life. I've got a mother with a terminal illness who's going blind, I've got a group of "friends" who couldn't give a single how I turn out, I can't find happiness in anything anymore. I just want to lay down and cry. All I want is someone to vent to, and I can't even get that, because then everything gets blamed on me. And I'm starting to believe that everything is my fault. I'm so fucking angry all the time because nothing I say or do matters anymore. I wish I was little again so I could just make people smile. All I seem to do anymore is disappoint everybody and I fucking hate it. I'm so tired of living my life like this. This just doesn't seem worth it.
