I should definitely kill myselfI lied to my brotherâ€™s face today when I said that I finally have a goal to lose weight. The truth is that I am going to kill myself in the fall of this year. I have already made up my mind and I have decided that suicide is the best option I have right now. 

Losing weight will do nothing to make me feel better. Iâ€™ve already dieted and lost 20 pounds in the past and I was still the same suicidal depressed loser, but 20 pounds lighter. I ended up gaining all of the weight back plus 20 more pounds.

Today was the first time I worked out in 2 years. Hopefully in 2 years Iâ€™ve finally stopped keeping this shitty facade up and Iâ€™ll be long dead before then. Thereâ€™s no reason for me to want to stay alive. I hope for nothing in life except a successful suicide.
