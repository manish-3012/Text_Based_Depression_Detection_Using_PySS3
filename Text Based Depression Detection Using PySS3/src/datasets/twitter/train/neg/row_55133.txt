My brother is best friends with my abuser. This pain feels unbearableI was sexually assuaged by my ex boyfriend for a year. I broke up with him three months ago. Itâ€™s odd how the people you expect to be there for you arenâ€™t, and the ones who are there for you are the ones youâ€™d least expect. 

I grew up with my ex bf. Our families are friends and him and my brother have always been best friends. When we broke up, I told my brother (mom and dad too) what he did to me. In detail. He nodded and said he doesnâ€™t hate him, just hates what he did. Theyâ€™re still best friends regardless of what happened.

I guess I was expecting my own brother - who I would have died for - to be loyal to me. To not betray me. It makes me feel like he doesnâ€™t understand the pain my ex bf inflicted on me even though I told him exactly what happened and when. I struggled with suicide the first month after the break up because the pain was terrible. I didnâ€™t see a point in living. My life was worthless. He broke me, and no one would want me. Iâ€™m irreparable.

I still feel that way, but itâ€™s less. My best friend talked me out of suicide. She told me my parents would be devastated and so would she. Iâ€™m alive for them. If she could have let me be selfish and end it, I wouldnâ€™t have to feel this way anymore. 

My brother just told my family that heâ€™s planning on going to the beach with my ex bf at the end of this month. I want this pain to end. I want this betrayal to end. And at the same time, I feel like I have a purpose. But what the fuck even is that? If Iâ€™m suppose to help people who have been sexually assaulted, Iâ€™m just going to be surrounded by the pain. Iâ€™m going to see time and time again that life only equals pain. I just want this pain in my chest to go away. Iâ€™m tired.
