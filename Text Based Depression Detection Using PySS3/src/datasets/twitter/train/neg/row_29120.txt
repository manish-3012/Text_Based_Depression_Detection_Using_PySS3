There is nothing wrong with my life.I've been suicidal on and off for 5+ years. My life is beyond fine.

My only problem is that I am unwilling to seek professional help. I've thought about it but I don't want to go through that mess again.

I've come to terms with the fact that I am going to kill myself eventually. I'm just not sure when.

I don't hate myself. I don't have a terrible life situation. I just want to kill myself.
