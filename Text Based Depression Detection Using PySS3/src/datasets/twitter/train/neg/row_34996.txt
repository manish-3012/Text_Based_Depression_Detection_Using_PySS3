What do I do? How do I get over this? Itâ€™s eating me up...Iâ€™m not sure if this post belongs here but Iâ€™ve accepted that I have a problem and I need help. 

Iâ€™m 18/m and Iâ€™m a senior in highschool. I had a pretty rough break up with a girl about nine months ago. Iâ€™m the one who broke up with her. I realize that staying with her would cause a world of problems years down the road. Her family is psychotic and her brother and I do not get along. Thatâ€™s beside the point thatâ€™s not why I am posting this.

I honestly think I have been going crazy lately. She told me over the summer that her new boyfriend was so much better than me and that I did nothing for her. Iâ€™ve been grappling with this ever since she said it to me. People always say that words canâ€™t hurt you but I think after she said that I was in the most pain Iâ€™ve ever felt. 

I feel worthless. Iâ€™m 5â€™4 and Iâ€™m 18 so the odds of me finding another girl are pretty slim. After I graduate I plan to go to college and I like to meet another girl but Iâ€™m worried my height is going to become a serious problem. Iâ€™m so stressed out about this I canâ€™t even breathe. There are some nights where I wake up and have chest pains and shortness of breath. It scares me to think that Iâ€™ll never meet someone who will actually care about me and not pretend to like the last one. She met the new kid a week after we broke up and often talked about him while we dated. 

I donâ€™t want to end up like all the early 20s people on 4chan complaining about their lives and how they canâ€™t get a woman. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ve ever really considered suicide but I am worried that if I keep thinking like this it may end up that way down the road. That girl really messed with my head and now I feel completely worthless. I know Iâ€™m a good person and I try to do the right thing. I often wonder if this is karma or somehow the universe is taking its revenge on me. Does anyone have any advice?
