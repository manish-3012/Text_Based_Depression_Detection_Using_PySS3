My parents disowned me.I recently came out to them as being gay and they kicked me out, and said that i wasn't their son. They hate me and now I'm homeless and alone. I'm wandering the town on my phone, heading towards a bridge so i can jump. I don't want to die but i can't see any other way out.


I don't have any relatives in town and i don't have too many friends. I only have about $50 in my name and I'm only 17.


Update: I'm leaving the bridge to go buy a sandwich, I'm hungry and i need to think.
