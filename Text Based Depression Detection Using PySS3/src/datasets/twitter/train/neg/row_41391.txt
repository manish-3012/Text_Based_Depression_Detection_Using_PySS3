I'm not going to kill myself, but...... I want to so very badly.

The only thing keeping me alive right now are my dogs. 

I have BPD and either depression or bipolar ii. I just got married. I'm dropping all of my classes one by one since I'm failing them. I live far away from my family. I have no close friends. My therapist is distancing herself more and more ever since my behaviors started to escalate; I'm not as "normal" now as I was when I first started seeing her. I think I only make my new husband miserable and would love to set him free. I'm clingy to anyone who shows me a shred of kindness and being that way scares them off. I would be much better off dead. 

Except for my dogs. One of them has special needs and I don't trust anyone to take care of her like I do. Plus, she was my whole life for a year before I met my husband. Killing myself would kill her, too.

I don't want to die, but it feels like my only option.
