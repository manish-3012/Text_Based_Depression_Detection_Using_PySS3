Requesting something...My life, my state of mind, at times, is unbearable. I haven't felt like doing the things I used to love to do for six months now, and every day is a coin flip on whether or not I don't immediately get an existentially crushing force keeping me in bed. I only sleep every other day, and have had terrible trouble going outside for the vast majority of this past half year. I can't get a job like this. I can't complete a college class like this. I feel like I went insane three months ago. I'm living as a tumor in my living space. I'm paranoid and my self image issues have been crushing me for over half a decade now. That's kept me from going outside to grocery stores, to school, to parties, to friends' houses. I gained sixty pounds since the year started.

I need to be able to go outside and get meds. some medications have failed me in the past. What can I do?

I hate doing anything remotely like opening up but if I keep myself locked up, I'm going to almost literally rot away in a pile of bed sores or give myself the Hemingway shave some years down the line. Something's just not working right with my brain, I feel like depersonalizing even as I type. I hope I don't delete this in some attempt to keep my emotional baggage hidden away. I get intrusive thoughts, and I find myself at times convinced that I will die. Not thinking about MEMENTO MORI. I get the feeling that I will die, and I will die soon. Maybe within the next few days. Maybe someone will kill me. Christ, the worst of it all is not feeling like getting up and getting shit done.
