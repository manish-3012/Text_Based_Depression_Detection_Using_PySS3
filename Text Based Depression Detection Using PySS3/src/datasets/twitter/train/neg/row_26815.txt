I want nothing more than to taste the sweet empty peace of oblivion.This world is pointless. I feel abandoned by everyone. Nobody knows me for who I really am, and if they do, they donâ€™t seem to care about me. Iâ€™m bordering on working a full time job while also being an over-full time student. The career path I wanted to take before looks now like itâ€™s going to suck. I canâ€™t change paths without putting myself in a ton of unpayable debt and more time dealing with an almost full time job and over-full time schooling. The one love I have left me 7 months ago. I tried to find someone else to fill the hole she left in my life, and dated someone for two months, lying to myself the whole time, telling myself this was better and what I wanted and that I was happy. That all came crashing down too. My old hobbies, I donâ€™t have time for, I canâ€™t make a career out of, and donâ€™t bring me any happiness anymore. Life is a chore that becomes harder and harder every moment. I have less and less motivation to keep going or do anything at all. Death is really really really tempting. I just want to leave the world entirely. Nothing is worth living for anymore.
