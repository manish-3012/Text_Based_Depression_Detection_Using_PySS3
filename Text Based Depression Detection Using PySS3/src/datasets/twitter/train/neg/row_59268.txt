I'm constantly thinking about harming myself. Please help.I have been having suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember, attempted suicide several times and spent a great deal of time at the hospital where I was given a couple of diagnosis and treated for them.


Iâ€™m now in my early twenties, have been off my medication for four years and am generally doing okay. I still have suicidal thoughts, but I also have a lot to live for and I realise that Iâ€™m not ready to leave this world, so I can honestly say that they are no longer a problem.


The problem, however, is that I canâ€™t stop thinking about harming myself in.. other ways. I have been cutting myself since I was eleven, but I had my scars removed by surgery four years ago and since then it has become a lot less frequent and severe.


About six months ago I met my boyfriend, who is a very loving and caring boyfriend, and who inspired me a lot and made me truly want to recover. Not just get better, but fully recover. And so I made the decision to stop cutting myself. I donâ€™t want to cut myself anymore, I donâ€™t want any more scars.


But lately I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. I almost feel like I need it. Every time I see a sharp object, all Iâ€™m thinking is how good it would feel to push it against my skin and watch myself bleed. Iâ€™m afraid to go to the kitchen, to cook, because I know that as soon as I have a knife in my hands, I will want to stab myself with it.


I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m afraid I might lose control or something. Please help.
