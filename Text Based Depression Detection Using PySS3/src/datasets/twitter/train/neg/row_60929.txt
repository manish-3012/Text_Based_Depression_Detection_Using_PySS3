I want to kill my self over dishes.I just want it over. Since I was 11 I have been seriously thinking about it. I have attempted a few time. Every one thinks I am too young to feel this way. I am 18 now, for at least quarter of my life i have not wanted to live. And I do not remember a time I did not self harm. 

Recently my step dad died,he committed suicide. He was the only member of my family I truly trusted to talk to. Like he wasnâ€™t mad at me all the time. 
And like I was the least suicidal I had been in a long time, When he did it. 
And like I was locked off like I couldnâ€™t cry till last night I was finally alone. Then like today I like didnâ€™t wash the dishes and like my nana told me the only reason I didnâ€™t do it was i wanted her to do it. And like I just emotionally could not do it last night. Like I just could not I was focusing on school and trying to catch up. And then I was crying the rest of the night. And then like this happened and I want to fucking off my self over dishes. And like I am so close I just canâ€™t because they need my social security to live. Thatâ€™s the only reason I am important.
