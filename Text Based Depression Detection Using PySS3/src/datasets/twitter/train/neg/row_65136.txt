"The Note" advice needed.I'm drafting my note, not looking for help support or reasons not to go through with it, I'm content on all sides of this but the section of my note that will be for my partner.


I want to fully express how much he has meant to me, helped me, and how he really couldn't have done anything to stop this. However, I'm cautious of hurting him more by saying such things or of hindering his ability to move on after I am gone. I wanted to leave him his own note but for these reasons I'm unsure if that's best.


Anyone here who has had to read a note left by a loved one, are there things you wish they had or hadn't said? Could anything have made it easier?

Thank you.
