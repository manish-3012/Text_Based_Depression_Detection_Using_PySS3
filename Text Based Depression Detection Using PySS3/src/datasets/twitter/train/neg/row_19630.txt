Not sure life is worth the effort anymore.Throwaway account. 
Things that are contributing to my depression:


- I'm a 19 year old female studying full-time at my local community college, due to my inability to work because of my busy school schedule, my boyfriend (21) had to pick up a 50/hr a week job with a one hour commute in order to support us, So he's gone now for 14/15 hours a day 4 days a week, 16/17 hours if there is really bad traffic. I barely see him now. He contributes to a lot of my happiness. 



- I'm going for a doctorate so I won't even be done with school until I'm 27, and then I'll have to deal with several thousands dollars in student loan debt. I feel such an immense amount of pressure to have a showy career and make an overwhelming amount of money because I grew up incredibly poor with a broken family, in which my dinners either consisted of a handful of otter pops or a $1 Mr.P's pizza split between my two siblings and I. 



- My boyfriend and I have been together for four years now and were considering eloping next year or the year after, and now I'm scared that i'll get cut off from fafsa If we do so, because it'll change my status to an independent.  


- I have no "girl-friends", I have tried everything, friendsmatch,  girlfriendsocial, not4dating, strictly platonic forum on craigslist, local subreddits. Nothing has worked. 



- I have no health insurance, constantly fearful that i'm sick or dying and have no idea. 



- Sometimes the only ways to get me out of suicidal thoughts is to place myself in a daydream where I have endless money and nothing to worry about, I find myself living in these fantasies more and more lately. 



- I'm growing increasing terrified of where I live, Someone has been stealing my mail for the last month, a man was murdered on my street a few weeks ago, and a hole was shot in my window with a BB gun, my only form of security is my German Shepherd. 

- Constantly struggling with anxiety and body dysmorphia, I'm thin now, but can't stop seeing the zit riddled fat kid in the mirror. 

- I've been having horrible nightmares every night for well over 4 months, so I've been avoiding sleep. The most I've gotten in a single night since this started is 5 hours of rest. It's really starting to have a physical effect on me, having back and side pain along with some killer dark circles on my face. 

- The ever growing thought that all of this can go away if I just kill myself, or attempt to go off-grid. I'm terrified of dying, yet feel sometimes like it's the best option to avoid pain and disappointment.
