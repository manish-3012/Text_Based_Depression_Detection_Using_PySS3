Just received a suicide text from best friend, did I do it right?For reference this is my best friend of over 10 years, over the past couple years he has grown more distant as he has moved a couple hours away and currently works 3 jobs. I maybe get to see him about every 3 months when I plan out a guys night for us to just hangout and do something fun. Our communication is rather sparse other than these occurrences. The last time we spoke was a few weeks ago about a Christmas present I was making him.

To make a long story short I received an ambiguous text out of the blue from him that I may never see him again. I responded asking what was going on and after roughly 10 minutes he informed me that he was planning on killing himself. I immediately attempted to call him and when that failed I sent some encouraging texts that he shouldn't do it and called the police.

He has a history of self harm and suicide attempts and it seems most common that if he contacts me that he is indeed planning to go through with it.

As of this moment I have received a phone call from the police that he is not answering the door and that's it so far.

Did I do everything right? I feel bad about calling the police on him but I also take this as a very serious matter and genuinely care about him. I'm debating on whether I should even go to a Christmas party I was planning on going to tonight just in case something happens.
