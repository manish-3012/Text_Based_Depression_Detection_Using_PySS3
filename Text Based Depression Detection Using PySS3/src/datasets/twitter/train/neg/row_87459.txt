Hey, Anyone posting here,I would like you to take a minute and listen to a song, and watch a music video.These two songs are concerning people dealing with close friends who have commited suicide. Both the writers and I strongly encourage you to get help immediatly. Although you may think that no one understands wht you are going through, some one has gone through it. 
[Here is the music video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpQ3q6PE6Ls)
[Here is the other song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE547s6FOFs)
By the way, the song is a remake of the music video's song, so watch the music video first.
