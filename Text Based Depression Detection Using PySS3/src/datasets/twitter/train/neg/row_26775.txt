I hate this â€œyouâ€™re not aloneâ€ crapI KNOW depression/anxiety/suicide/mental illness in general is pretty damn common at this point - thatâ€™s the problem. Everyone has it a lot worse than me and theyâ€™re also succeeding more than me despite it. 

Besides, being in the same boat as someone doesnâ€™t mean you arenâ€™t still rowing by yourself; doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re not making the boat take water and drowning the both of you.

Iâ€™m glad if some people take comfort in the idea that theyâ€™re not the only ones self harming or whatnot, thatâ€™s partly the point of this subreddit after all. I just see these kind of posts on twitter and tumblr and they scream faux positivity/normalisation to me. Yeah sure, we all have experiences with this, are we going to start talking about it properly? Canâ€™t we lift the â€œstigmaâ€ in a more meaningful way? /rant over
