I'm a lonely 22 year old guy and feeling like a loser with no future.I'm 22 and feel all alone and I am very insecure about myself. I'm a fat 6'3'' 260 pound guy with a really small 5.5 inch penis. I have no gf or any experience with girls cause I feel too ugly and I think they will laugh at my size. I only have one real friend and barely any family left that still cares about me.

On top of all that I have no college educaton or any idea what kind of career to pursue. That leaves me working a shit minimum wage job I hate and living my life paycheck to paycheck. I just feel like saying fuck it all and giving up on life for good. I feel like the biggest fucking loser in the world. There are 16 year olds more successful than I am and it's just sad.
