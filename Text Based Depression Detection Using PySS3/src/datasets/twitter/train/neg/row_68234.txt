I fkd up by going home in middle of the semester, now i want to kill myselfIt's my fault though. I missed a test I was supposed to give to be recruited. Apparently it's a misdemeanor that can prevent your from future recruitment drive (no information was given about it). Now I want to kill myself. I have let down my family. It's depressing. Could've jumped out of the train if I knew this would happen.
