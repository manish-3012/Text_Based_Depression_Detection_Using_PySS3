Tried to stay for my familyJust gonna poorly spew out my lifeâ€™s story here I guess. Im 18, Male. Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts since I was 13, which I guess is when everything started going downhill, had a good childhood, loving Mom, Dad, and brother even though my Dad had some anger issues and struggles with depression . Our family fought a lot which I regret, Middle school was a rough time I had been an overweight kid since around the 4th grade which certainly didnâ€™t give me confidence or a great feeling. Around the start of 7th grade my Mom started walking with a walker and her MS started to progress what seemed like faster and faster, I was too young at the time to understand why she tried so hard to do things like go grocery shopping or run inside stores when I could just go for her, I get it now that she knew things would get worse and wanted to do what she could for as long as possible. In the 7th grade I started not going to school a lot saying I didnâ€™t feel well when in reality I couldnâ€™t find the motivation to get up and get outside, I was always a good student who loved school but then I changed into the kid who never turned in his homework and slept in class. 

    Fast forward to highschool we lost the house and moved into an apartment my Mom had to stop driving but still kept her job my older brother drove her each morning (she worked alone in an office for our church) eventually the churchâ€™s new pastor would basically force her out of her job and treat her like crap. Weirdly enough things were looking up for me personally I got really invested in a club at school and met a group of friends, Thinking back I think between that and home it kept me busy enough that I didnâ€™t have time to sit around and get brought down by my suicidal thoughts and problems

     Going into my sophomore year of highschool I realized I was pretty overweight 6â€™3 280lbs and decided to work on it, I started working out and saw a lot of improvement by winter I was 6â€™3 220lbs and felt great. Sometime near the end of the year I started having trouble finding the drive to get up and go to school again, Ill never know what caused me to get back to that state of mind but it ruined everything, One night my parents tried to talk to me about it and it ended in an argument (Ive always blamed myself for the rest of what happened because I stormed off) as almost all of our conversations did, I went to my room and minutes later my mom got up to go the bathroom and fell, she cut her foot open and we had to call an ambulance because we had no way to get her into the car. This is where everything got bad she got stitches for the cut and antibiotics we would later find out that the doctor prescribed way to much antibiotics and she got an infection (MS patients or at least in my moms case have a weak immune system, the problem with MS is that signals from the brain have a hard time getting where theyâ€™re supposed to go In my moms case this meant she had trouble walking, getting an infection made this even worse) she was home and realized she couldnâ€™t move at all legs, arms anything, the doctors werenâ€™t sure what was wrong (we were unaware she had an infection at this point) so they gave her steroids to try and increase her function which only made the infection stronger. She was hospitalized for awhile but never regained her previous movement ability in her legs

     This all progressed somewhere into the summer between my sophomore and junior year. She was sent to rehab to try and regain movement with a walker, she spent months there made some progress but caught another infection (C-dif) that went unnoticed it progressed to septic shock and we were told she had a 50/50 chance, my Moms a fighter so of course she made it through and went back to rehab but had no luck regaining movement, our insurance said she couldnâ€™t be in rehab anymore and either had to pay out of pocket or move to a nursing facility or go home at this point none of us knew what to do, she ended up going to a nursing facility which was horrible, And we took her home she was bedridden ever since and lifeâ€™s changed my dad takes care of personal stuff and its safe to say he hates his life, itâ€™s probably safe to say my mom also hates her life.

   This paragraph also takes place during the same time period, my sophomore year/summer I met a girl named Lindsay online one night and it was one of the best friendships Ive ever had, I miss it deeply and wish I had my friend, Lindsay was someone I could talk to about anything and everything and vice versa We talked almost every afternoon and night whenever I wasnâ€™t visiting my mom, Ill never know why our friendship ended we slowly stopped talking time between talking got longer and longer and soon we just didnâ€™t talk, Im always gonna miss her.

    Junior year, I finished sophomore year somehow only failing half a semester of english I was still in good standing despite missing almost half a year things were still gonna be okay. Around a month in I lost control and didnâ€™t get out of bed one day and that was the end I spent the rest of my junior year sitting in bed listening to a playlist Lindsay made me and wondering how my life got to this point. My sleep schedule flopped often somedays I was up all night and asleep all day and somedays the opposite, nothing mattered and my suicidal thoughts were more prevalent than they ever were I spent a lot of time planning my suicide and gathering what I needed. The thought of my Mom dealing with my death always held me back and somewhere along the line I realized I had to fight to stay alive

    Welcome back to the present, My senior(current year) things started off as well as they could I still felt like shit but realized graduating was still possible and even this year, I set out great started working out again and got up every day for 3 months and worked my ass off, I still had a lot of suicidal thoughts and it took everything to get up and go but the more I did it the better I felt, I was doing great and then it happened again I felt myself slipping I knew what was gonna happen, I started not getting up somedays and I havenâ€™t shown up since a week before winter break, in the last week I went and got my license something Ive been avoiding for a long time but decided to do it because my Grandmas old car was given to us and was just sitting around, there was no excuse anymore and I actually did it I actually passed and thats when I realized this great event happened but I wasnâ€™t even happy I had/have so much going for me right now but I still cant even find the drive to get up and fix my fucking life. Today I got a letter from the school basically saying show up or dropout. Im tired, really fucking tired I cant do any of this anymore and I donâ€™t wanna put all this stress on my family so Im driving to the sunshine skyway and jumping I hope donâ€™t suffer but I truly hope my mom can forgive me I know what Im doing to you but Im so tired.

     If your here reading this you probably have your own problems, I hope you never stop fighting and push through seriously give it your everything I wish I wouldâ€™ve done the same.
