Today is my birthdayI cried for a few hours because I didn't get what I wanted the most (there's this  girl named Alexis right, I wanted a hug from her). My friend said she would say something to her but she didn't. I brought 10 dollars to school like I normally did. I wanted to pay her for it because she needs a new phone and she needs money and I just really want that hug and it's affecting everything. Please tell me what to do
