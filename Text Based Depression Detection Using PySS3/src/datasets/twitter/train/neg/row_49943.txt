Reddit I think this is it for meI put a belt around my neck from the closet in pitch black while standing on a chair with music on low volume in the background. I just can't let go so I'm just waiting till I get tired and lose my step and that will be that. I feel so many things in my head right now, thinking of every happy moment that I ever had but I just can't with deal with the misery anymore. I know I'm selfish and a coward but I never hurted anyone in my life.
