I want to talk about loneliness. Please.First of all I'm not going to take my life just now. I am seeking help.

I have been forever alone ever since my 14th birthday (I'm 20 now). I do not chose to be alone, which is different from being lonely.

If I were to take my life right now I would be missed by my family and no one else. That is what bothers me. I was born with no purpose. I am not important to anyone or anything. No one will remember me. Right now I am feeding on earth' sparse resources. I am not contributing to society, but straining it. I am taking up space that other more valuable people need.

I have a brother who is the exact opposite of me personalitywise. He is 2 years younger than me, and we should be having the time of our lives now, talking about girls, cars, life and other boy-stuff. But we dont.

I wan't to live, but I dont know how to.

My parents chose not to manipulate me when I grew up, forcing me to make my own decisions. This perhaps seems to be wonderful, and I should be ashamed of not valuing such freedom. But I dont. Everything I tried to do as a kid failed. The friends I had as a kid were lost quickly. I got no advice on life. No one told me about sex, no one wanted me to be anything. My dad didn't encourage me to obtain a hobby or do sports. When I finally, with few friends, started computer-gaming, I was presented with bullying from my family. I have only few times been supported in decisions of social matter.

I am a completely normal guy. I am not handsome nor ugly.

At the moment I am a failure.

If anyone with similar experiences would like to talk I welcome you.
If anyone has anything to say, anything at all, please do.
