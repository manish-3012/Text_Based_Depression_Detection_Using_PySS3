I have no idea how to make the pain stop.Im not sure if this is the best place for this. On Monday, my boyfriend of 3 years left me. It's now Thursday. He was sick of me and my depression. He was one of the only things that made me feel okay. I know that's not healthy and I was working to find ways to be happy on my own, but his sudden departure set me back a lot. I used to think of suicide often, but now it's daily. I don't want to live without him. I know I need to. It's just such an intense, physical pain. I'm 18 and this is my first heartbreak. I just don't know how to move on. I know it's supposed to get better, but if anything, it's gotten worse. Can anyone offer advice?
