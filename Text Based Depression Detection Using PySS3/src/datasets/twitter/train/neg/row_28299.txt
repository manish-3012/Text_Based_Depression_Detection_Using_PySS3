Told my mother, she didnâ€™t careSorry if my english isnâ€™t the best, itâ€™s only my second language.

Today my mom found out about me skipping school a few days ago. She was super mad and asked why I did it and why I lied to her. The truth is that I just donâ€™t care about anything in my life anymore. The only time I â€œfeel something positiveâ€ is when I get high, so I am often skipping school to do that. I didnâ€™t know what to answer at first so I â€œcame clearâ€ about not caring anymore and just wanting to escape this life (I didnâ€™t use the word â€œsuicideâ€ but itâ€™s pretty obvious that I meant it). It was the first time I told one of my parents about it and I kinda hoped for a helpful response. But my mom just didnâ€™t say anything. There was complete silence for about 10 seconds and then she just began to talk about something different.

The only thing that kept me alive so far is that I would hurt my family massively but after that talk with my mother I really donâ€™t have anything holding me back anymore. I donâ€™t know if she was overwhelmed but for me thatâ€™s not an excuse for not saying anything and switching the topic. Also that happened hours ago and she didnâ€™t talk to me since then.

So I guess thatâ€™s it then.

Thanks for reading.
