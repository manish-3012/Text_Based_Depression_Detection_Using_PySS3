Am I not justified?I've been wrestling with some suicidal thoughts and ideation for a few months now. Things have been up and down, and realistically, they will be on the up in the coming months for me (going to visit my girlfriend). But ever since I made the first attempt on my life, I have been unable to shake the feeling that one day, suicide will take me. I have been through bouts of severe depression for around the past 7-8 years. And I find myself asking things like, 'At what point might it be considered "justified"?' After a decade? Maybe three decades? How long do I have to keep suffering chronically, consistantly getting worse each time for people/society to think. Ok, I guess he's had enough now. I guess I'm just tired, tired of thinking that I'm selfish for wanting or thinking I'd be better off gone. Tired of being told "Oh, but it gets better". Tired of being told those close to me would be upset. Tired of seeing those around me succeed and move forward with their lives, while I remain stagnant, a burden on society. So mentally unwell and sensitive I can hardly think about working. If that doesn't make me a failure, I don't know what does. I'm not quite sure how much longer I can see myself fighting against this, suicide has seemed less and less daunting a task. Maybe soon.
