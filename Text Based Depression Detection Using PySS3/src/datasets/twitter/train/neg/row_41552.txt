I told my parentsYesterday I was really upset and I told my parents i wanted it to stop. I cried to my dad, and said please I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. Iâ€™m a grown adult with lots of trauma. Dad cried and said â€œdonâ€™t say thatâ€ - you will hurt so many people. You will. Iâ€™m so numb I didnâ€™t feel anything. I just kept thinking of the peacefulness it would be. I donâ€™t know why but Iâ€™ve been through hell for so long it seems pointless. But I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone. How selfish I am.
