What do I doI would like to kill myself. I have called suicide prevention hotlines tonight. One of them told me, â€œIâ€™m extremely worried about you, you donâ€™t sound very good.â€  He promised to call back next week, his name is Mark. He was very nice. Yah I was worried too. I canâ€™t find our gun. I looked in our bedroom closet but have no idea where my husband put it. Why do I have so many ridiculous emotions. It alarms people. It alarms my husband who has known me for forever. Iâ€™d rather be dead, honest to god, than to know what it feels like when he gives up on me. I just want to know whatâ€™s wrong with me so it can be fixed and if I canâ€™t figure it out, I would just rather be dead. I realized Iâ€™m saying â€œIâ€ a lot and that suicide is selfish. But whatâ€™s the fucking point. Everything is a hot mess and we are stuck inside slowly watching the other person learn to hate us. Whereâ€™s the relief other than everything just being over.
