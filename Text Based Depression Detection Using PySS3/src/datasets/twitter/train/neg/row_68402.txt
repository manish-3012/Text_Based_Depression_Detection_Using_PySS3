This week is probably my last week of my life.hey, I know y'all are gonna say that it's not worth it and that life has so many beautiful things.
But I can't do this anymore.
This isn't about others hating me, it's about me being a disappointment to everybody, I'm not worth anything and probably everything that my family has ever gotten me, I don't deserve it.
All of my skills and knowledge could be used by somebody else and actually do something good with it.
I lost my school year, found out about 30 Minutes ago, I'm just fucking stupid.
Not only did I disappoint my friends but also my family.
I just disappoint people whatever I do.
Maybe everything would be better if a piece of shit human like me would just disappear.
My brother's 20th Birthday is happening this week, I want to be there for him, and then I could rest knowing that I left a world better because I am not in it.
I don't wanna die, thought.
I just want the pain to stop, I just want the world to Freeze for a second and actually breathe even for just a minute.
But I can't.
I'm already way too deep in this whole.
