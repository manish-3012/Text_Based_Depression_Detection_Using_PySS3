Please Don't Do ItIf whoever is reading this has contemplated or attempted suicide in the past, please don't do it, I beg you. Today I found out my aunt killed herself by jumping off a bridge and it has not only affected me, or my mom but every single person in my family. As I write this, I hear my mom cry in her room. Please don't do it. Because you are valuable, no matter how many scumbags tell you otherwise, because there is always people in a person's life that care so dearly for that person. A distant memory of mine was on new years, I think it was 2016, and I remember my aunt. Her laugh, smile, her aura of joy she left on others. That was a good day, and I'll never see it again. You are valuable, you mean something to somebody in this world, something that can't be replaced. May god bless you and your families.
