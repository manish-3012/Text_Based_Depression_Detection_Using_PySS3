I'm hurtso this summer has been shit for me, i lost all my friends and yesterday. I even lost my only real bestfriend I have ever had. i'm so hurt I can't take it anymore, she meant everything to me and now shes gone. I have way too much stress on my mind and now that this adds up I simply don't have the energy anymore for it, I don't want to have hope. I don't even wanna see or hear the word. I'm done, I don't want to fight it anymore. I have tried therapy so many time and it just won't work. I have made plans to do it tonight, and tbh I don't fear it or I won't regret it, after all I was born a mistake anyway. I don't care if my family will miss me, they should've helped me when I gave them the chance. Who would miss me anyway

People told me to get new friends but i'm scared that this will happen again, I just want my old friend back.

It hurts even more when other friends tell me that my bestfriend only ever talked to me because she was scared this would happen, I guess I fucked this up aswel.

The only option left for me is to just die
