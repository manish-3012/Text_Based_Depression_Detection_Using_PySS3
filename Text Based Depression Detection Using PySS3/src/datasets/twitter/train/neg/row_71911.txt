Please talk me out of these thoughtsI did something several years ago when I was a dumb kid, nothing violent, and I know the person it involved is completely okay with what went down, and doesn't want to pursue it, but the justice system does. It could potentially follow me for the rest of my life.

The appeal costs alot of money, and I can't force my family to pay for this, I am at a fork in the road, I can bite the bullet and watch my family potentially go into debt because of my stupid decision, or face this charge and ultimately end my life if I keep thinking the way I am now. I'm so confused as to of what I am to do. Please reddit, I need something, anything, I don't want to do it but I feel like it's all i have to do.

(just an fyi i'm not in any danger tonight, I have 20 days to appeal, I need to make a decision at that time)

edit: also have self mutilation problems from past depression, they're rearing their ugly heads again.
