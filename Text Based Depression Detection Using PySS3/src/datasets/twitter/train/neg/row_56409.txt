I will be okay but not right nowI need a job. I need a job. I need a job. I need a job. I need a job or I will just be a burden always and will destroy all around me. I need a job. I need a job. I need a job. I need a job. Or I will be useless. I need a job. why is it so hard to get a job? to have motivation? why canÂ´t I get an interview, get rejected and at least learn something. Do people see me being a loser from just seeing my cv? I wanna go and never come back.
