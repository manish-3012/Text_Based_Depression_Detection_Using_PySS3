sooni can feel myself running out of time. i have the pills and have attempted twice this month, i would be in the hospital but my parents dont care enough. they see all the signs. my friends know, they know ive been attempting but they donâ€™t care enough either. no one genuinely cares. even if they did, i wouldnâ€™t. im done with this life. i seriously am. ive tried everything to make me happy or whole again but to no avail. nothing helps. i dont know if ill do it tonight or tomorrow night. but its gonna be soon.
