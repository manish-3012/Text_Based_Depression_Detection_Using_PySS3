Please help, or dont, I dont even know if i careI am a loser, with no ambition, and no future. The only person I ever cared about I have hurt beyond repair. Ive been so fucked up for so long I ruined everything I ever had. I went from a normal kid with tons of opportunities, to a 28 yr old, unemployed, college drop out, asshole, piece of shit, loser. I loved my girlfriend more than anyone could ever know. She gave me more chances than I can count on my hand. The only time I ever do anythign good is when I was with her. She brought out the good in me, now im just evil and should die. Every time I would fuck it up. I AM worthless, I AM a loser, and I DON'T deserve to live.

I try every day to show this girl I love her but i already ruined everything and I just hurt her. I know she would rather me be dead. I wish I was dead. The pain hurts so much. Alcohol and drugs don't numb me anymore I hope the next drug I take kills me.

I say please help, I don't even know if I want it, everyday I wish I would find out I have terminal cancer, or someone would run into my car and kill me, or ill get robbed and killed. these would all be welcome experiences. I wish I never had to have another conscious thought. I don't want a life where I can't be with her. especially knowing I could have had her if I didnt do anything I possibly could to throw away her love. If anything just help erase me from existence, it would do the universe a favor.
