How to Tell My Parents I have Suicidal ThoughtsI'm thirteen years old and I'm depressed and suicidal.  It's weird because some days, everything's fine, and the next, it's really bad. My parents have no idea. I've tried dehydrating myself because it's the only thing I can do. I feel as if nothing matters anymore and I've felt this way for months. I have anxiety too, but I'm scared to tell my parents. I can already see the sad, scared looks on their faces. I want to tell them, but I don't want to hurt them. I'm afraid that they're going to ask me a bunch of questions that I don't know how to answer. I need advice. 
Also, please do not make comments saying that I shouldn't feel this way and things like that. I get it if you don't understand what I'm going through, but no hate please. It's the last thing that I need right now.
