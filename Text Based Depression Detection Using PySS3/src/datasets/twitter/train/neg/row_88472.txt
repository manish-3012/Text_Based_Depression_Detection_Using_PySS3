Best idea is prob to kill myselfThinking about it pretty serious. I'm 31 and have a gambling/spending problem. I started at 16 with gambling and I've probably lost around 180k in the last 15 years. I have 35k credit card debt that I think I could square long term because I have a great job. I almost feell like just saying fuck it and ending myself.
