is it possible that iâ€™m just not meant to live?was there a glitch in the system when i was created? this doesnâ€™t feel right. it never has felt right. iâ€™ve never fit in. iâ€™ve always been the last picked. not good enough. the outcast. the one pointed and laughed at. why me? why do i deserve such pain? what did i do so wrong?
