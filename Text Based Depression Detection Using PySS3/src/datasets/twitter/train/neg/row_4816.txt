Feeling like I NEED to kill myself, but don't really know whyDoes anyone else feel like they just positively **HAVE** to kill themselves? Like I don't even really *want* to commit suicide, but I know that I have to and that I will, I just need to push through it.  


It's almost like it's the right, correct thing to do. I'd barely be able to explain my reasons if anyone asked *why* I wanted to kill myself, I just know that I need to die.  


So that's basically where I'm at right now, not necessarily wanting to commit suicide, but forcing myself to do so anyway because - well because they just need to like I don't know how I can accurately get this across.
