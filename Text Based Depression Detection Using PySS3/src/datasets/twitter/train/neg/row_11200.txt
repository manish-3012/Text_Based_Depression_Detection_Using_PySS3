I was going to shoot myself at school but I decided not toIf you have time to read this, a bit of a rant:

&amp;#x200B;

As I browse Reddit I see posts titled similar things that I used to write a while back: "I think I'm going to commit suicide today", "would anyone even care", "I dont know anymore", variations and stuff to that extent. That wasn't too long time back for me, this started maybe last year in June and ended in this May I'd say.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background: I've been unhappy since I can remember. I always been suicidal. But this time period marks the point where it got super bad, and the point where it started calming down. I don't really want to talk about everything leading up to this point in my life where I continuously seeked suicide, but rather what it is like when you hit that point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I knew suicide was technically "irrational". But I thought life was so unpredictably irrational it didn't matter. I'd be dead, so it wouldn't matter right? The consequences wouldn't affect me. If I didn't think about the consequences then I could leave and all the pain would just be gone.

&amp;#x200B;

I indulged in this particular fantasy for a long time: public suicide. Particularly, I wanted to shoot myself in my seventh period. I don't know why, but I found it so appealing. Part of it had to do with pop culture portrayal of the revenge aspect to it. I wanted to get back at people who've bullied me, an ex, and the school system. Not so much the teacher, I felt bad for that guy, but I knew I'd die and escape all consequence. There was the chance that I'd end up horribly disfigured. But at that point, there'd be nothing to lose and I could just attempt it again with even less fear. Because surviving was the only fear I had.

&amp;#x200B;

But I didn't have a gun.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew my dad had a gun and it was in a safe somewhere, but that's it. So I looked around the house. Didn't take long for me to find it under the couch in his office. He had a camera in his room, one of those security cams with an app, so I downloaded the app, tried variations of his email for login, and guessed his password based upon other accounts he shared with me. I turned off the camera. Guessed the code to the safe based off previous codes. He has a bad habit of using old passwords. But the safe was empty, but I knew it was the safe for the gun because of the casing inside.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a minor in liberal California and I was constantly searching online and hitting people up to see if I could get access to a gun. Black market was hella shady so I stayed away from there. I was hoping to contact someone who'd give it up for a big amount of money; I had all this money that I wouldn't need if I was dead, so as long as I got what I want, I thought I'd be fine. I searched on all sorts of sites. It wasn't as easy as Americans like to portray it. Some people cooperated, but then lived too far.

&amp;#x200B;

I posted on subreddit throughout this whole process. I posted my plans. I knew eventually I'd find someone willing to help me out, or my dad will return the gun back in the safe. Wherever he took it, I know he'd bring it back, because in the past someone tried to break in the house and he took it back so I knew it existed.

&amp;#x200B;

On this subreddit a stranger tried to talk to me about my feelings. I didn't budge. I was stubborn about my plan, and mad at the world. On the post I made I talked about wanting a gun but not being old enough. They said they could help me. They messaged me in private, and I noticed something was off because they dodged around my questions. But I thought fuck it. I remember being at school talking to this stranger, and I knew it was dumb and I could get in big trouble, but I remember just thinking fuck it, I doubt anything would because nothing interesting ever happens to me anyways. They told me they could deliver it to me for a price and we worked out the details. I gave them my zipcode to let them know my general vicinity. We talked more, and then we settled on delivery by my school so I gave them the address of my high school.  Both were super dumb mistakesâ€”and I'm usually not a super dumb person, to be real. But I wasn't thinking straight. 

&amp;#x200B;

This gave the stranger enough information to contact the admins of my school. This gave the admins enough information to identify who I was. So the cops show up at my house. I tell them it's a joke, but they have access to everything I posted. I tell them it's my strange way of coping: making dark jokes is my way of venting, but I never intended to ever do anything. They told me they'd take me to get psychologically analyzed, and if I fail the analysis they'd put me on a 72 hour hold. Long story short, my insurance screwed up and I never got a chance to be assessed and was sent to a psychiatric hospital anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

The experience was so hellish that I managed to act like the happiest person there to convince them that I wasn't depressed. I've never been so depressed that I can't function in front of other people for a long-term amount of time so acting fine was fine. Mostly everyone else was the typical edgy teenager with piercings and dyed hair and an attitude, and I was this kid that was super polite and got straight A's and smiling and joking a ton. So right away I stuck out like a sore thumb. I put on this constant show of being fine because I wanted to go home so bad, and I was wishing they'd lift my hold. They just didn't want to lift my hold earlier in mean case I ended up shooting a school later and they'd get sued. 

&amp;#x200B;

The psychologist seemed really annoyed that I was fine. I told him that I was just venting, and he said "so you just did it for attention huh" and I said yeah so I could get out of there quicker. It worked. I got out of there as soon as my hold was lifted. Usually they kept people longer.

&amp;#x200B;

I was just as unhappy as any of these kids. But that night I found myself lying in bed at the hospital thinking "I'm not depressed" and "I'm here by mistake" because I was constantly trying to prove I wasn't depressed. I still kind of believe I was there by mistake when I remember the kinds of people there. But then I remember I was actually going to shoot myself at school. I don't know. I fit right in, right? Then why was I the only one trying to pretend I was fine? Did I actually do it just for attention?

&amp;#x200B;

I felt this sense of discomfort when I returned home. I felt unsafe. Like I couldn't tell anyone how I felt anymore. But I felt a new sense of gratitude towards my life. My mom was mad I did something so dumb but she understands my situation better now. My dad talked to me about my situation he was aware of, but never found it right to talk to me about. I missed a really important performance during my stay which resulted in a lot of people getting pissed as hell. When I got to check my phone, I saw that when I missed a practice people messaged where I was. My friends asked for what happened and I told them. This girl I caught feelings for, a close friend of mine, part of the reason I was so depressed, we talked and just some part of talking about it to someone I loved so much helped me so much. I realized yeah I don't matter that much to these people, but I matter at least a little. I saw things change when I wasn't gone. Some people noticed I was gone. And that's got to mean something right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you feel as if no one will care if you are gone. But actually think about it. Maybe loneliness is not your pain problem; loneliness is a problem for me, but not my main one, because I know it isn't permanent. But knowing I'm not as lonely as I thought I was, it makes it a little more bearable. I'm looking forward now. My same problems are here, but surrounding yourself with people will make it better. Stop worrying if they care because it'll only make it worse. I see the solution in the future so I just have to hold on.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not anti-suicide. I hate that hospital and my insurance for fucking up. And I'm not happy, but I'm happier. I'm not forcing people set on suicide to not do it. I won't send you to the hospital; if you aren't depressed before you get sent there, you'll definitely be once you get there. But I'm just saying I was about 98% sure I wanted to do it. Now I'm around 50%. I'm mostly excited for the future. So. Maybe give it a shot to live a little differently. And to the people who want to kill themselves but can't. If you can't because you don't have the resources, or are holding on for someone, or aren't sure about your life, this might save you some heartbreak. Force yourself to think you're not depressed even if you are. It sounds so simple it sounds dumb. But if you can force yourself to do it, you can be a little happier. I'm not invalidating anyone's feelings. It might not work for you. But this might help even just one person
