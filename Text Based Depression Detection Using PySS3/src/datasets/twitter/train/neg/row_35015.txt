Donâ€™t have anyone, my only good relationship is slipping away and Iâ€™m back to the startIâ€™m a 17 year old girl suffering with depression and a fuckton of other issues that I donâ€™t even know of yet. Iâ€™ve always been walked over because Iâ€™m quiet and nice, and Iâ€™ve been bullied since I was 12. My parents are both dissociative and never asked me about my feelings, my day, etc. They use everything I say against me and have to argue with me on everything I say, I can never be right. We barely even talk anymore but I live in their house. I have a boyfriend who I love with everything I have but Iâ€™m so fucking sad that heâ€™s distancing himself from me also and it seems like itâ€™s almost the end of us. My birthday was two weeks ago and my only 2 friends cancelled their plans with me on the night we were supposed to celebrate. They said theyâ€™d reschedule but never brought it up again and I spent my birthday crying, again. 

Last year, when I turned 16, I tried throwing a party (didnâ€™t even bother this year) I had about 20 people say theyâ€™d come, only 3 people showed up, 2 of them left early, and the last one stole my dadâ€™s phone and moved to Pennsylvania the next day so there was no way to get it back. I have no one to even talk to about my feelings because my boyfriend basically tells me to get over myself and stop ruining his day and try to think of â€œhappy things.â€ I have been suffering for so long that thereâ€™s no trace of happiness in my mind anymore. No one likes me, I see a therapist and it doesnâ€™t even help, and I go to the most poor, miserable school ever where I donâ€™t fit in anywhere, 

I just want happiness at this point, enough to get me through each day without crying or breaking down but Iâ€™m so weak and beat down that I feel like I canâ€™t go on anymore. The only way I can end this suffering is to end it, Iâ€™ve tried it multiple times before and didnâ€™t die and Iâ€™m not scared to do it again. I just want someone to care enough to listen to me and try to help genuinely without just brushing it off because my depression puts them in a bad mood. My boyfriend told me to stop using my depression as an excuse to not be happy. I need someone to understand how deep this pain inside my mind is, I feel it every day piercing my heart and slowly driving me to suicide. I canâ€™t handle it anymore, no matter what I do I canâ€™t win, I donâ€™t have any desire to be alive on this planet anymore. Iâ€™ve been suffering for over 5 years with this constant pain and it seems like it will never end, I donâ€™t know where I could possibly find happiness when I have no passion or motivation, The next time my boyfriend is out Iâ€™m planning to end it, I just need one good reason and some sort of hope for myself to stay alive. No one close to me can find one besides â€œso many people love youâ€ My own parents donâ€™t think Iâ€™m anything to be proud of, my boyfriend wants to get away, and my friends donâ€™t even like hanging out with me unless they have to at school. Nobody makes an effort to talk to me or be nice, usually people hate me just by looking at me and judge me because of a deformity I have. 

Iâ€™m sorry about this rant and if it doesnâ€™t make sense, I just have so much inside that I canâ€™t let out because I have no one to express it to. I need to end it or get serious help and no one seems to understand that itâ€™s this bad, or they donâ€™t care. Thank you for reading this far, I feel guilty for even exposing you all to my hopelessness. have a nice day
