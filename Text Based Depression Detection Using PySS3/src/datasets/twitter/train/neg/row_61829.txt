It's my 5th attempt, yet i'm still here.12:27 AM. I have school tomorrow, and I need to get up at 6:30. Me and my mom had an argument, that both culminated in both her and my sister threatening the call the police because I told my mom how shitty I think she is. How she is just like my father.

I'm done with it. I try for a few minutes finding a suitable ligature and where to hang it. I end up with my leather belt, with a freshly pricked new hole to tighten it to. I attach it to a doorknob, with put a towel and then my neck inside. Then i drop.

I feel my head getting lighter, but I can still breathe. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. My heart pounds. I stop. I wonder if this is really what I want to do. If i want to die looking at my dirty room, the floor riddled with clothes and books. I don't care. My whole life is ugly. 

All my life i've followed a strict moral code that I try my best not to break. I can't live in the same world with people who don't even know what it means to be moral. Who have hurt me because they have no sense of brotherhood. All they care about is themselves.
