Think i want to die, not sure though.I just feel like a failure, that im never going to be good enough at anything that i do. i don't know why i cant become a better person, like i try for a while then i just go back to the lazy useless fuck that i am. I dont want to spend my whole life playing games to try to escape reality, even the games im playing are getting boring. i feel like im wasting my life. I barely eat i cant sleep early like a normal person. 

i keep being compared to everyone by my family, to my cousins, friends etc like i get it guys im not fantastic like they are or as talkative. i have no irl friends anymore and that scares me, i pushed them all away because i was going through shit and no one understands. I hate how i spend all day playing league. I wish i could be someone my family is proud of for once. 

i lost all motivation for my past hobbies. i need to get a fkn job and do something with my life. been saying that for 2 yrs now. im so scared of changing. i need to eat. i feel sorry for my friends on discord who read this shit every fkn week. i love them though. how do i stop thinking negative thoughts? or just thoughts in general?

Sometimes i think the world would be better off without me but i have the tiniest bit of hope for myself. I feel like i want to die but that's probably me just wanting an easy way out of the situation. idk anymore sometimes i feel like i wanna slit my neck other days i feel quite happy. 

hope ur all doing well! love ya.
