I simply find no joy or love in my life and I have not for a long time.  I feel exhausted and feel like I would rather get it over with.Hi SW,

Throwaway for obvious reasons...
I am a 28 year old man who does not enjoy life and has not for some time.  I have no friends.  I have no family close by and I have not had a loving relationship for over 7 years.  I have a pretty good job, which to be honest I can manage.  But my personal relationships with other people has always been a hard battle for me.  I cannot connect with people, and as a result, I can make some acquaintances, and no real friends.  I have felt borderline suicidal from when I was a young teenager, and have never really felt happy with myself.

I don't know who this is from, but someone once included love among the various 'needs' that a human being has.  I have love from my family, but I long to connect with another person and feel loved.  I just had my birthday, and I spent it sitting in my house, by myself actually crying because I'm just finding everything too much to handle.  I spend my weekend trying not to be bored around my house.  I usually end up playing a game (again) and I know life is passing me  by.  I have nothing to live for - The only thing that gets me up in the morning is work.  The first thing that comes into my head every day is sadness that I somehow didn't die throughout the night.  I see everyone else around me being able to do everything from being with a different person every week, to forming stable relationships and getting on with their lives.  I feel I am going to be left behind, and I will end up becoming one of those disgusting old men who cruise Asian beaches to buy a wife.

I'm feeling really overwhelmed with life right now, and killing myself is honestly looking like a better alternative than a life devoid of any happiness.  I just feel like giving up.
