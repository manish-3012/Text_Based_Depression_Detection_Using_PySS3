I don't want to face the struggles of life anymore. I'm scared. Call me a wuss. I don't give a crap.M progress report came in the mail today, and I have a C+ in my history class because of a 0 on a project. My parents are disappointed. I told them I turned it in, and it must've been a mistake. That, of course, was a lie. I didn't turn it in because it was due during our extended Spring Break, and I thought he would extend it by a week. A week went by, and nothing about it was mentioned, so I let it go. Idk if it was a conscious decision or not, but that doesn't really matter. Point is: I could contact my teacher and ask him if I could turn in an assignment that was due over a month ago, but I don't want to do that assignment. I don't want to deal with it. I want my grade to be decent, but I'm not willing to put in that effort. **I'm lazy and scared.**

I have a draft due for my final paper (7 pages with an abstract and at least 5 sources) in my Writing class due in five days, and all I have is a thesis statement, and the final paper is due a week after that. I don't want to do it. I like the normal flow of homework assignments, and I don't want to have to work harder than I am right now. I like getting my assignments done and then having free time on Reddit, YouTube, my Switch, and with my family. **I'm lazy and scared.**

I haven't responded to a friend in almost a month since this whole \*thing\* started. I owe her a response; I'm acting like a jerk by not replying to her. I'm just scared to respond after not getting back to her for so long. **I'm lazy and scared.**

I'm tired of people telling me that I need to move on and get up. SCREW THEM. YOU THINK I'M WILLING TO? DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT CALLING ME OUT FOR MY LAZINESS AND APATHY IS GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER? I KNOW HOW AWFUL MY BEHAVIOR IS. IF I (THE ONE WHO KNOWS ME BEST) CAN'T CHANGE MY BEHAVIOR, HOW ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER? 

I know this isn't going to change as I become an adult. College is probably going to be worse. Adulthood has responsibilities that I'm going to try to ignore, and I'll eventually curl up into a pathetic little ball of apathy. That's why I want to end it prematurely. I did some research and it appears that suffocation through nitrogen (or other gases) is the easiest and most painless way to go. Trouble is: I don't know how to easily do that. But that problem is a post for another time.

No one's probably going to read this, and that's fine. Most posts on here never get read, anyway. If you read this far, I just want to thank you for listening. I don't know what kind of response I'm looking for. I don't want to be dissuaded (unless if you have a flawless argument that can bring me out of my apathetic semi-nihilism, but I doubt one exists), but I also don't want to be encouraged. I just want to be decapitated.  Has anyone got a guillotine? Screw stay at home orders; you can't spread a disease if you're dead.
