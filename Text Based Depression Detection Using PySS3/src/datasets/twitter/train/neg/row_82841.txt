i donâ€™t want to go out of my housei have to go back to my old school soon to receive my exam results, and im not at all worried about my results because im aware that itâ€™s something i cannot change but i just donâ€™t want to leave my house and go to school. There are people there who i really donâ€™t want to see and they were one of the main factors that i couldnt stand being alive for the past two years. I also donâ€™t want to have to travel for two hours to go there. i dont want to be in public, i donâ€™t want people to see me. 

i know itâ€™s such a simple task and i hate that iâ€™m already panicking 4 days prior to the event but i just feel like if i see them, i might really really want to die. 

i want to tell someone i know about everything that has happened but i canâ€™t bring myself to actually do it. i genuinely hate that im acting like this when others are going through even much worse circumstances
