I want to kill myself. What about you?Hi. I've been thinking about this for years. And I just can't seem to take it off my mind.

I've opened up about it to a councilor when I was in college, and her way of talking me out of it was by playing with fear, that if I attempted to take my life, and then failed at it, I might end up permanently damaging part/s of my body (like ending up paralyzed and stuff) and I'd just end up regretting why I did it in the first place. It worked for a time, because it worried me that I'd fail and it scared me.

I even got caught harming myself by my family. It was my older sister who found out first and made me stop because  our mother would be sad. When my mother did catch me, she got angry instead.

Back in college, I tried telling myself that maybe it's just because I'm in a course I didn't like, because my father decided it was the "best" for me.

I've graduated. And the thought just keeps persisting. I'm afraid that it will never go away.

Even if you tell me to get some help from professionals I don't have the money, and no one really cares about this matter from where I am. People here think, that if someone resort to suicide they're weak, they let their problems get the best of them, that they're sinful and they'll go to hell.

I don't know why I'm posting this. Maybe I just wanted to share since I've been lurking around here and reading your posts. It's consoling in a weird twisted way to know that I'm not alone. But it's still frustrating cause I can't do much about it on my own, not really knowing what to do next and if it's the right thing to do. I've also talked to some friends who feel the same way but that doesn't really do anything. Nothing's solved, and it hasn't changed how I feel.

I still want to kill myself. I'm still a worthless piece of shit.
