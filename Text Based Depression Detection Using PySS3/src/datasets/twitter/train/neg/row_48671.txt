Planning on killing myself later this weekAfter many many times of wanting it, hopefully this time it's for real. The pain is too much. 
It has taken me whole. 
The darkness is real at completely set in. I can't even lean on my family and girlfriend to talk myself out of it. 
I turned 25 today and almost all those years have been suffering. I think it's time to go. I'm going to get the words "I'm sorry" on my grave because that's all I've ever said and will need to say. I'm a sorry sack of shit, I've lead a sorry life and I'm sorry for ever being a pathetic useless idiot burden on everyone's life.
