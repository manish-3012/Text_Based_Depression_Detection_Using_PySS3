Call for helpI lost my brother to suicide 6 years ago this April 24th. I've spent the last 2 hours looking at pictures and listening to his music. I always wondering what I did wrong and what I could have done differently 

DO NOT DO IT. 

Please please please....there are resources out there for you. Reach out and get help for your depression. The amount of pain you will cause is nothing to what you are feeling. If you have nobody else to reach out to please message me.
