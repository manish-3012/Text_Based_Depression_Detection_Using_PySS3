One of these daysI am hesitating but quite sure about doing it.


Now I have done bad things in my life.

Id fraud, stalking, harrasment, smuggling stuff in clinics, fightinf people, Multiple over the line posts.

I have done terrorist threats in the past.

Rn my situation in life is as follows.
My friends ignore me.

Haven't scheduled work times yet.
Delivered the worst school project ever.
Have multiple people want me gone. Some said things like: 'you need shock therapy and counseling 24/7 with no internet acces'

Which hurts like a lot. Especially when this people make posts asking people to downvote and report you. Yes I annoyed them personally. But they do this bc they thino it's their duty. They do not do it bc of what happened to them. 

But also bc of my past. They are right I am a bad person. That's why I will deal with it myself. But they need to fuck off. They know nothing. 1 person is a autistic crylord and the other is a kid.

It's sad how a death me is better then me alive.
