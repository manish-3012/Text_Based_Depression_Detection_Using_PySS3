No pointThereâ€™s no point. Iâ€™ve failed my PhD exams three times now. Iâ€™m a 27 year old virgin with no friends and now 5 years of grad school debt that has led to nothing. I have no other prospects. Thereâ€™s no point, no one would mourn me, the world is dying anyway. Nothing entertains me anymore, i just lie on the floor day to day. canâ€™t eat. just want to drink. why bother. it gets better? it hasnâ€™t been better for 10 years just worse and worse
