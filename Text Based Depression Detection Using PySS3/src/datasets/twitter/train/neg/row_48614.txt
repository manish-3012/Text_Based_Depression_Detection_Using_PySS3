I was getting better until tonightAmy was confirmed for the supreme court. Sheâ€™s pro-life and anti LGBTQ+. Please dont argue in this post. PLEASE DONT ARGUE JN THIS POST. I dont care if you disagree or not, sheâ€™s against my and many other women and LGBTQ+ membersâ€™ rights and sheâ€™s might try to overturn roe v. Wade. I want to die. Dont argue in this fucking post or im going to delete your unnecessary fucking comment. The point of this post is that i was improving but now i feel like having an aneurysm and dying and leaving this world.
