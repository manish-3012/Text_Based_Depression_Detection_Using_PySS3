My boyfriend tried to kill himself shortly before we started dating. He will almost certainly do it again if we break up. How do I deal with this?He keeps telling me that I am the only reason to continue. I really try to show him that life is wonderful and there are a bunch of things that make life worth it, but he keeps telling me the same thing. I know we are going to break up at some point and it could be at any time. I want him to be prepared when this inevitability comes. I really don't want him to try to kill himself because I really care for him and I don't want to be the reason someone I love died.
Please help me, he tells me not ever to leave him and that hurts my heart.
