I gave life one last try and it still fell apartThis year didn't start off good. I started it with extreme depression and anxiety. I didn't have any friends left. No significant other. College was too frustrating. I tried jumping off my schools parking deck, but was caught and admitted to the hospital. Honestly, the mental hospital was a big help and I felt better after leaving. Then I found new friends. I reconciled with an old friend who screwed me over previously. I even found a significant other and I was so happy with him. 

But now, I've lost all of that all over again. First I failed the spring semester because I was too depressed and anxious to focus on it. After moving back home, my parents took my car away, meaning I couldn't see my friends or partner anymore. Then my friends stopped caring about my wellbeing because I couldn't hang out with them and I couldn't consistently keep in contact with them. Then my partner decided to break up with me because I couldn't go see them anymore; they don't own a car because it was totaled and he doesn't have the funds to buy a new one. Then my old friend screwed me over a 5th time. Then my parents kept asking for $4000 ($2000 a semester) because they paid for my school year since FAFSA couldn't cover the full ride, and I barely have $500 in my account because I pay for my gas, phone plan, and other amenities. I'm already in debt because of FAFSA. Now I can't even go back to school in the fall, meaning no more volleyball or meeting new friends, which were 2 of the biggest things that kept me going. 

I gave life one try after the hospital. And for a while it was good. Now I'm back to where I was. I've been dealing with mental illness since I was 12. I'm 21 now. It never stops. I have nothing and no one left. I need it to stop.
