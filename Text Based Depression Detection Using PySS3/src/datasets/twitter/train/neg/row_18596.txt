I cant anymoreIts 6â€™o clock in the morning. Day 2 that im still awake, im crying and dying. I cant fuckin take this anymore. Why is everything always going bad in my life? The pain is so heavy on my chest and heart even breathing just fuckin hurts. I feel so alone. I feel like i shouldâ€™ve never stayed alive and just kill myself already. At the moment im so bad i cant even write the things i wanna say or why i am feeling like this, will i ever be happy?
