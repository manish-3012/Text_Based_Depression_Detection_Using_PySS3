I am suicidal and I dont wanna kill myself, but...... I just want the pain to go away. I just want to feel free. I want to feel happy.

It's not happening and I am lost. Lost in my own thoughts. I am not sure which way to choose. I am not sure how to stay alive anymore. I am not living my life, I am just staying alive, surviving in my own body. Surviving...
