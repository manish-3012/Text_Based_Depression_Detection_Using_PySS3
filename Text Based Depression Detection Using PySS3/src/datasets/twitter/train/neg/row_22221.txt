Itâ€™s backThe urge to rip myself out of my own skin and disappear isnâ€™t as strong and loud as it has been... 
But, here I am laying on the floor of my apartment in tears, considering the options yet again.

Iâ€™ve typed this out about 5 or 6 times now, but nothing seems to sum up just how lost and empty I feel. 
Itâ€™s all hopeless at this point. 
Even killing myself seems pointless. 
Iâ€™m dead anyway, so I may as well wait it out. I wish I could sleep until that time.

No one truly cares for anyone and we are all lost.
