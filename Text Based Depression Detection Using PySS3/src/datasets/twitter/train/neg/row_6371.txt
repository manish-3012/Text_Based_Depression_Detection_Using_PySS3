The only thing keeping me from killing myself is the fear of survivingEveryday I can feel the urge to jump in my dadâ€™s car and ram it into a tree. The only thing that holds me back is the same question: â€œwhat if I survive?â€ 
Having to sit through the hospital, ending up in a wheelchair, probably having to pay for the car damages, I canâ€™t do it.
Yet I canâ€™t stand being alive.
