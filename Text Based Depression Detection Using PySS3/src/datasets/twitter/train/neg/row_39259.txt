Why do I think of ways to kill myself, but don't follow it through?cPTSD, OCD, anxiety, depression, intrusive thoughts, self loathing, you name it. I've got it. I've had all these for 8 years now, yet even after 8 years and being my lowest of lows, I still can't take all those tablets and finally end it.

I know my future won't get better, and don't say it will, because you don't know my story. Why can't I end it now instead of going on another 8 years of suffering?
