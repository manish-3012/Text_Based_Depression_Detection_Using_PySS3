HimHes always on my mind, the one person that has kept me going. Made me happy and smile and made me feel good about myself, but he was also the one tearing me down emotionally and mentally everyday making me seem like a monster. His final words tear me down and break me entirely... I am numb I feel nothing. My life is now monotone, black and white. My days are grey without him. He hurt me yet I still want more..
