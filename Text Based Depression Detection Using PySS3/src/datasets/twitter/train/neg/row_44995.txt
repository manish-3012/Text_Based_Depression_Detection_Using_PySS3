I'm 24 and I'm scared nothing will changeI'm 24. I dont have a degree, I dont have a job, i try and apply but no one will call back. I still live with my parents and I can tell they are tired of me being so useless too. I have a bf that i adore and it's the only reason I'm still here, but he is tired too. I've talked him out of 3 suicide attempts, every time he has an episode he has asked me to do it with him so we can be free of this shit and the next time he suggest it I'm going to say yes. I'm never going to find a job and I only have useless skills. I dont want to live in poverty and with my parents forever. When I was a child I thought I was going to be a successful woman, I thought I was going to have a house by now. I have earned nothing. I'm a miserable failure and it hurts.
