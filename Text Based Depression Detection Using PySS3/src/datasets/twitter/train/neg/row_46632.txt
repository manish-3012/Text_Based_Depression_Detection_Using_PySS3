Read if you pleaseI'm 15, my name is Gabe.

I feel like im just trapped in this endless time loop of the same shit every single day.

Im unmotivated and smoke weed every day. I cant even do my fucking schoolwork. I just want it to end but I cant do it 

I pray every night that I wont wake up, but the fear of loosing myself, of loosing that voice in my head every day that I speak to, day and night. How do I just stop the marching speed of time that's impossible to stop. Why must I have been born such a complicated species like a human? Why must I be aware of my own existence? I am surely taking it for granted but what's it like not having your own concience and just being a dog or a cat all day long? Why must I have these feelings that put me in this hole? And how am I supposed to ever get out of this?

I know what you guys think, every day. The pain, the wish to end yourself. But how could you knowing that yourself, the voice that you think to and speak to every day is never going to be there again? I'm afriaid to die but I WANT to.
