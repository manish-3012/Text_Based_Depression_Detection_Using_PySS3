I can't take anymore shit from my parentsI'm 15. Young and a fragile kid. So how I'm about to describe my parents may not sound that bad to you, but to me it's a never ending nightmare. Anyways I live with my Dad and step mom. Most of the issues come from my step mom. Anyway I'm not gonna give a whole life story. I'm just gonna tell you how they view me and how they voice it. I'm shy and don't socialize much. And do they hate that very much. Is especially my step mom. Almost every time they're out with friends and I'm there, they always tell them how "stupid I look when I don't talk." I kind of just sit there and smile pretending like it's just a joke. But deep inside I know it's not. Basically, in a way, I'm not a very helpful and "fun" person to hang out with. And that's something they hate as well and they just bash me over the head with that shit. My step mom is always, everyday telling me how she wishes I could actually do something with my life, or how she voices every 30 mins of the day: "Oh I forgot. You can't because your useless." Today has possibly been the worst of all and that's what lead me to write this. Today we are taking a cruise. And both my Dad and step mom act like a team while trying to push me out of their way. The one thing that just absolutely broke my heart was this one incident. Again, might not sound that bad, but it broke my heart. While walking back to the hotel my step mom told me, while I was walking next to them, "Get out of our way and hurry to the hotel so you can pick up. We don't want you here right now. We'll meet you there at the hotel." I almost bursted out in tears, but I couldn't. If I did others walking past us would look at me strangely thinking why a grown kid is crying. I can't take it. I really can't. I only have 3 more years until I can leave, but I don't know if can take it.
