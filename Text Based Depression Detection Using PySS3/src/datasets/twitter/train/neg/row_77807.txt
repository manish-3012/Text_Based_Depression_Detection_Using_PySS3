I have a knife to my throatI posted earlier, I am going through alcohol withdrawal again and I cannot repeat this. I have a doctors appointment tomorrow where I was planning to tell them but a combination of vomiting blood and not being able to forgive myself has made me decide its really time. I have tried to kill myself many times but my body is just resilient I guess, I don't really want to slit my throat but I need a surefire way I will die.
