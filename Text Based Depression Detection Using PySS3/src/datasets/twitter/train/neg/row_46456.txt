Living for someone elseIâ€™ve been diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, PTSD, General Anxiety Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder. You can tell I had a rough upbringing. Now that Iâ€™m an adult and out of the abusive situation, you think Iâ€™d get better. I donâ€™t have the best life but I am free of abuse. But the sadness still lingers. Medication, therapy, doctors, hospitals - and I still feel suicidal everyday. 

The only reason I stay alive is because it would destroy my fiancÃ©e. She knows that I struggle with mental health but I could never tell her about my suicidal thoughts. It would make her so sad and probably feel bad about herself. Thatâ€™s how itâ€™s gone before when I spoke about it. Itâ€™s not that she canâ€™t make me happy, itâ€™s that Iâ€™m permanently damaged from my childhood and I donâ€™t know if I can recover. 

Iâ€™m starting to grow tired of life. Idk what I expect from this, just need to put this out there.
