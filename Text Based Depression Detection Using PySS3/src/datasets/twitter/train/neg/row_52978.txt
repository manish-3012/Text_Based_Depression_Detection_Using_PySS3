What is the point of living if all the suggestions against suicide are anti suicideI actually came against this issue in a dream last night. Faux me and me me were having an argument in a bar and I just couldnâ€™t beat the though that being anti-suicide isnâ€™t reason enough to not kill myself. And I mean really, being anti suicide doesnâ€™t mean my death would mean any less. It just keeps my reason for killing myself from being anything more than that. So when my reason becomes just â€œnot commuting suicideâ€, what tf is my last step?
