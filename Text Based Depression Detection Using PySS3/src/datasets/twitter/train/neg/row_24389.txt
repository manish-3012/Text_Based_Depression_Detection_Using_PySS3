I want to cut my tattooed skin off of my body, I want to shave my head and shoot my hideous skull and leave my deformed body in the ocean or where no one will find it.All the good things I am told by temporary strangers has been said by five times the amount of people to my abusive ex best friend. 

It is now gotten to the point where someone telling me to hold on and keep fighting to stay alive means nothing to me. I want it to mean something but I am truly disconnected from the human race. 

I am getting rid of every belonging. Slowly. Throwing it away or selling it. I planned on giving myself a pleasurable few days on earth as a proper send out to make peace with the injustice in my life. 

However, I realize being born an unfortunate female means I cannot roam the earth like a man can. 

I am hideous. I am deformed. I am unwanted. I am unloved. I am disabled. 

I have no reason to be alive.
