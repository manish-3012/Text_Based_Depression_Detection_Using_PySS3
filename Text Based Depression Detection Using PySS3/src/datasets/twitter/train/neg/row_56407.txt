I've been suicidal since I was 10When I was in fourth grade I got in trouble by writing in a notebook and filling it with the phrase 
"I'm useless, I want to die" 
I kept it up until my mom found it and grounded me for it. I always am sad and even when something in my life seems fun I tell myself I dont deserve it. I feel as though all my friends hate me and are just friends out of pity. Multiple times I've set dates and times and methods of killing myself but never followed through because I've been scared. My earliest memory of a suicide not was when I was in 5th grade and wrote in my journal 
"Goodbye, I want to never wake up. I am so sad"
Mental health issues have only been present in my mom, since she has clinical depression. I just want the cycle to stop. I want to feel genuine happiness. I want to be free from my own chains that I lock myself into.
