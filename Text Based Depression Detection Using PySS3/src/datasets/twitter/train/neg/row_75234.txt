I think I'm readyI think I might finally be ready after all these years of being suicidal.   


I know it is a horrible way to go, but I got some pills ready and a razor. Now my question is, can anyone tell me if I will realize when I should call the ambulance so my family won't be the ones to find me? I don't want to do it too early, but I don't want my family to find me either.
