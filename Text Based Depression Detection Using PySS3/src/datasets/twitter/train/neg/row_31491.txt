I can't seem to get my shit together.This is a confession, of sorts.  I haven't ever really laid all my shit out before.  So, sorry if this ends up being long.

First thing, I'm a 35 year old man.  I have a loving family and good friends.  I weigh over 450 pounds and haven't been in a relationship in about 8-9 years.  I live alone with my cat.  I've finally reached an age and weight where I really feel limited.  I've always been fat, but it's never been a huge hindrance.  I could still do everything other people could do, it might just take me a little longer.  Now, if I am standing for even a few minutes, my lower back starts to hurt a lot and eventually go numb.  I am now walking with my toes cocked off to the side in a sort of back and forth waddle because walking straight ahead pushes my belly out and strains my back more.  If I need to walk more than 50-100 feet, I will need to stop to catch my breath before continuing.

Apart from this physical stuff, I have become so utterly lazy at my job.  I am a lawyer, and I am seriously on the verge of malpractice in 2-3 cases just do to not doing anything.  I've never missed any deadlines that can't be missed, but I'm just doing a shitty job.  I've lost several clients in the last few months, and my boss has given me the "get your shit together or you're out of here" talk.  Even after the talk, I am still fucking up, still not doing the shit I'm supposed to.  He got a call from someone to report that paperwork I was supposed to file on a case last summer still hadn't been filed.  He sent me an email about it on Friday.  I had planned on coming in on the weekend to complete it to be filed today.  But, both Saturday and Sunday, I woke up, ate some food and just sat in my living room watching youtube videos all day.  Every time I thought about going to work, I just couldn't bring myself to leave.  I said I'd go in at 10am, then at 10am, I said noon.  At noon, I said 2pm.  At 2pm, I said it was already too late to work, so screw it, I'll go tomorrow.  Sunday, same thing.

My job pays me half of the money I bring in to the firm each month, so sort of commission.  I've never been great at bringing in lots of money, and I haven't been working very hard for a while now, so I am financially utterly fucked and on the verge of bankruptcy.  My credit score has dropped below 500 due to all of my unpaid bills.  I am having to borrow money from my retired parents to make ends meet most months.

I live in a shitty little studio apartment above a townhouse's garage.  It has no kitchen and incredibly spotty wi-fi.  Yet, I am happy to have it.  In the last year, I have been kicked out of 2 different apartments because the landlord saw how dirty it got. I've never told that to anyone.  I tell everyone that my first landlord wanted to raise rent, so I moved.  I tell them the second one had a family member that needed the space and my short-term lease was up.  All lies.  In reality, there were so many flies from the spoiled and rotting food trash that I filled 8 fly-trees and still had a significant fly problem.  When the landlord at the second place had to come in to turn off the main electric breaker, he said that the smell was so bad, he could smell it from 10 feet outside the door.  I'd gone noseblind to it.  I vowed after losing that place that I'd never let the new place get that bad.  So far, there are no flies, but the trash and mess are starting to pile up.

I am tired all the time.  Honestly, I am just waiting to die of a heartattack.  If it doesn't happen, I think maybe I'm hoping to be fired from my job to give me an excuse to end it.  I am not sure if I actually could, because it would hurt my parents far too much.  But, I certainly think about it all the time.  Maybe I could make it look like an accident somehow.  I'd love to get my life together and start living well, but I can't.  Every time I try, I just fall back into the same traps a few days later. I'm feeling very hopeless about everything.
