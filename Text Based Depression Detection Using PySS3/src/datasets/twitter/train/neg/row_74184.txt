Depressed friend, need adviceNot sure if this is the right place for this, but itâ€™s worth a shot. Obviously I canâ€™t give every detail, but to keep it brief my friend is depressed and I donâ€™t know what to do to help him. Heâ€™s been this way for about a month and itâ€™s gotten progressively worse over time. Iâ€™ve tried to be there for him whenever I can but itâ€™s hard because I donâ€™t feel like anything Iâ€™m doing is helping.

Heâ€™s always been very hard on himself and itâ€™s as bad as itâ€™s ever been right now. I donâ€™t know what to say to him. It seems like at this point heâ€™s just looking for reasons to berate himself. Heâ€™s also stubborn and it seems like heâ€™s refusing to try to change anything for the better. 

I want to do what I can to help him, but have never been in a position like this before. If anyone has any advice for me Iâ€™d appreciate it.
