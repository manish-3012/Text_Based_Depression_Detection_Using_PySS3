My goodbyeIâ€™ve thought about this for awhile now and I just need help on how To end it.

I never thought I would be one of the people that would end up writings these.

Iâ€™ve came to the conclusion that Iâ€™m never gonna be shit 

My mom says it to me, my teachers have said it damn even a homeless man said it to me. 
I donâ€™t know I just donâ€™t feel loved. I never felt the love and I donâ€™t think I ever will.
Iâ€™ve been getting kicked out the house since I turned 15. I just donâ€™t feel the love. My mom is a miserable neat freak that acts bipolar and likes to worry about the little things to avoid bigger things in her life...I try and stay out late as possible so I donâ€™t have to hear the regret in my mothers voice Iâ€™m not writing this letter to make people feel bad for me. Iâ€™m writing this letter because you could never truthfully know what goes on at home. Just a simple bit of love and affection could go along way. Sorry I didnâ€™t make smarter decisions but Iâ€™m not sorry for having to get high and drink to feel okay and loved... you know I might as well tell you one of my deepest secrets Iâ€™ve never been ables to tell Someone I love them. I think that shit is fake... I wish that everyone I was close with live a long, prosperous, healthy and loving life....
At one point I tried to better myself be more positive and show sympathy for others and I did just that people started to ask me why was I so positive and happy through the negatives and it was that I started to hate myself I started to feel miserable and disgusted of myself and it made me change how I seen myself then one day I posted a YOLO and I instantly started to get so much hate I never thought I would see the day where being nice and polite to people would would bring out the worst i someone I thought if I gave out love and kindness to others that I would receive nothing but the same back it turned out I was wrong and thatâ€™s how ended up here... and my mother is a manipulator she is not as innocent as she seems she claims to be a saint but talks down on all of her kids, her friends and family right behind closed doors.....
