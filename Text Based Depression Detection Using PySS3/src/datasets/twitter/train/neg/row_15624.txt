I might as wellI cut myself again. I've tried swallowing pills before but I think this time I have so many and a wide enough variety that it would work. I really don't want to die but I don't see what else to do at this point. I am going nowhere in life, I've fucked up the only relationship I have ever had, and the only thing that makes me feel better is cutting myself. I tried medication, therapy, exercise, everything that they told me to do. Nothing works. I think it's time that I accepted that I am not supposed to be here. It'll be hard on my family but not as hard as continually disappointing them for the rest of my life. I feel pathetic for bitching to this subreddit about this but I don't know what else to do.
