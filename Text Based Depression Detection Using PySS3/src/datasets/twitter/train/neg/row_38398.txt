I want to kill myself, but Iâ€™m too scared to.I want to kill myself so bad, but Iâ€™m too scared to actually do it. Scared of the pain. Scared of suffering. Scared I might live. I donâ€™t like my life, it sucks. My dad is emotionally unavailable, ever since I was little. My dad is actually a fun, funny person and I love him, but he never shows that he loves me and he never puts in the effort to spend time with me. It depresses me. I see him like once/twice a year now. My mom is bipolar and can be so heartless. I love her and I know she loves me, but sheâ€™s scary and depresses me. My siblings donâ€™t hang out with me or get involved in my life. I am the youngest. I donâ€™t have a close bond with anyone. I have no friends and Iâ€™m all alone. I am a very shy girl, filled with anxiety and depression. Itâ€™s so hard for me to make friends and to be open. Iâ€™m tired of myself. I hate myself. I cannot see myself succeeding when Iâ€™m older. I cannot handle the real world. I just want love and affection, but I canâ€™t find it anywhere in my family or friends. I dwell on the past and memories. I am still in love with my teacher whom I havenâ€™t seen in over a year. He was the only people who showed me love, affection, kindness, positivity. He showed me he cared. I miss him deeply and think about him 24/7. It depresses me he is gone from my life. I am a very unmotivated, lazy person. I do the same thing everyday: nothing. I have no friends to do things with and my family never does anything with me. I want to end it. Iâ€™m tired of living this way. Iâ€™m alone and stuck with nothing but my thoughts. I just want to kill myself. I donâ€™t know what to do. How do I do it with 100% completion. Without the possible suffering and pain. I want to be in heaven and be happy.
