Feel like hammered shitAbout a month ago my wife left me due to my depression and anxiety. Because of these and a few other physical conditions I can't work. No job = no money. No money = no wife. So much for better or worse, in sickness and in health, etc. Anyway, had depression for years now, don't see it getting any better, tried pills and therapy. Been depressed and hated my life since I was a small child. Don't see the point in continuing. I'm just a fucking waste of existence.
