Asshole asshole assholeBeen going through a lot of bad stuff. My mom is, my stepdad is. We're all under stress and high tensions at every turn. 

Today wasnt any different. Me and mom were supposed to do laundry, on my way past her room she couldn't hear me when she asked me a question so I said it louder but to her it sounded like I was being disrespectful and she said thats the reason everyone leaves me and dont talk to me.

We were ready to go but i asked for 10 minutes because of pain im in. I even acknowledged her pain and just asked for 10 minutes to sit. She said alright. Two fucking minutes later of her grilling me about some other shit she says "so i guess youre not going?" I was confused and she got all pissy and said she'd go by herself to do laundry. She said i could have the 10 minutes but I guess she wanted to be mad at me about something else and made it seem like I was being lazy and ungrateful. I ASKED FOR 10 MINUTES AND YOU SAID YES BUT NOW YOURE ACTING AS IF I JUST BLEW YOU OFF. 

I got pissed and I kicked a chair over and she told me to get out. I want to kill myself, I cant do a single fucking thing right in her eyes. Fuck her, fuck my problems, and fuck life. 

Death IS A SOLUTION TO EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM I HAVE
