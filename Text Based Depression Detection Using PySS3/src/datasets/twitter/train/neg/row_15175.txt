I donâ€™t understand what purpose I have in lifeIt seems as if I can never do anything right. Almost everyone hates me. My family wonâ€™t believe Iâ€™m depressed if I tell them. Theyâ€™ll probably just say â€œbeing sad doesnâ€™t mean your depressedâ€ so when Iâ€™m around them I have to act like Iâ€™m happy and everythingâ€™s fine. Luckily my only talent is acting. If I said I was going to kill myself nobody would give a shit except some people that comment on the post telling me not to do it but they donâ€™t know me and the pain Iâ€™m going through. They would notice or give a shit if I just disappeared from this useless world. Everyone is forgotten unless you change everyoneâ€™s life. 

Goodbye I hope this is my final post here
