The only winning move is not to play.I've used this throwaway for a while longer than I thought I would so my whole story is in my post history, but just for a rundown my ex girlfriend is actively trying to frame me for breaking a restraining order. She is trying to have me locked away. There is no one I can talk to about this, it's all "keep your head up" or "your court date hasn't come yet" or "one day at a time" but I'm sick of worrying.

An evil troll is trying to ruin my life and will stop at nothing to do so. It's been six months now since I broke up with her, she slapped me twice in the face and I pushed her away from me. She called the cops fist, I spent the night in jail. I got a restraining order on her the next day. She broke it by coming to my home (which I have proof of, no one cares) texting me (proof sent, no one cares) and having her new boyfriend pretend to be a police officer via text (other police officers confirmed it wasn't him, called and he told them his real name, no one cares). 

She has tried everything to initiate contact with me and I didn't fall for any of it. Weeks after all this crazy shit she gets a restraining order on me, and with no proof at all, boom I have a trial on Wednesday. Seems like they have their minds made up that I'm some wife beating monster and poor little girl could never do any wrong.

I cannot stand the thought of spending time in jail again for something I didn't do. I **will** find a way to kill myself if I'm held for even thirty minutes. If I'm found guilty for this crime I didn't commit **I will** kill myself. I've told myself that for months and I'm starting to find it comforting. "If it all goes south I'll just do it" stops me from worrying.

I can't talk to women anymore. I am so paranoid of more false claims I'm taking multiple pictures of my odometer every day to document my every move. This is no way to live. I don't want any part of a world where someone can drive someone to this level of madness. It seems juvenile but the first word that comes to mind when I think of all this is "icky", like she's inside of me and will never leave. 

It is a fact that I will have to worry about her false claims for the rest of my life. Do not tell me otherwise. I am correct. I will live in fear every day.

It is a fact that she is bulletproof to the police. They will not touch her no matter how much proof I have of her breaking the order and they go along with everything she says. Do not tell me otherwise. I am correct.

I am innocent and even if the judge somehow believes me the previous two statements still stand. She will walk away *laughing* one way or the other and I will continue to be scared every hour, every day, forever.

Part of me wants to save myself the potential embarrassment of being found guilty and check out now, this isn't much of a life to live anyway. I don't want any part of this. I don't want to play anymore. People are trash.
