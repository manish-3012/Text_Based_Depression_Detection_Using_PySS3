Iâ€™m planning on killing myself in less than 2 weeks.I am a 15F and I am planning on killing myself in 2 weeks. I made this plan about a year ago. I decided that I will kill myself if life doesnâ€™t get better. It got better for a while, but now itâ€™s worse than ever. I distanced myself from my friends and my parents probably hate me, so at least not that many people will be effected. Iâ€™m lonely, and I just feel bad about myself when Iâ€™m around people. I donâ€™t have any skills and I doubt that I will ever get a real job. I havenâ€™t been truly happy in years and I always end up miserable. No one has taken me seriously, so I think itâ€™s impossible to get help at this point. I feel like living is torture and I donâ€™t think life is worth living if I donâ€™t enjoy being alive. I donâ€™t want to kill myself, I just want to stop feeling like this and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to feel fine anytime soon. Maybe Iâ€™ll back out if I magically start enjoying life, but I think I will go through with it this time.
