I still want to dieContacted 10 friends today.... I still haven't gotten a response.

I first attempted suicide when I was 15.... I've been struggling with depression ever since.

It's been 9 years and every day I go to bed with the same wish. The same dream. That maybe tomorrow I'll be lucky enough to die.

I know people love me.
I know peoe care.
Is it selfish for me to not want to be here.

It's like being a piece of paper..... And losing little pieces day by day. When is it my final tear?

It's like being a car that is no longer quote good enough. The kind you pass by on the freeway without giving it a second look.

It's just being unnoticed. Unimportant. Irrelevant. And being contempt with it.
What's the use of pushing to be better, achieving something..... When my ultimate goal is to die.

I don't want sympathy. I don't want compassion. I just want to find a way to want to live.
