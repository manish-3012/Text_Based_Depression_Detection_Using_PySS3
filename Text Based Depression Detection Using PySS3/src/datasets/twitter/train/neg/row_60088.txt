Reddit, Iâ€™m losing itYou know the days, when you just lie on your bed the whole day wishing not to exist? Itâ€™s been lasting for about a week now, and I donâ€™t get it. Sadness is normal, but this is to intense and is lasting to long.

I am not even sure if itâ€™s the right subredit, as I do not intend to end my life. I want it back.

I am attractive, smart and liked by everyone. I study at a great university and live in a beautiful apartment. I have dreams and hopes, I love making new friends and the love me.

Itâ€™s just not enough anymore, everything seems pointless. I donâ€™t know why do I need to get up from my bed. So I donâ€™t. I lie there, I cry , I sleep, I stare at the wall and I empty my fridge. Sometimes I try to force myself to do stuff â€“ go for a run, go shopping, try new recipes, read a book, an article etc. And I feel happy doing it, only that when Iâ€™m done, I once again sit there wishing to cease existing. Itâ€™s getting harder and harder to force myself to do things, therefore I just lie there. And I canâ€™t get up anymore.

I like my life, I know I do. I just forgot what the purpose of it all was.
