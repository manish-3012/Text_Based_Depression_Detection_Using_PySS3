I donâ€™t fear death but I fear godI have no reason to live but god the more I think it over to do it the more I fear god. Iâ€™m afraid of him, or whatâ€™s to happen to me after I die? I am sorry for the things Iâ€™ve done. My huspand was my reason for living. Heâ€™s gone now. Every time I close my eyes I fear god will hate me for taking my own life. Iâ€™m so sorry to type this I never thought Iâ€™d say these things...Does anyone else struggle with this when it comes down to it?
