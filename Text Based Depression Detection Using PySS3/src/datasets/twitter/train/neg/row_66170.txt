I'm scared. I don't want to die.I've always imagined myself committing suicide one day. I'm afraid to, but I don't feel like there is any other choice. I can't stop crying. I don't know what to do. My entire life is just a series of distractions until tomorrow, but once tomorrow gets here it turns back into today and I repeat the cycle. I've been doing this for as long as I can remember. I know there is some happiness in my life, but it's mostly superficial. My main reason for living will be leaving soon and I don't know how much longer I can hang on. I've never been this scared before. 

I can see myself writing all this and imagine what all people would say, what I would say, in response, but this time it just feels so hollow. Nice things we're programmed to say, because deep down we're all nice people but sometimes misunderstood. I've said and heard it all before, it seems like. 

What do you do when talking and writing isn't enough? I so desperately to be held right now, to be told everything will be ok even if it's only a lie, just so I can get through this night. Because right now, I don't know how else I can make it this time.
