Hello, I wanted to kill myself.I am so fed up of people such as my family treating me like shit, I am tired of people pushing me around and I am tired of not having a job. There's no point of living anymore. I could just make others lives worse simply by living. I miss my dad so much. I wanted to be with him in heaven, where I actually belong. I don't belong in a world where everything turns against you. It's Hell. I wanted to commit suicide, but I simply can't. I want to die, but I am afraid to die.
