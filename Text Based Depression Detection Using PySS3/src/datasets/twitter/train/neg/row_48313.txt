Never look at your ex's Instagram I guess.I know that it's an old cliche and I've been able to avoid it for like 4 years now but I guess tonight I just wanted to punish myself and everything I saw even though I didn't even scroll just makes me want to die. I just can't believe I let one person fuck me up this much. And every time I see someone that looks like her even a little bit even if it's only for a second I immediately start thinking about how much I have the feelings I have and how I should just jump off a building and kill myself and end the misery. 

Honestly I don't know how I get up in the morning sometimes. I keep thinking what if I screwed up my one chance. Why not just jump. It would be so much easier. I just want this hurt to stop.
