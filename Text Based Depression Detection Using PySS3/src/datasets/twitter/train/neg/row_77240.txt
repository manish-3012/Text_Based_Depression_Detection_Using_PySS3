Social anxiety has ruined my life and after my first semester in college Iâ€™ve finally accepted that I have no hope at a fulfilling life.I have no social skills, I canâ€™t initiate conversations I canâ€™t maintain or make friendships I struggle to find things to say when Iâ€™m alone with another person. Growing up I was always the smart and quiet one, and now Iâ€™m just the weird, isolated, soon to be burnout one. All my closest friends from high school, most of which I became friends with in grade school or were introduced to by my grade school friends all went to college together while I decided to go to a college that has a better computer science program. This past semester I have had a couple opportunities to make new friends and I did t take them because I didnâ€™t know what to do. My whole life I have never been the one to initiate hanging out even if I wanted to. I either never let any of my personality out or Iâ€™m just fucking obnoxious and insufferable. I realize that my future is one of loneliness, never finding friends or a life partner. I crave social interaction. I want to hang out with people, make new friends, go to parties and just have the overall â€œcollege experienceâ€, or at least have one with a couple friends in it. I have only enjoyed three days this semester and those were when i visited my friends at their college. It alleviated my (irrational) fear that they would replace me, but made me realize that they are living the life I can only dream of. Those 3 days I felt like a real person. I want to interact with people but I donâ€™t know how, I donâ€™t know how to make conversation or small talk or just talk to friends. Even if I got rid of the social anxiety magically I still donâ€™t have the social skills or habits to make and maintain friends. This is why I realized I have no hope. I thought that I just need therapy or medication to get rid of the anxiety (havenâ€™t tried but I know itâ€™s pointless bc of the aforementioned lack of social skills), but itâ€™s all just fucking hopeless. The depression has seriously affected my college grades. I graduated as a valedictorian, 36 ACT, many APs credits and classes. I just canâ€™t do schoolwork right now, but I canâ€™t stop because then the feeling that my life is so quickly passing by me will intensify even more, which will just worsen the situation. Thereâ€™s no fucking point to living. The only reason I am alive is because elf the naive hope that I have always had that things will get better if I do xyz or by random chance (things have never gotten better), and because I canâ€™t bear the pain I would cause to my loved ones. My future is a bleak one without anything to bring me happiness, only cos rant pain and fucking suffering as everyone around me gets to experience everything I crave but know I never will.
