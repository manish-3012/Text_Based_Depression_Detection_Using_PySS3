The Trials of LifeI have thoughts about suicide almost every day since I was 15 years old, and I'm in my late 40's now.

I'm married, but I'm not sure we love each other (no kids).  Life is relatively good right now, good paying job in IT as a consultant, no debts, but I feel like a fraud in my work life, and I feel like a failure in my day to day life.  I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop...the job to go away, the wife to find someone better.

I think of the old show business line "always go out on top".  I feel like this is as GOOD as my life is going to get, the only thing to look foward to is the death spiral.
