Finger on the trigger

So much power

So much pain up to this point

The release is a few centimeters away

Sweating

Everything in my body is fighting against it

My brain is trying to delay

Frantic

My conscious is pushing me

Tears start

I think of the future

I tighten my grip

I think of the past

I close my eyes

I test the weight of the trigger

So close

I want it so badly

But i dont. 

I want to hear my next favorite song.

I want to taste my favorite food.

I want to take a road trip to nowhere in paticular.

I want to get fucked-up on every drug.

I want to stop the pain that is all in my head.

I want to be free from commitment.

I want to have everything without doing anything. 

I want to die

I know im irrational. I am stupid for believing i can be normal. I have to live with an unbearable weight.
