Nobody wants to listen to meI'm going through a  really crap time right now. I'm financially pretty screwed and I'm in a job that's driven me to tears more times than it should. My manager is bullying me and threatening me with redundancy all the time and it makes doing my job so difficult. 

What's worse is that I have asked loads of people for help or to rant and I feel like they want to turn their back on me. I am scared to ask for handouts in case they say no, cos my family helped me out earlier this year and I dont want to ask in case they think I'm a joke. 

Last night scared me. I got drunk and went to a nearby canal and i could feel myself getting ready to jump in. I really really wanted to do it. I've had suicidal thoughts in the past as a response to bad stuff in my life but this time I felt it was the only way my story could end. 

What stopped me was my girlfriend and my best friend who was back at my flat. I didnt want them to wake up and me not be there, but how can I tell them or anyone this? I feel like a horrible person for doing it but I do want to go.
