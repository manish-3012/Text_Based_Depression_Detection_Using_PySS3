Best time to kill yourselfSo, my best friend killed herself almost two years ago, and so many people who never talked to her came to her funeral and cried. But this is my question: What time of year do you think is the best to kill yourself? Obviously, you should avoid doing it on Christmas. Even if your coworkers hate you, that would put a damper on their holiday. Maybe mid-January or end-of-summer?
