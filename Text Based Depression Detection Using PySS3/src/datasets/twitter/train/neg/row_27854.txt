GoodbyeEverything hurts. If my family finds this, it's not your fault. I love you more than anything but I can't stand it anymore. I tried this before and it didn't work. That was a long time ago. I thought I was better. But the demons were just sleeping, waiting to take me by surprise. I love my friends too, there's only 3 of you and you know who you are. I hurt down to my soul. I actually had a good night with a friend, and then one person flipped the switch.

All I wanted was love. To love someone and them love me. Be in love love, not friend or family love. But I'm not good enough for anyone, you showed me that my dreams are stupid and I'm worthless. I hope you know this is your fault. I know you don't care. I hope you're ashamed. I hope it hurts you like you hurt me. You haven't even hurt me the most out of all of them, but it cut the deepest because I so badly wanted your love. But this was it, my last try.

My soul hurts. I've had an itching for death since I was 10 and now death is the one to love me. I don't know if this will make me happy, but I just know I don't want to wake up to find out what cruelties lie within tomorrow.

I love my family

But I don't love me. I'm sorry I couldn't try harder for you. Sorry I've never been good enough. I love you.

Goodbye
