I'm not even sad anymore. Just numb and doneWhat's the point of living anyways? Everyone's just assholes and if you don't love yourself, then you'll just feel like an outsider forever anyways.

I'm not in the mood for writing out my life story. I just want this numbness and self disgust to end. I just want to end now and forever. We all die anyways, why not today?
