HeyIâ€™m not really sure why Iâ€™ve joined this group or why Iâ€™m posting in here. After reading some of the other posts, I really donâ€™t think I have anything to complain about. But, life feels pointless. I have a good job, I have friends, I donâ€™t particularly dislike being alive, but Iâ€™m so lonely and so bored. It never goes away, no matter what I do. I engage in hobbies to distract myself, but theyâ€™re always there, lurking, waiting for the moment when the distractions end. Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts since I was 12, in my mid thirties now, and theyâ€™re more pronounced now than ever. I already understand that theyâ€™ll go away at some point, but theyâ€™ll also come back. Iâ€™ve never actually been happy, but there are moments when Iâ€™m not bored, and every once in a while I donâ€™t feel lonely. Again, not even sure why Iâ€™m posting this, because now Iâ€™m just rambling. Guess Iâ€™m just craving attention, but donâ€™t want to bother my friends too much with this kind of talk.

Anyway, sorry for writing so much, guess I just wanted to vent. Thanks for reading.
