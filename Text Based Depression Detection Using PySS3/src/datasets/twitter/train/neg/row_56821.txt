I fucked up too much this time.I was just diagnosed with bipolar and put on a mood stabilizer.  Upped my dose and started swinging between highs and lows worse than before.  On a manic episode, I blew 300 bucks to get drunk at a strip club and for 2 private dances with touching allowed. 

I have a wife and toddler at home.  My wife was shattered when she found out I was touching other women.  I feel like such a shitty husband and father and made the biggest mistake of my life when I was supposed to be getting better.

She wants to work it out but I don't want this rift between us to damage my son and I don't think I can be a good enough person.  I constantly fail.

I wonder if it would hurt him more to grow up without a father or with a shitty father.
