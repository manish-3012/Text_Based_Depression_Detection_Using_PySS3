I just want to cryEverything seems to be falling apart. My home lifeâ€™s gone to shit. My parents are always at each othersâ€™ throats and my brother started cutting himself again. I want to finish my research degree but none of my experiments are working and I only have less then 3 weeks left (so looks like I canâ€™t move on with my life yet). My health is going to shit so I canâ€™t drink to calm down. I havenâ€™t been able to sleep right for almost a week now. My psychiatrist died so I have no one to talk to about any of this and the freaking crisis line kept me on hold for 15 min before I gave up and hung up. I just want to curl up and cry. I just want everything to stop for a bit. To just freeE and go quiet...
