Secret SelflessnessI am alive
Not by choice, but selflessness
For others breathing is thoughtless
For me, it's a forced chore
The reason? Not sure.
No single event, no single person
I feel no desperation, only emptyness
I do not desire pitty or a savior
Only to be erased, deleted
For them to all forget
A drastic action
Manipulate my image
Make them hate me
To ease their pain
Its a secret fight within
I am on the opposing team
By winning the daily battle,
I lose my internal war.
They all win when I lose
It's the silent sacrifice I make
For an unwitting few
Not by choice, but selflessness
