My best friend tried to kill himself and i found himThis happened yesterday evening. He's awake and in hospital now but it might've done permanent damage. I don't know. I had to stop him from falling asleep or throwing up for 2 hours before the ambulance finally came and they said there isn't much they can do now, we just have to wait and see if he survives the damage I guess.

I don't know what to do. I know he doesn't want to be here, but I don't want to lose my buddy I really don't. I apologised to him and told him we love him over and over. I'm really not taking it well and feel like I'm a rubbish friend, I have clinical depression and don't know the right things to say when he feels so lost. I'm bad with words and could've probably done so much more. I know that ain't my place and I'm no therapist, but I really wanted to help him even a little

 We've been talking about his issues for days and days and days before this happened and I let him talk as much as he wanted..Of course that wasn't enough. I'm sorry for being all over the place. I just want him to come home.
