BF thinks about suicide, please helpHello /r/SuicideWatch,

This is a throw away, and my first post ever on Reddit. 

My bf recently became depressed and it has lasted for about a month now. He told me how he contemplates suicide and I don't know what to do, I keep teling him that I am here for him but he keeps pushing me away (which upon doing research sounds normal for someone who is depressed). I love him and I want help but I don't know how to. Please, any advice would help. Thanks.
