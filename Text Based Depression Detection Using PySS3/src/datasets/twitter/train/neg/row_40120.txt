Iâ€™m getting pretty closeI opened up about my mental health/suicidal ideations to my roommates, a few friends, and a few managers at work. Ever since, our relationships havenâ€™t been the same. I feel like they feel very awkward around me.  Only one of my friends has been truly supportiveâ€”texting me to see how I am, inviting me to do things, not acting any different than before around me. (Her close friend killed himself about 7 years back.) No one knows what to say to me so Iâ€™ve felt the distance widening. I thought I was doing the right thing but I want to go back to before, where I just used dark humor to express my pain, and keep my friendships the same. 
My boyfriend, who has anxiety-under control, has been so supportive of me. He just told me last week that he accepted a job offer in Pacific Northwest US, and I live in a south eastern state.  This news has definitely â€œtriggeredâ€ me. I was not great but â€œokâ€ before and now I feel myself spiraling. Iâ€™ve been researching gun ownership, drug combinations, carbon monoxide, and flights to a tropical place so I can do it somewhere wan and sunny, without scaring the shit out of my roommates. 
My mom is definitely on Suicide watch for me, which makes me feel guilty but the pain of being alive thatâ€™s been building (for a long time) is getting to be too much. Thanks for reading/listening
