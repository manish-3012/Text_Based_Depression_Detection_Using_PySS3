I'm fed up(first post)This life everyone tells me is worth living... what is worth living about it? Can you tell someone who has watched a family fall apart, who has been raped, , who was physically and emotionally abused by her mother, who has no one there by her side when she needs a friend to talk to, that this life is worth living?

I hear people constantly telling me to find a coping mechanism. Since I was little singing, drawing, and being on the swing has helped me so much. As I'm getting older though it's losing its meaning. Instead of singing I cut. Instead of drawing I drink. Instead of sitting on a swing I starve myself. 

I cannot see past tonight. I cannot see what tomorrow holds anymore. I'm a 21 year old senior in college and everything I've dreamed about for my future is dead now. I am dead now. I can't think straight anymore. I can't see straight. I've lost the desire to even get out of my bed. I've been pushing forward though hoping something would come along to make the pain go away. Instead someone has pushed me farther into this sinking hole. I am so scared to end my life but I just give up finding a reason not to. I've already held the gun to my head before. I just need to pull the trigger. 

I wish there was someone I could say I love you to. Someone I can say I'm sorry to. There's just no one left in my life worth those words anymore.
