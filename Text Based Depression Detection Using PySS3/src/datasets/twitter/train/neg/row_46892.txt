I had the choice to die two weeks ago.It was 4 in the morning and I had the suicide note, and I had the razor to my wrist. I could've done it. But what stopped me was two things: the thought of one of my family members finding me, and also the potential for things to get better. My family finding out the next day from someone other than me was excruciatingly painful. I'm still suicidal but not quite to the extent where I have a plan in place. I'm on a new medication now, fourth one I've tried.

I still feel fucking depressed. I feel like I've had my share of happiness in life when I was younger and that it's all downhill from here.

I was 14 when this took place, 15 now, it was my birthday last week. Yay me.
