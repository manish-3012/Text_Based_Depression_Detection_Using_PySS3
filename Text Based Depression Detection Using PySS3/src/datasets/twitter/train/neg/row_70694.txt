What the actual f*ck is wrong with me?! Tl;dr: Feel suicidal, but I deny it when I gradually (and inevitably) get better; it's a cycle of misery, hope, and emotional amnesia.

Why do I feel this way? Logically speaking, there's no reason for me to feel like this. I know life can be good. Yet it still comes. Like the tide, it ebbs and flows, flooding my brain with these thoughts. At times I'll feel completely normal or even as if I have my shit together and can actually take on the world. Confidence and ambition is over the roof and out of orbit. I will deny ever feeling suicidal: "I was overreacting", "I was just being lazy" and other excuses^(tm). When the tide hits, all traces of hope will be washed away. My body will be filled with this desire to just... *be gone.* Just as strongly as the thirst of a dehydrated person that's stranded on a tiny island. You're craving water to drink, but the only water available is the sea. Seeing so much water all day and not being able to drink it is fucking maddening. That's how I feel at my lows. And it's so frustrating because I *know* that I will feel better again and brush it off; I'm stuck in an unending cycle. Not like I ever had any confidence to actually do it (after researching i'm seriously baffled there's so many complications that can happen! Who knew it was that difficult to safely kill yourself?! Not me lol.)

Obligatory note: English is not my native language, which is why I'm apologising if my comparisons/examples were terrible. I'm trying to accurately convey my feelings.
