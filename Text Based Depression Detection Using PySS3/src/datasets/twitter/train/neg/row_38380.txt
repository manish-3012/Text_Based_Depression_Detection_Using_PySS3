I need something to keep living forWhenever I get down like this I like to pick something I can count down to (an exact date) for something that'll make me happy. Usually it's something like a movie or video game I'm really looking forward to, or a friend coming to visit, or an event at work, but with covid it feels like release dates don't really exist anymore and everything is just a vague idea of "future" that I can't grasp on to.

It feels I'm walking through mud towards nothing. I have goals and ambitions but they also have an ambiguous end date, some of them no end date at all.
