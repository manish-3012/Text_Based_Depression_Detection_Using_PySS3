There are too many of me in the worldWhat the hell do I offer? I am a strait white male, I am relatively wealthy and 15(yeah that number tends to invalidate anything I say), I am basically the cause of everyone's problems (poor? Guess who is oppressing you? Me. Female? Gay? Black? Trans? Disabled? Mentally ill? Muslim/Jew/minority religion? Born in an unprivileged country? Fatherless? Divorced parents? Abusive parents? I have every single possible privilege I learn about in school). And they give every advantage to people who are different to me in some way because there are too many of me. I am not even better than anyone else at anything important. I am a shitty athlete, a bit of an introvert, I waste my time on stereotypical white male things, I don't get great grades and my siblings are everything I am not (good grades, popular, athletic, fit in and know what to do, their own person). i know i am a shitty person at heart, when i was 12 i scammed a bunch of people on the internet (using a referral site, more out of time than money) including a guy who messaged me saying he was spending his time in a starbucks for me trying to get money for his kids because he was unemployed. I am not even depressed, I am just lonely and sad, and struggle to see good in anything, i seem to hate everyone else inside, but especially myself but I just keep it together for my family and few friends, and to them I am a pretty happy person. I have old parents, maybe when they die I can kill myself without being selfish. (67 &amp; 55). I also don't see why suicide is such a bad thing, not everyone can be a beneficial human, and I am about as shitty as it gets. There is not space for me.
