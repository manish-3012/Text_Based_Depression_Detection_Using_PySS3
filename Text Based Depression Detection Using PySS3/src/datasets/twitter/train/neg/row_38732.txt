URGENT: One of my good friends just told me he's strongly considering suicide. AskReddit said you guys could help. Okay so some background info...he's 18, and his mother is extremely overbearing. As in she still doesn't let him go to sleepovers or anything like that. He put this status on facebook: "Imma just kill myself. That way i dnt have to be under my moms fuckin grip all the time. Can even go to a damn sleep over... Because she doesnt know them??? -_- this is the same shit tht drove me to my suicial thought in the first place. No matter what anyone tells, a good parents let their kids make mistakes so they can learn from them, not smother them from all danger. Then she had the damn nerve to tell me i cnt do anything until i graduate and move out??? Wtf? Im fuckin 18 bitch." I keep trying to tell him that there are a lot of people who care about him but that doesn't seem to be working. I'm really worried &amp; I need your help! Can I talk him out of it? Is there something I can say that will make him feel better?
