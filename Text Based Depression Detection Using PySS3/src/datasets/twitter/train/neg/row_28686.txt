I attempted suicide. mother didnâ€™t careI have PTSD due to childhood incest and I canâ€™t handle the pain anymore so I attempted to overdose on painkillers, which I know realise was a stupid way of trying it. I told my mother as she found me throwing up in the bathroom but she just got really angry, didnâ€™t even attempt to take the pills away from me and went back to bed. I wish I succeeded
