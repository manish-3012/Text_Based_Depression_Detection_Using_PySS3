Depressed at Random PointsThis night, I was normally skyping with my friends and talking and working on homework, listening to music, the usual stuff a teen does. 5 minutes later, I was fighting back tears and wanting to cut myself and wondering how much it'll hurt and wondering why I have no friends. I get confused as to why I've made so many mistakes in my life.

I was just wondering if this is a normal thing, to only go through this at random intervals. It's happened before when I was just at school eating lunch and talking to my friends and I don't know. I wish my emotions would just be normal.
