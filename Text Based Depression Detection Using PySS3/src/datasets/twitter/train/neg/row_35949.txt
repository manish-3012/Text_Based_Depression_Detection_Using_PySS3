I didnt think that id live this longIm turning 15 next thursday. I was suicidial around age 12/13. I'm crying right now but only because nothing really feels real yet everything is beautiful. Ill hope to only find love and happiness but it isnt too much to ask right? I hope not. Im overwhelmed with the thought that right now instead of it being a normal day, my parents would just be depressed because of me. Thank you everyone.
