The time has come, Good ByeThe time has come to end all of this.  
I am not tired, nor angry, and not unhappy in any way shape or form. I am blissful, and at peace.  
I see no point in continuing this venture, and thus i shall terminate it.  
The poison is ready, my mind is clear. Woah

So good luck to you all. And good bye. In a few hours, all shall be over.


P.S. Committing Suicide due to irrational reasons is dumb. Try push-ups if you are in distress.
