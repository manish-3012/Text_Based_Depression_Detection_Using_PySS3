Im done!So ive dealt with thoughts of suicide my whole life. I'm 23 years old and most days all I think about is what would happen or what if I killed myself. I've tryd everything to not think this way. Medicine didn't work it enhanced the thoughts and a couple of weeks ago I slit my wrist and attempted to bleed out. My parents found me. Its been about a week since I got out of the hospital and the thoughts are coming back. 

I've always had anxiety. Very bad anxiety. Like its hard for me to do anything alone. This made it difficult to make friends or get out of the house.  On top of all that. I lie. All the time. I don't know why I lie. I guess its to fool the people around me. So maybe people wont see my problems. This has also Messed up keeping friends and being in relationships. I'm The boy who cryd wolf. No-one believes me when I say anything anymore. I've dug myself so deep in lies I cant find my way out. On top of that I don't have a good relationship with my family. We don't get along. And with my lies at home. They don't believe me either.

Sometimes I think I cant get myself out of the hole I dug for myself. I seriously believe that If I was gone, Nobody would have to deal with my shit. I know it kills my parents the things ive put them through. I know ive hurt everyone in my life at least a couple times. I've lost everyone and everything. I've been told by almost everyone that im a loser. Maybe their right. I am a loser. Its funny im writing on here because the people I know really don't care anymore about what I do. They just seem to ignore me. Whats the point anymore. Guess its just a matter of time. I don't want to do this anymore.
