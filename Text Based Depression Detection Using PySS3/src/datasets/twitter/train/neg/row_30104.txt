Just stop the anguish... I CAN'T take it anymoreI have had suicidal thoughts for 3 years now, non stop depression, anxiety and OCD and stress and trauma around my family

I go to a terrible high school that makes me wish I was dead when I am in it, all the professors seem mentally broken, why is it that in my country, or at least town, my whole life, the teachers that I have had to deal with are always relentless and think that they are better than everyone other than other teachers? I don't get it

The only options I see for myself are to dropout because it's way too hard, and very painful all the time, or to suicide but then my parents would suffer even more than if I dropped out

Right now I am at a terrible place and the only way for me to tell you the all stuff I have/had to go through is for you to have to go through it yourself so that you don't just say "wow that seems like nothing, you're just some sensitive loser, grow up" so I won't bother talking about some smaller stuff in my life 

I think that I have been traumatized... school has always been more hellish for me than for anyone else and now I feel like other people's happiness is just something that is there to make me feel bad

I can't stop being jealous of famous youtubers, I feel like life is UNBELIEVABLY unfair because I was born in a poor country instead of a first world country with all the advantages like those people

Whatever I do I JUST CAN'T STOP BEING MISERABLE, WHAT DO I NEED TO DO? WHAT? To get the agony to stop is something that feels more and more unachievable the more I suffer

I keep thinking negatively about everything and taking everything EXTREMELY seriously while being terrible at it, I can't relax no matter what or feel happy

I think about the fact that I was born in a poor garbage communist country on a daily basis, and I NEVER feel anything other than really bored, extremely worried or frightened while at school

I am getting more and more frustrated with life and things like me worrying really really hard about if this post will be a cringey stupid mess that nobody will understand or something well written where I make all the points I need

I am extremely overwhelmed by life and by everything, the constant agony is getting me to be a toxic person who would be nice if I just didn't have depression so much and didn't suffer so much more than other people, I think it is INCREDIBLY unfair that I suffer this much so I try to make other people suffer to balance it out because I can never be happy myself

I feel like there was so much suffering in my life that it prevents me from reaching success in my life because that takes willing to suffer but the more I suffer the more I just want it to stop without enduring even a single bit of it anymore
