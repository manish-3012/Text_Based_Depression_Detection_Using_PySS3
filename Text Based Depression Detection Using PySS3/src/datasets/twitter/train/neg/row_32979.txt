10 months in, can't find work anywhere and I just want to fucking die.I don't know if I should laugh or cry but I went to my doctor to run a physical exam. My mother basically forced me to get it cause she's been worrying about my health nonstop. Got my results today and my doctor told me over the phone to go to the office because he needed to explain in more detail. I reluctantly went there and he told me that I am at a severe risk of T2 diabetes and CHF because I have hypertension, OSA and blah blah. So I'm like whatever and I told him right in his face that I am not going to do anything about it and that I really don't care. My doctor got really pissed at me but I just left the door and went home. 

No really, I don't fucking care. I've been looking for jobs non-stop and it's been 10 months since I've graduated last year in May. I feel like the most unemployable pos on Earth right now because even shitty jobs don't want me. What good is life if I can't fucking work and I might have to live penniless for the rest of my life? I did literally everything in the book. Reach out to employment agencies, volunteer, network, practice interviews, resumes, and I still can't find a fucking job. I honestly don't know what to do. I haven't told my mom about the results and lied to her that "everythings ok" so now I also have this guilt on my back because I have to ensure that my doctor doesn't pester my mom to take action because I really don't fucking want to do anything about it. 

I'm living in so much fear that I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future. Even if I will have a future.
