I will kill myself once my cat diesI think she's the only living creature that will actually care if I'm gone. No one will be able to love her and care about her as much as I do so I don't wanna leave her alone but at the same time, I just want to disappear and stop feeling this miserable.

This is the 3rd. night I've been crying and I wish I could make it stop. I'm trying to see if I feel any better just by writing how I feel lately.
