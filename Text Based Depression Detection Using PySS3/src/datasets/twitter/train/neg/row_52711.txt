I wishI wish I could bring myself to want to get better. But I've grown so comfortable in my sadness and the idea of killing myself. I wish I could just go through with it and kill myself instead of just thinking about it constantly. I can't handle this I am not strong enough. And I'm so tired of the annoying cooking cutter responses to it like "You'll get through it, everythings going to be okay etc. etc"
