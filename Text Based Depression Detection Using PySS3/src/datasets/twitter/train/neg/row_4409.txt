AngryNo need to do shit on this dying planet. I have no future. I only create waste and thereâ€™s no way of stopping my impact. Hemorrhaging money from my parents. No point in investing in me, I am just going to die too soon to even get any profit. I am a lost cause. Canâ€™t do shit. I want to starve for the rest of my life because Iâ€™m part of the problem. The planet is dying and Iâ€™m a part of the problem. My family is suffering. No job security. I am so frustrated.
