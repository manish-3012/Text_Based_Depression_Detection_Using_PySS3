I am stuck, I can't go anywhere but gone.I'm not a good person. Suicide wasn't an option for me a month ago, but now I feel it's the only option. I'm stuck in a loveless marriage with a lying, cheating wife. I have no where else to go. No friends, no family, no money, no job, debt, and the only other option is staying here and pretending to myself and my wife that it will all be better. But it won't. It's getting progressively worse and I can't even stand to look at her, or hear her voice. Only nightmares now, and all I want now is to end them.
