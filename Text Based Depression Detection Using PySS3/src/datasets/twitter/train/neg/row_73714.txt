Third time lucky?I'm posting this here because:

* I just found out about this r/

* I thought you might find it interesting

* Out of some wild hope that someone will say something other than what I've been hearing for years from myriad psychiatrists / psychologists / concerned friends.

* I just want to get my thoughts together.

Without further ado:

I've tried twice before. The first time was a year ago. I drank a bottle of whiskey and swam out into the middle of the ocean. Then I turned back and saw my mother standing on the shore and I felt so bad that I had to go back. Then I ran, wound up waking in hospital, I'd been picked up by the police. I spent three weeks in the psych ward before lying my way out.

Things got back on track, I went back to university and things were good. Good friends. Great girlfriend. Good grades. I don't really know why things degenerated. Got depressed, felt like I was stagnating. The world is crumbling and humanity disgusted me. A lecture on power structures that I took really put a hook in me. I turned back to alcohol, my old friend. Alcohol doesn't mix well with my meds. Woke up in parks, with no wallet. Got in fights.

I went back home, deferred from my degree. I got a good job, started saving up again. Things were going so well. With work, with home,  with the girlfriend. And then I got drunk one night and we had a bad argument. I swore at her. She was leaving the next day on a plane. Never heard from her again.

I guess that was what pushed me over the edge the second time, the straw that broke the camel's back. There are a lot of things going on with me. I've never been happy except in flashes, and I've always had a sense that everything is being pulled down to the ground by some unstoppable gravity.

The second time I took a large overdose of some prescription sleeping tablets I use. I wrapped a plastic bag around my head and said goodnight. Woke up in intensive care. Was there for three days between consciousness and un-. Don't know why the hell they let me go home but they did. That was about 2 months ago I think.

Anyway, since then I quit my job. I had savings of 3K and I've now got nothing, I spent it all on alcohol. I drank up to 1.5 bottles of whiskey or 5 bottles of wine daily, depending on my mood and usually starting drinking at 10am. Now I've been dry for about a week. Nothing much else left to distract me from the fact that I am just fucking sad.

So, part three. I've written the note. I've checked it for spelling and grammar mistakes. It isn't fancy or poetic, it just says to my family and friends I love you, to my girlfriend I miss you, and then explains a few other things about why I am "doing this". This time I'm going to try for hanging. The plan is to rig up a noose and find a suitable tree. I think a three meter drop breaks the neck, but if not I've got some cable-ties for my hands. I'm scared it will be painful, but I guess I'll just have to deal with it as it comes. If I'm lucky I might be able to scrounge together a couple of bucks for a cheap bottle of wine for courage. I still haven't decided whether to do it in the family yard, or out in public, so that the police or paramedics will have to deal with my body, rather than my family.

*Phew* that was long. That's the situation as it stands. I've left out a tonne but I'm quite tired.
