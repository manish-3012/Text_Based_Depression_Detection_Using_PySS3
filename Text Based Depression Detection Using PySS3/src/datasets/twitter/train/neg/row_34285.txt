I think I'm going to do it, I'm not even sad.I found out that I am the father of a 10 year old child recently.  The mother is pretty crazy and I am looking at 45% of my income going to child support.  Not to mention 10 years of backpay at a 5% interest rate.  I am not sad but I don't see the point (logically) of continuing my life when I'll be in debt forever.  If I don't pay they suspend my passport and license and then they throw me in jail.  I have a gun in my night drawer and pulling the trigger would be painless and quick.  Not to mention dying on the 4th of july wouldn't be bad.  I don't know what to do, I don't want anyone's pity.  I just don't see the point.
