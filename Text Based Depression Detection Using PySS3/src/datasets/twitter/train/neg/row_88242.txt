Staying around for family?Anyone else have this thought? I don't necessarily want to careen off of a cliff to end it all but, really, the only thing keeping me around is because of the pain it would cause my family. I'm sure this same thought has been posted 100x over but I realized it on my way home from work. I don't have anything to live for. Every day is getting up for work so that I can pay for rent, loans/debt, and stick around long enough for my family to die off. I'm just so fucking bored with life and might join the military just for the chance to die honorably. Anyways, first post, rant.
