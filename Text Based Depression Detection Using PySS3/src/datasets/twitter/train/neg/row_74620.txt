I hate myselfIf this doesn't get removed for being too typical/going against guidelines, that's great.

16 years old. Want to die so badly but suffers from typical case of cowardice. Messed up my life from 4 years ago when I rejected a girl, only to realise that I love her a year later (crush?? Idk). Feel like shit now, but can't bring myself to confess cos she deserves someone better.

I'm lost in life. I'm conflicted on how to proceed with my education. Also realised the harsh and brutal treatment of this entity we call "life", and realised that there's no point slogging our asses off if we die eventually (typical emo kid thoughts). I have no one to vent to, my friends seem distant and afar, my parents seem distant and afar, and I have an irrational fear of people. I hate myself, I hate who I am and I hate that I can't be who I want to be. 

I have no interest, no passion, spent half my life people-pleasing to feed my sense of self-worth but found it really tiring and frustrating. Failing at piano, standard dropping since grade 8 last year.

I wish that I could take back all my choices made since 4 years ago. I regret everything. If a simple rope or jump can reverse this hell-hole I've created or let me start with a blank slate, I would gladly do so. I'm just scared of the pain that I'd feel if I did, but if a new world awaits, I'm willing to take the bullet and bite the dust.
