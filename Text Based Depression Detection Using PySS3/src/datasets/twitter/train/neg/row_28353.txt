Welp, I've screwed my life over. Time to kill myself.It's not even that big of a thing. Last year, I tried to fight an underage consumption offense. It didn't work. It went on my record. And now no place even at minimum wage will hire me. I'm out on my own, away from my family, with less than $500 in my account. Nowhere to live, just crashing at friend's places. There's nothing out there for me to do. I'm fucked. I'd rather die than have to live with a guilt like this, and have no purpose in life.
