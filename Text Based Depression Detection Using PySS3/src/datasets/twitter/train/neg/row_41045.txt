My 18th birthdayOn my 18th birthday, I plan to end my life.
I gave myself a couple years to decide if I want to die yet.
I'm probably going to die painfully, but I dont mind.
I plan to use a knife.
I'm not sad or anything; I'm just bored and have been for years. I needed to say something because I kept getting that tingling feeling that takes over when you feel overwhelmed.
I may change my mind by then, but I doubt it.
I think I may just be happier then, dont you think?
It feels good being able to say this, thanks for listening to me â™¡
