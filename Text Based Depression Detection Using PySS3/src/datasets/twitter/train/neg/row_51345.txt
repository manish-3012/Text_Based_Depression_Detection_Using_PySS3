Life feels like a constant battle I no longer feel like fighting15, male for background.
 For a while now I've been thinking about how pointless me being alive is, I just finished crying to myself like the weak loser I am thinking about how there literally is no place on earth I would want to live on because I dont know what I want, maybe what i really need is to die. I was thinking about how I really am an inferior person, I don't think I'm the type that is supposed to be alive, I feel like I'm the type of thing that would have been weeded out by natural selection. I wish I had been aborted. some days I go to sleep hoping I die at some point in the night and I feel disappointed by finding myself still breathing in the morning knowing I have to get up and go to these bullshit classes. Its not made any easier knowing I will be feeling that for hundreds of days to come unless I end it sooner than 50+ years from now when I die happens naturally. I have tried Zoloft but it just made me more aware of how bleak my future is. but I realize that antidepressants are like getting painkillers for a broken leg, the leg doesn't heal from painkillers it just makes it hurt less. it feels like no one will help me and the ones that say they will never mean it. I want to feel better, I want someone to actually help me but I don't think I can be helped.
