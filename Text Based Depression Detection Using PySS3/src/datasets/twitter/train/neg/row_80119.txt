I just want to end this life.I don't want to hurt anybody because it might look like a huge rant over what's going on in my head, so if I somehow hurt someone - I am sorry. 

I am 24 years old. Not a cool job but I can't get anything better because employees don't give a fuck about me. I am an ugly dude, I have no friends, I have no love, no girlfriend. I have no meaning to live. Hell, even my parents tell me things like "if you die, we bury you, that's simple", so why the fuck should I try harder? 

I've lost all my motivation to live. Why do I even exist and have to wake up every day and feel like a piece of garbage and complete biotrash person? 

The only reason I stay alive is I am too cowardy. I have everything plan but as soon as I do it and it's just 3 more seconds before I commit it, something inside me says "Stop" and I just stop. And I feel even more shit that I can't even do such a simple thing in my life. 

Why am I here? And yet again I wake up and think it over, have another emotions on how to end this life, try to do that but again 3-5 seconds before initial step something stops it inside me. 

It's like a torture. I don't know what to do and how to live longer with such ideas in my head.
