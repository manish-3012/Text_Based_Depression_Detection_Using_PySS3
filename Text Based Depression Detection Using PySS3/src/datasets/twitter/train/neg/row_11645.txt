Everything just hurts.My best friend saved my life the other day. It's kind of weird to think about it now. Thinking back on those few hours before you mean to try it, it's always weird and it's always the same for me. Weird numbness and this feeling of acceptance, almost. It's just thinking about those feelings is odd.

I was gonna hang myself that night. I had my plan. But they asked if I was okay, and started asking me about things that I loved. Which, I mean, they were distracting me, I know they were, but it worked. They didn't even know that it was as bad as it was. Still don't. 

All of that just makes me feel worse. I mean, it's really nice to know I have good friends, but the idea that someone would miss me hurts. It hurts a lot. And the last time I was this bad, I didn't have anyone like that. Now I feel so bad for everything, and for feeling this way, and for the notes and the plans and the feelings and everything. I'd be hurting people, and that makes everything worse. I hate feeling this way. It's this big spiral that just keeps going. I want to die, then I feel bad for it and the people I love, which makes me feel worse and makes me want to end it all, and it just keeps going like that, in a constant feedback loop.

I just hurt. Physically and emotionally, I just have nothing left to give. There's no energy going spare. And yet I keep pushing past my limits to help people and to keep up with my life, even despite so many things getting so much better in the last year. 

I just want to go. I don't want this hurt anymore. I wish I wasn't so easily distracted.
