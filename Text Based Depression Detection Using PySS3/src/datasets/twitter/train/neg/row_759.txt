Good wishesI'm here asking to receive encouragement and fortification from the anonymous forces on the internet because I need to be fortified right now.  

I've had chronic issues with suicidal thoughts for 10 years. As you can imagine, someone with mental illness like this doesn't have a lot going for them. It feels like my life fell away from me. It slipped through my fingers. And I can't get it back.

Tell me I can come back from how badly I've ruined things. Sit next to me and hold my hand. Tell me a story about your life or who you are, I want to be part of you so I can find myself in you.
