How to seek help when you can't seek help?I'm diagnosed with major depressive disorder. I have in the past tried to end my life 3 times and the last I was hospitalized due to trying. I was seeking (still am) Help at the time. The thing is.. I feel like ending my life again. I'm 26, haven't had a job in about 3 years and when I did have a job I wasn't able to hold one, I have friends but feel like they just kindly put up with my being around and I don't really hear from or see any of them.. I've felt like a disappointment to my family and household as I still live with my aunt.  I'm too afraid to admit it to my doctor because I have a baby on the way (me and the mother are no longer together) but the mother has expressed to me that if I ever self harm or come anywhere near suicide again that she'd make it very difficult to see my son. I know Self harm and suicide aren't the best ways of dealing with things it's just, I feel useless and without worth a lot of the time and sometimes even think my future son would probably be better off not know I was his father though I try to not dwell in that thought for long... I don't know how to talk to anyone about the way I've been feeling without the fear of having my boy kept from me. I just don't know how to life right now..
