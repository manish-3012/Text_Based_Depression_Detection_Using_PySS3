Can't Meet My Own StandardsIt doesn't warrant much detail, I guess I just expected that I would always get perfect grades, I would be athletic, I would be ranked at the top of my class...

Well, I'm not anymore. I fucked it all up. Granted, it was a crappy semester and I have 5 semesters left. I can always get better, things won't always suck so bad, and sure, I can make the positive impact on people that I always wanted. But living with that shame is hard. It burns on the inside. 

Ironically, all I do now is spend a lot of time on reddit. I think it keeps me distracted. But hours on end? At some point I'm going back to school, and what then? People will know how bad I fucked up, they'll lose respect for me, and so I become irrelevant. Because I never had anything else to offer to people except for what I could do, for the example I set, and therefore the help I could give people. Helping people is the only thing that kept me happy this past semester, and yet. Now if I help them, it all seems like it'll be under false pretenses. 

My freshmen that'd I'd tutor hold me in pretty high regard. They'd tell people I was some kind of genius (I'm really not), but the fact that they'd respect me so much made me happy and really compelled me to help people in the first place -- "give back", as you will. Now, I feel like a sham. I can't do that anymore. I am so worried that they are going to lose respect for me.

I need help. I don't talk to anyone anymore. I never considered suicide like I have now. I want it all to end, because even though fundamentally I know it wasn't that bad of a failure, it sorely failed to meet my own expectations.

**Help me learn to accept failure and let all of this bullshit go. I wouldn't be teaching my freshman kids a good lesson if I didn't learn to accept failure as it came. I want these suicidal tendencies to go away, too. The pain is just immobilizing and it angers me because it shouldn't be.**
