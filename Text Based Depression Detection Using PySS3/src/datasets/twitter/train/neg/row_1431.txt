I wanted to get help before it got this bad. I really need it now.I can't look after myself properly, I hurt the people around me, I'm jaded. I just feel like a bad person who is bad at everything and unlikable and unlovable. About a year ago I left a long term relationship and was shattered, then I was raped. This past year I could feel myself depressed, I was struggling, I knew I needed help.

Trying to find a psychologist and when I call the answering machine says the office is unattended, and don't leave a message. Another hasn't returned any calls. When I do get a hold someone they're a member of this stupid cult in my town. 

In this time I felt my depression getting worse. Started thinking about self harm. Now it's wishing I never existed. Will I even make it to getting help?

I just want someone to talk to. When I was raped I felt like something fucking broke inside my soul. Then I got treated like garbage by guys on tinder, I look back and feel disgusted by it. I'm a different person now and I don't like it.

I'm just numb a lot of the time. My breakdowns are so frequent now, I'm having ptsd and flashbacks. I feel like I have lost my mind.
