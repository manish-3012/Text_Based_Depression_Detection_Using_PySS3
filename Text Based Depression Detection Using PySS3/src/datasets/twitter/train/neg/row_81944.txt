what should I do?I'm around 16, (I'm not a generic depressed teen I swear) Anyways, nothing in my life is in my control, I'm stuck going to a horrible school where most people are bordering on braindead; and my chances of going to college are around 0.5% (and thats community college.) My other options are military (which nowadays probably isn't the best idea) and trade school. I dont think we even have the money for trade school tbh. On top of all of that it's all mostly my mothers fault. and once again, I have no fucking options; if things continue like this I will end up with a situation that is more suffering than its worth.

And so we come to our main issue, Either I 
A: suffer through the next 2+ years and hope to what ever god I clearly pissed off I can go to a decent school. 
or
B: say fuck it and kill myself. (I'm thinking asphyxiation, maybe knife to the neck but that would hurt like a bitch)
(note my chances of ending up to where I would want to be are quite seriously infinitesimal.)
(('where I would want to be' means not in the fucking boonies of east Tennessee.))

feel free to ask questions, and dont give me that "just live bro, life is what you make of it" bullshit. I'm not dealing with fools.
