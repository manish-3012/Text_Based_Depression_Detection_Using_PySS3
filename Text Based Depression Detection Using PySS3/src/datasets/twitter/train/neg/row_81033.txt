Freaking out, no insurance panickingI had a healthcare plan last year, it ended in the new year.  Healthcare.gov switched me to a new one.  Because I'm such an irresponible mentally ill mess who can barely manage their life I didnt keep track of the payments I needed and lost it.  I could of signed up for a plan at Target, but I missed the open enrollment because I'm irresponsible and didn't pay attention.  I hate working there, and Ive been having a nervous breakdown because I get treated so shitty.  I'm going to quit anyways, so who cares about getting health insurance there.

But now I'm realizing how absolutely fucked I am and it's all my fault.  I'm 29, live alone, no family(abusive, cut contact), no friends.  I can barely get through the day.  I ran out of my medication(seroquel,pristiq,concerta) in January.

What the fuck do I do? I need to die.  The reality is that I can't take care of myself.  My existence is a mistake.  Please help im so afraid.
