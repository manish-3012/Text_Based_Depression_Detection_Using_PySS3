I wish I had a definitive way to kill myself so badI havenâ€™t slept normally in 3 days. Iâ€™m exhausted and my muscles are so sore. I have classes tomorrow and I wanted to work out but my anxiety is through the roof and although I feel exhausted I cannot sleep. I have had bad insomnia which has never happened like this before. Itâ€™s making me seriously consider suicide. I canâ€™t fix anything in my life if Iâ€™m this exhausted. I canâ€™t work out like this which is also a huge part of my life and the only thing I felt like I was doing right. Iâ€™m at a loss and hate everything about my life and have one more reason why my life is just so shitty.
