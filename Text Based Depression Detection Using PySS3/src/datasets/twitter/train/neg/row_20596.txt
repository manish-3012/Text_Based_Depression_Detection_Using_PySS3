How do I tell the people I care about that I love them?I did some questionable shit between my last post and now. My behavior is getting increasingly impulsive for the worse. I have plans to see a psychiatrist to talk about meds, but I won't see them until June because 'murica.

Problem is... I don't 100% know if I'll be around by then. I basically wrote a suicide note a few hours ago. When I get like this, I don't start doing things because I feel X or Y.  I do them because I can. It's an impulse. I just start acting without feeling.

I'm not completely gone. A part of me doesn't want this. But. Because I am at risk, I want to ask in case I need to know.

I want them to know now in case anything happens later. Hell, even if nothing does, I still want them to know.
