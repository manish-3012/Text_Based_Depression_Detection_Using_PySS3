I got so close today, help me with some questions in my mindI have these "thought problems" where whenever somethiing is good I just think around it, like it doesn't exist. I think this is just a superficial problem and that the cause is my loneliness. It started in the summer when my loneliness was at its alltime high, only talking ot my parents for months. Now I'm in school and this weekend especially has been really lonely. Only talked to my mom and the kind people in SW. My thoughts are like, for example, whenever i ask myself a question i already know the answer or deep down I know how things will turn out and htye will turn out poorly. It's hard to explain.

Anyone with ANY insight into this? "Thought problems" that make it really seem like there is no way out of this tunnel,but could they really be something else at the core?

I also wonder, why not? Suicide is so simple. 


I was walking to a friends place to pick up something and I just decided to do it. I felt relieved, but I felt bad at the same time. I know deep down, I hope I do, that that isn't the right thing. Sometimes I'm worried that I don't. I cried when I imagined how my mom and dad would feel. It's twisted, thouhg. On the one hand I know that they would be destroyed, but on the other I still feel like nothing matters at all, even them.


Gah, I'm not sure if I was really close. Maybe it was more like a childish dare to myself.
