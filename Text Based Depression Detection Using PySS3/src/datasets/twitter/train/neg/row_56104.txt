The Only Thing Keeping Me Alive is Fear of PainI don't think I can ever be happy. I'm ugly in an unchangeable way, both inside and out, so people never really want to get to know me. I have no friends, my family thinks you can just magically be happy by not being sad, etc. I tried therapy but they just don't understand how depressed I am and I'm forced to wait over 2 months for an appointment (cannot change due to crappy location, no job, no car, bad insurance). 

I am over 100,000 in debt from college because I don't know how to say no to my elitist parents who pushed so hard for me to go to a private college that gave me no aid (parents make too much but aren't contributing to my loans and my SATs are shit so I got no merit aid). 

I majored in HR because it was one of the few fields that I was smart enough for that could get me a job, but I'm in the job market and everything sucks. The only available jobs for me even with internship experience are crappy recruiting jobs and even then most ghost me and I'm 99% sure I'm on a blacklist because I told one recruiter (kindly) that I didn't think the company was a good fit due to their excessive promotion of alcohol (family has alcoholism issues, plus they pushed for a concrete reason).

I found a field that interests me, but I need to get into grad school for it. However, I suck at networking so I have no teacher recommendations and my intern boss ghosted me. I'd rather just not be here, but dying just is painful.

I understand this all makes me arrogant, self-loathing, etc. but I just need to get it all out. I try to be the funny depressed person and I never tell people my true mopey self-loathing thoughts, but idk. I'm just tired.
