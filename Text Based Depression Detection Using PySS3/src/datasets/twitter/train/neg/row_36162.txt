I went to message the one hotline that i had access to &amp; was open this time of day......and i never got through. When it got to my "position in line" 4 times in a row, every time in a row, it glitched.

Im ready to give up.

One month ago i made a deal with myself that in one month i would end things if i didn't have 3 reasons to continue. Sunday will be one month. I am trying so hard to fight this but i feel like every factor in my life is fighting against me. I want to instant message somebody or something and i only have one person in my life right now - somebody i can't talk to about these things. 

I just don't know what to do, and the counselors in my life are short term so i've been (on top of a head injury, which triggered random severe anxiety for me; prior i didn't really have anxiety and after such i started having random severe bouts of it) having severe randomized bouts of anxiety, making it very difficult to open up to them about this, on top of a number of severe life stressors. 

I can't do this. I feel idiotic posting on Reddit so much, but such a large part of me just needs to vent and put stuff like this out there as writing is hard for me with ADD and i just need to vent a lot of the time. I don't have anywhere to release this and it's so pent up, making it so much worse being so isolated.
