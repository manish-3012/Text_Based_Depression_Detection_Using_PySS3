The only thing i have each year was taken from meI know what this sounds stupid but Halloween was the only holiday that I ever loved it was one holiday where I could be away from my family. It's the only holiday I like and I was happy during. This whole year I've been nothing but depressed and helped me with the only thing I could look forward to is the only thing that's me happy every year. it just got quarantined right before the holiday starts so I won't be able to do anything for it. It's the only thing I wanted this entire year it's the only thing to keep me going through the year, and it was just taken from me. my parents are mad at me for getting upset about this it's not like they ever understand anyways they know this sounds childish and I know this might sound like a silly thing to get upset over but it's genuinely the only thing that I had.I feel nothing but pain for the rest of the year, but Halloween is the one thing that can make me occasionally happy because it's the one thing I exelled at. I can't really talk to other people and don't like seeing any of my family members because of them aren't necessarily nice to me but I love doing special effects makeup and I love dressing up in costumes and cosplaying, so this was the only thing I had, and the only thing i had got taken away from me. Now that I'm quarantined I know my grades are going to drop and my parents have really high expectations for me so they're just going to yell at me more and more and I know I won't be able to handle it anymore I can't do this I really can't. I want something different happen, I want this all to stop, every time I think something good is going to happen, every time I start to get happy, it all gets taken away from me.
