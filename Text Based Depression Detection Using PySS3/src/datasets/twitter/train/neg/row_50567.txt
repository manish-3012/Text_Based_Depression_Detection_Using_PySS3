I just had a nervous breakdown, started cutting myself and now I want to dieI had a mental breakdown in front of my mom and then I started cutting myself in front of her. I moved a lot as a kid and had no real place to call home. Now that I'm back in my "home country" people expect me to assimilate and integrate back into the culture, but I can't do it. I'm so different here compared to everyone else. I don't want to be here and I don't want to be anywhere else either. I have no home, no sense of identity, no jobs. I just want to jump off the roof and die. I fantasize about slitting my wrist opened or jumping off the roof.
