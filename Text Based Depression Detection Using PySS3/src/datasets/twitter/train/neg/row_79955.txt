I need some supportThe past couple of days have been the absolute WORST. Everything has just been going wrong. I feel like Iâ€™ve failed at life. Iâ€™m going to graduate college, but only with a 3.0 gpa at best. I canâ€™t get a job and Iâ€™m going to be stuck with my parents who treat me as a child. And during this one month I have off before I go back to school they want me to go on a fucking vacation with them. And now Iâ€™ve pissed off my girlfriend because I had to cancel on a date because I have to get my cavities filled. Yep, a 22 year old male has cavities. I just want to leave everything behind. But Iâ€™m stuck here since I have no job. I need some positive support - ANYTHING will do. I just feel the absolute WORST right now. Iâ€™m just sitting here in my car about to cry.
