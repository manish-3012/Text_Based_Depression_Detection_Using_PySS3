Just got home from work and I want to dieI'm lying in bed right now. My foot hurts for some reason. I feel a bit deflated and sad. I'm not sure if I'm officially depressed but I just feel really shitty and suicidal. I don't even have any energy to have a beer which is my usual coping mechanism. I'm off work for 3 days and I should be happy but I can't shake this shitty feeling. What should I do to get myself out of this mindset...?
