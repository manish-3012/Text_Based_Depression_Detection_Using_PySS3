I just need some help, someone to talk too.Recently I've been going through some real tough times, my parents got divorced and both moved away so I had to move into my own place, this was maybe 6 months ago. So me and my then girlfriend moved in together in our own place, she left me about two months ago because she wasn't happy. And now I'm struggling at work with the hours I have, I am struggling with rent in an apartment I can't afford nor do I have time to move out because I'm studying as well and my parents won't take me back in because they both moved far away back to their home towns. I just need someone to talk too, I'm afraid I'm going to be homeless in a few days and I'm so worried, I'm 18 and I've tried everything, it's just really hard to co-exist my University hours with my work hours in order to make money and still have time to study and now it's all backfired and I'm going to somehow go to uni without money or a place to live. I just need someone to talk to, someone to help. Thanks guys.
