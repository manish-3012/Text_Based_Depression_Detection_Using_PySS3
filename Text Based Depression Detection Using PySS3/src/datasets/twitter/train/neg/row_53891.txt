I can't careLately I have just been having trouble feeling any emotion towards anything, which makes me not care about living. It has gotten to the point where nothing affects me. A raise, So what? A friend's parent dies, what is the problem? Upcoming vacation, what is the point? Nothing is truly "wrong" with my life, I have a fine job, supportive friends, a good social life, but every day I find myself reaching for my rifle out of extreme disinterest in life. I don't feel sad, depressed, angry, or anything else, I just don't care. Help?
