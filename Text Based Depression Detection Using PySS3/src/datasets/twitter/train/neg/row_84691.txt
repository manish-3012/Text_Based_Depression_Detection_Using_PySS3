Advice for friend!Hi, I have a close friend who has been going through depression for over  a decade. She recently told me she's had suicidal thoughts for a long  time, but will not kill herself until her father has passed away. She  lied to her father about her depression a while back because she does  not want him to worry about it, but she is in a lot of pain right now as  she is going through a depressive episode. I'm not sure what I should  do- she does not want to seek therapy because she has tried it before  and found it ineffective, and feels that if it does not work again, it  may be the last straw. I really care about her and love her and it hurts  me to see her go through this. I'm always here to listen, but part of  me feels like I'm harboring a big secret that will only cause her more  pain in the long run. What do I do? How do I help someone who feels like  they can no longer seek help? She's currently on anti-deps also.
