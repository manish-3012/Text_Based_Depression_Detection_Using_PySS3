I don't want to dieI'm in a downward goddamn spiral. I got shitfaced two nights ago and fucked stuff up more than ever, so I told myself.. no more, I was gonna quit.

Here I am again, drinking. Two days. Fuck. 

My parents were alcoholics. I guess you can't break the pattern. I should die. But there's so much I want. I'm so lost.
