Trying leads to failure. Everytime.Hi, so I'm really getting tired of trying. I'm a 26F who is so much of a lose, I fucking deliver pizzas. I have never had any real life friends and I've never had sex or been in a relationship. But today I'm just really fucking tired of it. I had a chance to get a decent job, but I fucked it up like I do all things. So now I have to go back to fucking pizza delivery. Honestly, I'd rather be dead. I'm not really sure why I should keep living when its pretty clear I'm incapable of progressing from this menial state in life. I'm sitting right next to a big cliff and I might just throw myself off of it. I can't take another fucking failed attempt to get my life together.

You're probably not going to read this and thats fine. I don't really care. But maybe typing this made me feel a little better.
