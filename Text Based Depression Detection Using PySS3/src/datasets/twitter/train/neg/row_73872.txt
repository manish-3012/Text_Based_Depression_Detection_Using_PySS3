feeling extremely stucka little background: iâ€™m almost 23, my boyfriend broke up with me last week through text. weâ€™ve lived together our whole relationship, he got into a car accident late summer in the middle of us moving &amp; i moved the whole house myself, helped him go to the bathroom when he couldnâ€™t alone, showered him, worked 80 hours, did all the cooking/cleaning/shopping. i have BDP so itâ€™s hard for me to connect with people, he was my best friend. 
the breakup was pretty unexpected &amp; is killing me. i found out a day after that iâ€™m pregnant &amp; he of course wants me to abort it. 
so iâ€™m currently homeless &amp; pregnant &amp; struggling to find a place to live/new job/think about what i want to do about my pregnancy. 
my friends are saying â€œiâ€™m here if you need anything!â€ but arenâ€™t willing to actually hang out/help me pack or even text me back most of the time. my ex isnâ€™t offering any kind of support at all, except that he isnâ€™t throwing my stuff out on the lawn. 
i have no one &amp; nothing-easiest option is just to end it iâ€™m so miserable :(
