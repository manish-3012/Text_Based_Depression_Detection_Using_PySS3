Time running out... money problems growing.Lost my job two months ago but now After interviewing and failing to get the 10 jobs I interviewed for I am once again interviewing for a job that will help me and my family out but I'm doubtful that I will get the job. I also need rent money in 2 days or I will get kicked out, I applied for atleast a dozen loans and got denied for every single one Because my identity was stolen by my biological mother while I was on active duty in the Army before she died so my credit sucks and I am stuck with the aftermath of this and I sold everything I could to pay for my recent car repair (head gasket and timing chain) I can't even buy food at this point. I have about $10 to my name. I tried dozens of emergency funding programs but they all take awhile to process. I'm out of options... I will not be alive in a few days. Thanks for reading.
