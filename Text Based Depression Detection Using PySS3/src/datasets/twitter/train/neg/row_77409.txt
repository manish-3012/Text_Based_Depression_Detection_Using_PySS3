I'm getting closer and closer...I have been depressed since 13 years old. Every year I get worse and worse. At the beginning of 2016 I was pretty bad, but I thought suicide was stupid.

 A year after that, I hit rock bottom and thought about it every single day. I've gotten out of that slump, but I'm still not ok. After that, the only thing holding me back was the fact that theres no easy way to get the job done.

A few days ago set up and tested a noose and its solid. I dont even need to leave my bedroom. Whats stopping me now? 

About 4 months ago, I used to always think about how just the year before I laughed at the idea of suicide and now look at me.. thinking about it every day. I used to ask myself "If it only took a year to get from that point to this point, where will I be in 1 more year?".. 
But now Im starting to ask myself "Where am I gonna be in a month? Where am I gonna be in a week?"
