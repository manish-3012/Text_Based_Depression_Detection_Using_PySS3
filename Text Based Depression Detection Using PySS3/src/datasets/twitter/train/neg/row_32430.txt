Don't do it.Sucide is not worth it... It's not. You will never experience the emotions again, you will never achieve your goals, you will never find love, you will never know what tommorow could have been, tommorow could have been better, than the day tommorow. I can only semi-relate to being depressed, let alone suicidal, I have never been suicidal.

But it's not worth it, your life could get better, you will never experience again if you do this, and thank of your family, thank of how devastated they will feel, they love you, don't end it. For your friends, family, the future, More! Don't end it! 

Don't end your life! It's not worth it! Get help!

I pray for every one of you, please don't do it and God Bless.
