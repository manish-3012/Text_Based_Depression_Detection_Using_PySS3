oofi never tell anyone anything. i barely even think about it. but weed can force you to think about it so.. just writing this i hate myself so much i hate it itâ€™s gross 

iâ€™m scared of myself at this point, iâ€™ll admit that. itâ€™s incredibly scary and it sucks i can never tell anyone.... i canâ€™t even let myself cry for long

i donâ€™t understand how iâ€™m not locked up or being diagnosed but tomorrow iâ€™m going to tell myself that it was just an episode iâ€™m not depressed i have an average level of anxiety and that iâ€™m just uniquely incompetent lol but i really doubt it.. i wonder if iâ€™ll ever be able to find out 

iâ€™m scared 24/7. i feel like i dissociated my whole childhood.. i think i was just sad was i actually or did i just want to be? i deserve this

god have i always just suppressed my feelings of worthlessness i look back and realize how sad everything was and how happy i should have been how proud i should have been i won the lottery in having parents that stayed together and that loved each other and werenâ€™t addicts. thereâ€™s no reason for my brain to be this way 

iâ€™ve been trying to write more but every time i realize iâ€™m saying too much or going to far and i force myself to stop and change it and iâ€™m just going to end the loop with this. ugh.
