I just had a dream about suicide and it was greatI (17f) dreamt that I killed myself and I was so happy before I woke up. I don't want to be here anymore. I feel like every fucking card is stacked against me. Everything about me presents a challenge.

Female, queer, ADHD, PoC, poor, etc. I've been through every kind of abuse at home, a mother who doesn't give a shit about (she's made that perfectly clear), and I'm just so. Tired. Of fighting. 

Fighting to live a life that just seems impossible for me to ever have. 

I'm getting so fucking close. I don't think I'll be able to hold myself up under all this weight for much longer.
