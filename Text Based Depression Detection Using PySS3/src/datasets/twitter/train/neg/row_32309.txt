Love how people tell me to kill myselfMy brother tells me to kill myself, drop dead, cut myself,  slit my wrists, hang myself, and no one would care about me if I killed myself. Iâ€™m m 14 heâ€™s m 17. Only if he knew I cut and had suicide thoughts. I usually just ignore him or respond with â€œyou shouldnâ€™t joke about serious things like that.â€
