It's never to late to get help.I have ptsd from sexual abuse, bi polar depression, and have had some brief periods of psychosis. It appears that I have suicidal ocd where I have the overwhelming craving to kill myself. The only reason I never fully went through with it, is because of my mom. I have struggled years of self harm, it being the only reason I didn't off myself for quite A while. I felt irremediable and hopeless, like nothing could ever get better. All day and night I felt and looked woebegone, it took ages just to feel even the slightest bit of joy, I was so close to killing myself...but then something changed. I met a girl that I fell in love with, I got the confidence to tell my family which i never had the willpower to do so, I am now in therapy getting A plethora of advice and ways to improve myself and mind, and also find ways to alleviate the pain instead of physically harming myself. I felt so lost, so low, so close to suicide, but I didn't give up, I stayed willful, and I didn't do it. Even now I still sometimes feel like dying, i'm not completely better, but I am improving, I am getting better, I once thought that was impossible. If anyone reading this feels terrible, feels alone, feels as if they are doomed to live a life of hell and want to die, try to take my story as some bit of hope. You never know how many people truly love and care for you, ask for help, if help doesn't come be patient, suicide is never the answer.
