Five more days.I met my best friend today. I joked about getting hit my a car and stuff and giving all my books to her. She laughed it off and everything but as our conversation got more serious, I said, if I died in some kind of an accident or something, I want you to have all my books. 

I have around 600 in total. Some of them are kind of rare. She could sell them for uni, (sheâ€™s eighteen), and some of them she could use for her course, (english lit). 

She said where would she store them all? I said she could use my bedroom or use a storage locker. I also gave her early birthday gift. Sheâ€™s not in the habit of opening things until the day so Iâ€™m safe. She knows Iâ€™m going to â€˜Franceâ€™ or at least I told her I am, so this will be my only opportunity to give her the gift: six hundred pounds. For nights out, for books, for rent, anything. Iâ€™m quite proud of saving that much. I do â€˜t really go out much anymore lol, today was the exception. 

Then I saw my nana, acted normal, made her smile. Same old. Tomorrow Iâ€™m going on a long, long walk to the lake. I just want to sit and read for a while. Itâ€™s normal as well, since Monday is a training day. Then on Tuesday Iâ€™ll go to school, then Wednesday, then Thursday, Fridayâ€™s Iâ€™m off so Iâ€™ll work.
