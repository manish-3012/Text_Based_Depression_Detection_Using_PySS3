I'm not sure if I should go through with it,but I'd think I'd be bestI've failed literally everything in my life,I have no talent in anything,and I have no reason whatsoever to keep living. Problem with this is,I keep on hesitating,I don't know why but I do. So at this point I'm not sure if I should go through with it. I think I will though,I just have to try no to hesitate again.
