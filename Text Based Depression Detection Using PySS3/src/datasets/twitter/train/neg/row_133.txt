Does anyone not want to help themselves? Because I don't...I'm at the point where I don't want to try anymore. I've tried it all, and I've been wanting to die since I was 12 years old (I'm 28/F).

Now, I've successfully sabotaged my life so that I lost my job, my boyfriend, I'm pushing my friends/family away. All I want to do is make sure my family doesn't have to deal with too much of the aftermath. 

I used to want to try. I spent countless years researching all to know about mental health/psychology, the different therapies to treat them, therapy, exercise, hobbies, relationships, creating things....I'm just all out of fight and I feel like that's too pathetic. My boyfriend is leaving me because I don't have the will to live anymore....

I want things to be over so badly.
