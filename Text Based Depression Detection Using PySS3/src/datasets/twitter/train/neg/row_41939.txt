Being left by friends who don't want to deal with or talk about mental disorders**TL;DR: I don't have friends to talk to at my lowest points**
I've been losing friends one after the other. At this point I try to go through my phone contacts daily just hoping someone will pick up to talk. I don't know why I keep trying. I feel like a lot don't really care if they pick up to just to say something like,

"Sorry, I can't talk. I'm out with [closer] friends."

Some haven't returned calls for months. I also tried talking on those emotional support and crisis lines, but I hate talking there and only getting generic and rather ingenuine responses. My current therapist thinks I should give up on seeking friends for emotional/mental health support, though in my opinion other options for support, such as 6 medications, 5 years of therapy, 2 involuntary hospitalizations, have failed me to help me.
I don't know how long more I could tolerate with living like this.
