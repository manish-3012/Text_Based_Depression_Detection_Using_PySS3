Can I please just be DONE???I just. It's too much.

I found out my husband told his brother he wants to divorce me.

He's been hiding money. Lying. Having at the very least an emotional affair with a coworker. My autistic daughter is acting out. My 11 year old daughter is going through puberty. I'm in a major depressive episode. I have ulcers and I'm just in pain all the time. The one person who I want to love me who I want to please seems completely unfulfilled being with me.

I just want to fall asleep and never wake up. I don't have a gun so I can't do that. I have always pussed out with cutting myself. I never get a free fucking moment alone with the car so that won't work. 

I don't want to traumatize my kids with a mess. Basically the only thing holding me back at this point is that I don't want to ruin their Christmas and I can't figure out how to do it in a way that's not going to make their home into the scene of a death.

I just. I can't do it anymore. I'm supposed to start with a new pdoc soon and I just don't even know if I can do it. I hate me. I know that deep down everyone around me must hate me too. There is nothing about me worth saving.
