Everytime I get up I get knocked down. This time literally.Iâ€™m so fucking broken right now. I hate the way my life is going. The only good things I have are a job and my dog. I was just assaulted, had hair ripped out of my head and my lip busted open. Then Iâ€™m told â€œit was an accidentâ€ and after more yelling and telling him to get away from me he tried to corner me in my room so I kicked him in the balls and slammed on the door until it moved him and locked. 

Then he tells me no one would ever believe me if I told about what he did and that it would be his word against mine and since Iâ€™ve been in a mental hospital and have mental illness theyâ€™ll lock me up instead. Then said my ex who strangled me near to death in my sleep probably never actually did it Iâ€™m just a liar. 

I hate my life. I just want it all to end.
