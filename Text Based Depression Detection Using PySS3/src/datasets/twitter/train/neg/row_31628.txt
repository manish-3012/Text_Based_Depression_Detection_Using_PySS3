How do I make the most out of my last days?I have reached the point of no return, so don't try to convince me out of it. I am going to kill myself on March 5th 2019. The reason why I'm waiting until then is because I want to experience my best online friend turn 18, don't ask me why I make such a big deal out of this.

I already made a rough plan on how exactly I will spend my \*last\* day, and planned out my suicide thoroughly. However, I don't have any plans for the time between now and March 5th. I am into video editing and am part of the Furry community. What could I do to "graduate" from this life, if you get what I mean?
