Does anyone else just look at their post history or just realize how long youâ€™ve been suicidal for and realize that nothing seems to be changing no matter what?I canâ€™t help but laugh to myself at the fact that Iâ€™ve been suicidal for years (if I add all my throwaway accounts up) and Iâ€™m surprisingly still alive. 
I really want to die. 
Iâ€™m my own biggest threat. Everyday itâ€™s slowly getting worse.
