Rant and I am doneI hate it when I say that I am thinking about ending it all, and someone says... think about this person or that person who you care about.
Firstly, you are grossly overestimating your value in my life to think that just thinking about you will stop the hurt and pain, and make stop considering what I am considering.
Secondly, where are these people? When a person wants to die, they feel like no one is listening, there or understands them. So, thinking about Tom, Dick or Harry at the end doesnâ€™t mean shit.
