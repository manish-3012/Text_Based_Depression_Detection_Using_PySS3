â€œit gets betterâ€(sorry if any grammar is off, Iâ€™m not taking the time to proof read or fix punctuation. :))

bs. Thatâ€™s a bunch of bs. Iâ€™m just barely a teenager, I just know my adult years arenâ€™t going to be any better. 

Iâ€™ve been bullied almost my whole life, but get called violent now that I stand up for myself. I get called selfish when I do nothing but put EVERYONE before myself. I just feel like I donâ€™t fit in. nobody understands me, at all. 

This virtual school stuff isnâ€™t helping me either. Battling homelessness, a sick mother, two younger siblings and a father who just decided to go into rehab is HARD. 

Before this I was an A, B student...held to the highest of expectations. Everyone ALWAYS wanting me to do something to their standards. Even though face to face was stressful and extremely depressing, I still managed to do my work. Did I put all my energy into it? Ha no. but I still managed to pass. Even then I tried to talk to an on campus counselor and the next thing I know the WHOLE school knows about my self harming and attempts. 

Now that this pandemic is a thing Iâ€™ve just be so not me. Starting off the virtual school year strong with a 4.3 weighted gpa, now my grades are dropping to low Bâ€™s and Câ€™s. Teachers stepping on my neck because â€œI have no reason to have missing assignments.â€ 

Even when I explained my lack of motivation and depressive state it still was â€œyou have lots of potential and thereâ€™s still no reason your grades should be dropping.â€ 

My mom swears itâ€™s my phone. â€œYou always in that phone instead trying to do something.â€ I donâ€™t think she gets that Iâ€™m trying my hardest. When I donâ€™t even have motivation to wake up and eat, what makes you think Iâ€™d care about school? 

if I kept explaining this would probably go on forever. but Iâ€™m seriously thinking about â€œitâ€ â€˜cause at this point Iâ€™m tired, physically and emotionally.

whatever tho, Iâ€™ll be alright. Iâ€™m probably over reacting anyways :) 

happy holidays!
