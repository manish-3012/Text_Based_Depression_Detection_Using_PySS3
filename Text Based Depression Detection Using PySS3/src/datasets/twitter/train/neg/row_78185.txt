I took four Percocet 10s recentlyI bumped one then took two right after and then about thirty minutes later I crushed another. The weekend before I did a lot of drugs and still nothing. (A lot for me) 

Backstory my girlfriend and I had split up a while back but we kept talking. She was basically living with me the last two months. Finally this last week she brought up the fact that she is talking to another guy after specifically saying if she finds out I do that it would be over for good. So she tells me this and Iâ€™m obviously not to happy about the fact has been keeping this side piece this whole time. She had to have been doing it while she was working because when we are off she is always around me. She was always trying to catch me on my phone, which makes sense now, and she was always blaming me fore talking to other girls. Iâ€™ve been with her for almost four years and now that she is out of my life idk what to do. I have family trying to keep me up and out of this but all I want to do is drink another bottle and down more pills this time.  Iâ€™m 6â€™5 about 230lbs and pretty extensive background in weed but not coke and molly. Iâ€™m trying to stay happy and work and be human and stuff but I just donâ€™t wanna. 

Iâ€™m just ranting, Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m just lost right now. 

Again delete if this isnâ€™t the right spot.
