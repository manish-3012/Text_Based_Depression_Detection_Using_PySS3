What do you do to distract yourself from wanting to end it all?I feel empty inside. I'm in therapy but don't like the idea of medications because I've been on nearly all that there is out there as far as antianxiety, antidepressants and antipsychotics. Most days are usually good and I'm fine but there's days where I just really want to fucking kill myself (like today). It physically causes me chest pain to feel like this and I have to try not to self harm because I don't want to ruin 6 years of being clean from that. Any suggestions for distraction?
