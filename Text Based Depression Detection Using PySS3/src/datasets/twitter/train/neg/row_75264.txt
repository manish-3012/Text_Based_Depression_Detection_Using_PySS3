isolated, etc.How am I supposed to stay alive for anyone when absolutely nobody in my life actually cares about me?

My family arguably loves me but they're growing tired of my incompetence and my inability to do anything because of how depressed I've been. They're understanding to a point but I've been too useless for anyone to feel bad for me anymore.

I don't have friends so that's not even worth mentioning.

The only place I can turn to for "support" is the internet and I've worn out my welcome with most of the people I know online (people who I'd maybe consider friends if I weren't so intolerable). Lately all anyone ever says to me is that I'm annoying (and ugly, etc.), that they're sick of me, that I need to grow up and turn to people in real life for support. But I have nobody in real life to turn to.

But how am I supposed to make any friends when I'm so annoying and worthless and depressed? When I don't have any hobbies any more? When I can't bear to leave the house because I hate myself so much?

I just need advice I guess. I feel like I'm trapped in a situation I can't escape.
