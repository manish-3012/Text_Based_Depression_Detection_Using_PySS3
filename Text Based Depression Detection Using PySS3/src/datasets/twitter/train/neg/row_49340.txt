whatâ€™s so wrong with wanting to diethis question keeps going through my head. why does anyone care? my mom says suicidal people are selfish. i think everyone else is selfish for trying to â€œhelpâ€ me and making me feel guilty for it wanting to be around anymore. i donâ€™t want help. i want to die. i hope there isnâ€™t anything after this. iâ€™m ready for it to be over. iâ€™m so sick of everything man. iâ€™m so stupid and useless and i canâ€™t do anything right. i want life to be over
