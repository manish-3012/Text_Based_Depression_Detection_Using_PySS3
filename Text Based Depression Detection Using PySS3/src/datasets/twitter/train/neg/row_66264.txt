This is itI've lost everything this year. Life has me by the throat. Divorce. Homelessness. Abuse. I can't handle anymore.. I have no reason to be here. I'm gonna try again for the 3rd time this year. I hear it's like going to sleep and peaceful..I just don't want to suffer anymore. It's what everyone around me wants anyways. No matter what I do or how much even though I have nothing at all I'll always be considered a burden. It does NOT get better. It's been months of disaster after disaster. I wish nothing but love, peace, and happiness to you all and hope life deals you a better hand to those struggling
