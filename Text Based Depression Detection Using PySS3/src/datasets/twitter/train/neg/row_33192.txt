Being 19, gay and ugly is horrible. As well as having no friends, no social life, and staying cooped up inside quarantinedI feel I have no drive to live anymore. I have nobody I can relate to on anything. My last boyfriend left me two years ago and since then I have felt a complete sense of loneliness. The only connection I can get now is a meaningless hookup with a stranger, risking myself of getting HIV. Iâ€™m not straight-ugly, but Iâ€™m ugly in the gay world because I donâ€™t have chiseled abs or a perfect jawline. Iâ€™ve considered taking out loans to get elective surgeries, but I just wish someone would see me as attractive. If I canâ€™t find a husband in my future, I might as well just kill myself. I donâ€™t want to die aloneâ€” that is my biggest fear.
