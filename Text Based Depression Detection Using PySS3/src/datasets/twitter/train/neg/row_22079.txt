does any one else fantasize about how sad your loved ones would be if you killed yourself?i think about that a lot and sometimes thatâ€™s the only way i know i would be noticed is if i killed myself or tried to kill myself. itâ€™s not a cry for attention because thatâ€™s not what i want at all. it makes me feel good knowing my death would cause so much pain to my loved ones. that sounds messed up:/
