I tried to kill myself at 9...I should have gotten it over with then.I am 19 and have had depression for 11 years. I have been seeing therapists, psychologists, and social workers since I was 4 or 5. I have been on 10 or 12 medications. I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 9. I have stayed in psych wards 3 or 4 times (the last time at 13).

I am so tired of being depressed. I have no energy; if I could, I would lie in bed all day. Caffeine doesn't help; I have had 400mg of it today, and it's 10PM and I'm ready to go to bed. I have no drive or motivation. Everything is flat. I just want to be normal and be able to function like other people can. I don't want to have to live like this any more. It seems like I am constantly irritable and I can't focus on anything.

I have been increasingly suicidal for about 2 weeks now, so I decided to go in to see a therapist at my college. I had earlier gone in to talk to the doctor about my medications. When I was first feeling suicidal, he doubled my medication...this made me less suicidal, but I was throwing up a lot and couldn't think straight. I also had to stop taking my other medication because I can't afford it any more. 

So, I went in to see a counselor. Basically, ~60% of his responses to me were "Oh, that sucks". Yes, verbatim. When I left, he said "remember, if you need emergency help, call 911". I told him that that wasn't financially possible for me. He said "Oh, that sucks, doesn't it?".

I am so tired of having to live like this. It is too much effort for too little payoff. I have no fucking energy and it is killing me. I would kill myself tonight if my roommate didn't have to find my body.
