Why can't I just tell them?Most of my friends know I suffer from depression and anxiety (and the ones that don't would understand, I'm certain). Most of them know I hospitalized myself for severe depression this summer. So why can't I reach out for help?

I've had 3 friends ask me how I'm doing today. Three. And I avoided answering. But inside I'm screaming, "Help! I'm pretty suicidal and I think I've started planning a gesture next month! I'm scared!"

But I can't even allude to it.

God, I feel so pathetic.
