01/05/2020Itâ€™s my birthday today. I turned 22 and Iâ€™m tired. 
A month ago I tried to kill myself. 

I didnâ€™t want to let myself live another year but here I am, Happy birthday to me lol

Iâ€™ve been thinking about it everyday and how I couldnâ€™t bring myself to do it. I really wish I did.

Itâ€™s come to the point where I really donâ€™t know if I want to do this anymore. I feel like Iâ€™ll let go soon because everything just seems so fucking pointless and Iâ€™ve made peace with that.
