my boyfriend makes me want to kill myselfhe also makes me want to live. when heâ€™s nice and loving. 
but when he makes me feel bad about being more privileged than he is, for choosing to go to university, for being financially dependent on my parents at age 18, never had to work to get my own money, it makes me feel like my life has no worth because i never â€œreallyâ€ struggled and had everything handed to me. 

confused the hell out of me. does he hate me? does he think iâ€™m pathetic? am i just a joke to him? those figures people make fun of because they have their parents hold their hand through everything? 
while i resent my parents for supporting my financially only and never emotionally? 

i feel weird. i donâ€™t know what to do. but i love him and we have been through so much together. i have already put him through a lot and heâ€™s been patient with me and my crazy circumstances of strict parents and my emotional instability but he makes me hate myself.
