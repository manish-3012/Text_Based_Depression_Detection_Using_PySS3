I donâ€™t know how to get helpIâ€™ve been walking in fucking circles for 20m trying to just say how I feel to a friend m, I canâ€™t do it, I donâ€™t wanna die without them knowing how good most of them were to me. I donâ€™t know if I want to ask for help or say that Iâ€™m ending it tomorrow. I canâ€™t take my inability to do something anymore, my stupid inability to talk to new people in person, I canâ€™t stand being me anymore and I canâ€™t stand my dad anymore I just wanna die. Idk what to do to stop feeling like this except kms.
Iâ€™m tired of crying and being useless to anything but games, I donâ€™t know what to do with my life.

Talking to people here helped for a while, and now I simply donâ€™t think that would work again, I dont know what I want
