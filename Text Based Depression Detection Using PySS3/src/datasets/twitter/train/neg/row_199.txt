I need to feel someone elseâ€™s skin against mineAnd soon. Otherwise I swear to God Iâ€™m gonna end my life. 

Reading posts where guys complain about the impossibility of attracting girls because of their supposed bad looks makes feel even more worthless because I know girls like me. They look at me all the time, Iâ€™ve missed millions of opportunities. But I feel so unable to reach out. Like Iâ€™m trapped inside myself for having been isolated for so long. 

I hate myself so much. My life is a complete failure. 
Sometimes it occurs to me in a flash that the idea of ending my life is an aberration as the gift of life is such a sacred and gorgeous thing, and I mean I really feel it in a deep way. 
Also Iâ€™m fully aware of my potential (which is in part why I despise myself so much). But in moments like now (and theyâ€™re getting more and more frequent and intense) all I can think of is my pain. 

The lack of socializing, physical affection and sex leads to a very real physical pain at this point. I feel it all over my body. Like a wave that envelopes me and ends up focusing right in my heart, like a frozen fist clenching suddenly around it. 

And believe me Iâ€™m not letting myself go. Iâ€™m fighting with all I got. Iâ€™ve quit smoking (both cigarettes and weed), stopped fapping and watching porn, I exercize daily, meditate, take cold showers, go for walks, got back to photography, which was a big hobby of mine, and started seeing a therapist. 

But no matter the efforts and although Iâ€™m getting positive results in some regards, the loneliness is just too fuckinâ€™ unbearable. 
And everyday, little by little, Iâ€™m losing my will to live. I end up crying in my bed almost every night.
