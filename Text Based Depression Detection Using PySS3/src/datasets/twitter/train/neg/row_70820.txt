Fuck lifeI just find life to be a series of shitty letdowns and problems,I'm never happy (I'm mixed up in some legal shit that could put me in jail).  The only shit I am guilty of is trying to help my mental health.   Life without escape is something I don't want to deal with.  I've tried so many antidepressants and nothing works.  I still just wanna die.  I have a plan to use a camp cooker in my car to kill myself with carbon monoxide poison.
