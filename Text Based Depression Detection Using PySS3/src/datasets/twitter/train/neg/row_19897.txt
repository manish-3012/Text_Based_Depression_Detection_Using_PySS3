I feel so isolated and itâ€™s absolutely destroying meIâ€™ve had a lot of problems making friends in my life, I have really bad social anxiety and Iâ€™m just an awkward and not very entertaining person in general, so Iâ€™m not exactly the person people want to be friends with. 

As a result Iâ€™ve almost always found friends through the internet. This did make me really happy but several years ago, stuff happened that honestly ruined me when I had already been depressed. I met some truly great people who helped me. It was like they knew whenever I was upset, theyâ€™d always check in on me and help me however they could, and it was all around great to have these amazing people I met in my life. We were a group of friends on windows live messenger and would talk every day and it helped me out as I had never felt true, genuine friendship like that.

It all went away when one of them killed themselves. It started a huge chain reaction and 4 other people killed themselves sithin 2 years in the group and since then Iâ€™ve fallen out of contact with everyone and it hurt so bad. It still hurts me. Itâ€™s been 5 years and I think of them all every day.

Since then Iâ€™ve drifted among friend groups. Never really made many irl but Iâ€™ve made a decent few over the internet, especially lately. It was nice to be able to voice call and play video games with people I liked.

Thatâ€™s changed since I started going to college. In addition to the huge amount of stress schoolwork adds, Iâ€™ve lost my only coping strategy with everything else happening in my life. My dorm room is so loud and everyone in it so judgemental I canâ€™t ever voice call. It feels like Iâ€™ve suddenly become irrelevant to a lot of people I know and love. Everyone feels colder to me the longer I am away and Iâ€™ve been constantly panicking and on the edge lately because Iâ€™m so scared of being isolated and losing my friends. No one even seems interested in talking to me at all anymore when Iâ€™m going through such a hard part of my life and I truly do need people but Iâ€™m losing everyone I thought I had and itâ€™s so hard. I donâ€™t know how to fit everything going through my head and life in a Reddit post and I wish I didnâ€™t have to because I just want my friends to care about me again
