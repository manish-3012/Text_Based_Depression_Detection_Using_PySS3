UniteEver wonder if the lot of us combined, that all our needs could actually be met?

So many of us lack family, friendship, love. So many of us need someone to understand them. What if we actually *did* something to get our needs met amongst ourselves? We all offer something, even though we all lack many things.

Or maybe Iâ€™m drunk.
