Sometimes the trash takes itself out...I'm not a good person anymore. Not really sure that I ever was. My spiralling negative thoughts have led me down a dark path of cynicism and misanthropic views. Everyone eventually realizes what a drain I am and abandons me, and I can't say that I really blame them. The world is such a soul-sucking, dream-crushing place, and I never chose to exist in the first place.

I'm going to finally find some peace now. Thank you. I hope the state of this world improves for everyone.
