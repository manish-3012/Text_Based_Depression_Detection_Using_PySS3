Anyone open to talk?I have ran out of my drug of choice, my anti depressants arenâ€™t doing anything to help, and I am running out of space to cut. Every minute that passes I feel more and more on edge and I cry and cry more. Itâ€™s really not a good feeling. Had a talk with a psychiatrist today and we only talked for maybe 5 minutes and after those 5 minutes I was already crying and she said even though she doesnâ€™t know about me since it was a last minute thing my doctor did but that she can already see that I am suffering with major depression and anxiety. All my friends are asleep or busy. I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to and the later it gets the worse I feel and the more I get closer to actually doing it. If anyoneâ€™s down to have a random conversation about anything I would really appreciate it.
