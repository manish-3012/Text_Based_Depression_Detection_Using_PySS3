Iâ€™m about to lose my counselorI started seeing a campus counselor at my college because I had persistent thoughts or suicide for about a year straight. I canâ€™t say that itâ€™s definitely made my life any better, but at the very least, venting these feelings and thoughts Iâ€™ve kept hidden for so long does provide some relief. Anyway, the campus only provides 10 therapy sessions per year, and while I havenâ€™t been counting, I know weâ€™re getting close. Lately, weâ€™ve been delving deeper into some issues from my past, and it has been stirring up some emotion. Sometimes, it feels like this counseling is the most important thing Iâ€™m doing right now, far above my shitty job, classes, research and other obligations. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s making me better, but itâ€™s the only thing Iâ€™m doing that I think might be helping. Depression has been hitting me like a fucking tsunami lately, and Iâ€™m anxious about this coming to an end. Life seems to be crisis after crisis with short reprieves of a boring, meaningless existence. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do when counseling is done. Group doesnâ€™t interest me, and my insurance sucks, so I donâ€™t think I have any good, affordable options available. My loving family is my biggest reason to stay alive, but due to some recent events, Iâ€™m thinking maybe I hurt more people than I help. Also, I have a huge presentation due Tuesday that I havenâ€™t started. Funny how all this shit seems to happen simultaneously so often. Anyway, I could really use some kind of help.
