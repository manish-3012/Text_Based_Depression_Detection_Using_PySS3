hangingGetting more and more numb as the days go by. I've already bought a rope and practiced tying a noose. Can't figure out the knot use for attachment. I don't even know if I'll go through with it. Every time I look up suicide methods I calm down a bit, but its all i do besides drown myself with alcohol. how the hell do people make hanging seem so easy?
