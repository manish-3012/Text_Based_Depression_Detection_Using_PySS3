I just hope reincarnation doesnâ€™t existThis is not really about suicide, but I never want to return to this earth after I pass, even under the best conditions... even if I could come back and own everything in the world. Even though there is still good in the world, is a terrible place and I donâ€™t want to return for any reason.
