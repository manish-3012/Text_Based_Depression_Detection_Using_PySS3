My Dad, the AssholeHey everybody. I'm fairly new to Reddit still and trying to find the appropriate place to write. Hopefully I'm in the right area.

Anyway, I am 21 years old. I am attending college right now and live with my parents and five other siblings. My dad is the issue though because he is never happy about anything; not even his own kids. I'm 100 percent sure he's bipolar as well as schizophrenic and severely depressed. He became disabled in 2005 when his diabetes took his sight to the extent that he can no longer drive nor work. He's never happy for any body though and he's always complaining about my mom and how she never does anything at work. My mom is a personal care assistant and thus, takes care of elderly people who need assistance in being cared for. I think he has no room to talk because he no longer works and whatever he does contribute to the family is monetary. Money is great though. I guess I'm just trying to ask about different coping techniques to practice. How can I ignore him? 

Before you suggest moving out, I can't. I left my job last June and am aware of the huge mistake I have made for myself. I can't concentrate well enough to pass the driving test to get a license even. I have become so stressed to the point of leaving all my friends in reality and secluding myself due to embarrassment of my lack of achievement. I'm not trying to compare myself to them but when your own father is a huge piece of shit who isn't happy for anyone and one day yells at you, calls you retarded, doesn't recognize your sexual orientation and then another day, is completely fine and dandy playing video games on his tablet, it becomes a crippling thing. I have no sense of identity and no motivation.

I'm not suicidal but I don't know where else to put this. Thanks for reading.
