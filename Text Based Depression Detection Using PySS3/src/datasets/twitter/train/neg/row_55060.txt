Please helpThese past 3 months have been extremely rough. All I've ever thought about these nights is death and the afterlife and I cant keep going on like this. This shit all started because someone I looked up to, entertained me, and help me get through rough times fucking killed himself on June. That's when I started thinking about this shit and seriously cant get my mind off of it. I'm so fucking scared that in the distant future I will think about it one more fucking time and my mind will just snap and I'll end my life right there.
