Everything is grayNothing even distracts me anymore. Every day is just lying in my bed hoping I can sleep and not think about how useless I am for even a little bit.

People around me have shown they don't care; my dad kicked me out and my mom just complains about how sad I am and how I ruin her day (as if she hasn't ruined many of mine throughout my life). I would get a job and move out, but I can't keep a job partly because of depression and partly because I'm completely socially inept. I don't see a way out that isn't killing myself.
