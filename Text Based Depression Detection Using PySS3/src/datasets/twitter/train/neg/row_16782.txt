fuck everythingi'm not gonna rant or anything but i really don't know what to do because i never talk about my problems (seriously don't ask me to it will make me mad and stressed out) but i feel like i could maybe get better if i went to an institution. i need a break from the real world and i need to focus on getting better, but along with all my other problems i have ocd so thinking about not having the blanket and teddy bear i sleep with every night gives me panic attacks and has made me avoid being admitted for like 5 years. (i'm 20) seriously no matter what i can't be admitted somewhere i don't have a blanket and my teddy bear. i would rather die. i used to see a psychiatrist and a therapist but they both said my ocd wasn't my biggest issue but i'm literally sitting here considering killing myself instead of getting better because of a stupid fucking toy. kill me
