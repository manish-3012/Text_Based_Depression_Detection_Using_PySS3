i don't think i can keep going any longeri don't even think i can make it through the night.  i keep telling myself to hold on, to wait for things to get better, but the weeks just keep coming and coming and nothing is changing.  i am not changing.  i don't think i'll ever change.

i am so fucking tired.  being this alone and this suicidal is utterly draining.  i can't keep going on like this - the pain is unbearable.  even scrolling the internet on my phone while i'm lying in bed is draining.  being alive shouldn't be this exhausting.  i'm missing out on what are supposed to be the best years of my life because i can barely get out of bed, let alone make friends and be social.  i'm honestly hanging on by a thread and i'm ready to break out the fucking scissors.

trying to get better is pointless.  living is pointless.  if i'm in this much pain, if i'm this miserable every second of my life, shouldn't i just end it?  why keep torturing myself like this?  at this point, killing myself is the rational choice.  so that's what i'll do.
