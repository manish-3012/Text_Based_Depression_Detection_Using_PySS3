I feel like Iâ€™ve hit my lowest point in life2019 has been incredibly rough and I honestly donâ€™t know where to go or what to do. Iâ€™ve officially failed out of school and have wasted 4.5 years and easily over $100,000, Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with a chronic illness that has been progressively lowering my quality of life, and to top it all off I just got dumped by the one person I felt I could actually talk to

Iâ€™ve never felt so lost and alone and I think Iâ€™m just about done with it all
