Breakup leading to thoughtsIâ€™m 25 (m) sheâ€™s 21 (f)

We have been together almost 2 years. 

Sunday afternoon she said she needed time to think if sheâ€™s happy. She claims I have done nothing wrong. I asked when she will be back. She said she wasnâ€™t sure if it would be a day, week or month. I asked if we were still together and we would remain loyal and no dating or anything of the sorts. She agreed. She left and I was in agony. I felt like the world was collapsing in. I got a text the next day while I was at work saying she was at the apartment. I rushed home and held her. We get to talking asking about if things have improved. She told me she went to a friends house, and then to a co workers house. (She has no close friends). She got drunk at the co workers house and slept with him. I find out and lose it. We eventually calm down and I say that Iâ€™m willing to forgive her and if sheâ€™s willing to go to couples therapy. She agreed instantly and we just held each other. 

Today as I woke up and finding some therapy locations she came out and said that sheâ€™s still not sure if sheâ€™s happy. She said we have (had) a perfect life with perfect pets, location etc. but sheâ€™s not happy where she is. I then told her what do we do? After lots of talking she is unsure if she still loves me and wants to take time to think about it. In 2 weeks sheâ€™s going to let me know if she still has feelings and if I do. 

Right now I have feelings and want to get back together. But my brain tells me that I shouldnâ€™t do it. Iâ€™m scared alone and living with a friend at the moment. Any advice is welcome. 

Iâ€™ve never wanted to hurt myself until today and I donâ€™t know how to process it.
