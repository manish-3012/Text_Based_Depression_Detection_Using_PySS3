I have until SeptemberThis medicine has until September to start having the desired effects, and if so then March of next year for further, but if none by September then I am done. The cool part about this is that my life is so pathetic and stagnant nothing will happen to convince me otherwise; just the same old daily soul crushing humiliating existence due to my rare disorder. 

I was robbed of a childhood and an adulthood, and a manhood, and now I can't even do the only thing that I ever enjoyed; art. Normal people have it so good, they just don't know it.
