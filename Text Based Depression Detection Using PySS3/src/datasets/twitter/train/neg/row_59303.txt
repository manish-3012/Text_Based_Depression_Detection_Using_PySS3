Cheated while apart and she found out, not the first time, now she won't stop crying. Probably won't see her or my kid again.Idk why I'm a piece of shit. Part time bull shit job that pays just enough for me to live in the ghetto, roach infested apartment. Electricity doesn't work right, can't have both fans on at once so we sweat in our room ans stick to the $40 air mattress. I go to work and feel like an outcast, too awkward to function or make friends. Self conscious and paranoid always. Life's just not meant for some people. I know I'm too big of a pussy to kill myself. But I wish it would just happen.
