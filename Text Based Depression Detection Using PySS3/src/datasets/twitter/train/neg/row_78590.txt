Turning 18 in 2 and a half weeks. Why am i still here?The only career path i ever wanted to do is now impossible. I don't care for any other jobs, i just wanted to work as a cop. I wanted to help.. but now from my own demons legally i am unfit mentally to join. I refuse to work just because i have to, i want to do what i like doing but no no, guess I'll die. When? Who knows doubt i could do it again but i want to. Being Autistic makes living almost impossible and doing simple tasks is like an exam each time. 

Please let me die, please break into my house and stab me. Give me cancer or something. I WANT DEATH.
