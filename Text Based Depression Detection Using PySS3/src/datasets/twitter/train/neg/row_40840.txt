Being driven through lossI'm only an 18 year old male with a "future" ahead of me. I'm a really emotional person when it comes to relationships and have attachment issues. Recently my gf of 2 years broke up with me, about 2 months ago. She started talking to a guy immediately and life has been hell since. It's a constant 24/7 stream of not laughing or smiling except for VERY FEW occasions and I feel so wronged. I'm constantly blaming myself for the end of the relationship and even though it's not as serious as an issue of other people, it's still affecting me in a large way. I tried talking to someone once about my suicidal urges, but they told me I just needed to man up because "who would kill themselves over a girl", and basically took it as a joke. I feel trapped with no way out of this besides ending my life. I feel with my life ended, I want feel this anymore, because I want feel nothing, and that seems like a paradise to me right now. I've had a couple moments where I would sit on the railing of the 18th floor of a hotel, or drive late at night on the highway, but never pushed myself to do it, because I know deep down I want to continue living. I just don't know how long this will hold, or if one of these times, I'm going to end up doing it.
