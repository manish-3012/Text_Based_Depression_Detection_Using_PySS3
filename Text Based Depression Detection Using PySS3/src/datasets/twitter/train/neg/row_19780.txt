Im losing my will to live and feel like im reaching my limitSo I am transgender and already suffer from major depression and I can add the dysphoria over that and I have a bad time wih people leaving and today I had to say good-bye to an important friend and this all. Got to much and no one around me wants/seems willing to help me or care about me, or they are having a good day and I don't wanna ruin it but at the same. Time, I am slowly losing my will to live. 

Don't know why I post it here do as you will please downvote or upvote just do whatever, I am losing my ability to care anymore
