I think Iâ€™m going to tell my parentsIâ€™ve been really suicidal lately. Iâ€™ve made a note and figured out how Iâ€™m going to do it.

Today though, I felt different. Iâ€™m 20 yrs old. These suicidal thoughts came from college, Iâ€™m bound to fail my classes. But itâ€™s not too late to drop them. Another reason was because I felt like Iâ€™d let everyone down. And that I donâ€™t know what I wanna do with my life.

Everywhere Iâ€™ve looked, itâ€™s said the best thing to do is talk. And my parents have said theyâ€™ll never stop loving me. I know that itâ€™s going to be hard times still because Iâ€™m going to need to get a job and all. But this is a last ditch effort. Iâ€™ve talked before but only when I was crying for help pretty much. Today though, I think Iâ€™m going to really make an effort to reach out.
