I'm at a loss for what to do.I don't know what to do. I don't feel okay. I got news that affordable, rent geared to income housing here in The Niagara region, the wait time for a one bedroom is 16 years. My school program I wanted to do, which a student Loan will cover maybe a little less than half, is $16,400 (CAD), my mother is gaining full custody of my daughter because of that wait list for housing, and I don't have a stable enough environment for her right now. I'm working a seasonal job I despise, where I'm written down as full time but not even working enough to meet part time hours, and I've lost all hope. 
I have no one to talk to. 
I'm lost.
