Diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, hate my job, and lack motivationI believe my disease makes me inherently less valuable as a person. I find almost no joy in anything I do anymore. The only thing I somewhat enjoy doing is programming but I'm unable to finish anything due to my lack of motivation.

What do I have to live for?
