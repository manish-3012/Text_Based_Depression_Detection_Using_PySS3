How i'd do it.I think, over a period of time, the only reason I haven't killed myself is fear of the pain involved. I'm Australian, so gun ownership isn't as easy, and by the time i'd have the process of getting a license, and a gun to use on myself, the feelings would have passed.

The other day I thought of a bearably painful way to die, and it would be easy to organise. Two bits of hardwood timber around my neck, held together with a C-clamp, and then turn your head, and tighten the clamp to compress the carotid arteries. Do it just below the jawline, and you're not even fucking with your windpipe, which would be the most painful part of hanging (without neck-break). Basically, 10 seconds of discomfort, probably a maximum of 20 seconds of relative pain, then you're gone forever.

Now, i'm not saying i'm going to do it, or even want to do it right now. The problem is, i'm the cerebral type, when I didn't know how much I had to suffer to die, it was alot scarier, now I have some rough idea, it feels like the commitment I would need emotionally just got a lot lower, and, at the same time, the low I would need to be in just got a lot higher.
