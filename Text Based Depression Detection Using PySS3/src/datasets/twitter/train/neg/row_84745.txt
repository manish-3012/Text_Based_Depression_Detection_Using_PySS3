Been thinking about my own value.Some context: I'm as generic as it gets, been through therapy for anxiety and depression, seen doctors for my psychosis, attempted suicide on multiple occasions, and at the end of it, told them I was better, because that's what they want to here. 

For a while, I was better, I stopped panicking so much on a night, dying wasn't on my mind every hour or so, but much less, it seemed like my problems were coming to more of a halt. 

This last week, I've gone back to my old self: held back, tired, no source of happiness, I just feel so drained all the time.

I'm not asking for advice, or for you to acknowledge anything I said, I just needed to open up, I'm too scared to tell family anything, they went through so much the first time round.
