I Want Us to Help Each Other...Hi, everyone. 

I first came to this subreddit 2 days ago, mostly because I have this emptiness that never leaves, and I feel like a complete loser.

I have an amazing wife, which is a blessing, but I have never achieved anything in my life.  I never succeed.

Had a science job but left due to the stress and handling biohazardous chemicals every day.

Now I do data entry for much less money.  We always have financial issues and try to make it each month.  I hate having no purpose, hating each job I take.

I have gotten overweight.  Joined a gym in February, and after lifting and cardio for 4 weeks, lost no weight.  So depressed that I quit.

I see the pain and evil in the world.  Such a corrupt world.

Then reading your posts moved me because I can understand some of the pain.  It eats at me all the time.

Even with these feelings of not wanting to live, I still believe in God, in Jesus Christ.

I want to give some hope to all of us.

I would like to start a Daily Rosary Prayer List.   Anyone can respond to the daily thread, put their name, age, anything,  and I will pray a rosary each night when I get home from work.

I wish I could hug each of you, I know I can't do much, but I want to do something. 

Hang in there everyone- I care about you all!
