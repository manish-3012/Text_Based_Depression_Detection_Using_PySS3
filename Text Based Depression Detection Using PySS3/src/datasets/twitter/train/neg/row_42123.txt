I'm a failure, and suicide is looking like a great way to avoid the shame of it coming outI've just flunked out of community college because I hate busy work and my GPA has been too low for too long. I've been living with my mom and sister for free on the condition that I stay a full time student. I can't bear to tell anyone about my troubles, and I can't afford rent on my meager tour guide wage of $8.40/hr (rent in the area is about $600/month for a single room with utilities included.) I've been looking for a better paying job, but I haven't had a single interview in the 2 years I've been looking. I'm a horrible human being and I can't stand the idea of being looked down on by my family or friends. I'm considering just slitting my wrists somewhere about 50 miles away from home after burning off my fingerprints and without any ID so everyone thinks I just ran away. This is the first time I've mentioned anything about this to anyone. I'm not putting any burden on people here, so if I do end up killing myself, you'll never know as this is a throwaway account.
