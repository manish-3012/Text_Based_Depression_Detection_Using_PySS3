I write my ex poetryBecause she still comes around. Here's the latest, and apologies if it's confusing, its situationally relevant. And cheesy. I'm a fuckin mess.

Halloween and thanksgiving I guess wasn't enough, she had to step on christmas and smash it from above.
 Called at 1am told me to come over and a week later its silent still and sober,
 now it's Christmas eve and im starin at her cat wondering aloud if shes ever coming back, 
her gift is in my car and i left it unwrapped, cause whats the point of giving something to somebody in the past? 
I could wrap it up with paper tie it with a sash, but sadness is the only thing goin in the bag
I talk real tough to no-one and myself but if she ever called me I'd follow her to hell,
Hold her purse and coat while she does a dance with satan she only kisses me to silence what im prayin,
Merry Christmas taylor and happy new years, i hope you find someone to wipe away your tears.
