Why death is so difficultIâ€™m smoking in my room while my parents are sleeping in the other. I cut my legs again. I took some pills again. And again noting will work. Itâ€™s a shame I canâ€™t get a gun in this country. Iâ€™ll have to die painfully and slowly just the way I suffered through my whole life. I understand that Iâ€™m unfixable and broken beyond repair. No one wants a broken toy no matter what pretty lies they tell you. I hate that Iâ€™m  still here. Things changed but i didnâ€™t and i donâ€™t wanna live with myself. The only thing I hate more than this body is whatâ€™s inside it. Iâ€™m completely useless and so helpless Iâ€™m sick of myself and Iâ€™m, as always, ready to end it. Itâ€™s just iâ€™m afraid of pain and I love my parents. I wish they didnâ€™t love me, this whole thing would have ended years ago. Maybe there wouldnâ€™t have been a thing in the first place. I think Iâ€™m doomed. Itâ€™s either a miserable painful life or suicide and neither is particularly great.
