Going back and forth with it in my headI just feel as though at this point I am better off dead. No more lying. No more hurting people. No more cheating. No more hurt.

I may do good things at times, but I feel as though deep down I am just an evil person. 

I just hurt the man I love the most. I had to detach because that's the only way I'll stop hurting him. I watched him sob for hours and hours, so confused. I know someday he'll get it.

So maybe I should just end it all. I just lost my biggest support, my best friend- my boyfriend. He was everything and now I am devoid of who I thought I was for over two years.

I just can't stand myself anymore.
