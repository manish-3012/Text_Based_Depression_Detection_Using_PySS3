What should I do that's productive instead of sitting around slicing my arms/legs open with razor blades?I have no money. I am staying at a friend's place. I have no friends. I have no possibility of future education. I am perpetually tired/depressed. I have no job. I am 18. My family hates me and has disowned me. Christmas is horrible. I don't have any booze/benzos to kill whatever angsty white-liberal pain I have. I tried filling out internet surveys to get money and made about 2 dollars on my paypal before giving up and deciding to place razors against my arms and swipe hard/quick.

So as opposed to watching blood pool around my feet, what should I do? I honestly see no point in living anymore and I of course have felt that way every day for the past 6 months. 

I have no emotional support whatsoever. I can't afford a therapist. My psychiatrist got me off of all of my medication including my ADD meds, and I feel like a confused pile of shit all of the time. Not that it matters, government assistance doesn't cover Vyvanse.

I would smoke a joint right now but if I start with weed, I'll never fucking stop. I'll be buying ounces, pretending to sell them, and sitting in my room smoking all day. And cutting.

While I make a journey to booze up and black out from blood loss, can anyone offer words of insight? Hopeful words?
