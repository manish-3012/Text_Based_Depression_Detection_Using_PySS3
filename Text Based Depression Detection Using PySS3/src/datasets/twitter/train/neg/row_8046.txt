I'm turning into a major failureI'm finally finishing my doctorate degree. I'm in the home stretch, but I don't feel that I can make it. I'm working 6 days a week, my mind is always somewhere else. I have no friends, if I died nobody would care. My house is a wreck. My preceptors are fed up with me for being constantly late. I have nothing to look forward to in life. I'm terrified of letting my parents down, but I'm struggling to keep my head above water. 

I have no interest in participating in corporate society. People are ruthless and cut throat and I'm constantly on edge. I just don't see how I can continue living in such misery. I wish I was a different, more competent person.
