Tired of livingSometimes I wonder what's the point of living anymore, maybe if i killed myself I would be reborn as someone else and start over my life again. I know I royally fucked up this one maybe I can start a new game.

Partly why I think like this is because I know its not gonna get better. I already fucked my life goals and even I achieved them later they wouldn't really be satisfying cause I'm older. Its rather out of desperation than outta passion.
