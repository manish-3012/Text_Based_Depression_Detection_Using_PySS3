I don't know anymorei'm really sorry if i'm just wasting space, again

i normally have thoughts that it'd all be better if i were dead but not this bad and not this long. i'm scared because maybe this time i'll be able to do it. i can't imagine the thought of moving onto college even though it's only months away. i can barely focus on anything and idek why i'm reaching out because it's hopeless anyways but i've always had a naiive side. i'm only alive today because the other time i had the courage and plan to go through with it my mom was home when she wasn't supposed to be. not that she cares, just that she wouldn't let me get to what i need. now i'm just trying to find a couple hours when i'm home alone so i can do it because i'm still able to. i know how to. it's so simple. if anyone really wants to try and battle with my demons with me good luck, but to anyone who may have known me, i'm sorry i failed you. 

sorry for the gibberish, if you wanna reply you can but i get it if you don't. probably have a few weeks before the opportunity comes again. christmas is gonna be hell
