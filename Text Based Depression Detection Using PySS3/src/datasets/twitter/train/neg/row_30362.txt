I canâ€™t. Sorry.Iâ€™m twelve. Everyone thinks that because of my age, I canâ€™t feel suicidal, or Iâ€™m pretending to have these feelings. Iâ€™m not fucking pretending.

I was two months clean from cutting until last night, where I sliced my skin again. Iâ€™m not even ashamed, otherwise I wouldâ€™ve been hanging from the ceiling. Iâ€™ve told my parents about this, but theyâ€™re scared that if I go to the hospital theyâ€™ll drug me up (they refuse to give me meds for depression and anxiety.) I have a shit ton of missing assignments that make me want to skip school every day. I tied a rope to the light hanging from my ceiling last week, but didnâ€™t end up doing it.

I donâ€™t even care if Iâ€™m just a statistic on teen suicide. Itâ€™s better than the shit Iâ€™m feeling right now. Nothingâ€™s worth it. These teachers are breathing down my neck for missing assignments, but they have no idea. People tell me to tell people about this stuff (I even have a therapist) but therapy and talking to my friends doesnâ€™t help. My friends donâ€™t understand, and talk therapy is going nowhere.

I have this crush (thank god i can still feel positive emotions) but Iâ€™m fairly certain he doesnâ€™t like me back, and I feel like shit. Heâ€™s not even a bad guy, itâ€™s just everything around me just propels me into a further state of drowning. No one can tell.

I canâ€™t live anymore.
