I break everything I touch.I never really thought of it until my brother put it into perspective to me.

My brother was going to give me his old laptop and my other brother was like "im telling you right now hes gonna break it, he breaks everything he touches" and thats when it hit me. All the things i've broken. I break everything I touch. I got this ducky mecha mini from my brother. Broke in a week (the usb port inside the keyboard broke). My old laptop, broke. My old tablet, broke. The laptop with all my sisters baby pictures, broke. You know how hard it is to wake up everyday and know you're the reason your sister will never see her baby pictures again?

 But I digress, I'm literally convinced someone has done black magic on me. I don't know why this only happens to me. 

On top of that I'm the only one in my family who sweats uncontrollably especially from my hands and feet. Nobody wants to shake my hand. Nobody wants me to try out their new game.

 Nobody wants me to play with them. My brother got a new vr, he let everyone try it and then when I asked he said no because he didn't feel like it. I know what he meant, he didn't want me to break it.

 I don't know what to do. It feels like my whole world has just come crashing down on me. I have nobody to talk to. My parents are immigrants and are not good at this type of stuff, and I don't got friends. Why am I even here.
