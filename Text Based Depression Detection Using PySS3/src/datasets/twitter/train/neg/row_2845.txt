I've been trying to get help for years. Nothing changes.NHS waiting lists, endless assessments, triggering and unsupportive family. Ex that told me to just stop being weak snd making excuses.

I don't know how much longer I can keep limping on and hoping. I just want it to end. I don't think it's irrational or unreasonable.

I've tried tried as of yet but I just feel like pull this inevitability like it's not in my control and it will happen, it's just when not if.
