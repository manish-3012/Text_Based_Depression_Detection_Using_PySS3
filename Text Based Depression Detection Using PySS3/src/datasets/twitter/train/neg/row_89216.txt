I canâ€™t go on like this anymore.A year ago,  I wanted to die. Now, Iâ€™m just nihilistic and hollow, but I donâ€™t want to die, kind of. I feel like suicide might be the only path for me, though. 

I can never imagine myself living past 18, and Iâ€™m miserable. My parents are good parents, sometimes. They can get so overbearing though, to the point that theyâ€™re like choke weed and Iâ€™m the plant. They constantly block stuff, nag me about getting my work done no matter how depressed I am, most talks are about school and work, and how â€œLife is cumulative, so no matter how far college is from middle school, you need to work hard, and get good grades, and do extracurriculars even though you hate socializing and most people, and become a leader for your college application.â€

They also threaten to call the police whenever I do something serious enough, refuse to give me privacy, and when my dad gets angry enough, he barges up the stairs and into my room, and I have to try and beat him there and then block the door quickly, and he may not hurt me, but it feels like it. 

I know that I have it better than a lot of people, and that they also have a lot of good parts to them, unlike some peopleâ€™s parents, but thereâ€™s so much pressure on me and so little choice, without them getting the police or a mental hospital involved, that I canâ€™t go on like this for a few more years. Talking to them is pointless, because they ignore me and would try to get me out in a mental hospital without listening to my words. Even if I tried to go to a friendâ€™s house, theyâ€™d probably just call the police to bring me back.

I canâ€™t go on living with so much pressure and so little happiness and so much fear. Call me a coward and weak, but I canâ€™t take this anymore.
