I only blame othersThe bullying I received years back has scarred me to this day. I have always wanted my death to make them feel guilty and aware of how much it's affected me up until now, bit  I know they won't care.

On the other hand, my mother, who I know faces her own problems, but is one of the sole reasons for the continuous cycle of my depression and self harm.

And finally my step-father, whose verbal abuse and drunk spells scare me to death.

It seems like I only know how to blame others for my problems, it makes a shit person,  victimizing
