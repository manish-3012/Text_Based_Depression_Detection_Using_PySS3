Best way to leave a note?I am 32.  I'm not sad.  I just hurt a lot.  All the time.  It is not terminal, but it does not appear to be treatable either.

I hope to live with the pain as long as I can be useful, but working is difficult and I am afraid I cannot complete another year like last.  I have lived with this condition for 5 years now.  It only gets worse.

If I do decide it is too hard, I would really like my family to understand that I am not angry or depressed.  It will take them a while to get over their emotions so the message should be delayed.  I want to guarantee they receive the message without letting anyone else know about it.

I will probably need to have redundant servers send a video on a scheduled date to several friends and family.

I understand it may be hurtful to receive such a message, so I will want to make clear that I will not contact them again and it is okay to let go.  I have money I can leave, so they might be less angry with me.

I am married, and I worry about her most of all.  We have always been friends, but I do not believe she loves me.  Until I became sick, I was her security.  I was strong, smart, and quite successful for my age.  I've held on until she finished school and built a career.  Now, I think she will be okay.

I want her to find someone she loves so she can raise children as she always wanted.  She cares about me of course, but I can tell it hurts her to give up her plans and support someone while she is still so young.  She would do it.  She would stay with me forever if I never left, completely loyal but not in love.  She'd give up on romance and sex and family and children... she can even have a real wedding this time.

A note for her will be hard.  I want to tell her I need her to be strong and think about herself.  She needs to be independent.   She needs to understand I was happy and she did nothing wrong, but it just wasn't a situation I could put her through.
