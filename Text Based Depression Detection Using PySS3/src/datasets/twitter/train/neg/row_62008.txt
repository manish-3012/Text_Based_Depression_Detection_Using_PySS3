Looking through old photos...I had to look through photo albums my parent's had for a work project and I feel like driving off a cliff now. I could see myself going from a happy kid to looking miserable starting around 12. I wish I could go back to that and not now want to kill myself even more. This is why I hate looking at pictures. Extra reminder of how far I've fallen.
