I don't know what to doI've posted on here a few times recently, and I swear I'm not just fishing for sympathy, but I just recorded [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpygEHX-s2o&amp;) video and tried watching it back and couldn't even sit through it. I wasn't even going to upload it, but decided to for the sake of making this post.

A week from today I'll be 24 and I still will have never slept with a girl. I've been paid by guys (well -- a guy) in drugs/money to be used for a night.. I think I posted on here after that...

I don't want to die yet but I'm really scared

Edit: I think I have some serious anger issues.
