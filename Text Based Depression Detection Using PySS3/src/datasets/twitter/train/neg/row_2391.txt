Wanting to kill myself soonI don't know if I'll have the courage to do it and I'm scared. I don't have many friends and I'm not close to the ones I do. I don't feel like anyone cares about me that much. I hate how everyone around me is happy. The only person who I can talk to who knows how I feel lives tens of thousands of kilometers away. I'm gonna try to talk to someone but honestly every time I see someone having fun and giving absolutely zero fucks about me just makes me want to kill myself more.
