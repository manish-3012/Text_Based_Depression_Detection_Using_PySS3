Too Scared To Die But Want ToIâ€™m 18 and my parents are terribly strict. I can go out and see friends maybe once a week but only for a few hours max before they blow up my phone and tell me to come home. They monitor what I spend, so when I opened a separate bank account for myself my mom flipped out and cried and told me sheâ€™s never going to help me financially ever again. Iâ€™m failing my college classes and therefore Iâ€™m going to lose the scholarship I have which is the only reason I can even afford to go to college. My boyfriend and I have been fighting more lately and despite a talk we had last night where we worked things out Iâ€™m still anxious for the future.

It just seems like thereâ€™s no hope. I barely see my friends so theyâ€™re all forgetting about me. My parents are controlling every aspect of my life and I canâ€™t break free. My boyfriend may or may not be a problem, I donâ€™t even know. My only dream in life was to be a programmer and work for Microsoft but how will I do that if iâ€™m failing my programming class and calculus class and am going to lose over $40k total worth of scholarships? If I wasnâ€™t such a pussy I would be gone by now.
