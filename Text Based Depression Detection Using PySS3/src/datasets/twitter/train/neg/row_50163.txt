Nothing left for meCan't find any summer internship offers (most interview offers are given tonight or yesterday night), school is really difficult, too much work every night. This is my junior year of college and without an internship there's no hope of getting a full time job in my field. I'm super introverted and get really anxious when talking to people. I'm always disappointing my parents and screwing up and I can't seem to do anything right. My colleagues are telling me it will be fine and everything will work out but I know it won't. They're the ones who have nothing to worry about because they have 10 interviews lined up over the next few days while I don't have a single one. I haven't been able to make many friends in my major because they all understand everything so well and can succeed while I never do. I know I would never fit in with them, especially in a major and university that are highly prestigious.

I'm eating my favorite potato chips to try to cheer me up but they don't taste like anything. When the time comes I want it to look like an accident or someone else's work so my parents don't freak out on me if it doesn't succeed. I'm crying so much I might just choke on a chip and go out that way. No one lives with me so it wouldn't look too suspicious that no one was able/willing to help me.
