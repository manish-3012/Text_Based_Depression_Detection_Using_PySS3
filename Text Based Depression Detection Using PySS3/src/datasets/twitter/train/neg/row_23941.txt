Drinking makes me happy.I'm just back to default. For me, that means that my wish to die is greater than breathing, but I don't have the balls to kill myself. I've been in some relationship trouble for a while now, and the relationship with the girl who I thought was my soulmate and partner for life doesn't seem as likely now. How do you keep going after losing your only reason to live?
