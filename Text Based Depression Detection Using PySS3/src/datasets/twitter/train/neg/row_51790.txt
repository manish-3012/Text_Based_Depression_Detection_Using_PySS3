I'm a burdon to everyone in my life.I tried to make my ex (boyfriend of 4 years) understand that I know he was fucking around on me while we were dating and severely depressed and didn't have to keep turning the story around in me. Instead being mature all he said was "mhm" and tried to change the subject on me while making me feel like shit. He made me realize how if I disappeared, it wouldn't phase anyone. I guess I should go ahead and go with my original plan of ending my life if it didn't cause anyone's pain if I ended my own suffering...
