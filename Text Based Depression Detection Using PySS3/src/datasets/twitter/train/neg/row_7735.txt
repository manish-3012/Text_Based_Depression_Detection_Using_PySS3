I can't do this any moreThe only hospital in my area with beds is a run down Catholic hospital. Last time I was there they put me in dual diagnosis for depression and cannabis use, and if you think you're going to find some reason to live watching a bunch of religious crack pots pretend they know how to handle people with schizophrenia, maybe you need to find some new medication. My life is hell, I have fibromyalgia and was neglected as a child. I have been on every antidepressant, except for irreversible MAOIs and ketamine, neither of which are available to me. I can't work do to pain but they keep denying me unemployment or disability. I have no family or friends in this are. I have no idea how to connect with people and quiet frankly, after attending DBT and CBT groups, I am absolutely terrified by people, or at least the only people who seem to want to spend time with me want to use me for money, food, rides or sex. I do not know how to connect with people and multiple therapist have been all but helpful at fixing the problem. I can tell them how my mother abused me until the cows come home but they. ever seem to give me anything to work with other than deep breathing exercises or telling me to slow down and calm my mind. Over thinking is not my problem, I need a solution. I eat well and exercise and that hasn't helped me make any improvements. I use an SAD light in the winter and take vitamin D. Fuck this world, I know there's something wrong with me but people never tell me directly what it is.
