blueI feel so sad lately. I think I'm not as depressed as the last months for sure but all this chaotic system and all the problems on my family breaks my heart. I feel like I can't take it anymore honestly and dog I'm trying my best to wake up and do positive things but ocd is getting worse cause my depression and yeah, I talk to my therapist but I don't feel like telling her all of this cause every time it's the same: I tell her about my shit brain thinking of suicide and then we work on that and I get better but at this point I feel like I can't take it anymore. idk. I can't sleep well, I see no future or when I see something I imagine all of this pain on loop and I can't. I just want to take off this pain, it's an agony living like this. Im so sorry about the rant but I think you all are wonderful people and why I can't just think that of myself and just be more kind with myself but this sadness seems endless
