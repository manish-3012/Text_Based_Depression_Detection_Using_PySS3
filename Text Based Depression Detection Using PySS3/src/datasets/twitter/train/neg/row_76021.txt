I feel like my time is comingBroke up with gf of 1.5yrs because things felt one-sided, realised it was just me being a fucking idiot and now she's having second thoughts about me (as she should)

Severely underprepared for exams starting in May which (would) determine which uni I get into

I turned 19 last month so no longer get my antidepressants for free, also keep forgetting to take them

Can't book a face-to-face doctor's appointment due to coronavirus and far too anxious about phone calls to do it that way

Eating like crap because no motivation to cook anything properly

Probably the most intense depression I've ever felt. I literally had to get out of bed just to get my scissors to cut myself to distract from my emotions for a bit.

Am I missing anything from my checklist?
