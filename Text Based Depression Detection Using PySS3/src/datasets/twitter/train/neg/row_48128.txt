I honestly wish I was deadI can't handle living anymore. I am so sick of my absolutely awful parents who only care about themselves. Why they decided to have kids is beyond me. Every time I ask anything they could not be more disinterested. They always scream at me to "go away!" I hate these people so much. I feel so trapped. I also have been dealing with some health issues that have been made more miserable than I thought possible. And with all of this, I have an absolute ton of work I have to do daily that I just don't want to deal with. I feel so lonely; I have absolutely no one to talk to. I want out of this life. I don't see a point in living when I'm so unhappy.
