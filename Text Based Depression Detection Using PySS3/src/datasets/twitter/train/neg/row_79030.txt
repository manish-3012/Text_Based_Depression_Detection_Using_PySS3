I don't want to die per se, but I wonder what would happen if I was gone.I want to fix my life. But I wonder if anyone besides my family would care if I was gone. I went to a high school where we had two suicides in one year. 

The first one was a pretty unknown kid and when he died, no one really seemed to care. The second one was a popular kid who played on the basketball team. People were so distraught over his death that his friends and family started an organization to help fight suicide.

If I died, would my legacy be more like the first person, or the second person? Who would come to my funeral?
