I am a loser.I find really beautiful, intelligent, well bred, successful, motivated, creative, talented people depressing. An extremely reliable source of misery for me is spending hours online awing at the shiny perfect lives of people who seem to have just been dealt a better hand. I am left in emotional bankruptcy pitying the miserable life I've led. It's just soul crushing and it's hard for me to find happiness in anything.
 I have no motivation. I'm not especially kind. I'm always in a shitty mood. I'm kind of ugly. The only people who would consider me their friend I don't have the motivation to respond to or hang out with. I guess I find everything about society and humanity depressing and go through life just waiting for a ripe misfortune to excuse suicide.

The only thing which gives me any kind of comfort is the beauty and scope of the natural world and physical law. I feel I would miss it.

p.s. for context. I'm a 7th year phd student and think that most second years have accomplished more than me. I am no where near completing my thesis and I dread meeting my advisor, because I never have anything to show him. I haven't talked to him in 4 months and have broken nearly every promise I've ever made to him. I've burnt every bridge academically.
