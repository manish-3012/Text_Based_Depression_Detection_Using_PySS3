I am beginning to rationalize suicide.I know I'm depressed. I've been depressed for over a decade. I'm 26. I have a job in my field, a nice apartment with a nice roommate, people I could probably call friends. I've hit some of the milestones I want to hit. But if this is it, I can't do it. 

My depression has turned from being a constant numb to being...more loopy. Intense periods of almost physical pain where I can't move, I'm curled up in a ball crying. I didn't leave my house one day last week despite having no food because if there was a bridge nearby, I would have jumped off it. I'm irritable very quickly and it's hard to come down from that. I have terrible anxiety too. I was invited to go dancing on Friday with a friend, but knowing I was going to meet some of his friends made me sick with anxiety, which to overcome I psyched myself into this feeling that I can only describe as mania. Fast-talking, super excited but to a fault. It felt like a drug high.

Suicide has become part of my daily thought process. It's not just appearing in moments of extreme depression. I'm beginning to rationalize taking my own life, that the world without me won't matter. I can't continue living in extreme hatred of myself. there's a few people who would miss me but I can't go on feeling this way. Medication hasn't worked before. It takes too long. 

I did my social work placement on a mental health team that often included visits to the hospital's inpatient mental health ward. I've sat in on and participated in case conferences. I can't go through the medical system being talked about like that. I can't rely on friends when I'm in a particularly bad spout. I can't be that depressed friend again. I can talk about it openly when I'm in a stable mood but that's it.

I'm beginning to convince myself that suicide is a rational option that I can do silently without a big hurrah - no subway jumping, no bridges. I can disappear without a trace.
