Trapped. No hope.Life will never get better. Never see my kids working 60+ hours / week.wife hates me - Iâ€™ve been sleeping on the floor of the closet for 2 years. Hate my job - boring busy work. No friends - Iâ€™m always working so no time. Can never retire - have to service student loan debt for myself and bitchy step-daughter. Want to go to sleep forever but miss my kids. I think thats the only reason Iâ€™m still alive.
