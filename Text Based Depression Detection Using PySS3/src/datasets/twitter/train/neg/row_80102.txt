Why live?I'm 17 years old, parents getting divorce, girl I love doesn't want to get in a relationship with me, Failed suicide 2 years ago, grades dropping, missing to much school. Thinking about downing some painkillers I found in my parents medicine cabinet.

EDIT: I'm going through with it before my parents get home in an hour, thanks for everything SuicideWatch.
