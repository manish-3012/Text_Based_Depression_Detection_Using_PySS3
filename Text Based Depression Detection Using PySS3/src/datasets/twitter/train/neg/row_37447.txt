There's no reason for me to stay aliveSeriously. What use is it? What the fuck is the point if I'm just not happy with the way life is? What if I just can't bring myself to actually like doing things? What's the point? There never will be a point. I fucking hate everything about life. I don't want to die, but I don't want to participate in this life anymore. And it's not because of how my life is, but how life in general is. It's all work work work and coping with awful shit and competing against everyone else. It's all bullshit. I repeat, it is all bullshit. I'll say it again. This is all bullshit. Even living for myself is bullshit. I don't want anything enough to do anything to attain it, besides survival and not dying in the cold or by hunger. If it doesn't have to do with my most basic needs, I just don't give a shit. It's not my fault. It's painful to exist. I don't want to die. I really don't want to die. But I hate my mortal existence. Nothing about it could possibly overshadow the cold realities of life. Everything about life I hate. I hate the process of living life. Doing things you don't want to do, having to plan and think ahead, never knowing when shit is going to end and other shit is going to begin, etc. it's all just meaningless bullshit. I can't bring meaning to my own life. I just don't see the fucking point, and I really, really don't want the "point" of my existence to have to be other people, even though it inevitably will, because I guess I can't bring myself to be morally depraved enough not to help take care of my family in some way, despite the fact that I cannot help but see them generally as burdens in my life, except for a few. I just wish I could bring myself to up and leave, but I'd probably just kill myself after that. I guess the ease with which I can survive at the present moment is enough to keep me in the house. Lord knows I wouldn't have anywhere to go if I left.
