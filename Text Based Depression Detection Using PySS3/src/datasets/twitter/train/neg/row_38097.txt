Made up my mind. My situation is unfixable and I refuse to live like this.It's just a question how do I kms because I don't live alone.
Why it's so complicated.
I just want a peaceful death.
I don't want to feel terror during my last moments. I am not afraid to die anymore but I want it painless.
Everything is so unfair.
