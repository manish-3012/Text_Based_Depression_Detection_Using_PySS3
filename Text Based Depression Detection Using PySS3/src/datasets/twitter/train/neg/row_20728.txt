talking doesn't help; nothing does.I literally spend my breaks at school either hiding out in toilets, or sprinting around in the school building trying to avoid people, so that nobody finds out that I'm friendless \(I don't even want friends at this point in time\), miserable and terribly anxious. I wish that I could just be locked away alone forever to cry alone, away from human complexities. I start to sweat and stutter when people talk to me, because I'm a weirdo, and I haven't had a substantial conversation with anyone in so long, all the friends I've had somehow find satisfaction in talking about vapid, meaningless things and it's always so draining. I think too much and, because of how much I think, I've been able to realize how much significance is put on so many meaningless, meaningless, meaningless things unnecessarily. I've been able to realize how cruel people can be, how easily impressionable they can be and how disloyal they can be.

Maybe I'm too detached from society and reality to even understand why people are like this.

And, after I come home from a hellish day at school, I go home and I'm tormented by my siblings because of my weakness as the second youngest child. They always enforce their physical strength over me, I'm afraid to step out of line because they could hit me, and I could do nothing back \(this doesn't happen often, I am just threatened usually\). I get embarrassed and ridiculed. The only place I can truly call home is my bed at 2:00am, or talking to my mum and little brother. My life is just a continuous cycle of torture, my only escapes are movies, music, math and drawing, but I've lost that enjoyment, too.

More recently, I've been looking into genocides, slavery, etc and have come to realize that this world cannot be redeemed.
