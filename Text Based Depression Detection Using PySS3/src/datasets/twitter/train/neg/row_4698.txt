X-post from r/foreveralone. Do your best to push me over the edge. It's too painful to continue to hold onto hope.I'm 25. I actually look like a thin version of butthurt dweller with less acne and no ponytail. People say I have things going for me, I can lead a successfull life and that I am awesome. Ironic that the people who say these things don't want to be my friend. I'm tired of people lying to me to make me feel better. Just give me a bag of weed and a roof to jump off of. Yes I see a therapist twice a week and am on meds.
