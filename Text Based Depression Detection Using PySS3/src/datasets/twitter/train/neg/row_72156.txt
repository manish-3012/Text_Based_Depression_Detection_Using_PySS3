World is going to hell. No friends, never had a relationship. What is the point?I have tried everything. Therapist can only give me 2 hours of stroking my ego before I inevitably feel bad again. I live in the Netherlands as an expat, still don't know Dutch and with the rise of the far right I might be kicked out (I keep getting reassurances that as an Southern European engineer I won't be targeted but there are no guarantees). I can't go back home and have to deal with my borderline abusive parents who spent every waking hour criticizing everything I do. I am 29, have no friends, never had a girlfriend. Every day I look at climate change news that make it seem inevitable that the planet is going into destruction overdrive faster than we can imagine.
I have nothing. What is the point in going on. I have gotten "advice" like "We need people like you to keep fighting the good fight!" Why do I need to fight if no one cares about me. "Just keep going until you die!" Why? Why must I keep playing a game I already lost. I am so sick of everything. Even if a God exists, which I doubt, he would have to be horrifically cruel to let the world come to this. I don't want to witness the end of the world. Only thing keeping me here is not wanting to cause pain to my parents (even though they don't deserve this) and my acquaintances but it's getting harder and harder to justify that. People don't give a shit about me and only react if I start hinting I might do something stupid. And once I don't it's right back to silence and exclusion. Why do I need to stay. Why?
