"accidental attempts?"I'm worried.. I've been extremely hopeless lately and have found myself making more and more mistakes in the dosing of my medications. the most troubling is my insulin.. waking up in the middle of the night with a blood sugar level in the low 50s .. and realizing i must have double dosed.

A few times I've seriously pondered just how many units would put me to sleep.. for good.    Am I suicidal? or just careless and incompetent?
I don't think I want to die, but i don't like what my life has become or where it is going.
