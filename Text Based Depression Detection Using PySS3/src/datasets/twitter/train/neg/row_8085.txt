How To Live With MyselfI am currently 20 years old. When I was 18 I got drunk with one of my best friends who was a girl and we had sex. She said that I assaulted her and that she didnâ€™t want to have sex. I believe her and I donâ€™t think she would make that up about me as we were so close. I just canâ€™t get over the fact that I hurt someone so much that I cared about so much. Iâ€™ve always held the opinion that rape is one of the worst crimes you can commit and I just feel like I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. I just want those thoughts to end and I feel like suicide is essentially my only option because I will never not be a rapist now.
