feeling lost amd confused.So this is going to be a bit of an essay so forgive me. 

Yesterday I had a fight with my boyfriend and it started over something small. I had called him a weirdo as a joke and he got offended and said he didn't want to be with me coz I am a mean person. I honestly didn't mean it in a vindictive way but I understand why he was hurt. 

He told me that he was settling in the relationship and that he checked out other girls all the time coz he finds me so unattravtive. I know I'm not the hottest girl on the planet but I also don't think I'm as hideous as he makes me out to be. I know I could do with losing some weight but he honestly  makes me feel like I'm worthless 

Anyway what he said was the tipping point for me last night. I've been super stressed with uni and work as well as feeling low so it just triggered these suicidal thoughts. 

This morning he told me he would be with me if I got out of debt and also lost weight. I acknowledge I do need to be a lot healthier and stop spending as much as I do. I guess food and shopping is my coping mechanism for how I'm feeling. 

I am greatful he is taking me back as I know he is out my league both with his personality and looks. However his ultimatums have also left me feeling a bit isolated with my problems. I don't even think I  could tell him this without him getting angry or breaking up with me. I feel I'm alone in dealing with all this
. I'm  just so confused as to if I'm.wrong to feel.this way and I'm being a big baby about it all. Some advice would be appreciated my fellow Redditors.
