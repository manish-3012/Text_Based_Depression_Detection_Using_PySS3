Happy Suicide?I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, but I honestly have no idea. I have a pretty good life, and I'd say I'm happy the majority of my time. I'm a happy person with a happy life, or so I thought... Especially the last 2 weeks, I've been thinking of just ending it, and I'm feeling more confused by the day.

When I'm busy and actively doing stuff, I'm fine, but it seems the moment I have free time, something just clicks. I feel lonely, sad, uninspired and overall depressed.

Any suggestions to get back into life/advice? I know talking to people is often the obvious solution, but I've always been really against trusting people, and I am very stubborn at being an individual.
