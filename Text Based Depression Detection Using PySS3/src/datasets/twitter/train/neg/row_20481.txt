I will be shooting myself in a few hours.It's almost November 14th, which finally means it's almost time for me to die. I truly gave myself too much time since starting posting here (June of this year) to be successful, of course I failed. I have absolutely failed everything you can fail at in life, and that's why my parents hate me, that's why my family left/died, that's why I have no friends. I dreamt of a fantasy lift that only a few actually live, knowing I'd never reach this way of life. Was suicide needed in my situation? Absolutely. I should have never been born, and I wasn't even supposed to be, yet here I am - someone with many illnesses, who has lived a life of nothingness for too long. Everything is gone now, though. My belongings, my money, my dreams, and soon my life. Someone will be having a huge celebration tomorrow, with friends, family, and a bunch of gifts, while I lay in my room with a bullet hole to the skull. Someone will live the life I wanted to live, well after I am gone. I hope no one finds me, I hope I stay in my room rotting. I really do. 

I just can't believe I've made it this far, and most shockingly, I can't believe I'm so excited to die. Oh well.
