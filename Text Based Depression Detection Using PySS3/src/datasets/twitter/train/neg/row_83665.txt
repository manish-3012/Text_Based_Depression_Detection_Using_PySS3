Here goes nothingI was arrested for drunk driving as a college sophomore first offender of anything, never had a speeding ticket, hell Ive never even had a parking ticket but when I was convicted they threw the whole book at me. My lawyer was shit and my parents were beyond pissed at me. fast forward to last week, after class I came home to a letter from court saying I violated probation because I had blown into the breathalyzer in my vehicle after using mouth wash (which I didn't know had 21% alcohol in it) and it gave a positive reading. I've tried to explain it to my case manager and my parents but neither believe me, they think I'm lying and now I have to go to court in 11 days. I never had any forms of depression or any thoughts of suicide until after I was arrested. it seems that since that day my life has went down the drain. my thoughts of suicide started around Christmas time but they began as thoughts such as "if things don't get better maybe you should try it" and progressed to the most recent thought I had today which was "its an option that keeps looking better and better". I am not the type to go to prison and there's a solid chance that come next Monday I will spend a few months in prison so I've made up a plan on how it will all go down and I think I have a method that is discreet and won't leave much of a mess behind. before I ever began having thoughts of suicide I was one of those people that viewed it as a selfish act, however, I don't have that view point anymore, rather, I look at it as a way to go to sleep and not have to deal with the messed up reality that is my life. at this point I feel like If I have the power to ruin my life by a bad decision, then I have the power to stop myself from ever having to live in the hell I created for myself.
