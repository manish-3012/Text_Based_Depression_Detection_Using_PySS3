What comes after is what really scares meDying not at all I can handle pain and I'm quite close with fear already, this reality is cursed for suffering and I'd leave if I knew I wouldn't go to hell or some suffering afterlife because any God may actually be real and I find out too late, ignorance is no longer bliss.
