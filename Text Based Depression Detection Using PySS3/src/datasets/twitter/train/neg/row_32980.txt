Therapy.I thought about going back and making steady appointments like I used to because it helped a lot for me to have someone to talk to but my last therapist found a new job and I have this weird paranoia that she found a new job because of me and everything thatâ€™s wrong with me she couldnâ€™t handle. I feel myself slowly detaching from ppl in order to not get hurt and itâ€™s lonely and scary but itâ€™s the only way I know how to protect myself from any further pain is by shutting ppl out. Most ppl leave anyway.
