I'm not sure of myselfHey guys,

So I have been suffering from depression since the fourth of July (the irony).

I met up with a friend and we got into a random conversation and eventually, my depression randomly kicked in and I started crying because there was so much shit going on in my life.

I started talking about how the people were treating me like a pos. Then somehow (don't remember) it ended up in some psychology session. OP thinks I'm a little too open about my personal life to people that I make 'friends' with, which is why I'm having issues finding close friends or even having a relationship. OP also says that I shouldn't be too dependent on people for companionship and that people get scared off when you tend to spill things about your personal life.

I feel like my self-esteem has fallen apart. I don't know how I should act, feel, or do when I'm around people. I feel like because of the way I was acting, nobody wanted to be friends with me. I'm already in a shitty position with my depression, but when that came out of OPs mouth, everything officially fell apart. I can't stop crying rn. I feel like this downward spiral is never going to end.
