I honestly don't know what to do anymore.I'm in the school's ISS room as we speak, I'm in 7th grade. I got caught ditching school once and my mom got super dissapointed (obviously). today, one day after my suspension, my stupid ass decided to ditch one specific class, and I hid in a place that certain students aren't allowed in, and I got caught. I damaged my mother's trust and probably the trust of many others but I dont want to hear about it right now. It would just make me feel more guilty. And, yes, I know i brought this upon myself. The administration said I'm probably going to get expelled so i probably just threw away my whole future.
