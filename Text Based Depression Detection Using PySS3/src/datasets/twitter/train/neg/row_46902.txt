I've had thoughts before, how can I stop them?I am extremely low on self esteem and that has caused me breakdowns and suicidal thoughts the past few weeks. I won't commit I'm sure but does anyone have any kind of 'mantra' to get them out of a rut? My friends help a lot but I also want to help myself.
