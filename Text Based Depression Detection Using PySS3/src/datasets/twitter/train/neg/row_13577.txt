unappreciated work, sacrifice, deathi work on two programs.  im moving offices to work on program a.  program b starts getting more and more passive aggressive, and one person was really openly nasty to me in a meeting.

i had a private conversation later and it was mentioned that "it wasn't apparent" that i had sacrificed a lot to be here.  my 5 year anniversary is in 3 weeks.  Also something about how "its one thing if one person thinks you're an asshole but if everyone does then you probably are" -- im not sure if that was meant for me or the aggressor.

we talked for a while, but it changed my entire perspective on my job.  now all these passive aggressive statements i ignored in the past are apparent and galling.

the quips i brushed off or wrote up as "ball busting" now just seem like vinegar in the wound.

i have pack all of my stuff next week to move, for a job i might not want anymore.

this was my only connection to reality; i have no other reasons to live.  it made my job more important to me.  i really want and hope that this is the end, but im also sad that nothing ever works out.
