I'll never be normal. I'll NEVER fucking do things right.II'm fucking exhausted from trying. Obviously I'm a defective human being. I have been fighting this for YEARS and I'm fucking tired of the fact that no one will admit to how fucked things were, because they were all there but never listened to me; they didn't pay attention. No wonder I was so fucking skinny. I was never fed. I was in disbelief when someone told me I was being neglected. I loved my mom? She loved me...? But when I finally accepted that "diagnosis" EVERYTHING started to make sense. Who the fuck doesn't pay attention to their 13/14 year old daughter when they know that other men are around, while everyone is drinking, smoking pot, and doing meth..!? SO MY WHOLE REASON FOR POSTING I bought a 600 ct bottle of diphenhydramine (aka benedryl) and I've already drank all the alcohol I had but in 1 hour it will be time enough to purchase alcohol again. I literally see no future for myself. I'm such a stupid piece of shit I can't accomplish ANYTHING, everyone is TIRED OF ME, and having bpd (borderline) makes everything worse WHY CAN'T I BE AT LEAST 20% NORMAL??!! A N Y W A Y S I just want to lie in a pool of my own blood. How much benedryl do you take to overdose??
