I feel like I was born the wrong genderI've always felt like I was born the wrong gender. Those feelings have just been there. I just can't go through the whole transition phase because I don't feel like I will look like a cis woman, and I feel like it would ruin my family. :/ Besides, I'm 17 so I should have started transitioning a long time ago. Now I feel like suicide is the only solution, because I'll never be who I want to be anyway and I don't want to destroy my family and friends memory of me.
