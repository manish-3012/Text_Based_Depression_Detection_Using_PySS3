I'm becoming meltedI'm getting stupider and caring less how that feels, I can tell my mind is less sharp and I remember less. I feel sick, the more I learn the less I know. I'm so like everyone else, I can't stand it and it's not because everyone sucks but because I'm losing whatever it is that makes me able to see people from outside of the world. You know, it's a privileged position but I feel that I'm being sucked into normalcy by ad campaigns and media and pressure from the world and I fear I might become a machine soon no more capable of having an original thought than your average copier.  


In addition to this I'm also a malfunctioning machine, my wants and desires are geared towards being normal but my body doesn't react that way, it's broken. I can't play any instrument, and anyone capable of reading between the lines must know I mean any kind, in any sense. It's not just about musical instruments, I can't draw like I used to or write as I once did. My mind doesn't click into things, I suffer from aging and dulling.   


But I've done nothing, I've created nothing good enough. I was never much beyond mediocre, and I want to die because that's how I feel.
