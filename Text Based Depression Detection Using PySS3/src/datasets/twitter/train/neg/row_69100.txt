Going downhillMy life has gone from being, hopeful to not giving a fuck! Im 30 years old, single,  in debt, all alone, and hate myself.  What is the point of going on through life?  All my friends are married and have a family of their own and im the 30 year old that had only one girlfriend my whole life, but it of course it only lasted 3 or 4 months. Every time, when I was getting close to a girl and the date we went on was great, she will tell me , oh im not interested anymore, or that you are not my type. Lately I just feel like going away for good and never come back. Ive been a BURDEN to my family long enough. 

Any suggestions?
