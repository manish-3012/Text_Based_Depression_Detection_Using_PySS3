I'm going to do it soonI just don't know what to do anymore. I can't hold down even a call centre job because it causes me to have extreme panic attacks and I have no future career prospects. My family see me as a failure and a disappointment and I lie to them constantly so I don't burden them with my problems. I just don't have a way out anymore and I know they're going to think I'm so selfish for killing myself but I really have no way out anymore. They go away at the end of this week and I'm going to do it then so nobody's here to stop me.
