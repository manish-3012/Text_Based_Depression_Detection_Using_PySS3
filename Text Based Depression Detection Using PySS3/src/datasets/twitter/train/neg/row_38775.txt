I'm 13 and I've wanted to die since I was 11Being alive fucking hurts. It's Christmas. That's the worst part of the year. It hurts so fucking much to see people happy and having fun.

What do I even have to complain about? My family's relatively good, I don't have friends but in the grand scheme of things that's not so bad... I feel so guilty for being depressed, especially since my mom keeps telling me about kids starving in Africa.

I've been wanting to do this since I was 11. Tried a few times. Started cutting myself too, but I've stopped, and I feel like I need something to fill that gap. Like nonexistence. I'm so sick of being alive when I never asked for it. I know how edgy and teenage that sounds. I'm just sick of everything.
