Hello, would enjoy a conversation, I'm teared up typing this.My best friend shot himself in 2006.  I still can't go a day without thinking about him.  His parents were more "parental" than my own while he was alive. I'm so pathetic about the situation that I can't even hear about my friend or his family in casual conversation without it  affecting my depressive/ self destructive tendencies. If I happen to run into  his sister, mother, father, or even a mutual close friend, my sadness resurfaces and dominates my life for several days before I'm "well" again.

The tight group of friends we all shared were strangely "suicidal."  Somehow I feel I owe my life to him, yet I still have my moments of wanting to die.

Edit:

thanks for some of the insight, going to delete this but don't think I don't appreciate the comments.
