I'm not seeing the purpose.I graduated in May. I've applied to over 100 jobs with no strong leads. I'm afraid I may have to get a job in what I trained for the last two years, which I've pretty much decided I hate. With a college degree, I hoped I could find a different type of work, but it isn't looking that way. Now, it may even be hard for me to pass the exam for what I have trained in, because I haven't been able to force myself to study for the exam for a couple of months.

My parents give me mixed signals. I was told they want me to move out, but then they also tell me not to look for jobs out of the area, because they think I will only be able to save any money if I stay with them.

Also, I still have chronic pain which can get severe daily for anywhere from a couple of hours to a bunch of hours. It's been over 2 years of that. I also have social anxiety and depression (which is probably a byproduct of the social anxiety and pain).

I've been seeking treatment for the pain and the depression and have tried different medications.

My dream is to be self-sufficient and build my own house, but I'm not sure that reaching that goal is worth all the time and pain it will take to get there.
