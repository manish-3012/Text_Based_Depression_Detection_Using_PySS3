ultimately, it'll either be suicide or jail for me.hard to face the reality of my life, but those are the only two options for me at this point. did something in the past... something bad... it'll come back for me... not sure when, but it will. so these are my only two options. to everyone else who's dealing with this hard life, take solace in the fact that you're not me. that's all i can say. if you can... live life... enjoy it... savor it... be happy if you can. that's all.

i suppose i should ask for some advice. if these were your only options, existentially, what would you do in the meantime?
