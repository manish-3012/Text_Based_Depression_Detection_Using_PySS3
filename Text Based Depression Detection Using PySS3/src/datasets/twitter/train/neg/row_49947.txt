I'd rather be dead than to feel the way I do. It's all over and I can't do anything about it. Title is self explanatory. 
I've had Suicidal thoughts for years, most of my life, and I just really want to get it over with. I'm tired of this place, these people, pretending. 
I just want to not have to have these thoughts anymore. Never again. 
I can't do anything to get It back. It's gone. Fucking Christ its really gone.
