someone to talk?Its been a while since I had this strange and distant feeling towards life. But the events of the last like six months lead me more and more into suicide. Ive been there before, thought about alot in my youth, but this time it isnt about attention. I mean i guess it was at the beginning, but I stopped talking about it and now the feeling intensifies ... I feel left alone, but I left everbody, I feel angry and sad about me ... I stopped working out, let myself go, drink smoke ... i know lift your head up, but I cant because everytime I think its okay now something happens and most likely im the one who fucked up ... that makes me tired ... What should I do? Clearly im not in the shape to decide myself ... its so hard to admit that I made myself my biggest struggle and I only can think of this one way out
