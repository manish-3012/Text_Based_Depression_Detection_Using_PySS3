I need some feedback on a situationI once told a close friend I would kill myself if I had to go back home. When she dropped me off at a friend's empty house, my sister drove up and they took me home. She had secretly arranged an intervention. I had to stay home at that point. I'm still extremely angry about the whole situation. If someone told me they would kill themselves if they went home, I'd do everything to help that DIDN'T involve them going home if I could. I know I'm being unreasonable, but the whole situation makes me so upset that I wish I had just killed myself before telling her. Now, I wait for people to betray me and push them away because I feel I can't trust them. My relationship with my family is not better and nothing even came off the intervention. They expected be to be grateful and even said as much. And when I told her my real feelings on it all, she showed the other participants and they pretty much told me I was horrible for making her cry, when I was suicidal. 

I think about this all the time and I hate them so much when I think of it and it's the first thing I think of when I want to kill myself. I think "look what happened when you told someone last time. It's not worth it. Just kill yourself this time."
