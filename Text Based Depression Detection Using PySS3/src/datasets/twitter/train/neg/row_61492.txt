Cant forgive myself for something heinous I did as a teenager, i cant stop thinking about how bad and awful I amI donâ€™t know how to start this or even where to start. I have been really struggling these past few weeks. At the moment it feels as if my life is more difficult times than anything and I donâ€™t know what to do.

My brain keeps fixating on an event from my late teen years I think 17/19 and Iâ€™m worried what it means about me and my life and whether or not i'm worthy to be alive. In a moment of stupidity I encouraged the family dog to lick me down there, it didnâ€™t last long a couple of seconds maybe I donâ€™t know , but the fact I was capable of doing that of thinking for a split second thatâ€™s that was ok or even an option mortifies me. I am terrified it makes me a monster akin to people who abuse and molest and take advantage of the weak and innocent , it makes me feel as though I donâ€™t deserve to live and suicide constantly rattled around my head as my only release.

I hate that I ruined my life story. That I can never look back fondly on my past self because she was capable of this thing that mortifies me. I wish with all my being I could take it back I really do. I worry that Iâ€™ll never find love because I feel I donâ€™t deserve it and I worry I will never be able to enjoy sex because any time I do anything enjoyable that is related to sex by myself or with a partner I am reminded of my worst action it plays constantly in my head and ruins everything.

I feel so guilty and ashamed. I just want to stop thinking about it and end it all. I need to know how horrible I am compared to the rest of humanity. I want to know how horrible, awful or disgusting what I did was. I just feel trapped in a horror story of my own making . Every second it feels like my skin is on fire and I just want to die. I don't know how to go on living, knowing i'm a monster. I can't believe i did this, i just dont want to to beleive i did this
