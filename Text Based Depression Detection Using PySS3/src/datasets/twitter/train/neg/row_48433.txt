I don't want to do this anymoreI am so many medicines and yet I feel this shit. Psychiatrist? Done. Regular therapy? Done. Regular medicines? Done. Getting better? Nope. 
It's been years, and I'm just 20. 4 years of clinical depression and anxiety. Then drugged and raped 400 kilometres away from home by a friend. Add PTSD to the mix, more drugs. More than two years of that. 
I have loved ones, I have people who help and I have been trying. I just don't have the energy to go on, it just doesn't seem worth it. 
The funniest part is I know how incredibly ridiculous this is, I'm a psychology student. Two years of biotechnology, raped by a friend, everyone abandoned me, dropped out of college. Six month break, cracked tough exams and got into the best University for Psychology in the country. Doing well there, marks, friends, competitions, actually learning.
Still doesn't feel worth it, I don't want to feel this. I want to die, I really want to kill myself. I don't know what to do. Talking about this just gets me explanations and justifications and rationale and logic on getting better and tips and tasks. I don't want this anymore.
