The greatest illusion of life: hopeIâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m so sorry Iâ€™m the way I am. You donâ€™t know how much you mean to me and I know itâ€™s pathetic. You keep me sane, wanted, heard, but above all you listened to me. 

For my whole life Iâ€™ve kept everything inside me because I had no one to express to. But for some reason I trusted you and confessed my entire life to you. All the shit moments, all the times Iâ€™ve broken down and cried. You listened to all of them. You listened when no one would.  You donâ€™t know how much you mean to me.

You said youâ€™re as fucked in the head as I am.  When we were still talking we built ourselves up. Not by saying everything is going to be okay but just by listening. Listening as word after word come out, years worth of pain and hopelessness. I was feeling hopeful, maybe something more. You listened when no one would, but you donâ€™t know how much you mean to me.

Now you hate me. Ignoring me. Because Iâ€™m more fucked in the head than you are I guess. I always believed I would know when Iâ€™m losing my mind, when Iâ€™m going insane, so that maybe I can stop myself from doing dumb shit. But I realized staying insane is comforting, losing my mind is relieving. Losing you is losing myself also. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I have no one to tell how shit my day went and try to make each other forget about it. You donâ€™t know how much you mean to me.

The one thing I ask for you is to remember me at least. The little time we had together. At least I was apart of your life. Thatâ€™s all that matters. Give coco my regards.

Iâ€™m sorry I wasnâ€™t strong enough. Iâ€™m losing my mind and myself. I just wanted someone to listen then being the one to listen to others. Someone please save me. I just need hope again.
