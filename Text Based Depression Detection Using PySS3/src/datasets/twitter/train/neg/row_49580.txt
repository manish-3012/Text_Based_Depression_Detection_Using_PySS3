Want to die but don't want to kill myself.I feel like a useless hopeless piece of shit failure. Im not doing good enough in school that my parents are paying for. I feel if i drop out of college everyone will look down on me and my parents. I feel like i'm a waste of money and time. I just want to die but i dont want to kill myself. I don't want to hurt my mom or my dad or my brother by killing myself. I wish I could just die in a car accident or something.
