Never thought Iâ€™d be making one of these postsI know Iâ€™m not alone. I know it supposedly gets better if I can hold on. But itâ€™s just so fucking hard. Iâ€™ve always been the fixer for everyone in my life, but now Iâ€™m realizing I just donâ€™t have anyone to turn to. Iâ€™m exhausted. Every day is a new hill to climb. Every day I see everyone else in my life find some sort of happiness. But I canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™m surrounded by people, but Iâ€™ve never felt so alone. Really makes you wonder why even bother going forward. 

I guess Iâ€™m just looking for reasons to live at this point.
