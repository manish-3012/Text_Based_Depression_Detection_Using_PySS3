I keep texting this suicide line because I have NO ONE to talk to when I'm in crisisI'm so depressed and suicidal. 


There's no one in my life I can talk to when I'm in crisis. Can't talk to family, only have a few friends. One gets angry when I talk about my depression, one (I love) but she told me it's hurting her too much to have so many of her friends in depressive crisis and she can't handle the pressure of it. Soooo... not gonna talk to her. It's okay. I understand what she means and I don't blame her. Friends say they'd give everything to help but really, practically, there is a limit. I know what she means, I just wish I could talk to her about this. 


My other friend I just don't feel comfortable talking to about this. 


I don't have a therapist, don't have friends I can talk to, don't have family I'm at all comfortable telling these things to. I'm so alone. No one has any idea what I'm going through, at all. Whenever I'm in crisis I wish I could call someone I know but I can't. (And I don't feel comfortable calling people I don't know, so I don't call the line.) So I always text the 741741 line whenever I feel very suicidal because that's all I have. 


I just wish I had someone I knew who I could talk to. There's no one. They're great but a stranger talking to me on a crisis text line  isn't the same.
