A CRY FOR HELPI haven't attempted anything yet but my mind is flooding with all kinds of thoughts. To put it shortly, I was madly in love with my girlfriends, we were friends for 2 years and then lovers for almost 3. We would constantly fight about who loved who more and we had such a great time together. Then one day two months ago she decided to break up with me out of no where. After that day she gave me the cold shoulder and told me that it wasn't my fault. Everytime I messaged or tried to see her she treated me like I was a stranger. Ever since then I cant get her out of my head, I talked to friends and family, I tried to workout, I tried to occupy my time in any way, but she wouldn't get out of my head. I cant live without her, I did everything to secure our future, by getting a good job and going to college to get promoted at work. I even bought a ring that I was going to propose to her with on her birthday. I know I'll never find anyone like her again and so now all I can think about is driving off a cliff, jumping off a bridge and all kinds of things. I'm spoiled and have to loving parents and great friends but even thier words get lost in my head. I tried everything to get it to stop, I even wrote one of my favorite song artist of all time to see if his response would make me happy. Im so desperate to find a way out, its eating me alive. If I dont end up getting help, my mind will get the best of me.
