i think i might end it tonight.i cant do this anymore, iâ€™m so tired of having to live like this. 

iâ€™ve already tried to kill myself once, but somehow i survived. this time i think Iâ€™ll up the dosage :/ maybe thatâ€™ll workk. 

a friend once told me that if i killed myself, he would end his life too, which has been one of the biggest reasons I havenâ€™t done anything yet. but i guess iâ€™m being selfish today 

iâ€™m sorry.
