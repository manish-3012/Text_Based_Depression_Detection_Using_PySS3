Should I get myself checked in a hospital?Ok- So I am uncertain on whether I should go to the hospital for treatment or not. 
-I do not have a psychologist (it takes a year and a half to get one 
that is covered by governement health plan) I don't have additional insurance.

I often have thoughts of Wishing I was dead- wishing something would kill me, like an illness, or being hit by a car or something similar. This being said: I do not know if this counts as being suicital or not (could someone clarify that for me?)

Current state: I am depressed, and have a difficult time going abouts to everyday tasks- somehow I have managed up until now. I cannot talk to my friends or bf. ( I don't want them to think different of me, and don't want them to think I'm just trying to complain and bring them down)
-have good days and bad days with bf. Somedays are just great, and in love, however this often turns around within a couple hours. 
bad days: we mostly just don't talk a whole lot. adn feel like I'm working towards basicly nothing: we don't live together, don't plan on getting married withing the next few years or kids for that matter (all things I would have wanted)

Work: feel like a faliure (working at a dead-end job- I could have gotten this job without a college degree-which I have)

Money:Not going so good. 


TL;DR - Not doing so well, wondering if I should get myself checked in a hospital.

Reddit: PLEASE HELP!!!

EDIT: I have decided to go to the hospital tomorrow- thanks for your advice- I will update when I get out.
