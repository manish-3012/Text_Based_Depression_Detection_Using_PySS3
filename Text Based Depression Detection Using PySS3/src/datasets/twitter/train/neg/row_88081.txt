College has been the worst experience of my life.I fucking hate it. I don't want to give you all the long pointless details. Im in my 30's and I can see right through this bullshit. Any employer that requires college thats not a fucking doctor or engineer is a fucking goddamn idiot. I'm trying to stay alive and get through this, and this is the final nail in the coffin, failing at college, at learning this pointless fucking shit. 

I hate math, to all you young fucks out there, algebra and calc and trig and whatever are fucking useless. I'm tired of spending a fucking absurd amount of money on tutors to explain it right, when educators can't figure out how to teach it. This is going to keep wearing me down until I kill myself. 

Already suicidal, comes in waves. have another post on it thats the full story. Whatever. I don't want help, I want someone to just shoot me in the fucking head.
