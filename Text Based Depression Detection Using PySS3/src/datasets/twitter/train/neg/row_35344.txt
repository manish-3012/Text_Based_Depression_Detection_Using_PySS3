Need advice for a friend.My friend and I are concerned about a mutual friend. Our friend (we'll call her Monica) is a very anxious, socially awkward, depressed person. Monica has expressed wanting to kill herself very recently (and it's been said more than 1 time). She is very erratic when you talk to her. She can't hold a conversation about 1 topic for more than a few sentences. Her depression and anxiety have reached the level of major concern. She won't take the initiative to get help, so my friend and I are looking for help. How do we get help for Monica? I'm prepared for Monica to be mad at me for it and or lash out, but I don't care. My main concern is getting help. What do we do?
