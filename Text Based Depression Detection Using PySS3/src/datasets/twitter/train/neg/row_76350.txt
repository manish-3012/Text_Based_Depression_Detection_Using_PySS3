I just woke up in the middle of the nightI just woke up in the middle of the night feeling like theres no escape. I want to kill myself. No one likes me, no one cares about me, and i can't think about positive things. Even when good things are happening to me I'm still sad. When looking back, I only think about the negative. I am currently crying and have been for an hour. I am a 14 year old boy with a loving caring family and a nice house in a nice town but feel like I am letting them all down by being sad. I am nice to everyone but no one is nice back. I am going to a private school next year with two of my only friends who luckily only got in and I shouldn't care about anything at my old school anymore because I probably won't see these kids again but I just can't stop thinking about it. I can't escape.
