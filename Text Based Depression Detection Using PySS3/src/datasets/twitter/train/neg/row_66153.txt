Absolutely not helpfulSome of my family members seem to think itâ€™s okay to keep telling me at random occasions that they are so happy that Iâ€™m still here to be able to be at whatever the occasion is. Itâ€™s been over 3 years since the attempt that they know about and Iâ€™m still hearing it. Itâ€™s so frustrating and really doesnâ€™t help me. If I had had my way they wouldnâ€™t have even known about that attempt but I didnâ€™t have a choice in the matter but I havenâ€™t let any of them know about any other attempts or the fact that Iâ€™m still really depressed and have suicidal ideations.

Does anyone else have the same problem? Does it usually help you or make things worse? I donâ€™t want to tell them to stop because Iâ€™d rather just avoid the subject with them but they need to stop. At my younger brotherâ€™s wedding my aunt decided to tell me at the end of the night that it was really nice to finally actually see me happy (I was putting on a good face despite really not wanting to be there) and for me to have been able to make it (tone made it obvious that she didnâ€™t just mean that I was able to get the day off but meant that I have survived) for my brotherâ€™s wedding. I had really not been doing well all day and I swear that comment made everything 10x worse and Iâ€™m so glad I was leaving because I couldnâ€™t hide any of my emotions anymore and I started thinking about trying to kill myself again. 

Any advice would be really appreciated because right now I just try to avoid any of my family and they get mad at me/disappointed with me because of it.
