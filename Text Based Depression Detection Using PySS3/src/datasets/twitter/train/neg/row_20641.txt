Should I just pack up and run awayI donâ€™t have much money atm but Iâ€™m sick of being here. I kind of just want to pack things up and donâ€™t say anything and just go somewhere different. I think thatâ€™s honestly the best option for me to build a better life somewhere else for myself. NYC is too expensive and Iâ€™m sick of new jersey. I have a bachelors degree and Iâ€™m 23 so what do I have to lose.  I guess Id rather sleep in my car in the freezing cold.
