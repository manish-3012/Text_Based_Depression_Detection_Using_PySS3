Life's worth living.Most of my life I have wanted to end it. Probably since I was in my early teens. I'm 35 now,  still looking forward to the day I die.  I've recently found myself wanting to help others though.  I've started some online stuff for the sake of helping my friends in need.  

Every time I see someone kill themselves I get more and more frustrated. I've beat this demon.  I know you can too. Keep being awesome and keep up the good work of keeping this demon locked up. There's some days where the act of not killing yourself is something to be proud of. I fully know what the struggle feels like and I know everyone here can beat it.
