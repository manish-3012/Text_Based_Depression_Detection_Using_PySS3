Anybody out there?I'll start by saying I'm pretty young, (17 years old) and I know a lot of people my age struggle with depression so I know I'm not alone in that respect. It's just I find myself depressed for no reason. I have no trauma or really bad events that I've been through. I'm just simply depressed for no reason. I want to die. I don't know what to do. It feels right. I've felt this way for a while. I recently went to a long term youth behavioral center and it was the worst thing to happen to me. I don't even know if I'm any better then when I went into it. All my brain is saying is it wants me to kill myself when I go off to college. I'm not even sure I want help anymore. I just want to talk to someone anonymously about how I feel. Whether I kill myself or not I guess it doesn't matter. I'd like to chat with someone willing to listen. Just anyone please. I don't know why I want this I just kinda do. I am not going back to a long term center i at least know that.
