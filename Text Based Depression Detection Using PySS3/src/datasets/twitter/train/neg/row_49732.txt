Take from this what you will. (Quote)"Everyone has a talent or some type of gift. Yours could be helping others, but first you need to learn to love yourself, and by doing that helping yourself. Once you are content with yourself then you can realize what you're truly good for." - Caroline May Fortin

So one of 2 people I've ever cared for and one of 2 people who at least pretend to care about me sent me this. She is the nicest smartest person ever. This quote I think single handedly saved my life. This is an original quote by this girl. And try not to stalk her. She doesn't deserve that after all she's done for me.
