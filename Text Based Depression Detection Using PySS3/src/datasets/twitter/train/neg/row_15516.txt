QuestioningDonâ€™t have a plan but definitely feeling down. From the outside, my life looks great. Iâ€™m healthier than Iâ€™ve ever been, engaged to a girl out of my league, and making a difference in the world. I just quit my job to be closer to my fiancÃ©, yeah not a great idea in a global pandemic, and am afraid of how I am going to be able to support both of us moving forward. Iâ€™ve struggled with these kind of thoughts before but never had this much going for me. Really just looking for an outside perspective to see if anyone really cares.
