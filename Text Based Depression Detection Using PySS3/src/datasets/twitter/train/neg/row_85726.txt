Stress is making me (25F) have suicidal thoughts againI have always had periods where I suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts. I even remember being as young as 13 and having suicidal tendencies. I also have periods where I'm relatively fine and can function normally. 

I admit I messed up. Partially because of my depressive state, I neglected going to university and I took too long to finish. I'm 25 and I'm still at uni. (the good news is that it's free in my country, so I don't have to worry about debt) My family is mostly supportive, but I feel deeply ashamed that I'm 25 and still completely dependent on them. I can't find a normal job because it will get in the way of my education. I get so stressed about my situation that I'm in danger of going into a depressive spiral again, something that might make things worse. Another things that's making me stressed is that my romantic life is messed up. I don't want to get into detail, but I'm in love with someone and he seems to be in love with me, but we can't be together for many reasons. I don't know what to do. The stress and depression are paralyzing me and I don't want to go into therapy because that will just be one extra economic burden on my parents.
