I'm sick currently and I can't take the mental abuse of this house anymore I keep wanting to dieEvery single day screamed at just for existing. Right now I have a throat infection it hurts to even speak yet being screamed at again by my 83 year old grandmother just for trying to watch her. Fuck my life is awful.
