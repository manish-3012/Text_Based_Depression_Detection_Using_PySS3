I have a new planI am not actively suicidal, but I often think about suicide. I have many different plans. I've felt this way for years. Had one "attempt" (I chickened out half way through)

But I have a new plan. I will die a martyr. It will be in the news. People will gather in the streets, and it will bring attention to a great cause.

But first, I have a few things to leave behind that need to be done. 

This all makes me feel so content right now.
