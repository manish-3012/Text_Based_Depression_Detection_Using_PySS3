I stormed out of my house after fighting with my family and now I feel like I should just keep walking and kill myselfI feel like this is the final straw. I have so much anger and sadness and shame inside of me and I canâ€™t get rid of any of it. Iâ€™ve lived a life full of neglect, abuse, and mental illness. Iâ€™m pathetic, poor, ugly, uneducated, I have nothing to give the world. 

Iâ€™ve felt like I was predestined to kill myself since I was 11 and I feel like this is finally it.
