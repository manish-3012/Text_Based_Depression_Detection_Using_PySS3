By the end of this year.....Letâ€™s get straight to the point, Iâ€™m a 19 year old 5â€™8 tr@nny little man who live with his sister. I pay rent, it is my apartment, she doesnâ€™t respect me. 

No one really does until Iâ€™m angry. I donâ€™t really dwell on that emotion. I really donâ€™t dwell on any of my emotions. It obvious no one cares. You feel me? Words canâ€™t express how empty I feel, how left out and behind I am. How emotionally disconnected and unavailable I am. 

I speak and no body listens, a guy at my job speaks as quiet as me and everyone listens to him, cause heâ€™s older. 

Why does everyday go by so slow? Why are the people that constantly hurt me, living better lives than me? Iâ€™m a very pathetic man. I know I am. By the end of this year. If I donâ€™t see in any progress... Im seriously considering offing myself. 

Thereâ€™s nothing else for me to do, itâ€™s time for a close.... I canâ€™t live another dreadful day in my solitude. Nothing but nobody is here for me. I donâ€™t have time for excuses, or motivational speeches when I tried... 

This is my unhappy ending. I knew it would happen, told myself constantly I wouldnâ€™t make it past 19 I was right. Who knew that it would probably be so soon.
