I'm suicidal due to getting help is difficult.I'm 21 years old who have had suicidal thoughts for over 3 years.
I'm not sure if this even counts as an attempt but my first attempt was at college 3 years ago when I had anorexia. (Painkillers) I did have a lot of stomach pain and I was very close to going to the hospital but I spent 2 days in my bed before the pain was gone.

I do want to get help but the free therapy that you can get in England apparently does not have my 3 attempts of referral. It has been over 6 months!
My parents were able to find my private therapy but she charges a lot of money just for one lesson. (I could spend the money on DIO merch and having one lesson with her is making me very very anxious)  
Whenever I contact any suicidal number, they somehow find my parents mobile number and contact them. My parents get confused each time because they do not even explain to them that their daughter called them because she is being a suicidal little shit. I really would like to know how they find my parents phone number when I tell them each time to please not contact anyone else.
I have told each of my past therapists (4) that I am suicidal hoping that one of them would get me put in a hospital in a few days so that I would not end up killing myself. None of them told anyone at all because getting courage to tell a doctor or a hospital that I want to kill myself is too difficult for me to do due to anxiety and trust issues. 

Due to all of this happening, I have sadly started to eat less/control how much I eat which is eating back to my anorexia. When I tried to get help for my anorexia 3 years ago, I went to ask help from 4 different doctor and 3 different nurses who rejected me because I was at a healthy weight.
