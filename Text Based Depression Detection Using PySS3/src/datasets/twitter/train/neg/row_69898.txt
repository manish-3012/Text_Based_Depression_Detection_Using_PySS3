I'm not suicidal or depressed, Just confused and tiredEvery day is different. One day I could be extremely happy (rarely happens tho lmao), and the next day I could have no energy to get up. I just feel, dead. Cliche, i know. I just dont feel safe. There is just this stupid society that everybody ignores. The dark part of it. Realizing the shit ppl do on a daily just to be happy. I've really thought about it. How do I escape an endless reality
