I can't. Trying to get excited for help, but can't. I know I keep posting here, and I'm sorry. I think I've gotten used to the idea I'm beyond help, but I need to get stuff off my chest. I'll never talk about it otherwise (although I would never be this open in RL). It hurts too much. Its getting hard to get out of bed, its getting hard to go to bed. Its hard to live a life that I've lost all passion for. 

Its really hard. I mean, to wake up everyday, put on a fake face, and pretend I'm happy. Pretending I want to go to social outings and pretending I'm happy when I'm not. I haven't been for a long time. Yes, I'm at the point where I'm deciding to be passively suicidal. I don't have the guts to take my own life, but I'm doing my best to become numb to the idea of death (my own at least). If I go out, I go out. I shouldn't fear it. If anything, I should embrace it. I want to. Its so hard to keep this up, and doing so is just making my sadness worse. 

I have somebody that knows, but when I complain to her, I force her to repeat herself, because I don't want to hear the advice. Or, I hear it, but I constantly complain about depression because it re-occurs. She's supportive, but I can tell I'm getting on her nerves. She'd doing enough for me, and doesn't need my emo ass making it worse. I want to be able to just hide myself completely. I'm not very confident, so I never talk about myself or how I feel, but I always feel bad for it. I don't want to care anymore. I don't think I want to bother getting help. 

I think I'm just done.
