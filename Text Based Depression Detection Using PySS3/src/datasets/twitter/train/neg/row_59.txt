Friend has been suicidal, not sure what to doHi all, I'm not sure if this is the right forum to post this but I'm at a loss on what to do. My friend from high school has been showing signs of attempted suicide. We don't talk as much ever since I moved away for college but her social media posts as well as someone she is close to messaged me their concern at well. I've tried texting her but she has been ignoring my messages and it's gotten to the point where we're really afraid she's going to do it. She currently lives with her father but I haven't been able to get in contact with him. I'm not sure what else to do.

TL;DR Friend from high school has been suicidal lately and is ignoring messages and refusing help from people. What can I do to  help?
