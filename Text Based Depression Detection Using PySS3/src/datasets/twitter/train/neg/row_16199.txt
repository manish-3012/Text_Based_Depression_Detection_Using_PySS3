Waiting for a slow deathTonight itâ€™s snowing in my town itâ€™s cold af and Iâ€™m have to sleep in my car I would hope itâ€™s warm enough but part of me wants it to freeze me to death while I sleep fuck this life and the people who took everything from me I know they wonâ€™t care after Iâ€™m gone but fuck them anyway
