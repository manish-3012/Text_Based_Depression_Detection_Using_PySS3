I see how easy it is to be overwhelmedYou don't even have to read their stories, just the headlines. So many hurting people and no answers. All the articles on preventing suicide are just rhetoric. I know... I have been in and out of the hospital countless times over many years. People are inherently mean. God does not exist or there wouldn't be all these agonizing souls. The solution to my problems is easy, but out of my reach... money. I don't have proper Healthcare, I am food insecure, I have one foot into homelessness at all times, my income is too small to keep up with inflation and the knowledge that when I can no longer care for myself I will die in the streets because I am not eligible for senior care gives me nothing but stress. I have no future. I was not wanted when I was born and abused all throughout childhood. I have had so many traumas. My father was responsible for my care, but thought with his cock and gave everything to the stepmother. What a cunt she was. I feel for those posting here, but I am in no position to help anyone... and no one is in a position to help me. At least I have a way to slip quietly into that goodnight with no suffering and no possibility of it being stopped. I am angry I was not given a better chance. People think there is nothing really wrong with you when they can't see it. My internal physical issues are every bit as real as someone who lost a leg. And like that leg can't grow back, neither can my problems. I am tired of the low hanging fruit doctors downplaying my problems. I guess I am just tired of all the motherfucking shit.
