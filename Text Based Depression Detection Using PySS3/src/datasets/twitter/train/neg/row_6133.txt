Need to be talked out out it tonight21/f
Since I was 12 I knew I was going to end up doing this.
It seemed inevitable, there is nothing but evil and bad people in my life.
I've been talked out of it before.
But it's never been this bad, I have a plan, a date, time. I don't want to be checked into the hospital..
But I remember the realization of being talked out of it by dear friends (which i no longer have). I hope that I can come to that again..
Just with maybe a few kind words.
If not, It's clearly the end for me.
