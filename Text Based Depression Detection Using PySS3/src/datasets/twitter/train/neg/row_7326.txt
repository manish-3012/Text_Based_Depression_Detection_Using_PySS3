I want to dieFor a long time Iâ€™ve dealt with intrusive suicidal thoughts and with depression. For a long time Iâ€™ve pushed back on those thoughts because I havenâ€™t wanted to die...Iâ€™ve just wanted the pain to stop and to feel better. 

Iâ€™m more than 2 years sober and approaching my 30th birthday and for the past 6 weeks or so I have wanted to die. Iâ€™m in therapy, Iâ€™ve been on medication for a long time, tried lots of different drugs, never found anything that helped. I donâ€™t want to keep trying. I just want to die. 

My gf is going home to her parentsâ€™ house next week for Christmas, Iâ€™m going to do it then. I guess Iâ€™m posting here as part of my continued effort to get comfortable with the idea...I have been thinking about it for a couple of weeks now.
