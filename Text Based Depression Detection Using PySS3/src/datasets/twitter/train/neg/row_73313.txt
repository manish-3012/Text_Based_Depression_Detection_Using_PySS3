Counselors can't help me, the threat of hospitalization is too bigI can't fucking open up to them about my self harm or suicidal thoughts or else I'll get taken away and hospitalized. How is that fair? How can they expect us to be open and honest with our feelings with this looming threat hanging over our heads?
