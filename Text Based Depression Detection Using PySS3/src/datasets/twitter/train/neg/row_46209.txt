Living life with bpd isnâ€™t worth itThis isnâ€™t going to be the most articulate post but I just want to let this out 

Iâ€™m done living with this fucking disease. Iâ€™m traveling the US over the summer for a fellowship for my career and Iâ€™m absolutely depressed. Iâ€™m feel like an idiot. I canâ€™t ever hold down a long term relationship or job. I want to die. I want to hang myself when I get back home. I want to die. My gf dumped me because I told her I have bpd. Today is her birthday and I want to wish her happy birthday but that would be a bad idea. I want to die. Fuck. Iâ€™m so pathetic. Iâ€™m so stupid. Iâ€™m going to take 6 classes for the next two semesters so I can graduate college in 5 years. I want to die. I want to die. I canâ€™t get better. Fuck!!!
