Once again, iâ€™m losing myselfhavenâ€™t posted on here in about 6 months because i thought i found happiness. Now iâ€™m realizing i havenâ€™t and iâ€™m in even more pain than before.

june came around and a new girl started working at my job. We kicked off pretty well and got very close until a few  weeks ago when she just started talking less. i confronted her and she said that we still talk the same. Friday comes around and she finds out that her boyfriend cheated on her and called me to leave work and asked if i could meet her at me house. So i left work and met her and just held her as she cried for awhile. We just kinda sat there while i held her and she talked and talk until she asked for someone else to come over. i said no and she left to go home. later that night, she asked me if i loved her and i said yes and she wasnâ€™t the same after that. she told me that she didnâ€™t feel the same but i was her best friend and proceeded to say she loved me and â€œto just know thatâ€. that raised an alarm and i didnâ€™t want to stop talking to her. 

after that night, everything changed. She barely talks to me anymore and talks to a different co-worker. We donâ€™t hangout anymore besides when heâ€™s with me, then she want to. when they are around each other, she constantly makes me feel like trash (she kisses him on the cheek, holds his hand, makes sexual gestures, etc but while locking eye contact with me) i canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s to hurt me or what but it just hurts. She tells me constantly that she â€œneed some dickâ€ and will go to other guys houses that have harassed her and have sex with them and come back and tell me that sheâ€™s upset but doesnâ€™t want to talk. all i do is care for her when sheâ€™s down, try to distract her from her breakup and love her with my heart but she just twists it around and plays with it. 

i canâ€™t do it anymore, iâ€™ve broken down 3 times and idk if i can do it again. i held a rope and just cried for hours and threw up multiple times.

just want the pain to go away
