I like fallingAmong other things.

It feels free and wonderful and peaceful. It feels like something I can control.  Other things give me peace and comfort, too, like biking at night and playing loud music, writing, camping.

I've considered suicide, in that way, and others, and I've cut a few times.  Even though I have very understanding and supportive friends about that, my parents make me live an extremely sheltered life.  I don't write things down for fear of my parents finding it.  I don't feel comfortable with my parents.  I don't wish for them to know me well. I feel like I can never going for rides alone, going camping alone, etc., without them prying into what I did.  I'm extremely private.

So, considering the fact that the only way for calm down and release comfortably is self-harm, sucks.

Anyway, falling.  Last summer, I went to a ropes course (with my parents, of course &gt;.&lt;).  Part of the ropes course was a 50 foot rope swing, from an 80ft platform, to a net, 30 ft above the ground.  When I stepped off the platform, I thought about the platform being a building. I closed my eyes and imagined I was jumping, and I enjoyed every moment of the fall.  From dropping down, my knee bending to start, to traveling through the air, relaxed and limp.  During those few, beautiful, seconds, I felt at ease.  I felt like that was the way.  I felt at peace.  I thought about unhooking, and jumping off the platforms, into the small river that goes through, for the rest of the course.

I have a strange liking to that.

TL;DR: 16YO M with sheltering parents likes falling, considers suicide, goes to a ropes course, jumps (with safety equipment) 50ft down, really liked it, thought about jumping off other platforms into a shallow river.  Daddy issues, Mommy issues, issues, and issues.

Edit:  I'm also pretty sure that I'm eventually gonna kill myself.
