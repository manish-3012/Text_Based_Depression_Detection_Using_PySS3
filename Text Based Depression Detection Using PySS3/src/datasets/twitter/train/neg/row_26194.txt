RottingFor the past several years I feel constantly like I'm rotting away. This is the first year in 5 someone hasn't died in my family. But still this year friends have tried to end themselves, and one has succeeded. My rope still has length left to it, but it's fraying and I feel I am running out of life left to live. My insides hurt. My head hurts. My own voice in my head is against me, calling me every name in the book. Telling me to end it.

&amp;#x200B;

There are things I could do to try and help. But I dont want to talk to a therapist, I don't want to give away my life story. I shouldn't be ashamed, I've done nothing illegal or wrong in my life, but I still would be ashamed my mind would make sure of that. Not a day goes by since I left highschool a few years ago that I don't think of ending it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are still fragments of me that want to live, I've had access to guns and knives, chemicals, so many things that I could use to end it then and there. But each time I knew it worked be burdensome to someone. But those fragments are getting fewer and I don't feel like I can salvage them anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost nearly every interest in my hobbies, I can't cry from this depression and despair anymore my body just won't let me. It's so frustrating, knowing that some of this emotion could be relieved if I could get it out. But nothing flows. I have really good days. Days where I celebrate something, or where I hang out with the few people who don't entirely drain me. But these thoughts always return, and they are getting worse. I haven't slept properly in days, which maybe is why I'm writing here. To vent since I can't seem to let myself emote. It hurts knowing I'll wake up tomorrow, after praying into the night that I'll fall asleep for the last time, shouting in my head for someone to kill me so I don't have to do it myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do anymore, I don't have a 'bad life' I'm grateful for having a clean home, for the friends and family I have left, but I'm rotting. I'm rotting. I hate my body, I hate my personality, I hate everything about myself. I've pushed away people who want to be with me, and I've pushed away my own flecks of love for others. I don't want to hurt them badly, they'll be sad. But they won't be as devastated as they could be if I were with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to talk to anyone I don't feel like anything will help. I'm shutting down. I'm rotting. I feel disgusting. Looking back I remember myself as a kid. Now I feel like some unhinged imposter in a shell that doesn't fit. I know I'm running out of time, I'm falling apart. I know people can tell now, that I'm starting to lose my grip on reality. My public facade is showing its wear and I'm terrified for the day when it finally crumbles to the floor. I hate it. I hate it I hate it. Can anyone tell me why I can't do anything? My parents and family always say god has a plan for all of us. But I stopped believing that a long time ago. No god could exist to put this curse on someone. That's too cruel. I don't know what to do. I really don't. Or maybe I do and I can't admit it to myself. I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm panicking. I don't know if I have days, weeks, months, or years left. But in the future I can't think of any other way I'll go barring an accident besides suicide. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm terrified. Why is my mind so cruel. Why is it so intent on keeping me alive if all it can do is tell me to kill myself. Why can't I stop it. Why can't it just end. Why am I such a coward. I don't want to keep living. But for now I can't even make the choice to end it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this is hell or limbo for some past life. Forcing myself to live in anguish while not being able to leave this place.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want it to stop. I want quiet. I want to be left alone. I want love. I don't want to hurt anyone with my absence. I want to leave. I'm tired of hurting. I'm tired of the fight to get out of bed. I'm tired of ignoring the advice I can't make myself follow. I just want to die. I want to die. Isn't this enough. Can't I stop now? Please can't I just fade away. I don't care if there's an afterlife or not. I just want this to end. I don't want to feel this churning gravel in my body anymore. I don't want to feel like my heart is hollow and broken. I want this rotting to end before I lose what's left of my ailing mind. I want this to end.
