My life is wastedI don't know what to do I'm depressed and incredibly lonely but whenever I try to make friends or talk to people I always get demotivated and pussy out of it it's not my confidence that the issue and I get depressed when I'm alone for long periods of time, my life is literally worthless all I do is read manga and fantasies about having friends and being important nothing interests me or makes me excited anymore. I'm showing less emotion then I used to do I don't get happy or laugh as much and when I try it just comes across as ingenious. 

Sorry if this was a mess I just need some where to unload all of this without making people think I'm attention seeking or making people feel sympathy for me. 

Idc if no-one responds I just want somewhere to unload.
