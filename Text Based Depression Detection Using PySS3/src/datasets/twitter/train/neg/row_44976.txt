should i just end iti suffer everyday of my life. i think i suffer from dissociation &amp; panic attacks but i'm not 100% sure cause my body feels so weird all the time. like every minute of every single day, i dont know what its like to feel normal anymore. my body does really weird shit &amp; im so weak and numb all the time, im so tired of it. 
ive tried multiple times to get help for myself but theres absolutely nothing i can do. i cant enjoy life anymore because of this. what am i suppose to do 
i dont want to die really, but i dont wanna live like this either
