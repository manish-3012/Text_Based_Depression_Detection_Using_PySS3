I just got back from a CSU inpatient care.I feel sick to my stomach and everything has me emotional. I thought I could survive but I really cant, this is difficult. 

I am pretty sure I have lost my best friend, which is the most heartbreaking thing to ever happen to me. I feel so incredibly alone without him. I think he dislikes me now. I never wanted it to come to this, but it has. I hate myself for this so much. I would give up anything to talk to him or see him. 

My family scares me. I can not face them anymore without being incredibly anxious or depressed. I could not tell them where I have been for the past few days or what is truly wrong with me. They don't believe me or think I am faking it to be cool. Major depression, anxiety, and more crap I have is not cool. Its painful. I want to die because of it.

I can not decide if killing myself would be the best choice. I learned a lot from the CSU and I felt a lot better there. When I came back, everything was shit again and I am so miserable. If I do it, I could be happy and so would everyone else.

My life is a mess and I don't know if it is worth fixing anymore.
