I'm in my early 30s and done. I am in my early 30s and have been unemployed for awhile now.

I have burned through my savings and haven't been able to land even the most menial jobs (I'm either over/under educated).

I can't afford to go back to school.

The part that makes me feel the worst is that I am married. I love my wife but wonder if she would be better off if I killed myself. 

I have gone through this before and we separated for awhile...I'm afraid that is coming up again since money troubles and an unemployed husband are stressful and she is in medical school. 

I'm just over this shit existence most of us get stuck with. Here I am...a failure fighting over 9 dollar an hour jobs with people. I can't provide for my wife, I can't pay the bills, I can't afford health insurance to make sure she is secure, I can't sell anything else to pay bills and I cashed out my small 401k.  

I have a large caliber revolver sitting on the desk in front of me and just want to walk off into the woods behind my house and put a bullet in my head.

I know it will hurt her but in time she will move on.

I did what I was supposed to...I was in the Army, I went to college, I tried hard and now I'm here staring at a revolver.

It just scares me at how death feels like it would be relief.
