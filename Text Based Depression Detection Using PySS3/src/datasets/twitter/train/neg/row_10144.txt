Why continue though?I have a bad habit of thinking about suicide when I'm supposed to sleep.
And so another thing.
A lot of people on this sub just say it gets better or you're worthy.
Not really a fan of that.
So I'm making this because of the "3AM's moments of hope".
Like sure having a great job and a family would be great.
If I could even get to being an adult.
And not killing myself for the next 5 years.
Like I'm suicidal for 3 years and I have 3 attempts not much but whatever.
I wrote a suicide note just in case of "unexpected death".
I finally got some alone time while my parents went out and I bring down a bag of expired meds so yeah. A whole bag.
So I have it pretty secured.
But my question is.
Why continue with life and it gets worse like no denying that.
For that slight chance of being successful?
It's like the lottery but worse.
My grades just went to rock bottom this year I don't exactly know why.
But I feel depression stepped up.
So why continue?
For that slight chance?
For the price of like 5 - 10 dreadful years?
I think I will pass on that offer and go out.



So yeah so that's my vent for the night.
(Sorry if this is worded weird I'm having troubles sleeping).
