No one will careNo one will respond to this because itâ€™s as if itâ€™s a crime to not be showing off and â€œhappyâ€.

This year I have seriously attempted suicide seven times. This included being forced off train tracks, being blocked from jumping off of a building in the city, injecting and ingesting rat poison, sedatives mixed with alcohol and whatever I could find numerous times almost leading to a coma and then having seizures. I have sliced my flesh open. I have hung myself from a tree. I have suffocated myself. I have prayed every single night not to wake up.

You cannot just go to therapy and think youâ€™ll be better, or a hospital over and over. Even when Iâ€™ve put my faith in everything it just isnâ€™t working.

Iâ€™m going to be real, tragedy after abandonment after tragedy keeps happening and I donâ€™t want to see 2020. I wish assisted suicide was an option in this state. Itâ€™s beyond â€œsadâ€ itâ€™s more like a fact of life. I have been suicidal for a long time...years....and Iâ€™m tired of lying about it. Itâ€™s just a fact, and most sheeple are too cowardly to respond and say the dumb advice: reach out to someone...as in someone else.

Being abandoned and abused by friends and my brothers has been hell. All the deaths I have experienced has been hell. There is no break. There is no joy. Dead bf. Cancer scares. A guy who ridiculed me. No motivation to eat. It doesnâ€™t stop. With my heart too badly broken beyond repair there is no point. In four days y first love is getting married. I donâ€™t have anything of my fatherâ€™s. This year was just the last beating I can handle. 

So please donâ€™t call the police, there is someone watching me that I donâ€™t kill myself. The police already know that Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself over and over. I canâ€™t wait until I am able to die. If anyone then says there was nothing that they could have done, itâ€™s a lie.
