I tried to hang myself when I was 10I'm 18 now, but I've dealt with depression for a long time. 
I'm wanting death all the time. I just recently learned how to drive, and every time I drive on a sharp curve, I'm tempted to drive straight as fast as I can. 

I've never been happy with myself, and I remember when I was 10, I took a belt, and double knotted it and hung it between my closet doorframe and the hinges. I remember putting my head through the loop and pushing the stack of books I used to get up that high away from me. I didn't fall fast, it was more of a slow suffocation, and I passed out, only to wake up an hour later on the floor, and a broken closet door hanging above me. 

I take medicine for depression, but lately, I still feel depressed. I don't want to talk about it to mom because I'm humiliated. Is there an anon therapist on the internet anywhere who'd let me rant whenever I feel upset? 

Any help is appreciated
