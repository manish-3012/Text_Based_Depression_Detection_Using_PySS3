Only alive for my moms sakeThe idea of hurting my mother is really the only thing that keeps me alive most nights. She's put so much effort into giving me everything I've ever needed and done everything possible to help me through my depression. I wish I could get hit by a car or diagnosed with a terminal disease so that at least she would know there was nothing she could have done. But I'm fighting a downhill battle and I don't know how much longer I can keep going for her sake. I just wish she could understand why I'd be happier in death.
