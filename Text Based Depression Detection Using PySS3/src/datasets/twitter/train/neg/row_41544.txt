Apathy for life and deathHello there, I'll start off by saying that I don't feel like living anymore, I really want to have a will to live, but for a while now I haven't had a real reason to live.

It wasn't this way, but about four years ago I lost my best friend and I couldn't find any reason to even smile, yet I wasn't allowed to mourn because people looked at me as the one who had to remain strong so that it didn't all come crashing down, or at least it felt that way. Now I don't feels depressed for this, it was 4 years ago and I've come to accept what happened, I have no regrets about it, I said he told me everything we had to and wanted to while he was alive, so there were no words unsaid.

This however brings another problem, while going to grief I had a reason to live, or at least it felt that way, I wasn't living for me anymore, I now had to live life for me and for him, because he loved life, but after I came to accept his passing it slowly became dull, Life no longer felt like life.

I do have friends whom I love and my family is great, I don't have bad grades or suffer from bullying, it's just that living is no longer appealing to me, my friends and family are clever enough to stop me from killing myself, they know me very well, so killing myself is not something that I try often, however I do wish I could just up and die, I don't fear death, I embrace the idea of me dying, I wish my bus would drive off the cliff, or for a Stray bullet to hit me in the back of the head. 
I know I won't be able to take my life. I don't find anything worth living for, I don't care if I live or die, but my compass leans towards dying.
