I'm breaking up with my boyfriendThe reason why I'm still alive today is my boyfriend. He tried to stop me from ending my life many times. Now I have an idea of leaving him so no one gonna stop me.
This might break his heart but I have no choice. I don't think I should suffer this life because someone told me to. I don't mind being an asshole. I wish a planet crashing this Earth everyday so... No big deal.
