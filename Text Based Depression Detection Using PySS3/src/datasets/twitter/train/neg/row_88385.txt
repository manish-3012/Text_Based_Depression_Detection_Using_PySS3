My living situation and mental health sucks.My whole fucking mental health is garage it's pretty obvious by my post history. My living situation just got a lot worse do to me and my mother getting to a fight and her losing her house she was renting. I'm now living at my dad's mom's and she's beyond toxic, controlling, she's in her 70s so she grew up back when mental health wasn't all that known and she still thinks that way. She's all about work work work. And mental health issues are mainly a lazy excuse to be a bum. I been coach surfing at my other nanas because I fucking hate it so much. Don't know How to get income or a place. Hell i wouldn't mind living in a fucking camper. I'm tired of being told I'm lazy nobody knows this pain. I'm gonna show them real soon. Let me know best sucidie option. Whatever supplies I can get I'll save up. Thanks.
