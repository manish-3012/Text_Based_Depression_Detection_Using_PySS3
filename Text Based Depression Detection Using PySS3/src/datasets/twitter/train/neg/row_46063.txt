I can't can't continue.It hurts. It all hurts. The end of relationship is just the straw that broke my back. I've been abused, raped, and thrown away. I'm unlovable and I'm so tired. Tired of being alone. Tired of having to be strong. Tired of doing it myself. Tired of the constant struggle. I'm tired of always weathering the storm. So tired of it all. The world is shit. People are assholes who just want to use you and throw you away. I'm tired of being a piece of meat to be used and spat out. I'm sorry. I can't do it anymore.

Hopefully, it's not long now.
