What should i be doingSomeone i love so much someone who promised to be with me forever someday, get married and live happily is pushing me away and it hurts so badly. they say they need to find themselves. but everyday a future relationship dies more and more. I dont want to be that guy who begs someone to come back so im trying so hard to be supportive and maybe getting emotional is just greedy of me. She was the only reason i wanted to live. I was thinking about working and saving up just to be with her and it made my life feel alot more meaning and i was so fucking happy. now without her it kinda feels like nothing is worth living for but her. and one day she was about to remove me from her life completely and i just couldnt stop shaking it was like in flash of a second my body lost all its weight and i felt a strong pain in my heart. no doubt i would of killed myself that night ig this love is keeping me alive. maybe i should stay forever as a friend but not being able to express my love hurts so badly. but the fear of her leaving / finding someone else has been haunting me. i dont think id want to live if either of those happened and it seems like that could be the case one day
