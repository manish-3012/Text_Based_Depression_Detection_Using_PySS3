I'm done fighting to stay in a world I don't belong in.I don't belong here.  I don't think I ever have.  I have nothing left to offer to the world, and it has nothing left to offer to me but suffering.  Why should I not kill myself?  Ask even most other severely depressed people and, if you really push them, there are things they still appreciate.  There is nothing I care about.  Friends, family, food, hobbies, careers, love...all of them are hollow.  Even if someone threw everything that others live their whole lives for right into my lap, I would collapse into a ball of tears...unable to feel any of it.  I stare at other people in awe, almost studying them as to grasp what it's like to feel their happiness.  They live more in a day than I can live in a decade.  What right do THEY have to tell me not to kill myself?  They are a different species in comparison!

I think about killing myself every day, breaking down under the weight of the pain in my mind.  I've tried to do what's right my whole life, never hurting anyone except myself -- slowly dying over the course of years.  My anxiety paralyzes and traps me, while my depression robs me of the ability to feel anything but pain.  As if it was not bad enough that I am a psychological defective, my physical disabilities have destroyed even the most shallow and superficial experiences of life.  They, and likely my mental and emotional defects, are not temporary -- they will follow me until the day I die.  Why not speed up that process?  Why use temporary (non) solutions to permanent problems?

I do not feel like a real human being, but maybe that's a good thing after all.  Only humans could be so cruel to force their own kind (at gunpoint or lock down if necessary!) to experience unending torment solely because suicide OFFENDS them.  So, why do you hate me?  Why do you want people like me to suffer?
