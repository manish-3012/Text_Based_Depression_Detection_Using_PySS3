So confusedI am so temted to get a gun out of the safe and hollow point end it. I have a good job, make a good money but life complexities  with relationships and my own ibility to budget money makes me think its better to leave this world and see what is in the next world. It's gets scary when multiple times in a month/week you have a handgun loaded with hollowpoints just wonderig if yo make that leap to see what in the next world....
I am not religious and if I would be it would be Buddist because they seem the most tollerant to the world. Christian, Muslim, Jewish all seem so rigid and itolerant to others in this world.... 
Maybe I should go and report back to this deminsion on that things can get bettter than the current cluster fuck that alot of us live in.  These deamons fight in my head constantly and seem to grow louder every day no matter what I try .
