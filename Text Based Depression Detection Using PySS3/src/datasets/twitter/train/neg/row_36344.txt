Please someone help me, I dont know what to do.I have just been trying hard my whole life but I am not getting anywhere. I hate that I am so useless. I am not clever, no matter how much i study I cant seem to get to a good grade. I tried experimenting different ways to study or just plain put in a lot more time into it, still did not get me anywhere. Whenever I think I did something right, I am wrong. I cant even be confident in my abilities because nothing i was ever even a bit confident at ever worked out. I cant absorb knowledge fast, I think its even safe to say I cant even absorb knowledge at a normal rate. I have quite a few deformities on my body that I have been very conscious about. I have pain everyday due to these deformities. Its like everything i go just turns to shit. Am i cursed? What did I do to deserve all this that happened to me throughout my life. I didnt asked to be born. The pain and anxiety i feel everyday is so painful. I rather I just die, it would be a lot easier for me. I dont want to make my family feel the pain of me dying, i know they care a lot for me, thats one of the reasons I havent done it yet. Please someone out there, help me, I am begging you, give me some advice, what do I do? I just wanted to be normal and achieve my dreams. Why wasn't I born normal like everyone else.
