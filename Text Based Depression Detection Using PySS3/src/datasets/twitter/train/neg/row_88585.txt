I'm gonna vomit why is this world so horribleI'm seeing out of a lense that looks pretty much like r/eyeblech  it's ugly, bloody and full of dirt. Everywhere you look are bittersweet faces etched with the harsheties of the world, and loud sounds careening from everywhere you know just really ugly and unpleasant sounds spinning around you and you can't drown them out. God, what kind of planet is this where pain feels good? One hurt dims out the other, my arm stings so much my heart pain is completely drowned out. What's the point to keep going, everything is so stingy and cold I just want to black out completely so this world shuts the fuck up forever. So much is just soo goddamn bitter, and love is so pleasant until it's not and leaves you ten times worse but that's just a small wir compared to everything else but fuck, everything else is thrusting so hard with that gritty shit, it's so goddamn stupid. this is hell. i'm so sure. and if i die i'll be reborn because hell is eternal and always keep. on. going. there's nowhere to run, not alive not in death, it can even be worse in death who tf knows nobody fucking knows! It's so stupid and painful, and it makes no sense it's pointless like some minecraft game so goddamn fucking stupid and scary. being scared is the worst feeling in the world I wish i was a psychopath so I wouldn't feel it, i just want to be gone now
