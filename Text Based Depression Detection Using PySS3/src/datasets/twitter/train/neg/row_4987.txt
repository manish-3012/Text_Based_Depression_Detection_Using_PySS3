had an episode, ready to kill myselffriends and girls are ignoring me, can't even blame them because I am weird, I pull the skin off of my fingers bc of nervousness and I must show the nervousness all the time. 

trying to find a prom date because if I don't go people will think I'm weird, not trying to go alone. 

I had an episode, I threw a clock at my wall and it shattered, I was ramming myself into my wall and blocked off the door while yelling. My mom forced her way into the room and cradled me while I cried. I was about to pull a bookshelf onto myself. I haven't told them I want to kill myself. I want to jump or hang myself so bad. 

I don't know what to do. it really feels like my life has no way up from here. I think about killing myself so much and I want to do it so bad. I would destroy my family and my 9 year old sister I feel terrible about that
