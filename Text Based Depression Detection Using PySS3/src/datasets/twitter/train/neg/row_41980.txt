Why does suicide seem like the best option?I quit my job a few weeks ago after an argument from a co-worker who was angry or depressed about something else berated me while we were busy and I was training a new hire on the stations. I have been to several restaurants and none of them are hiring. I spend my days looking fruitlessly while my daughters mother reminds me of how much of a burden I am. I made myself a noise out of wire and packed my bag with it. This will probably be buried by all of the posts by those who need love more than me but I have nowhere to turn to. I'm stumped and really think that this is the end for me
