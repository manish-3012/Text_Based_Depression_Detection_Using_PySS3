I just want this to be over, please help meI have been depressed for as long as I can remember. I've tried all kinds of help, everything I can think of and nothing has worked. I've been in and out of the hospital more times than I can count. Every time I'm out, I feel a little better, but it always comes back, usually worse than before. I've only ever had one real friend and even they have gotten sick of my bullshit. They haven't spoken to me for months, and the only members of my family that want anything to do with my are my mother and sister, but I'm just a burden to them. I can't pay my bills and I'm on the verge of losing my apartment. My electricity will be turned off next Tuesday, I've had no heat or hot water for the past month. I can't sleep, nothing gives me any enjoyment and I never want to eat. I've failed at absolutely everything I've tried. This is never going to stop and all I want to think about is killing myself.
