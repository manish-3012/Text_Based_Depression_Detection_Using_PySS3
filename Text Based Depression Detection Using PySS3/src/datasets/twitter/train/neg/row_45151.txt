Would you like that sandwich 'all the way'?I equate life to a shit sandwichâ€¦ you can dress it up however you like, with condiments and such to mask the flavor, but, at its core, it is still a piece of shitâ€¦ There are those of us that see it and others that donâ€™t.  

Iâ€™ve been trying to find God, so that hopefully he can shed some light on why the fuck I am here.  To my dismay, he is not answering the phoneâ€¦  So my next best action is to be Christian-like, because, since I canâ€™t find God, maybe I should try to act like himâ€¦  Turn the other cheek, serve others, love thy neighbor like yourself â€¦all that jazz.  I find that I am not very good at it.  Hard time turning the other cheek when someone slaps you, serving others meets their needs, but not yours, and loving thy neighbor is an impossible task for one who hates himself.  We just live to work, reproduce (some of us anyway), and die.  

So what is there to do?  Checking out of the game seems to be the best answer for those that donâ€™t want to play.  Think about it, if you are at the blackjack table and the dealer keeps winning, do you continue to play?  Hell no, you pick up what little chips you have left and you bounce!  Naysayers tell me that if I kill myself, that I will miss out on all the great things that life has in store for me.  What they fail to see is that all the bullshit is cut out as well.  Pick your poison: eat the shit sandwich for the mustard that you layered on it, or refuse to eat.  Seems like a simple choice to me.  But it is the most selfish act possible, right? To take oneâ€™s own lifeâ€¦  At least, thatâ€™s what they tell me.  They tell me how it would affect them, they would be heart-broken, life would never be the same, blah blah blahâ€¦  So who is being selfish?  I am to force down this shit sandwich, so their world isnâ€™t disturbed.  Seems fairâ€¦
