I want to end my life by March 2019.I have been living a meaningless and purposeless life since 6 years. I have now reached saturation point. I tried everything to get interested in life, but every endeavor faded with time. I find everything boring. I stay quiet in front of people. I have nothing to talk about. I work, come back, sleep, repeat. I have no life and no interest in anything. I am getting drawn towards drugs coz they keep my mind shut so I don't have to struggle passing a day. It is a useless existence I am living. I see people, driven to live for some motive. I have none. I tried ending my life but failed. A failure in living, a failure in dying. I wish I could end my life by March next year. My sis is getting married in 2 months. It will harm the environment. So once she settles I will make one final attempt. It's useless to continue a meaningless existence anymore.
