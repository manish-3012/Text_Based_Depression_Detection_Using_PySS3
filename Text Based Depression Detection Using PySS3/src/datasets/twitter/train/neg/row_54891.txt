TiredNo idea how to start this vent, which us what it is more then a plea for help. Depression is starting to get the better of me. Come from a healthy family, no hardships with relations or money. Dad is a cunt, but I have the same attitude he does and it just leads to constant arguing. I just have no motivation anymore, for anything. Dropped out of college after being a student with crazy high marks through high school and even into college. Just couldn't will myself to go any more. Even work is getting hard to go to, and it's one place my mind is usually distracted enough to feel okay. Failure as a person, a friend, a student, and a son. Even now, I have my best friend sleeping next to me and don't even know if she can help me. We've been getting much closer over the last few months, but now I keep thinking I'm just holding her back. She never seems happy around me, and that's all I want her to be. Want everyone to be happy, and I'm no help in doing that. Started drinking a lot as it helps the pain, but I'm afraid soon I might just say Fuck it, I'm done. Even do mdma, which started for the fun but had turned into a powerful release. Can't tonight, Way too much of a pussy right now to take any initiative, negative or positive. Goes with my nice long list of shit qualities. Greedy, know it all, always putting people down around me, talentless, physically laughable, no skills for the real world, unmotivated, dishonest, attention who're,waste of human skin. Doomed to rot in the ground anyway, why not give the process a kick start. I'm done crying, I'm done caring, I'm done waiting for life to change. If I can't find the motivation to change this shithole of a life, then it isn't one I deserve.
