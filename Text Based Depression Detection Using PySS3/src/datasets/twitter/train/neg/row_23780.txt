Iâ€™m very close to committing to my plan.I probably have some sort of mental illness, because from what I know no one hates myself more then I do.  And this isnâ€™t some edgy teen thing, Iâ€™m talking â€˜I got into an argument with someone and I regret starting the argument.  Itâ€™s my fault for starting it because I saw so confrontational.  I should have jsut shut up.  Why do I even try to express myself?  No one whoâ€™s worth anything will spend time with me.  Who wants to hear about me anyways?  Everyone tells me to shut the fuck up when I try to talk about my interests or theyâ€™ll ignore me.  No one likes me anyway.  I should just end it...â€™ and so on.  Honestly the only thing keeping me back is my parents who logically I know would be devastated but Iâ€™m so fucking stupid because the next line of thought is â€˜they deserve it.â€™  Iâ€™m so tired of these trains of thought I really just want to end it.   Im so fucking tired of me arguing against myself to not carry through and then I argue back why I should kill myself.  I hate it.  And I hate myself for thinking like this.  No one deserves to hear this though so Iâ€™ll just throw it to the fucking wind and see if anything comes of it.  I guess this is the more logical side of me reaching out?  Iâ€™m so tired of being contractidary and i want to settle on a choice.   Is this subbreddit even the best place I have no idea if it is.  Iâ€™m probably wrong anyways, cause Iâ€™m just a waste of space who keeps getting into other peopleâ€™s way.
