Thank you!Thank you for everyone who reached out to me to remind me that life isnâ€™t too heck. I posted in here last month contemplating suicide because of my dead end job and lack of motivation.

Iâ€™ve been avidly working on rebuilding this shit show of a life. Iâ€™ve been applying for jobs, I have multiple interviews lined up and hopefully something comes of it all.
