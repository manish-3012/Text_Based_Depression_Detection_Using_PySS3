I spoke to my parents on the phoneI was on the phone with my parents an hour ago after being told to speak to them about my depression that has plagued my life for so life, every since I was 12, I'm currently 18; they told me how much they hated me because I'm throwing away all my opportunities and am being lazy. I'm balling my eyes out as I type this, I have exams this week and I haven't done any studying, my life is a mess, I have nothing left to live for, please someone help me.
