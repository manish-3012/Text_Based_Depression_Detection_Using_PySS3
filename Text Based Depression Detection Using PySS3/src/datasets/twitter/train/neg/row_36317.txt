Strategy - Get ready in the morning, even if you don't have anywhere to be. (x-post from GetMotivated)  
Thought this might bring a bit of motivation here.

Days off/weekends can be a paradox. Not having to go to work sounds like a great time to get things done or be productive right? And yet, many of us lie in bed for half the day. When we wake up, we mull around the house in shorts and tee shirts, probably watching TV, playing video games, internet, whatever. Before long you have a day wasted.  

So here's a strategy: On a day off, get up at the same time you would have if you had to go to work/school. Don't just get up though. Get ready for your day. Cook breakfast, shower, brush your teeth, get dressed. Do whatever you do to get ready on a normal day.
This gets you ready to take on the world on days you have to work/school, so why not get yourself ready to take on the world on days off too?   
  
This is a great way set your mind in the right state.
