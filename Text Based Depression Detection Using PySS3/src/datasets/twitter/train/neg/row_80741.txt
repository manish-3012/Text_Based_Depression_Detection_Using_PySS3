Oh my godA couple days ago I got a call from collections about a bill, and looked into several other bills that I haven't had the funds to pay and several of my accounts have gone to debt collectors. Hundreds and hundreds of dollars. I know what to do, I don't need financial advice per say, I just need moral support I guess? Because I've made attempts at my life in the past, and I've been doing everything I can to avoid freaking out about this, but I feel like I'm going to snap, and spiral into self hatred. This is the biggest fuck up I've ever made and I genuinely hate myself. I genuinely hated myself before this happened, actually, so now it's so much worse. 

I just want so much to be happy and responsible and think that life is beautiful but how can I ever achieve that if I keep fucking everything up? It's like I go out of my way to sabotage myself. I'm so irresponsible. What the hell is wrong with me. 

Thanks for reading.
