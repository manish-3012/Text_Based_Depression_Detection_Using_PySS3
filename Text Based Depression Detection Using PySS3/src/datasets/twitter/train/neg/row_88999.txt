I'm at my breaking pointI've been depressed for as long as I can remember. It is hard, if not impossible, to find a single moment where I can feel truly happy. I feel inferior to everyone I know and have no positive qualities whatsoever. I just finally have broken away from a group of people I was talking to and just went to a hill to just sit and wait for whatever happens. I have no idea if anyone is looking for me, honestly I want nobody to look. I'm just going to wait here for the inevitable. I don't have a future and I don't care about life anymore. 

Also this may seem a little out of place but I apologize for any formatting as I am on mobile right now.
