Ruining things all over againEverytime I get something good that makes me happy I find some way to ruin it. I wish I was mute so I'd never open this horrible mouth again and destroy what little I have. I can't bear to be like this any longer, all I do is make things worse for everyone around me. I fail everytime I try and I can't take it anymore. All I can think about is my mom saying I make life miserable, all the friendships I've failed, the money I've wasted, and the way I've hurt the person closest to me. I feel like at this point I'm one breath away from finally ending it. I just can't take feeling this way anymore. I'd never meant to hurt anyone the way that I have and I'm sure they would be better off without me.
