I cannot stop thinking about itI've had a major psychotic episode when I was 17 (my doctor claims I have schizoaffective disorder), I couldn't sleep for days in a row (I'd sleep once or twice a week at best, literally). It lasted 18 months, I was way more than exhausted. I lost all my friends, it was "too complicated" for them. I've never made new friends after that. My family didn't care at all (they thought it was "just" some sort of depression, they don't know about the schizo- part). They still don't care. I'm 25 years old now, but since then I have thought about killing myself every single day. It's the first thing I think when I wake up, and the last thing I think before I fall asleep. I can sleep now, but nightmares are still common. I have nobody I could talk to. I'm so damn tired.
