I think Iâ€™m edging closer and closer to killing myselfHey all, first time posting here. Itâ€™s been a rough year and for the past 3 months Iâ€™ve had way too many suicidal thoughts. But it was always just a little thought and no desire for actually doing it. Well since a few days that has changed. Iâ€™ve now planned how Iâ€™m gonna kill myself and Iâ€™ve even thought about the letters that Iâ€™m gonna write. The only thing stopping me is that I donâ€™t want my parents to lose the only daughter that they have, I just donâ€™t want anyone to be traumatised or depressed over my death. Iâ€™m a muslim and my religion forbids suicide so thatâ€™s a reason too. Iâ€™m only 19 and I have no other or personal reason to stay alive or even want to stay alive. All I want is the burden to be off of me, to not obsess over any problem, to not experience this gut wrenching anxiety when I think about the future, to not feel as if Iâ€™m nothing. I just want to walk to the bridge at night, itâ€™s beautiful it has flowers everywhere and I just want to jump off, alone.
