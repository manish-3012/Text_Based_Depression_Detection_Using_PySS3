I've had enough.I've had enough of life.  There's just too much bad and not enough good right now.  It sounds stupid and cliche but their honestly is nothing I look forward to in life or am happy about.  

I have good friends at school, but that's all about to change.  My parents are admitting me to a psychiatric ward in a few days and that will ruin any shreds of hope that I have left. 

I get great grades and have done well on standardized tests but It's just too much stress, sadness, and honestly, fear of the unknown.

I've already made up my mind...I guess I just wanted to let someone know before I do it.  

For me, life's not worth living.

If their is an afterlife, then see you on the other side.
