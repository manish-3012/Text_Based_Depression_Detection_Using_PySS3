I want to watch the world burn.I'm sick and tired of feeling sick and tired.
I'm done having nightmares every night.
I don't want to be weighed down by depression.
I don't want to be made a victim anymore.
I don't want to be part of this world anymore.
.
I didn't choose to be born.

F*#k you world. 

 I never wanted this.
