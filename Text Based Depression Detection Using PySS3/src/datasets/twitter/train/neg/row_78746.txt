Took a small overdose last night while very drunk. What should I do now?Last night I got pretty drunk (not blackout or anything like that) and took about 6-7 one-a-night sleeping pills. I donâ€™t think I was intending to die, and I think deep down I knew nobody would really find out. I feel okay-ish now, just a usual hangover. 

Do I need to go to hospital? If I go, will I get my stomach pumped?
