Iâ€™m alone and manage to mess up whatever happiness I manage to stumble acrossIâ€™m done. Iâ€™ve been alone for so long. I canâ€™t even have a decent conversation online with anyone without fucking it all up. Maybe itâ€™s spur of the moment now, but this feeling always resurfaces. Iâ€™m a 19 year old male, with no real friends. Never a hint of romance. I canâ€™t go out into the world even if I wanted to. Nothing seems to make sense and the world always seems to turn back around and be set against me. I just wish I had some realistic way of doing myself in. So it can stop.
