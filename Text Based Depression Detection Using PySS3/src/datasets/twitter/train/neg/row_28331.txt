I canâ€™t think of any reasons to keep on livingShort version, I feel pretty worthless, I know I come from a more advantaged background than others and that other people would gladly use the resources I have. I just donâ€™t see the worth of me keeping on living. If there is a heaven, then great, I get to go there and be done with life. If not, and I go to hell, what difference does it make, I was gonna end up there anyway. And if there is nothing, and Iâ€™m just a sack of meat thatâ€™s temporarily alive, it really doesnâ€™t matter anyway. Right now my friend just texted me asking if I want to hang out. I enjoy spending time with my friends, I love my family like anyone else. But I keep sinking again and again. I keep getting into these thoughts and moods. Could anyone tell me if Iâ€™m wrong, Iâ€™d love to be wrong. But I canâ€™t see how right now. Thanks

Also if anyone could recommend an easy and quick method of suicide Iâ€™d appreciate it. Iâ€™ve been searching for weeks but I canâ€™t find anything accessible to me that actually leaves me with some semblance of dignity.
