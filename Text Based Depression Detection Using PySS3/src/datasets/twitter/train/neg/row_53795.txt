Overwhelming emotions right nowI have been having a really hard time lately. I seriously don't know how much longer I can deal with the despair. My heart feels every so heavy and I can't breathe sometimes when I think everything. 

Suicide has been on my mind everyday for the past 2 weeks and it feels like I'm constantly trying to convince myself not to hurt myself or do anything too rash. But I feel out of my mind, my heart feels very heavy and I just don't want to do this anymore.

I refilled my prescription yesterday. In a few days time, I'll have a new prescription of sleeping pills and that'll be my backup for when the time comes. I really feel like this is for the best. But for now I'll sleep it off and....see what tomorrow brings. That excuse won't last forever
