If I didnâ€™t work so much Iâ€™d either be dead or better.I have access to a prescription medication that I could overdose on. But my job just keeps me in one spot, I canâ€™t get worse or better.

If I wasnâ€™t working everyday I could kill myself and not feel guilty. Even if I attempted and failed Iâ€™d feel guilty having to tell my boss what happened.

On the other side, if I didnâ€™t have a job I could spend time in a psych ward getting better.
