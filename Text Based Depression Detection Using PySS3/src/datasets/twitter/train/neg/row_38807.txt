My life is void of friends and family. My life is void of friends and family. Everyday is worse than the previous. I could die in my sleep and no one would notice for about a year. Leaving the house for not-work related reasons feel like a punishment and I get drained instantly just thinking about them; my apartment is a prison. At work, sometimes I can only stare at my desk listlessly and think about hanging myself. I have a movie on my desktop that I watch sometimes; his face turns purple then black and then white again. Death terrifies me greatly.

I don't know if I'm suicidal but it sort of feels like I am closer. I don't know what to do
