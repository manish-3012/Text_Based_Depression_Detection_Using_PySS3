I REALLY wanted to finally end itI'm a closeted boy living in an isolated country and it is hell on earth. Society pretends like I don't exist and my father beats me up repeatedly. Being bullied at school and pretty much every other environment and feeling like I will never get out of here. 

I finally got a rope yesterday and felt like it would be much better to be in silence than have all this noise around me and come to find out it wasn't tied good enough. I felt really bad afterwards and cried myself to sleep. This cannot continue
