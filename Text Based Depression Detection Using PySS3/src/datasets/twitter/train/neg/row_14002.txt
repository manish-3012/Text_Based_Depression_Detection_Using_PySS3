No way forwardI am a graduate student without money to cover my studies' costs. I got a shitty job, which takes most of my time, stops me from studying properly, and barely covers my most basic expenses. I am locked in a cycle of shitty work - no time for studies - no money for my expenses. Recently, my partner left me after almost a decade together.

I can't really see a way out. I became a burden to my wife and she left me. Now I am a burden to my friends and parents. I have thought many many many times about ending it all, but it was never so strong, because my problems never seemed so definitive.

Please, I really need help.
