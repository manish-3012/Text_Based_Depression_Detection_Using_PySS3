Disgusted.Every one would die to love me until I become more than my physical appearance. I'm just a toy, sex toy, cum toy. I don't even like sex. I don't even have sex. I watch them all bite their tongues, lick their lips. Stare at me as if I was a piece of meat, a juicy piece of meat. I no longer know when a compliment is genuine or is just another person trying to get in my pants. I've lived miserably all along, if life was fair,  I'd have an unlimited pass to peace, to love and respect. But nah, life isn't like this. Suffering all along doesn't mean you're saved from being dragged into shit.
