crushedIt is like a weight on my chest and shoulders. I know that I want to leave but it would hurt my little girl. I hate her mother everyday for forcing me into a position where my love for my 6 year old keeps me from being at peace. She lied about taking her birth control for 3 months to get pregnant. I was kinda on my way out anyway then that happened and I almost killed myself. I had the gun. Bought it new just for that reason. I couldn't do it. I want to live. But it is always the same. It all degrades back to nothing. Back to the crushing weight. I was really close to doing it before my daughter. Now I can't do it. I try I can't. But the weight. The weight crushes me with every breath. It weighs on my head and shoulders and chest, Until I cannot move. On the couch, not sleeping, not awake, barley breathing. I just wit for the crushing weight to pass so that I can move again. Knowing I cannot kill myself. Knowing I am not happy. Not able to do anything even when not doing anything just makes things worse. I just lay and watch as my world crumbles. Waiting for death that never comes. I am pretty sure this is what hell feels like. God kill me please.
