feel like i'm not worthy of being suicidalI frequently have suicidal thoughts because I have ADHD and anxiety and I lack the motivation to get anything important done. I constantly disappoint myself and I'm tired of feeling like a failure everyday. I've recently found a therapist but she doesn't seem to be helping, and my medication doesn't work the way I want it to either. I want to go to grad school but I feel like in the process of trying to figure out how to function, I'm gonna mess up my GPA so bad that I won't be able to get in. Sometimes I don't see the point in trying.

But I still feel like everyone else's lives are so much harder. Literally everyone nowadays seems to have depression or some shitty home/life situation. I know it's dumb because I can't compare my situation to anyone else's but honestly it just seems like I don't deserve to feel the way I do. Which makes me feel weak, which makes me want to die even more- which makes me feel weak, which.....

it's a never-ending pathetic cycle :/
