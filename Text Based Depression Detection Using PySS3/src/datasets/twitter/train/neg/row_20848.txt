It's never going to happen.I'm never going to have friends, no one's ever going to see me as valid, I'm never going to get a job, and I'm going to have to leave the only place where I feel comfortable next year, and after that, I'll have nowhere to go.

I just want someone to actually care about me. 

I mean, posting here isn't going to do anything. No one's going to help me. No one's going to give me the help I need, which is to find a real friend who can actually tolerate and support me.

Like... if a person wants to do X, if a person's goal is X. And if you think that X is a bad thing, and that X shouldn't be done, and that X is ridiculous, then no matter how much of a nice person you are, you can't support that person whose goal is X. Because you don't believe in their goal. You might think that that person is the best person that's ever lived, and that they can do anything, and you might be constantly in awe of them, and you'll wave any banner they tell you to wave, and retweet anything they tell you to retweet. But if X, their goal, is meaningless to you, if it's offputting to you, if you don't understand it... then you can't support them.

That's basically my situation with people.

&amp;#x200B;

One of many ways to explain it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sick of all the work I put into making my situation and my thoughts palatable to other people.

I'm sick of all the time I put into justifying myself to get a foot in the door. Because either that entry is still denied to me, people still find some reason why I'm the one not doing enough for other people... or I go in and realize the house stinks of trash, and I choose to leave.

And then people tell me that if I ever choose to leave, I can't complain, because beggars can't be choosers. That if I don't love literally anyone who gives me the time of day, then I deserve to be alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just sick of explaining myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want someone to care about me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sick of bending to fit what other people want or need, and that no one actually wants me. No one cares. Like... I want someone to care about me. I want someone to remember me. That's all anyone ever wants. 

People talk about how they don't want to spend holidays alone, I've spent 10 years alone. I've never had anyone spend time with me as a friend since I was a kid, and then it was only because adults made them. No one ever wanted me around.

I have a lot of ideas that I think are good. I think I have a lot to offer, but no one wants to hear it, they just resent me for not being like them.

I mean... at some point, I want to talk about the stories that I want to write... everyone tells me to just shut up and write the novel, but like... every time I read a book, like... you know there are acknowledgements in books, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Because you can't write a book if you don't have any friends.

&amp;#x200B;

You can't just get that emotional fuel by yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

But apparently I have to be the exception and I have to do everything...

&amp;#x200B;

oh my god there was this book... and the acknowledgements section talked about how the writer never wanted to be a writer but they came up with this idea and they kept telling their friend about it, and their friend basically made them write it, and then they made it into a book, and like... every time I think of that I just... feel like the lowest piece of trash that has ever existed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because I'm just completely... worthless.
