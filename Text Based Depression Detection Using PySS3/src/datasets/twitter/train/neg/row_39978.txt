I donâ€™t wanna go to hellThatâ€™s what stops me from killing my self 

Iâ€™m not sure hell Is even real

Iâ€™m 19, and Iâ€™ve lost so many people in my life

Iâ€™m a shadow of my former self

I constantly worry about my younger sisters, where Iâ€™m gonna live, my drug addicted mother, bills, and school 

I keep telling myself Iâ€™m a bitch because millions and millions have it worse

I wanna jump off a bridge while listening to some peaceful music 

I miss my grandma, she always supported me but sheâ€™s gone 

Fuck cancer 

My dad abandoned me altogether, my mom abandoned me mentally and emotionally because sheâ€™s whacked out 

My friends are going up in life

Funny how I busted my ass in high school and got denied from the local university 

Most of my friends go there

I remember graduation

Friends were happy

My grandma died 12 hours after graduation 

Itâ€™s hard 

Please tell me thereâ€™s a solution 

Iâ€™m tired 

Iâ€™m weak 

I wanna cry but canâ€™t cry around friends 

I need a way out 

Iâ€™ll look like a weak bitch

I donâ€™t care 

I miss her

I try getting a girlfriend to be happy 

No girl talks back 

I try being confident like they say

It doesnâ€™t work 

Life is temporary 

They say make the most of it

How can I do that when I need to worry constantly 

If I died Iâ€™d be missed

But not needed 

Life would continue for everyone 

Itâ€™d get better for them

Iâ€™m sad 

What did I do to deserve this

Please grandma come back

Iâ€™m asking for my grandma to come back through a Reddit post 

People will probably read this and reply as a duty 

I suck at everything

Am I just the bad part of natural selection
