Loneliness is killing meMy whole life I've been alone, and unable to connect with people. Where ever i go, whoever i talk to and whoever i try to be i stick out like a sore thumb. I've made a real attempt recently to make friends, go out more, be more social, but it's just made me realize that nobody is know is actually my friend, nobody actually understands or connects with me. Whether i'm hanging out with one person or in a crowd of 20 i feel like i'm alone. 

I feel myself thinking more and more, what is the point of living if you have no-one? Even if i made friends and got a good girlfriend and surrounded myself with supportive people i feel like i'd still have these thoughts and feelings dragging me down all the time. I feel like i could just fade away into non-existence at any minute and nobody would even notice.
