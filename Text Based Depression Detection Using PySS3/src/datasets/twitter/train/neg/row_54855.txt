Constant painMy emotional pain is so persistent and strong that it is almost physical. It's agonizing and I don't know how to stop it. The only thing that takes my mind off it is eating or drinking alcohol but then I gain weight and feel worse about myself. I feel no joy from my hobbies and my creativity and motivation is gone. Talking to people doesn't help, nobody gets it and only I can fix myself in the first place. I feel disconnected from myself, from reality. I don't know who I am and nothing feels real. Only the pain stands out. I feel like a lost broken kid but I can't even cry to my parents because one of them isn't empathetic and the other is dead. I'll never feel motherly comfort again. I've been hurting for years ever since I was in elementary school. I want it all to end. I've lost my childhood, I can't remember anything. I felt so bad I would just resort to escapism and never talk to anyone. But nobody noticed they just thought I was a brat. I was in so much pain. But now I'm an adult, nobody will even pay me any mind for sure now. I'm not ready. I'm emotionally stunted. I can't handle this world.
