Starting to think that thereâ€™s no way out, Iâ€™m gonna do it eventuallyI have lived a depressing life and will never be happy. My depression has consumed me these past 2 days or so. Today itâ€™s been worse, my attitude at work has been shitty. I usually greet people with a smile on my face but today I havenâ€™t smiled once. Iâ€™m now talking under my breath, barely speaking up so Iâ€™m not even sure if people can hear me when I ask how they are doing.

Im just ready to do it. I havenâ€™t done it yet, but Iâ€™m trying to build up the courage to do so. Last night for an hour or so I looked up the most effective ways to commit suicide and the success rate. Definitely choosing handgun. Iâ€™ve started to look at gun permits online. Iâ€™m of age. I havenâ€™t bought one yet but I know when I do then that will be the beginning of the end. I also need to save up a little but I can do it. Looking forward to it. 

Im barely holding on. I donâ€™t know why I havenâ€™t gotten that gun permit yet. Whatâ€™s holding me back? Because I know as soon as i get it, thereâ€™s no going back.
