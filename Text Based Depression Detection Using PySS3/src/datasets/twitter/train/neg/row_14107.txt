Well why should I live?I have done a fair amount of research and nothing has lead me to an answer. I am currently 18 years old, UC Student, part time IT, and CTO, and I honestly do not see a reason to live. So many things on this planet is deadly. Life moves extremely slow. Just reflecting on how long it took just to get to 18yr and thinking about my genetics... it seems painful and awful to live to my late 90s. If I am not depressed and I anxious and if I am not anxious I am depressed. If I am no longer living, it would be as if I never existed. That means, no more people to criticize me, no more things to fail at, no more exhausting days, no more worrying. Sure you can make the argument that someone out there will be sad, but fortunately people go through a grieving process which will allow them to get over it and enjoy their life much faster than I could it I ever could. Plus, we are all going to die anythings so they would have to face it sometime or another. In fact, I am sure being dead would make life easier on people. No one would have to listen to my stupid remarks or ideas. My parents could save up their money since they will not have to help me out. Just so many benefits. The only thing that is really stopping me from doing anything is by the far off chance that their is some kind of hell... but I am thinking now that if that were to be true, it would still be out of my hands. I am just done with all the BS the doctors have been giving me and delaying my treatment. I am tired of making people feel upset, exhausted from not sleeping, and exhausted of never being happy. Like, what kind of person doesn't even smile at their high school graduation. I do not have any friends currently and it is my second year in college, but that is alright since I would not benefit anyone. I am just so done with everything. Life is just boring.
