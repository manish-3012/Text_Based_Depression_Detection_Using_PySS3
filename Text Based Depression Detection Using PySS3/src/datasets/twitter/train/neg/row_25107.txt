A Place To Say GoodbyeI.. Am just done. 32, male.. Single. Floated between many jobs, never earned over 30k with a degree even. What a failure from a white middle class family. No friends, lost any desire due to recovery. Numerous addictions, bad habits, and compulsive activities. I do not support war, or those that enlist to murder for money. The blind conservative support is unfathomable. I am done fighting. Done trying. My life went downhill as soon as it was up to me to make decisions. Maybe that's why I wanted to type this out. Reddit was the one place I could come to for support, and now even here I have lost it. 

Please, if you are younger... Make good decisions. I don't know what those might look like, because I obviously did not make them in my life. My mind was corrupted by hope. Maybe give in to the system. The harder you fight it, they will win. Kill whomever your country desires, no matter how corrupt and become a paid hero for life. Money is everything. I hope you are physically attractive. Forget intelligence, it will only get you in trouble. Do not question. Just follow blindly and maybe you will have peace in your life....
