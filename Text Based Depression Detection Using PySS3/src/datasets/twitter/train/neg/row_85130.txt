Wish this cycle would end...I don't know what to do anymore, I'm nearly 30 years of age, and I feel like I live in an endless painful cycle.  I'm so so lonely, and I work a job I hate with a passion.  I'm just so tired of it all, I work, sleep, work, sleep, just to get payed and bills take it all away.  I'm tried of waking up to just go to that hell of a job 6 days a week, tired of doing the same damn thing, tired of being fucking broke, and lonely.  Been thinking about just quitting, and watch the small empire I built, my car, my credit, just flush down the drain, then taking my gun and blowing my brains out.  I just want it to end, in any means necessary.  Tired of being tired...  Been job searching for months , maybe a year or so now to no success.
