Im not okay right now.[17/F]

I've been depressed for probably nearly half my life now. At this point it's hard to imagine being happy. Every day I see my friends living a carefree life, but every single thing I fucking do is ruined by either anxiety or just not being able to get myself off the couch. 

Somewhere during the last schoolyear my anxiety got to the point where I had panic attacks basically every other day, I ended up not going to school for over six months and I told myself it would be better afterwards. Suprise, it isn't. I don't see a future for myself, I don't know how I'm ever going to get anywhere because I'm fucking useless and there's litterally nothing to change about it. The past few weeks I've been thinking about suicide basically every day. Imagining how happy I would be to just let myself fall out of the window. 

It's been this bad before, but back then I always felt more of a barrier holding me back. Right now I have no clue how to go on. 

I'm lucky to have a supportive family, but I don't know how to convey that I don't want their comforting. I simultaneously want to suffer, and want the suffering to end. I'm so lost right now and I don't know what to do. 

I have no clue why I'm posting this, but I just want to get it off my chest.
