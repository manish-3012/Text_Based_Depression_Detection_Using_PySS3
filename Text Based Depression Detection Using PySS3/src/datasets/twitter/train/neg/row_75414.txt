Giving myself a week to figure out a reason to live.I'm at that low point where I never thought I'd be again. We're all familiar with it. The urges to off myself are getting harder and harder to combat, and I've already formulated a plan that would be guaranteed lethal and easy to pull off.


But I don't want to do it just yet. I don't know why, but I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can possibly find a way to justify my existence in this world. I almost died twice as an infant, and I've always wondered why I deserved to live.


I'm not sure what to do or how to go about this. Don't know who to reach out to or how to examine things. Or maybe I'll find that I really should just vanish from all my acquaintances and remove myself from this earth. If I can't figure it out after a week, welp, I'll just take a few days trying to get my affairs in order and make amends to all the people I've burdened and offended before I pass on to the next life.


So where do I start? How do I determine if it's worth it to be here, or if it would have been better for everyone if I had just died when I was supposed to?
