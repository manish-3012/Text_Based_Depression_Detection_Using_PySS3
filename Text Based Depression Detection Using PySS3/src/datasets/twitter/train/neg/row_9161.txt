Please help my friendMy friend's family is a bunch of incompetent assholes who refuse to acknowledge her sister's multiple suicide attempts and won't commit her. Her sister is 21-22 so she would need to commit herself but she doesn't want to. 


My friend is so lost and she's not living at home right now (she and I are both spending the year outside the US) so she can't do anythingâ€‹ to help her sister. Is there anything we/my friend can do? She's 18. There has to be a way to get her sister help right?? She's so scared the next time there's an attempt at suicide, her sister will succeed and she can't do anything to stop it and her family is literally just not acknowledging it as a problem. 


I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub I just don't know where else to ask for help :( please help me and my friend and her sister
