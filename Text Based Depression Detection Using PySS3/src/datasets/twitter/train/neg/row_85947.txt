Tonight is one of those nights.Tonight is one of those nights. I want to just die. I threw away all of my blades and pills. I can't see my boyfriend because his mom is being a dick. I need him more than ever. I just got very suddenly depressed. I have been having a rough day already. I have been dealing with pretty bad panic attacks and soreness all over my body all day. There has been so much going on in my life and I am trying to work through it and it's so so difficult to deal with between school, both of my jobs, And just living. And just thinking of the future is so terrifying. I just want to die. I am so sad I can't even cry. I am almost mentally numb which is a really bad place for me to be in. Last time I felt this bad I ended up cutting myself. But that was about a week ago. it's been a really rough week.
