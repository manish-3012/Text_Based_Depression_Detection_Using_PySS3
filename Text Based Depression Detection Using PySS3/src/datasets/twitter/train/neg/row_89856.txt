I want to wake up while my parents are asleep and just go into the kitchen and stab myself with one of the cooking knives.There's no point in life, it's finally come to me. Third time posting here, third time needing someone to talk to. Nothing helps.

My life is not worth living anymore.

EDIT: I don't know what's come over me, but the anger and frustration pent up inside me has dried up. All that left where the ocean once stood is a sea of delicious salt. This salt is life, and it can be a positive or negative. You can get too much and be bogged down, once this happens you just gotta cook a new dish. Start all over, because once you get the perfect amount, the dish you cook will be the best the world has ever seen.
