I've been trying so hardI have a weird thought process. I want to die but only by my hands and it's been like that for the longest but lately I've been feeling so defeated that i wish anything would take me out. I dont care anymore. Plus i have been hesitating to end it because i made a promise to my sister and i dont want to hurt her or the rest of my family. I keep trying to grab at hope but I fall right back into the same mindset. I dont feel like I'll ever be good enough and maybe all this is the universe's way of telling me I need to go through with it.
