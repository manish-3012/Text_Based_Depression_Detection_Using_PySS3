I need help.I'm lonely. I don't have friends. And I have an abusive semi-boyfriend who takes advantage of my loneliness. I want to be happy. And believe me, I'm trying. Him and I had an episode today and I'm feeling shattered. I want to be happy. But I keep falling into these relationships I don't want to be in. Somebody help me. I want to kill myself. I used to cut myself and I simply don't have the emotional stamina to do that to myself again. Help me. I'm so tired. :'( I feel dead inside. I can take so much more of this. I'm slowly turning into a hard person. I want to be happy and normal. Someone help me.
