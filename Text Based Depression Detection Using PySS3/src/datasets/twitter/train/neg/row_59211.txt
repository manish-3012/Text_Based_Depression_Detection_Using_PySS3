I don't know what I'm doing anymoreI've been depressed for years and it's only getting worse. My life keeps falling apart.

I wasted 3 years on a useless college music program. I don't even like music anymore so it was an even bigger waste. Then I did 2 years adult high school to try to get into University for computer science. Got in... except now I've pretty much failed out of university since it's so demanding(Google UofT CS POSt, you basically need an 85% average to get into second year).

I have a 75% average so I figured that's a decent mark and I'd go with my backup plan of transferring to a different University... except I got rejected. Now I feel stupid. I guess 75% is terrible after all. The world doesn't want me here because I'm dumb.

Now I have no ambitions left or any goals and I'm at a dead end. I'm in debt from all the wasted time I spent in school and all I can get are shitty minimum wage jobs. Actually I can barely even get those jobs because I spent almost a year looking for the shitty job I have right now. Oh and I have what is probably thousands of dollars of dental work I need to get done. Broken teeth, cavities. I'm doomed to be poor forever.

On top of all that I don't have any friends. Never had a girlfriend. Virgin at 27. Of course no one wants to be my friend because I'm too depressed and negative. Ugly too with the broken front tooth. So I couldn't even smile if I wanted too or people would get grossed out. And extremely skinny since I don't eat.

I'm on anti-depressants, seeing a social worker and going to a group cognitive behavior therapy thing but none of that stuff is working. They can't fix me when I have no future ahead of me.

I can't even go out in public any more. I see everyone else enjoying their lives and I get jealous and it makes me angry. Then I go home and I hate myself. What the fuck am I doing?
