I fell in love with a married woman.I fell in love with my best friend, who happens to be a married woman. Not ling after she says she fell in love with me too. For 10 months we were "together" trying to figure out how for her to leave her bad marriage. She told me all the time how horrible her husband is and how she wanted to live life with me. She came clean about a month ago to her husband, telling him about me. He guilted her into staying. Saying she disobeyed God and him and now she owes it to him to stay. Well she continued to tell me she believes God will let her leave someday. I found out tonight her husband told her to leave. Literally got a suitcase and put it in front of her, only for her to decide to stay. She has also gone back to sleeping with him. But in the emails she was telling me these things she was also saying how she continues to pray everyday for God to bring us together. I don't know what to do. Her husband threatened to put a restraining order on me. I feel so guilty and also at the same time so hurt by the constant back and forth "I believe we will be together, I need to stay." It's driving me insane and I don't know what to believe anymore. The constant pain is unbearable.
