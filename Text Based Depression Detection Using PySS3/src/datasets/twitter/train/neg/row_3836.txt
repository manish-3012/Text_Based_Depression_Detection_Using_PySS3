Really really thinking about it againBeen an awful couple days. Lost the love of my life, found out my university unenrolled me without telling me, and Iâ€™ve realized I donâ€™t have much of a future. 130k in student loans, and no one to talk to about it any of it. 

Never felt so alone, and Iâ€™ve been through some a lot. Just thinking thereâ€™s no point anymore, especially without her. Donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do, but I needed to get all this out. 

Thanks
