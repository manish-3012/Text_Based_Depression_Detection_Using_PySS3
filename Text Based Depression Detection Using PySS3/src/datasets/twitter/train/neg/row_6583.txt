I'm chilling with VodkaI fucking dread this. I have a date for myself, you know a death date, that I decided. But it's only August 8th! I've given this shit like 10 days then someone on here told me Push It Back! I was like okay when I'm 29. I am already regretting this. I know the people around me are shady, I know how this will end. I don't know why I keep trying!!! And yes, I'm working on drinking my problems away who gives a fuck what happens. I'm trying. AMERICA IS FUCKED.
