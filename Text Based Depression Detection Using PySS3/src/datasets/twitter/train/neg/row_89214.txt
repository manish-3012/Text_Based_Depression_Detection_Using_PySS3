Iâ€™m finished, no one can do anything.My â€œbest friendâ€ pulled the last straw. We were on the phone yesterday, and we were just talking. Then my little cousins came in the room screaming. I went out and yelled at them. When I returned, she said she was like â€œGirl you alive?â€ I was like â€œSadly.â€ I have very good hearing, and I vividly remember her muttering, â€œI want you to die too.â€ In shock, I asked â€œWhat was that?â€ â€œOh nothing.â€ I immediately hung up. Sobbing, I went to grab my box knife. I dragged it over my arms, but light enough to not make a mark. I knew her since 3rd grade. Iâ€™m a senior.

And Iâ€™m ending my life tomorrow.
