I fucked up and feel like I only have one choice now.I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I quit my job and now I can't find another. I'm sorry that the house we've worked for, the car we scrimped and saved to get a down payment on, and everything else will go away because I'm pathetic. 

I'm sorry that I couldn't stay there anymore and take the abuse of my employer. I'm sorry that I didn't find something else before I left. I'm sorry that it's been a month and I still haven't gotten any call backs. I'm sorry that I failed us. 

I worked hard to be the man I never could be when we met. I kept up the facade for a long time. Now I'm tired. I'm exhausted and I can't look on anymore. At this point the only choice I see is to remove myself from the equation so you have a better chance to be with someone who deserves you and can give you the things you want. 

I'm sorry that it had to end like this.
