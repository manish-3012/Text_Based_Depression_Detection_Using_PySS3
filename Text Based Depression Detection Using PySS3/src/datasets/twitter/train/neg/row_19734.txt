Planning it, but hurt right nowI dont really have anyone else to talk to about this, will probably figure out a way to set up my family to be ok after it's done, but need to get it out right now. 

I'm a failure. And not in the "woe is me" way. I know I can't actually do the things I need to do to make my wife better, my sons happy, my daughter a whole and complete person when it's time for them to be "adults". I'm marginally "there" when I'm not at work and when I'm at work I barely know what I'm doing. Pretty much decided tonight that I would end the years of depression and let my wife (who is becoming very successful) raise these kids without all of the hangups I've developed over the years. I know it will be hard for her, but she is a resilient woman and made it to where she is by sheer hard work. I can barely stand to wake up and function. I dont get it. I had dreams. I had aspirations. I had ideas. But I'm fucked up in the head. I only hope I havent damaged my kids in the process. Dont really know what else to say, this might be the most expressive I've been in years.
