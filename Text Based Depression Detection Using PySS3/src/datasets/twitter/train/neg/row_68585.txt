Soon.22M. I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe I want help? Maybe just someone to talk to? Or to just vent? I don't know. I plan on doing it either tomorrow or Tuesday. 

For those of you that are wondering how:
1,200mg of Lamictal
1,050mg of Propranolol
Hell I might even throw some Paxil in there 

Why?
I guess it all goes back to when I was a child when I was molested by my mother (that feels so good to actually say considering I've never told anyone). My mother was also a drug addict and an alcoholic who would "spank" me and my sister on a daily basis. My father? Well he was at work a lot of the time. When they got divorced he turned into an alcoholic, narcissistic asshole who would verbally abuse me most days.

Which leads to now. I have debilitating social anxiety, general anxiety, depression, bipolar II, and body dysmorphia. 

I just thought I would share my story. I have been on this sub reddit for a while and would like to thank all of you and I hope that all of you that are struggling find some peace.
