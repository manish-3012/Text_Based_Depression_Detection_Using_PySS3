can't even write a proper noteBeen sharpening the knife for the past hour or so while thinking of what to write in my suicide note and I'm too much of a failure to do that. Just that grinding noise of the blade going against the stone, I've probably been doing that incorrectly as well, wrong angle or whatever, no wonder nobody ever respects me, adults, teens, children, hell, I don't even respect myself, why should anybody else? Just some useless, good for nothing, unskilled and boring piece of shit. Atleast I'm pale and skinny so cutting along the veins won't be a problem, finally something I'll do right.
