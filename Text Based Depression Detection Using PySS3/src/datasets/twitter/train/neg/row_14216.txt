I have nothing keeping me hereI have C-PTSD, have been through horrific shit. Years of therapies and working on it never helps. If anything, it just made things worse. 

My family contributed to my trauma, so I have no family, no friends. No kids or pets relying on me. No career prospects, nothing I enjoy.

The shit Iâ€™ve been through destroyed me. I feel like Iâ€™m already dead. I just need to finish the job. 

This isnâ€™t even out of desperation. Or feeling like thereâ€™s no way out. I *want* to go. Iâ€™m ready to go. Iâ€™ve had good times, Iâ€™ve had bad times. Iâ€™ve achieved a lot. Iâ€™ve traveled a lot. I finished my bucket list. Iâ€™m satisfied with the life Iâ€™ve had. Thereâ€™s nothing more Iâ€™d like to do. 

I know how I want to go, I just donâ€™t have the supplies yet.
