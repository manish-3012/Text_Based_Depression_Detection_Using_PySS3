I just don't know what to do anymore.I kept trying almost all my life. I came to realize that I would be alone and nothing really matters. Then she came into my life. I was happy I thought I was with someone who could bring me back from this dark place. Until one day she said "I think you need to go see a psychiatrist." I was told this before and I thought if I ever found that one person who I could love and be loved by so much I wouldn't need a psychiatrist. But as soon as she said that I fucking died inside. That was almost a year ago of our 4 year long relationship. I thought I moved past it. And now I completely fucked everything up. I ended up just like my piece of shit biological father who cheated on my mom and left us. I did something that I thought I could never do the one thing I hated so much. I cheated on her. I instantly regretted it and I wanted to know why the hell did I do that. I told her the same day and she cried. We were suppose to leave for a trip across the country but I fucked it up. She said we are on a break and she needs her space and we'll talk when she comes back in a week. I don't know what to do. I hate myself so much. I came to the conclusion that even if by some miracle she takes me back it won't be remotely similar to what we had before. I know that it would just be a shell of what we had and everyday wouldn't be the happiness we had. I told her once, "My life is yours because I was so ready to die and just leave this place, but you saved me I'm happy with you." And now I fucked it up. I already wrote a text telling her that I wouldn't hurt her anymore. She would heal and go on to have a better and happier life than she could ever have with me. That she should forget about me. That I'm sorry and I love her. 
I tried twice and almost went all the way the second time. I can't keep this up anymore. I'm sorry.
