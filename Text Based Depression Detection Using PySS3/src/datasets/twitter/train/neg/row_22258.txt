21 with no family, no money and endless mental illness - I wish I could cease to existI was stupid enough to try overdosing two years ago and ended up in a shitty NHS psych unit where i was left to rot 
I'm two years behind at uni when I used to be a fucking child prodigy
abused as a kid but managed to escape
no money to live off no matter how much i work 
i feel okay for a bit and then it comes back the bipolar fucking awfullness
but overwhelmingly I am so so lonely. I have nobody who understands, who I can confide in and will care 
I have no way of killing myself so i'll just take a walk through a rough neighbourhood at night and hope i get stabbed for my smartphone
