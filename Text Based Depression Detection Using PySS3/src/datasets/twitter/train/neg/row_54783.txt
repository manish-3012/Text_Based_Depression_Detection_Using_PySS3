#It feels like god doesn't want me to live or be happyHey friends ðŸ˜„, I am a 12 year old boy who wants to live a happy life , but god doesn't want me to live, my family never encourages me to do something, they just don't seem to care! Studying using online schooling is hard, could be because this is my first time. You know my brother could not study because it was hard for him so came online exam and my mom thought he was hopeless so she let him cheat, I didn't though ,it would've gotten easy, but I chose not to, so the results came I got 48/50,36/50,34/50,46/50 etc, the exam was hard, but my parents got so mad at me for getting bad marks, my dad even beat me with a belt,(please do not leak it into the media I don't want my brother's or sister's future to be bad like me)idk what to say I did what I had to with honesty,I just want to die now because you know some people only see the marks and not the honesty or hardwork.
I only want to die now. Life is not going easy on me.
