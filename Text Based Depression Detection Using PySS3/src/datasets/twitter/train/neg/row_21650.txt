I think that now it's about time, I'm finally ready to kill myselfI've prepared everything from a very long time, I'm tired, I'm so tired of trying to change everything but it never works out. Therapy won't work, my family is ashamed of me, what should I do? I just want someone to remember me the good way, I wish I could leave a legacy behind me, but I'm not good enough for that. I wrote everything that was in my mind, it's in a really pretty book which I will leave by my desk with a goodbye note in some days. I will leave my philosophy behind, that's all I wanted. I was about to take a very especial science course, I worked hard to get selected but now I just feel like empty again, so empty that I don't want to go. There's no one I can turn to, I've tried so many times to just get the help, but this pain, hallucinations and trauma is never going away, it's impossible to live like this, with the lights on when I sleep, with the fear of getting touched or hugged even by my own family, it's weird, I feel disgusted all the time, I feel that it makes me mediocre sometimes. I feel so much, I'm so useless and stupid. The only place where I felt ok was studying, singing and playing D&amp;D. Seems like I don't enjoy it anymore, not even that. It's just that since I was raped things started getting worse, I've always been an emotional and closed person, I'm always in my head, but now I'm just a broken little shit, I'm a burden to my friends, they get uncomfortable when I talk about my feelings, my mom thinks I'm possessed because sometimes I hallucinate shadows and I feel really weak, I know there's people that have it worse than me, I now I shouldn't be that sad, but I can't anymore. I'm done.
