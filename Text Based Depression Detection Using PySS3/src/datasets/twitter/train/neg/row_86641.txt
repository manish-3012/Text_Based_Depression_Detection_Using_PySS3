It might be my last week alive.I realise that I've been posting here a lot, but I guess the things that a stranger on the internet says to comfort me are a lot nicer than the things I've had said to me IRL.
I'm just so lonely. I'm pretty sure that I'm going to die alone. Every relationship I've had has ended because of how fucked up I am. Which fucks me up even more. No one wants me. I see all the people around me finding people and ending up in great relationships and I can't help but think of how no one wants me. If I'm going to spend my life alone I might as well end it soon to save myself from further heartbreak down the road. 
I don't enjoy anything at all. Nothing makes me happy. I feel empty. I've lived my life making others happy and doing stuff for others, but whenever I need someone I get nothing. 
I want to die, but I can't bring myself to do it. I planned on drinking a bottle of vodka and taking a handfull of pills the other night but all I did was drink, cry, and then fall asleep.
I don't want to do this anymore. I just want to end it all.
