I think Iâ€™m cursedIve had cptsd and a bunch of other bs for a while now but apparently thatâ€™s not enough. The only things I had going for me were playing guitar and FPS games at a high level but that all ended from wrist problems that just wonâ€™t go the fuck away. I canâ€™t even sleep because of Heath problems and I just feel like the worlds against me. I have zero good memories because of how many times Iâ€™ve fucked up itâ€™s like I can never pick the right things to say or do I feel pathetic. When i graduated I stopped texting first and never heard from anyone again which hit me pretty fucking hard. I always had a feeling I was just there and no one really cared but it still hurt way too much. Iâ€™m feeling like Iâ€™m way to mentally unstable to even try to put my self out there because I donâ€™t want to act 24/7 just to have a life. The few people Iâ€™ve gone to for help just ghosted me so Iâ€™m just going to suffer for a little while longer until I get the courage to end it.
