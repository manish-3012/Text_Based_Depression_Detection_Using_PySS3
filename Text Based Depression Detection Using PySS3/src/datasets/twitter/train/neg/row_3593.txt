I want to do it, but...What's gonna happen to my mom?!? How will she find me laying in bed after I'll take all the pills. If not her, I wouldn't hesitate.

She's so disappointed in me, I can see it in her eyes -- but she won't tell me that face-to-face because she's afraid I'm going to harm myself...

She's making breakfast in the other room and asks why won't I eat and how I am suppose to tell her that it is so pills that I want to overdose on would work more effectively?.. D;

Wtf am I suppose to do??? I lived long enough, why didn't somebody just kill me!!...

She has no one! She only lives and suffers for me, and I just happen to be a depressed piece of shit. She doesn't deserve this, maybe she would actually be better if I died...

At least she'll have our beautiful cat after I pass away... I'm sorry mom :''''(
