Help. Please. Please.I'd copy-paste other posts but what is the fucking point?
I am not an English native speaker. I am a whatever from Argentina, "23 F". Currently dissociating and pretty sure I'll either overdose on Clonazepam &amp;  alcohol (pretty hard to do, I am aware but it's not intentional) or just.. die? I feel like dying today. Literally, as in: this is it. 

Even forgot why I started this post anyway. Lmao. Have a good one, y'all.
