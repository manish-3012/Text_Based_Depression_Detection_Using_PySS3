I didnâ€™t asked to be here
Obviously, nobody asks to be born into this world. I certainly didn't, but here I am at 14 years old. Simply put, I objectively dislike the world and society. I didn't ask to have to need participate in society and to work in school, but of course most people will just say I'm lazy for not wanting to work. Can they really just not wrap their heads around that concept? How can I get over this involuntary existence without deep downbeing miserable every second of my life until I die? Again. I DID NOT ask to be a part of this, but since I'm here I have no choice other than to work and he miserable until I die. I feel so stuck and I also feel that I've never actually heard a real answer to these feelings other than "well duh nobody asks to be born just get over it". What the fuck do I do with that?
