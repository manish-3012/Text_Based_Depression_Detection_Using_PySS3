Back to where I was nearly a year agoAbout a year ago this May I posted on another account about how I wanted to die because I messed up my relationship among other things. I then sorted things out with her and everything was great which I updated on.

Now we are taking kind of a break because yet again I cannot be a good person. I always just do shit my own way without thinking of her feelings and opinions.

We have been talking all day and she says she loves me still but she is not sure if she can believe that I can be that person again. I had already promised her this but I just took her for granted.

We had an abortion a few months ago which I was always for but I did say it was her choice. We had it but she told me how much she regretted it after and I do too as I know we would be a happy family by now and would be getting married in one month.

Now all of that is gone or in doubt and I have nothing to show for my life.

I just want to end it but I am also scared to end it. I live near a large bridge that connects Wales and England so it is always an option for me but I don't know what is left for me in life if we end.

I am a bit of a loner and so is she but I don't blame her for wanting to end it. I have fucked it up so many times
