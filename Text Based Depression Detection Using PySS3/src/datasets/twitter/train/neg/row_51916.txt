Another feeling of pure loneliness.I've felt horribly lonely for a while now. I understand that feeling of no one caring to talk to you once you graduating high school now. It sucks. 

I am losing hope in everything I do. I can barely convince my self to go out in public because I am convinced I am a fool. I get very anxious when talking to strangers and I stumble on my words all the time. I hate myself dearly, I sometimes feel passionate about it. 

My life is lame. I have a job, which keeps me busy, but it makes me depressed sometimes too. I work at summer camps as an assistant and just seeing the joy of a child reminds me how stripped of my childhood I was. My family took it from me and I hate it. I should be going to college this fall, but I am just not motivated. My dad doesn't want me to leave the house (because he thinks I cannot afford student living), but I don't know if I can stay here in this place I have to call "home".

I miss feeling special in the eyes of someone. It felt so good to be cared about truly. Sure, someone is going to say I am cared about, but do they even know the last time I didn't have to start a conversation? I always feel like I am begging for love from people and I hate it. I miss feeling like I could have someone smile by just saying hello. I miss just being loved. I feel so fucking alone and isolated from everyone.
