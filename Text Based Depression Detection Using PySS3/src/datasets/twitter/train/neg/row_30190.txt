I want to disappearIt's been 5 years of intermittent suicidal feelings. My emotional damage is just hurting people. My studies have gone to shit. I'm covered in cuts that don't even allow me to wear short-sleeved shirts. I want to end it finally. For my good and for the good for others. I am an abomination.
