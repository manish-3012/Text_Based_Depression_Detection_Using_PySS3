So many of us wanting to die every dayI come here often. I come here when I think "yes, I've decided now". I come here wanting to leave behind something. What's life if you leave nothing behind, right? But you can't leave anything behind with friends or family because we're repeatedly told we will hurt them by killing ourselves. So the only course of action is, try your best for your friends and family to have as little memory of you as possible, but leave a memory with strangers. 

I'm a doctor. First, my job made me ill - the hours, the stress, the repeated infections from colleagues and patients (but especially colleagues). Then I got CFS/ME taking medication for my depression and suicidality. Now I got sick again in March from a colleague. I have begged work to let me do some things remotely - meetings and telephone consultations to happen from home (as they do for many of my colleagues who have different supervisors) but my supervisor doesn't agree with this. So here it is, once again I have to play with my health, go out and risk COVID-19 or some other infections just for some phone calls to people or to type up letters. I can't even stand for more than half an hour but sure let's make it worse again.

I tried to apply for jobs, even as a secretary, for the past year. No luck. Now with the pandemic there aren't even any jobs. My family all lives abroad. Their country's borders are closed. I have no friends - my health drove them all off. Probably not helped by my charming depressive personality. 

I've made all preparations already. I've started to say goodbye to a few people. Letters, finances, everything is taken care of. I'm relieved everything is ending finally. I just wanted to leave some memory of myself somewhere. To say that this happens to doctors too. We get depressed too. We get sick too. And like everyone else here, there is nobody to take care of us either. 

Thank you for reading, and goodbye.
