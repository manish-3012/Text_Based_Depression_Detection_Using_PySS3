Life isn't fair.Didn't ask to be born yet here i am. i also didn't ask to be born with this ugly face either.

it's so amazing how much your life can be altered just because how attractive you are, by something that doesn't matter or should matter yet it does. People look more kindly on attractive people. they are more friendly looking. they don't even have to try to be loved. being born unattractive leads you to a life of being rejected, depression and loneliness and you cannot change that. what is the point in living if you were a failure from conception?
