I'm brokeI owe my electric company $230 and my landlord is coming by for rent tomorrow. I just barely made enough for rent (after my gf asked her mom for some help) I know I'm not gonna be able to pay that bill until I get my next pay check in 2 weeks. I have my tax return coming but that's just gonna go right back into bills. Basically I'm just stressed about this week. I have no money. No food and 2 people to feed. I feel like such a failure as a boyfriend and a person. At the same time I dont want to continue living to work. I hate where I'm at at this point of my life. Resent myself even. I put myself in this hole and if I dont get out of it soon there's gonna be one in my head.

Sorry for scattered thought I'm just hungry.
