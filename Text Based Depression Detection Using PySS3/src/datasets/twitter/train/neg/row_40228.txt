Got told off by a guy in a passing car for crossing the road, wish I had been knocked over and killedWas just walking in the area and needed to cross the road. After I had, some guy in a car just yelled at me 'THAT'S NOT A PEDESTRIAN CROSSING, BE CAREFUL!' I just wanted to scream 'do I look like I give a shit?  I don't care if I live or die' walked away nearly in tears, so tired of being lonely and just living.
