Anyone in or near Toronto able to get me a firearm? I'll pay.I can't go for the permit anymore to acquire one legally since I tried to kill myself the first time. 

I could always try hanging myself again. But something about a bullet to the brain just seems so much easier. 

Can anyone help me out?
