Things arenâ€™t looking good.Iâ€™ve been going through a lot recently, and have a bad history behind me. Was hospitalized for suicide 5 times in the past, and recently an attempt a few months ago. My friend caught me with a gun to my head last time.

But Iâ€™m back there. Iâ€™ve contemplated overdosing with a variety of pills. I canâ€™t talk to my parents about it. They just rant about religion. I canâ€™t talk to my friends, only one of them understands and heâ€™s going through a lot right now. 

Iâ€™m really trying to distract myself with games/Warhammer/SCA(armored combat), but I donâ€™t enjoy anything anymore.

Ive been abusing sleeping meds to sleep all day when I get off of work. It helps keep the bad thoughts away since my depressions meds donâ€™t work. (Yes Iâ€™ve tried a few different ones)

Tl;dr Iâ€™m going to try something soon. Iâ€™m just sick of it all. Tired of trying.
