Nobody cares but I just want to dieI'm sure no one will read this just like my other posts but I'm just done living like this. I'm miserable and I don't think that will ever change. I don't know when or how but I'm going to end it. I can't go on living in constant emotional pain and I can't change my thoughts and feelings so I don't have any other options. Living hurts too bad.
