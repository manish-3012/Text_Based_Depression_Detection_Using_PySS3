Idk how to feel. And I'm drunkTrigger warning for selfharm

My psychologist found out  can't be admitted into a long term mental hospital, but I may be admitted one of these days into an urgent hospital. So I'm sad and happy at the same time. 

I kinda planned to kms tonight, with drinking and cutting. But at the same time I know I should hold on. I guess I'm drunk at the moment cuz of drinking vodka. I'll probably delete this post when I wake up.

So I know I'm not thinking straight atm. But I had the suical thoughts before drinking so that's not a reaction cuz of the alcohol. I'm sorry if I've upset anyone. I probably gonna be okay. I have a good friend who helps me through everything and a psychologist trying everything to get me to a place safe against myself. I just hope I'll be admitted tomorrow cuz idk if I can hold on another day when I already am about to die this night. 

But I'm not gonna die. I'm going to sleep now I guess. Don't worry. How did I even type this post. I can't read properly.
