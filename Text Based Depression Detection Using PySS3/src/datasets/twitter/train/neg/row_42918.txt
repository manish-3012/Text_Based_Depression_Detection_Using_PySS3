Why should I bother with life anymore? I'm not special in any way.I'm sick of continuing to go on like this day after day. There isn't any point in continuing to live like this anymore when all there is to look forward to is suffering.

I hate my current job and it has destroyed any hope I have for my future career prospects. Even if my current job is pretty different from what I am going to college for, it has kind of destroyed what passion I have for it and I don't want to continue doing this my entire life anymore.

I don't want to be trans and I don't want to transition but if I don't do it then I'm going to just kill myself as there is nothing positive about being male.

I'm nobody special and the world would go on with or without me. What point is there to even going on when nobody really cares? This post is probably going to be mostly, if not entirely, ignored by everyone else anyway so why do I even bother reaching out?
