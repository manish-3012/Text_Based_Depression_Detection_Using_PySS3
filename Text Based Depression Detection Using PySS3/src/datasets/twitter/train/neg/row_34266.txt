it does not get betternearly 21. 

10 years of depression, anxiety, self harm and self hatred, unstable relationships and unstable emotions, 3 hospitalisations amidst 9 suicide attempts, bouts of bulimia, bouts of anorexia, binge drinking to numb the pain, meaningless sex to numb the pain, feeling like a failure, feeling hopeless, praying for death every single day.

it does not get better. i used to think my pain would fade as I exited my teenage years, but everything aches more, my entire body aches every day. it does not get better, it gets worse. i've started hallucinating a little now too. i'm losing my fucking mind and i want everything to stop.
