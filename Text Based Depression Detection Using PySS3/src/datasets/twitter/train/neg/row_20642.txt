Iâ€™m failing school and itâ€™s making me feel worse and worse every dayI canâ€™t fucking handle it anymore. I canâ€™t even get myself to get out of bed let alone do school work. And itâ€™s giving me so many urges like so many. Like if I feel like I canâ€™t self harm Iâ€™ll feel like I wanna get high or drunk or just something. I was so close to abusing my meds but one of my friends talked me out of it. And I did something really fucking stupid and illegal and it could probably ruin my life if someone finds out about it. The last time I was at school I literally brought a little baggie with 3 bandages and one of my razors in it just in case I need to cut. I thought the worst part of my depression already happened but no that was just a teaser for how it is now. Iâ€™m only 17 and I had such a promising future. But I ruined it. I donâ€™t wanna continue doing anything anymore but I have to I literally have to. Iâ€™m so exhausted. I just want a break.
