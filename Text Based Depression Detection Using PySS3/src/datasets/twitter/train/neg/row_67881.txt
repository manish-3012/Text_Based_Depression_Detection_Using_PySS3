Where is the logic in depression and suicidal thoughts?I mean, animals dont get depressed or wants to kill themselves, do they? Sure they might get sad when their friend dies.. But wanting to kill themselves? Im in this situation where I've been sick for almost 2 years and the doctors do not find out whats wrong with me. I only get worse and its slowly killing me. The doctors dont give me the medication I need and nothing goes my way. I feel like Im just watching my family live their lives while I have to wait. Wait for what? Im getting better? Cuz I dont. I cant. Not by myself. Doctors wont help. So what am I gonna do? If I were a dog Id be put down. Im completely useless to humanity and Im suffering so whats the point in all this? I really wish I werent born so I didnt have to live through this. Im suicidal, but at the same time Im afraid of killing myself, Ive been in this deep depression before as I have Aspergers and am Bipolar, so why me? Everyone in my family is healthy. They never had a longlasting sickness or mental illnesses to deal with. I was healthy before this. Mentally troubled, but physically healthy. Why do I deserve this "life" when Im not even living it. Its hard enough as it is and now this shit comes and fucks me over. Where is the reason and solution? I dont have the answers to these answers Im afraid. 
I just needed to get all of this off my chest as nobody seems to understand my situation and suffering, not among my family atleast.

If anyone has an answer to any of these questions or is in a similar situation, please comment. Thanks for reading.
