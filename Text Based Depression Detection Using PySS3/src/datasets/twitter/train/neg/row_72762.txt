Thanks guys, I think you may have saved my lifeSo about a month ago I came on here fully expecting for it to be the last day of my life. The last thing on my to do list was to get 31 flavors of fucked up, look at some old family photos, and than put a fat one right through my skull. Well I came across my graduation picture from ranger school with one of my old army friends and decided I should give him one last call. He knew that something was up and had the police come to my house, so Iâ€™ve spent the last few weeks involuntarily commited in the psych ward.

But hey Iâ€™m still here, donâ€™t really know what to do since Iâ€™m right back where I started. I might pack a bag and just start walking, I donâ€™t know. But Iâ€™m still here which is all that matters.

Rangers Lead the Way!
