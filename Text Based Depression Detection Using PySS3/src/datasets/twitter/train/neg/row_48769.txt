Honestly the only reason I havenâ€™t done it yet.My plan used to be to overdose but that has a chance of not working so now my plan is to jump off of the water tower. The only reason Iâ€™m not dead right now is because Iâ€™m super scared that Iâ€™ll either cop out and come back home or my mom will notice Iâ€™m missing and call the police, who will find me and bring me home. Then Iâ€™ll be sent out of state to another placement facility. Because my mom told me if the one I just got out of in April didnâ€™t work then Iâ€™d be sent out of state... Iâ€™m stuck. I was so close to doing it yesterday but then my mom dragged me out to go to the store... Iâ€™m seriously torn.
