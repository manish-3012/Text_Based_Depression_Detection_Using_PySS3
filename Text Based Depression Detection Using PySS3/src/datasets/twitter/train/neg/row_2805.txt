I don't know how to make it better when all I want is to make it stopI'm a wreck: depression, anxiety, a childhood in which I was whored out by my father among other abuse. I've never gotten help for it. I've only ever told my mother, who was angry at me for years until she worked herself into a state of denial. I put all my energy into pretending I'm okay with the result of being unable to do the things I need to. I've just failed out of college and am currently living on a friend's couch pretending I'm still in school. I have no money, though I am working, no car, no license, no insurance... I'm scared to admit that I can't do the university path because I know it'll make my mother hate me again and even after everything, I want her approval more than anything.

And on top of it all, I think I might be pregnant. I'll go pick up a test whenever I thaw out. I'm so fucking scared. I can't afford an abortion, and I sure as hell can't afford carrying it. I don't know what to do about anything.
