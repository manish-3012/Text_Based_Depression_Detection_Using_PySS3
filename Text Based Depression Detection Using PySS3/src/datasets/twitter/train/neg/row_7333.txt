the feeling is stronger than everi was newly diagnosed with borderline personality disorder ( before was mild depression and anxiety)
left hospital on friday (was 6 weeks in there)
one of my patient friends had really strong weed. I could focus when high
yesterday i was feeling very low and missing them, i wanted to die cause im afraid of being abandoned 
today i had manic mood so i tried smoking on it, hoping it would boost the mania. turns out its worse than yesterday. more intense feelings, i relearned self harm there (burning, hitting head and knuckles)
now i feel like i want to die a lot more
there is train near me and iâ€™m thinking about going there, despite telling myself they are the type of friends ill try to struggle through lofe for. the sensation is really strong


i also made some sentences because my feelings were hurt trough out years

â€the more somebody lies to me the more i keep shutting myself away and donâ€™t trust anybody and the more i keep losing hope in others being kind to meâ€

edit:changed â€œfear of being aloneâ€ to â€œfear of being abandonedâ€
