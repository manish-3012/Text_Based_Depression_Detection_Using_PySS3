Need financial helpIn need of financial help, I am at the point where my life story could be told but it wouldn't make a bit of difference. At the very bottom, tired of spending literally every waking hour applying for jobs to be rejected by every single one. Homeless with 3 kids, and an opportunity to buy a house with a 2k down payment that I can't come up with. A legal loan would work, I just can't do this alone and that's exactly what I am. Alone.

I have no family, no friends, no resources. I need help one time in my life. Just once. Please, please someone help me.

I am bawling my eyes out. Every day feels like the end and I am truly tired. I have lost half of my hair, I weigh 100 lbs and am severely underweight because of the stress. I continually try, and try, and get no where and I don't know why. Please help me.
