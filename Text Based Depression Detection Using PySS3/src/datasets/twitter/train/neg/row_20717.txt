I don't see the value in my own life anymoreI have no future, my family is unwilling to actually help me, all my friends don't truly care for me. I want to just meet SOMEONE who can understand what I'm going through. Please, I beg of you to anyone who sees this post to add me on Skype and just talk with me. I want to feel better and find some friends. Please, I can't live like this anymore....

my skype is luke.d32.
