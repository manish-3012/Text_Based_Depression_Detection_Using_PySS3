My best friend told me about his suicidal thoughts, and i forced him to tell someone.My best friend told me about his suicidal thoughts that he has. A couple months passed and I couldnâ€™t take the stress anymore, I was the only one that knew about it and I was seriously worried for him. I told him to either tell his parents or a professional or iâ€™m going to do it for him. He ended up telling his father, and now heâ€™s going to get proper treatment, but now he wonâ€™t talk to me, and if he does its very dry conversation. He also said that he has lost all trust in me. Im I in the wrong here? Weâ€™re both 15 I just couldnâ€™t deal with the stress of having someones life in my hands.
