Just a random thoughtI re-discovered this place today and spent the last hour or so reading and replying. And then it hit me:

I hate how calm stuff like this makes me feel. Calm and *normal*. As if thinking about suicide and feeling like shit are the most basic things you can do. Like there are kindred spirits out there just as messed up as I am or even worse and suicide isn't taboo.

I know people like feeling like a part of a group but this shouldn't feel normal - to relate to strangers on the internet who want to die. But it does.  
Is that fucked-up or what?
