What do I do now? (TW self harm)I posted yesterday because I was feeling terrible. Today I'm feeling weird, awful, very lost and not capable. I have OCD and bipolar disorder (just finishing the formal diagnosis) and I feel like I have concrete plans to kill myself. My best friend (she's basically my sister) has told me to bring myself to the hospital if I can when I feel like that (she's a nurse) but I don't think I'm bad enough right now.

I bought new blades for my box cutter at home to cut myself with, and I'm wondering if I could also kill myself with them. (In art school I was very proud of those blades, they're meant for ceramics and are very very very sharp. I don't know why I'm saying this.)

I'm at work and I don't want to make an issue (we're a small office, just my friend and I and my dad) and I'm not sure what I should do. I can't focus on work right now, I want to but I keep messing up and it's causing me to freak out a lot.
