I just wish that I didn't care that I couldn't care.Maybe the title confuses you; it confuses me, too.

I am hollow and empty. I am numb, apathetic, ignorant. I couldn't care enough to be more than a little upset at the state of the world. I flow through time and float on this earth being indifferent towards my health, my social status, and my appearance. I derive little pleasure from the activities that I had once deemed to be my pride and passions. It seems that I don't care about anything... except.

The only thing I care about is the fact that I couldn't care enough. I have become complacent, passive, and stagnant to the point of feeling nothing but shame, guilt, and worthlessness from being stuck like this. I wish apathy would just fully consume me so I can finally resign myself to death and finally have peace.
