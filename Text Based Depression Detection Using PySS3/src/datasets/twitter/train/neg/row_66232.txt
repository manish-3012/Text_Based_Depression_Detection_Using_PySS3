Even with things to be happy about; I'm not..I should be happy, I really should be. I own a home, I have a full time job and I recently became a dad. In theory these should be enough for any normal man.

Sadly, I'm not normal. I find the pressure of being a responsible adult and father too much. I feel numb and angry all the time. I just want silence. Blissful, calm silence. I don't hate my life, I recognise the parts where joy should be felt. The laugh of my son, the compliments I get on my home after I complete some decorating/DIY. But during these moments I'm faking my reaction. Because I feel fuck all.

I hate my job, with a passion. I need a new job but the idea of searching is just met with cynicism. Becuse whatever job I get next, I'll hate that too.

Im not destine to be a happy, normal person. I'm going to be broken forever. I want to die. I want the memory of me wiping from existance. I want my family to be fine without me. I just want silence..
