Maybe I should just end itI'm just so done with myself and this life of mine. I don't do anything apart from my school work. I feel tired and miserable all the time and I see no future were I will be happy. Only failing, not feeling good, not feeling good enough, never being able to be the person I want to be. I'm so mad at myself all the time because of who I am. Every little sprank of hope I have, gets shattered in no time. I felt this coming, this breakdown. The breakdown where I will finally really go crazy. I think it's here. I hate myself so much, I even look stupid and ugly. I don't see how life can become better. Despite trying so fucking hard, it's never enough to get better. If I'm gonna waste this life, look back at it with regret, why not end it now? I want to hurt myself so bad....
