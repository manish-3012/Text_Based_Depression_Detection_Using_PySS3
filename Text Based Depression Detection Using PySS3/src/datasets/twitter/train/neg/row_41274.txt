if i tell anyone iâ€™m suicidal iâ€™ll be kept in a 72 hour or wonâ€™t have much freedomdonâ€™t even know if i want to tell anyone iâ€™m suicidal. itâ€™s just an instinct to say â€œnoâ€ whenever the doctor asks. it was so hard to tell anyone iâ€™m depressed and look at me now. iâ€™m getting help but iâ€™m right back where i started.

i donâ€™t want to be kept in a 72 hour either. but if it gets real bad i donâ€™t know man.
