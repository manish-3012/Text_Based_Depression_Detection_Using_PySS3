Countdown.So recently I decided to go get help and I now see a therapist every Thursday, unfortunately it hasn't seemed to do much for me. I'm still self harming pretty regularly and get panic attacks etc etc. I want to die but I know I should wait just in case therapy does start to work for me so I'm giving myself 163 more days which I have to live for (I gave myself 6 months at the start). I don't want to tell my friends or family as they may stop me but I need to get it out there as it's just one more stress I don't want to deal with no one knowing.

If anyone has advice on how to make therapy work for me or other methods of feeling better that'd be much appreciated. Good luck to you all, bobby_bobkinson.
