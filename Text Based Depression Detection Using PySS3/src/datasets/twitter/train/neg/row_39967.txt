Don't think I was meant to be here longHad to post this on a throwaway account. I just don't think I can handle life any longer. I don't really envision myself with a future, let alone a tomorrow. Normally my main priority is just to get myself through the day without doing something stupid. I feel like I am always trying to reach out to my friends about my mental state and they make it apparent that they don't care. I know that they will all pretend to be sad if I actually do it, and that's shit.

The only ones I know will be sad is my family members, especially my mom. She's the only reason I don't just end it but I don't even know if that's enough anymore.
