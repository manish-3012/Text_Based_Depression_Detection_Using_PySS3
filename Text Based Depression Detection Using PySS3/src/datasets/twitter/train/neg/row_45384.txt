I just don't want to be alive anymore.I'm so tired and sore. I'm so sick of having every thought and memory hurt, every person I'm close to fade away, every dream not pan out, every task seem like such a monumental undertaking.

I've been depressed since November now, and I've been dealing with at least one moderate-to-severe cycle of depression a year for the last decade. I've seen several therapists and several psychologists, and tried several kinds of psychiatric medication. It's not really helping. 

The psychiatrist told me the last time I saw her that I will probably have to deal with depression for the rest of my life. But this is no kind of life worth living. I'm going to turn 24 in a few weeks, and I still rely on my mom and dad to feed and house and clothe me. If it weren't for them, I would have killed myself a long time ago. It's humiliating, though, to see my former friends graduating and getting jobs and getting married and having kids, while I can barely get out of bed, shower, and dress myself.

When I'm not depressed, I do ok. If I were never depressed again, sure, I would be pretty far behind my peers, but I could patch things together ok.  But what's the point in going on if I'm just going to have another episode in a six months or a year?

I simply don't want to keep going. My therapist tells me that I have to make more effort, because nobody else can get me better, but the truth is, I don't want to get better. I only go to the therapist's office because my mom wants me to, and I don't want my mom to be mad at me.  I used to want to get better, but not anymore. I'm just tired. I want to be done.

I know it would hurt my family terribly if I died, and my mom said she would be incredibly mad at me. I'm so sorry for that. I don't want any of that. But I just can't imagine trudging through sixty more years of this.
