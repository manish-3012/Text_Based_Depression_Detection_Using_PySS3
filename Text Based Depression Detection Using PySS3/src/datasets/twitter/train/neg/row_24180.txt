Every day is the same7 months ago i had a near succesful suicide attempt where i tried to hang myself but the rope broke but failed and spent a month in the hospital. Ever since that day I regret not getting a bigger rope. But after that my life also fell to shit. I was a model student at my school in classes several years ahead of everyone else and managed to get good grades in them. Unfortunently i've yet to gain back any of the motivation i had to get those grades. I've been bitter ever since i failed and that has pushed some of my closer friends away.  A thing with the mental illness I have is that I tend to fall in love with favorite persons which are basically the only people my mind will accept anything positive from. They seem to be my only method to aquiring hapiness but the favorite person i have now,h, shares no classes in common with me and is showing disintrest and on top of all that doesnt speak english but speaks a language that i am in the process of learning. Anyways h has complete control over my emotions and she barely knows i exist. Along with that I am left with less and less of a live worth living each day that goes by. Im losing friends left and right due to my isolation,political views, and bitterness, my grades are falling, and the person whom I love doesnt care about me. Recently i discovered a new method of suicide that I could carry out. Before the last suicide attempt i was living in severe depression for about 6 years and the only thing keeping me going was school and now that's gone. Im not quite to the bottom but i have a feeling things are about to get a lot worse. Every day that goes by i start and end by wishing for eternal rest or that h would care. I dont think the latter is going to happen and every day feels exactly the same. Sorry for making everyone have to take the time out of their day to accomodate me like the parasite i am
