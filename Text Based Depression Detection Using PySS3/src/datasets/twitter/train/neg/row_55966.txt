Why do they say if you have planned the way you will actually kill yourself you are more likely to go through with it?It seems to me like anyone who wants to kill themselves could, and it would take minutes to come up with an effective way to end your life. A really committed person could do it with a shoelace and a door nob. What's the reasoning behind "Have you planned how you will do it"? I have been reading a lot of these posts recently and just think the decision to actually kill yourself would be the big issue not the method of how you plan to do it.
