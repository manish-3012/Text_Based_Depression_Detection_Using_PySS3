Considering killing myself, the depression just keeps strangling me.I have always struggled with anxiety and depression, since i was a little kid i've been this way. This winter my abusive girlfriend left me and i still can't get over her completely. The weekenid i had now was the best in such a long time, the issue is that i met a girl and i felt attracted to her, she's too young tho, only 18 and i'm in my late 20s and i feel shame for that. Nothing happened between us, we barely spoke but we were in the same company over the weekend and i had a great time but now the weekend is over and same old shit week after week continues. It's like a post-great-weekend-depression on top of my regular depression that i somewhat can hande most days. I hate that i can't have fun without going into deeper depressions afterwards, i don't know why that happens and yeah, feeling this attraction to a 18 year old girl is shit aswell.
