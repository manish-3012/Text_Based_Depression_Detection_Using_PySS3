Is Suicide Better Than Relapse?Iâ€™m in recovery from drug/alcohol addiction. Lately Iâ€™ve been having strong thoughts of relapse. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s because Iâ€™m doing quite well lately. Not on the mental health side of things. But Iâ€™ve just acquired employment. Doing the healthy living thing. Besides cigs. Exercise, good diet etc...

Still. I canâ€™t escape these very intrusive fantasies. They were so strong that tonight they were causing physical symptoms. Pressure in the center of my head. I swore to myself that Iâ€™d kill myself before relapsing. I wonâ€™t go back to zero. I donâ€™t know if relapse is inevitable. But if it gets to that point. I donâ€™t see any other way. I have the money and the means to asphyxiate myself painlessly.

Iâ€™m quite confused. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this here. If you want to know how I feel listen the song â€˜Jugband Bluesâ€™ by Pink Floyd. Thatâ€™s my song.
