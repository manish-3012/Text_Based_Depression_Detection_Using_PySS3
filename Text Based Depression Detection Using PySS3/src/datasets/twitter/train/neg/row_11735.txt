The last straw...This will be my final post ever. I am very thankful for those who have reached out to talk, though we might have talked for a minuscule amount of time, it was very nice. I am really sorry for those who I have hurt directly or indirectly. Sorry to those who are my friends and were my friends for letting you down, you guys probably know who you are and I'm deeply sorry. Sorry if i acted weird and laughed hysterically and uncontrollably or would just be upset days on end, i don't know how to cover up my pain. Sorry for being the burden on your backs for the past 16 years. It was nice to see the generosity and kindness in humanity after a while. I'm am truly, truly sorry for being alive more than anything. At least i am out of your life :), if i manage to live i will save the draft and delete the initial post. Till i die

Lastly, if my parents or someone i know manages to read this, i am truly sorry and have typed up all of my passwords and accounts in my Samsung notes (use my fingerprint). Whatever you choose to do with it is up to you. One last request for my parents if you read this, please don't waste money on a burial or cremate my body. Though being a burden i would like to at least donate my body parts/ body for those who may need help and could you please remove all pictures of me. Please don't lament my absence
