They're going to get off easy and it isn't fairI'll get straight to the point and save a more detailed post for another time... Anyways, I can't kill myself because I know the damage it would cause my family who has done nothing wrong, but that means everyone who has mistreated me and left me in the dirt will never see how much pain they caused me because the only time people give a shit is if someone commits suicide. How am I supposed to live with this? Every single part of me wants to be gone, but the world doesn't accept death like I would, I'm not afraid (except for the actual process of dying). Why does it have to be so sad for people? Isn't it selfish to want to keep someone alive even though they're suffering just because it would make your life a little more difficult? Why is life mandatory? I didn't choose to be here! Why is it that people can say that an old person dying of a sickness is "finally free from suffering", but if a 20 year old guy with a sick brain kills himself its tragic? Why can't I have control over my existence or lack there of? One more question for the "it gets better" crowd, if life is so fucking great, why do so many people want the heck out of it? I understand no one has these answers, guess I'm just wondering if anyone has thought on these questions and came up with something to make it just not matter for a while, or at least until I finally die.
