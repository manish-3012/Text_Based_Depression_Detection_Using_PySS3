I've a problem.So since 2 years I'm feeling to acting weird to people. I'm always tired, sad and suicidal. It's difficult to communicate to people and sometimes I can be really fast mad. I like it to be alone and I love to isolate myself. I don't trust people very fast and I change mood very quickly. I'm always very quiet and and I always feel uncomfortable when with others.
