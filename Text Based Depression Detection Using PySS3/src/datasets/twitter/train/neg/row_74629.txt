Can you cheer me up?I'm 35, I secretly despise my wife and I think she stole the best years of my life, she's a damaged gal, but she's beatiful and I love her so much that I can't stand to lose her. We don't sleep in the same bed in a long time (4 years at least).

Thruth is I'm severely depressed, anxiety has been my friend since high school, I'm really suffering, all I can think of is to kill myself and end it all, sleep and dream peacefully in a sea of wonderful calmness.

I have everything: I have money, I have the looks, I have a nice job a house and friends, but I feel detached from this world.

I live in the past, I'm stuck 15 years ago in high school.. I was the jock yes the one that made fun of the nerds I was so happy in my mindless way of thinking, then real life struck, my dad died, I got cancer, I got in a relationship with the wrong girl (my wife) and everything spiraled out of control.

I cry myself to sleep each and everynight hoping I could never wake up, all the while my will to live is explosive there's so much I want to do and see, while I'm drowning in a sea of self loathing.

Wednsday I'm finally had an appointment with a shrink but I fear it would not help, I've posted here many time when I felt low, you don't even know how many times you saved my life reddit, when I was sitting on the roof of my building contemplating the last jump but checking my orangered one more time.

Thanks. I'm crying at work.
