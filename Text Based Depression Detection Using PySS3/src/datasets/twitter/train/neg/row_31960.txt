I want to die and I've started burning myselfIt feels so wrong and so right the pain is something else to focus on and now I can't stop thinking about burning myself I want to die so bad it's the only thing I can focus on I'm such a failure I wish I could just make all the pain stop well I can just haven't bought the benzos and opioids to off myself yet though Im so close to just doing it there's nothing here for me anyways and I was never asked to be born I hate it all I hate everyone and I hate myself fuck
