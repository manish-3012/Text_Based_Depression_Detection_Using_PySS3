Religious upbringing might be the cause of it all. Suicidal for over a year now.Hi all. First post on this board. I'll try to make it short.

I've been suicidal for over a year. Diagnosed with severe anxiety and major depressive disorder. Had two suicide attempts, the latest in April, which got me put in a mental hospital for a few days. (Best Easter weekend ever, am I right?). I've gotten help and I've been on meds for quite a while. I have a good psychologist too. She's been helpful. I finally got a job, so I'm doing well enough to get out of bed. I have a loving and supportive boyfriend too.

What my mind keeps focusing on is stuff I was taught being raised in an extremely conservative Christian environment. I'm so embarrassed to say this because in my mind I KNOW it's not true, but this is something like brainwashing. I can't stop the thoughts. Like how my boyfriend and I will never have a legitimate marriage because he's slept with other girls. Or how I need to be punished for inconveniencing others. I need to be punished for my mistakes. And so on. 

How do you undo something like that? Something that has been drilled into your head all your childhood? I'm so afraid I'm regressing again, and I might do something stupid.
