My life fucking sucksIll keep it short and simple. Dropped out of college, havent told friends or parents literally have to pretend i go to school so they dont ask, been going for about a year. Girl I was seeing ended up seeing multiple people behind my back, family sucks, friends suck, and it physically hurts to get up in the morning knowing i have to go out when i just wanna stay inside my room curl up and cry all day long.

so there, somebody please tell me why is it worth it to keep going, really why? At this point i know its a bitches way out, the cowards pussy whatever you wanna call it but you know what life fucking sucks why should i keep going when its just going to keep kicking me down. seriously why
