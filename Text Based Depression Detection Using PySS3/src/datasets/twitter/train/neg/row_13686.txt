I've lost it allNot long ago I was on top of the world, turned 30 and went to Paris to celebrate it where I had one of the best experiences of my life with my then girlfriend. Fastforward to today she's with someone else, a person she met on tinder, I have zero on my bank account, 2 of my closest family members died and I dont have a job, my life has no purpose anymore, it's void, its empty, I don't think I can carry on any longer, it ends today, it's the end of it all
