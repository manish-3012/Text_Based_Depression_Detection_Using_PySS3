Talking to myselfDo you guys talk to yourselves? 

Recently  whenever  I can't  sleep  I start to think my situation  and how fucked up I am, I talk to myself  like telling  how hard is my situation, how hard is to be depressed  with anxiety  and how wonderful  will be sleep  like a normal person  and have energy to do all the stuff  I need and want to do.

Is like: "damn it man, I want to sleep  but  I can't, do I need to take drugs to be able to sleep? I mean, I don't  want to be codependent on this things, what if someday  I'm not able to pay for it? What if someday  just make it worse? Well maybe that's  the only option  I have, even though i have been avoiding  it..."

That's  just an example  of when I don't  feel really bad, but when I feel literally trash it becomes  really  sad and dark, all the good things that I try to tell myself  about me turn out in to bad things, how will be the best choice to end  with this sorrow of living. 

Is like a double edged sword, sometimes I can motivate myself  but sometimes I can just bury myself  with all those bad things  I can think about me.
