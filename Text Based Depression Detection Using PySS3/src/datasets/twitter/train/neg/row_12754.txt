Throw away accountI've never had a plan before but I want to hang myself now. I'm being convinced that I'm doing this for attention by everyone around me. Part of me thinks I am. Part of me thinks I never want to wake up again, seriously. I know good things will come but I don't care because I know shitty things will come also. Life is hard and fuck this. 

I've also been off my ssri meds for 2 days, which I know is a terrible idea.
