From where I'm standing, theres nothing I see2 years ago I decided to take this road, this specific road that no one dares to take. No one bothers to venture. Many talk about this road but never really get to the end. Some even try but they return back to where they started and take detours.
I however decided that what was at the end of the road was worth the treachery it may bask upon me.
This road is a lonely road. Only one person can walk on it. No one can stand next to you, behind you nor in front of you. You and only you can take this road by yourself. It is the most loneliest road.
This road can drive one crazy, it can bring depression and anxiety to those that walk on it.
It will ruin any relationship you have. It will isolate you from everyone and once you step on this road there is no one you can see or talk to. If you decide to  rest on this road... The path becomes narrower and your journey gets longer. 

Right now I'm on this road. I have no one to share my journey with nor does anyone know what my purpose is and how important this journey is.
I need to be 100% consistent and give 200% of my effort while drinking and eating perseverance every single day.
I feel like I'm loosing motivation because no one sees it or hears about my journey and I have no positive reinforcement.

Im just a guy on a lonely road... loosing my motivation
