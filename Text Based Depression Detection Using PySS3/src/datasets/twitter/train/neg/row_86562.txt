I wan to cut my nose off.I am 19 years old. Female. Went in for a rhinoplasty apt I realized I will never be able to afford. my nose is ginormous, fucked up and hideous. My entire face is. I never want to leave my house because I am extremely ugly. All I ever think about is how I just want to die. I know I sound like I'm some extremely introverted emo personality. I'm not. I work as a waitress and I am trying to start school to work in a medical spa. Most people assume I'm just a nice but bad looking college girl who's really chatty. There are times I love talking with people and having fun but I always feel
 that there's no actual point. I'm ugly and insignificant. I want to physically slice my fat off my body and my nose hump off my face. I hate living and I often just wish someone would slaughter me.
