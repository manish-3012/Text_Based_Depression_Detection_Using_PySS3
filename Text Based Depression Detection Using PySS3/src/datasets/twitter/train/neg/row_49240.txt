I had a dream that I killed myself last nightIve had suicidal thoughts for a long time, but this is the first dream. It made me realize that this is an option I can take seriously.

I saw how it happened, step by step I watched myself do it. And I wasnâ€™t scared, it felt normal and natural almost like Iâ€™ve done it before. 

So yea, Iâ€™m really thinking about it now. I have the plan, I just need the date and the courage.
