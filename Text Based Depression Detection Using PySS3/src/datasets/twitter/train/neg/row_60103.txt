I lost my brother last month.My baby brother died last month at 36. He made some bad decisions in his life like the rest of his siblings, but he was beginning to get his life back. His associates degree came in the mail a few days after he died and he was a couple of semesters from his BA. He was fixing his relationship with his 13 yo son; things were getting better for him. 

Then he got into an accident that showed he was in the final stages of liver failure and no one knew about it. He spent the last month of his life in bed. However he did get to spend his last days surrounded by his family. I was holding his hand when he died and Ill never forget it. Its just not fair. 

On the other hand I am perfectly healthy physically at 40. Yet I have destroyed everything Ive touched, hurt everyone I have ever cared about, and squandered everything I have ever had. I just don't understand why the universe chose him and not me. 

I want it all to end, I am so tired of this life. Now that I lost one of my brothers, I see it will only get more painful as time goes. I just want it all to end....
