Thinking about doing it on my terms.Hey everyone. 

I am a 22 year old guy and have been suicidal for at least the past 8 years or more.

What it also boils down too now is feeling I am not compatible with the modern day workforce. 

In my opinion people are meant to do more with their lives then grind away at a employment they usually do not like the majority of the week. 

I know what everyone is going to say, to go to school for something I would love, tried that did not work out twice, or start your own business, currently trying that and it is not working out.

So with the very real reality of nothing but a life of menial work in my face and likely having the most money I will ever have in my life at this time, I am considering throwing $1000 into my forex account and using the rest of it to go to Europe and have a great time full of real life experience, trading forex when I can to try to make some cash.

If it works out, pretty big if, great I will likely stay in Europe and continuing being nomadic and trading stocks, if it does not work out I will kill myself by jumping from heights likely. 

I really have no fear of death and have literally no friends, am over my relationship with my girlfriend and have no real connection to my family.

 I feel like a lot of peoples pain &amp; misery is created by situation they truly do not want to be in, but are pressured into by modern society, which itself is a human creation, death on my terms is better than a shitty life doing awful work that makes someone else money doing no work just because they were lucky or born into it.
