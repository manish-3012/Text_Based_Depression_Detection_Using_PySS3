Gonna hang myself soon... I hopeHi, I'm 18 and female, and I tried committing suicide 3 weeks ago (by stabbing), and just seeing how nothing changed, nobody cared (all my brother could say is "I will never understand your pain and can't help you, but I hope you'll somehow continue on") and how nobody helped me... 
Even though I was in a mental hospital (they didn't do jackshit) and I told my therapist and my psychiatrist, which didn't amount to anything either, I think I've come to the point where I really want it. 
I'm even taking meds and they don't do ANYthing about my depression, though they do help me sleep, yay...

I already know in advance that my life will be a complete failure in the future and that I'll fail in every way possible, I'll never find a job, I'll never find friends and will never ever ever find love.
So now I'm thinking of buying a nylon rope on amazon, but it sucks that I have to wait for it and can't try it immediately...

Just wanted to tell someone that I'm gone soon or at least I'll try. 
What I hate the most about being suicidal is how taboo it is, you can't talk to anyone about it openly, whether its a doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist or god forbid a normal person. Nobody even tries to understand that it really might be too much for you and that it maybe is the only way out, they always automatically side against it without even like really discussing it at all, which just makes it worse in my opinion...
