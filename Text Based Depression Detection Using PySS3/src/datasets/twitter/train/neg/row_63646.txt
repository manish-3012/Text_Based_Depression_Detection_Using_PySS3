I can't make it another 8 yearsI'm 22. I've always had low self-esteem that has been linked to my looks - I'm fuck-ugly. For a short span of time I actually somehow managed to date a girl (she somehow managed to find me attractive). I thought it cured my low self-esteem. Instead, it was just a temporary reprieve. Now that we are no longer together, these feelings are back in full-force. Honestly, I want to kill myself every time I look in the mirror which is every day. I'm still young, so a few months ago, I made a "pact" of sorts with myself saying that I would not kill myself until I was 30 years old unless I managed to complete a list I created of things I want to achieve before I die. 

But now that I think about it, 8 years is so fucking long considering every day is so slow and miserable. I don't know how I'll make it to 30 - even if I don't die by suicide, I'll simply drop dead from sadness instead.
