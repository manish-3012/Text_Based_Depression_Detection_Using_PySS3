User in /r/confession may have committed suicideIn this thread http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/13vl2t/i_will_eventually_kill_myself/[1] S_M_C has posted that he has taken a ton of sleeping pills and isn't sure if he will be alive tomorrow or not. I have no idea if hes trolling or not, but I was hoping someone here many recognize him by his name or post history and be able to contact him, please anyone who has even a slight idea please post it here. Hope this is okay to post in this sub but I already tried to in /r/phoenix where he has posted but got caught in the spam filter

Edit: Still no update in 10 hours, starting to get pretty worried guys.
