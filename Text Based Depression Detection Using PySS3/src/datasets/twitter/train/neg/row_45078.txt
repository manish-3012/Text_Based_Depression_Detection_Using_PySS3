She left me. I serioisly can't take this anymore...I had been seeing this girl for 8 months.  She was the one person who could make me happy.  Lately, i noticed she had been acting more shy.  Last night i asked if she was alright.  She said she had just been seriously streesed with school and the sport she plays.  I quickly rushed to her side to support her.  Stress has put me into a downward spiral of depression, and i didn't want her to go through that like i am.  Less than 12 hours later, i get a text from her that she just wanted to be friends because she didn't have time to think about a relationship, but she had time to watch four seasons of a show on Netflix in two weeks.  Internally, i know why she cut it off.  I knew i would never be good enough for her.  I'd never be good enough for anyone.  I never will be.  I did my absolute best.  I was there when she needed a shoulder to lean on and was there when she needed someone to pick her up.  I didn't beg to have her back.  I said i understood, and never got a response.  I guess my best was never good enough.  Whats the point.  I can't even make myself happy anymore.
