I feel like I sound like a broken record.Iâ€™ve stopped bringing up the fact that Iâ€™m down or depressed or anxious or whatever feeling, because itâ€™s just the same thing. I tell someone, they listen/calm me down/help me, but itâ€™ll happen again. It always does. So why bother bringing it up every time? It will never go away. I will always be fucked up.
