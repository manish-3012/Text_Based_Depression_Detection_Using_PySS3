I want to end my life.I tried to kill myself last week. But i failed.
I don't want to live anymore. Every day I'm just crying. I have a son who is 3 months old. He is a good boy. He doesn't cry much. I love him but i feel i shouldn't have been a mother. I'm so lonely and alone. No one talks to me.. No one cares about me
