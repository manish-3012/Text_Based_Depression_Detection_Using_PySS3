My last call for help.I wake up everyday feeling like my time is over in this world. I can't help it, I feel like I have tried everything to change it. Not even the prescriptions. I don't know what I am supposed to do, I've ended up in a Mental Ward Twice for my suicide attempts and that didn't even help me. So please can someone tell me what I am supposed to do. I don't think I can push through this any longer. I don't want to let my family, my girlfriend and my friends down, but what else has my life come to. The people I thought cared don't, my friends I called family pushed me away, and the girl I am with now I don't even feel like it's working  out. Every second of my life is worrying and obsessing over the fact other people might leave me and I can't do anything to stop it. I have talked to the Psychologist about BPD, but all they  did was diagnose me with ADHD and Adjustment Disorder. So what does this mean for me. I have to take 5 pills a day just to pretend like I am normal and that doesn't even work for me, I just turn into this emotionless robot. So I will tell you again, my time has come in this world, and my life is over. Just know that I always have loved you, J, A, V, M, L, P so thank you guys for being there when I had no one else, you haven't failed your job. I have failed mine, I have failed to push through this pain and get through it and all I can say now is that I am sorry for making your lives alittle harder.
