Divorce and suicide.A lot of men tend to commit suicide, following a divorce. I don't know what it is, specifically, about the title, the nature of this defined loss, the permanence opposite of what is (systemically) designed to be permanent. But like most things in life, love shifts. What kills us is when it shifts away from us, from the people whom we still love.
