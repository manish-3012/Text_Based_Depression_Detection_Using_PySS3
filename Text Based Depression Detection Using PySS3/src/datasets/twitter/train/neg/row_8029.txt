Back here again. My heart is just so heavy.Sometimes I smile, I really do. I love to watch comedy TV shows. I live for it, every week, new episodes of Community, Modern Family, South Park, Californication. It's something to keep me going. I was having a really good week, because I went camping for my birthday and then got to recover from camping by relaxing with TV. But now I'm back in real life, and I still don't like what I see.

I'm just another cliche, broken home, deadbeat drunk psychotic dad, overworked mom, juvenile delinquent, traumatic experiences with sex, joke of a degree, no skills, and while in my manic stages I feel like a genius, most of the time I know I'm an idiot. I'm a lesbian with a history of falling in love with straight girls. To top it all off, I will be totally broke next month.


I'm not going to kill myself. But when will I stop wanting to?


Between now and the last time I posted here, one of my friends told me her boyfriend had threatened to kill himself in front of her. I don't know what to do. Life is hard. She said I give great advice. I don't know why I can know things in my head and still not feel them in my heart. I don't know why I can't tell the girl I love that I love her. When I had the urge to tonight, I told my friend instead. That made me feel good. Telling people I love them feels good. I wish I could tell more people than just my friend. I wish I could tell the girl I love, but I know she doesn't love me.


It's really, really hard to laugh sometimes. I wrote in my journal last night "How can I trust someone who doesn't know me well enough not to hurt me? How can I trust someone who knows me well enough to hurt me?"
