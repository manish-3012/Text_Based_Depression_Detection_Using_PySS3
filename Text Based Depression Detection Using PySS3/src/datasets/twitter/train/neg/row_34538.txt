I only kinda want to dieI dunno. I'm just stuck at a family reunions while I am glad I'm here I still just can't deal with all the people and the pep and in the quiet moments it just seems worse than when I'm home alone and able to just pretend. 

I've almost killed myself before and I feel like I'm at the cusp of falling down that path again and I just thought /someone/ should know.
