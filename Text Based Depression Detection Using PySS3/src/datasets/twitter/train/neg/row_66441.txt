A drowning man can't learn to swimso as you may have guessed by the title I feel like I am drowning (figuratively of corse) sinking into deep depression and suicidal thoughts. I have everything going for me at 14, not to brag but I am what some people would describe as mentally gifted in maths and science (i'm shit at english though) but I don't see it. How can someone who is supposed to be clever be so dumb to want to end it but yet I do.  I know people say there is always a light at the end of the tunnel but from what I can see, I am not in a tunnel, I am in a cave full of dead ends and it is just empty. I don't know why i am even posting this, I guess I just needed to tell someone. who cares though, not me for sure.
