Accidently told my friends Im suicidal while drunkPlease help me I really don't know what to do. I got my results back yesterday and celebrated with 4-5 friends in my house. I drunk so much to the point I had to be consoled on my couch while I was sobbing and talking about how I "need more alcohol because I don't want to wake up anymore" which I think is a dead giveaway to my suicidal thoughts. My 4 friends were very supportive and hugged me and were talking me through it. They shortly were forced to leave by my dad.
Now I'm on my bed waking up with no pants on and freaking out as to what I should do. My friends aren't the most sensitive people and I'm so embarrassed. I don't know what to do.
