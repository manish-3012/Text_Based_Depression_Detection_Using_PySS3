TrueI am wanting out. I don't see any good future for myself : middle aged man , serious health problem , no family , no friends , completely broke with no chance ( other than lottery ðŸ˜„) of having a comfortable old age. 

Tried and failed once 5 years ago. Have put a lot of time into studying methodology and success statistics , as well as legal assisted ways 

Want to discuss my situation with someone objective who is not anti suicide to see if my self evaluation of circumstances is accurate 

Suicide hotlines are anti suicide and I think that is an unreasonable position , sometimes it's right
