Well, might as well give this a try..I've been feeling miserable and suicidal for about 7-8 years now. Tried overdosing once, but it didn't work and I just felt like shit for days.

Recently got a girlfriend, and then broke up a few months into the relationship. Now the thoughts seem to be stronger, and I find myself putting myself in dangerous situations in the hope that ill die; blameless. I also seem to be contemplating suicide 3 - 4 times a day, usually when I wake up, or go to bed.

I seem to have lost all interest in my university course, as well as my guitar. I have also had a loss of appetite, although in an attempt of keeping myself from thinking too much, I spend most evenings in the gym listening to heavy metal.

I havent told anyone of my thoughts before... and im probably robbing others of advice. Just thought I'd post my thoughts in an attempt to make myself feel better.
