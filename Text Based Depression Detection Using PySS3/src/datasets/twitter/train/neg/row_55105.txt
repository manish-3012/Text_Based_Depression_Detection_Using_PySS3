I'm so fucking done.(I apologise if this is messy.)

I miss when I didn't think about suicide or self harm every moment that I wasn't distracted.

I miss when I cared about my grades and turned in schoolwork on time instead of thinking, "I'm going to die soon anyway, so why should I waste my time?"

I miss when thinking about how my friends would feel actually stopped me from hurting myself.

I miss when I thought that I could do something with my life, and when I didn't have four suicide notes written.

I miss just being fucking happy.

 I'm only fucking 13, and I just get brushed off as edgy by my parents, the only adults that I have tried to open up to.

"You'll grow out of your shy phase, I was like that at your age."
"It's just hormones."
"You're lucky I'm not half as bad as my parents were."
"You act like we beat you."
"Speak up."
"It's all in your head, you wouldn't be so timid if you were more positive."
"You need to have faith in a higher being."
"You're just going to end up in a mental institution."
"You're fine."
"You're just like your dad."
"It's your fault."
"I wish you were more like _____. At least they don't _____."

I don't get it.

"I love you." What does it mean coming from your mouth?
"You can always talk to me about anything." No I can't.
"I'll listen to you." You never let me talk.
"I'm sorry." No you're not.
"I'm the only person you can trust." Fuck you.
"You'll never have someone as honest as me in your life." ...

I'm tired of being kicked down, being told a few kind words so that I forget why I'm upset, and then being kicked back down again. 

Soon nobody will be able to do that to me anymore.
