Job making me think of offing myself againI havnt made one of these posts for a while I have had depression for almost all my life, I am 26 now and I have had this job for almost 5 months and at work and the anticipation of going to work makes me think of killing myself again, it's not even that is a terrible Job, I don't think there would really be a job that insolent hate it's the obligation and I don't understand why it does this to me because everyone has to work. But I can't stop it stabbing myself hanging myself this is all I think about I don't really have any friends and have never had a relationship so all I have is my free time to read or play video games and I'm so tired after work I don't even get to really do that besides the weekend...

Idk it's just so it of complaining but I really think I might kill myself this time, I have thought about it for so long I need to just do it already
