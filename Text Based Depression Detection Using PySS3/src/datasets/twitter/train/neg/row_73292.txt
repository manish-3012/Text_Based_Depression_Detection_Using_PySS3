I can't live anymore. I have to get a gun.I just can't keep trying to live anymore. Everyday it's the same thing. I feel fine for a bit, then I crash and everything is horrible. It's bad enough not having a job but learning that there will be no jobs in the future and that all but a small percentage of everyone will be impoverished, homeless, starving, and terminally sick living like rats on less than a dollar a day while robots continue to steal more and more of everything is simply too much. Knowing that universal basic income is impossible in this country just like universal healthcare pushes me further over the edge. I don't want to see this come to pass. I'm getting a gun to shoot myself with this week.
