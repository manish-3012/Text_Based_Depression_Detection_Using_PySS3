I feel like Iâ€™m going to attempt again.So I just recently left a mental recovery center for 3 suicide attempts. What drove me to those was that I was previously in a horribly mental and emotional abusive relationship. It was so bad that it drove me to suicide and put me in a mental hospital for around 2 weeks. The only reason why I left so early was because I faked my way through it. She manipulated me and never cared and destroyed my self confidence and anything That might remotely make me feel human. As soon as I left the recovery center I left her, and it was hard on me. Then after that my friends decided to abandon and start hating me and calling me a whore and trying to hurt me in any way possible. Forgive me if some of this doesnâ€™t make sense Iâ€™m horrible at explaining situations. Iâ€™m just feeling so destroyed and the suicidal thoughts are constant and Iâ€™m afraid because of all the work Iâ€™ve missed that I might have to repeat freshman year. Itâ€™s getting so hard to even stay alive and Iâ€™m constantly feeling like Iâ€™m about to pull the trigger on myself. I donâ€™t know what to do but losing my friends and getting over my breakup and just everything in my life is getting to where I canâ€™t handle it again. I think they might put me back into the mental hospital but I donâ€™t want to go. I just wish everything never happened. I just wish I never happened, or lived. I constantly wish that I succeeded in my attempts and I didnâ€™t have to go through all this pain Iâ€™m going through right now. My family is scared for me and they donâ€™t know what to do, and I feel horrible for putting them through all of this. Itâ€™s hurt all of them so much. I know it may not sound like much, but it feels so overwhelming that Iâ€™m failing in school and all I do is sleep and wish I was dead. I just canâ€™t do it anymore, I just want a happy life. I went back to cutting and stuff, which nobody took well. Iâ€™m just starting therapy again after not being in it for so long, but almost every time my therapist calls mobile crisis because of what Iâ€™m saying. I have numerous safety plans and Iâ€™m doing all of them but nothings helping. Nothing helps anymore and I feel so dead. I canâ€™t feel happiness anymore, all I feel is depression, guilt, and anxiety and pain. I just need help, and I need to get out of this.
