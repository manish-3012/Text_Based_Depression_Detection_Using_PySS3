Advice needed..Hello... Looking for some advice. Iâ€™m at a point where I feel like thereâ€™s no purpose anymore. I dont have any friends, and havenâ€™t for many years. My parents and my boyfriend of 6 years are pretty much the only people I have anymore, but the past few months My parents and I have Not seen or spoken to each other. I reached Out to them to let them know how sad I was Feeling, hoping they would recognize my cry for help, but nothing. Im having thoughts often of just deep sadness and lonliness, feeling like I wish I would die. Last night, after I reached Out to my mom and got no response, the sadness seeped in and I decided to tell my boyfriend of 6 years about what I have Been feeling lately. His response was to give me a few shoulder pats and fall asleep. I feel Like no one would even care at this point if I died. I feel like I want to die. What is the point of life when you care so much about these people around you but they donâ€™t care about you? Im ready to take responsibility that this is all my fault, and the reason no one cares about me must be because I suck. I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to anymore, so Iâ€™m hoping someone on here can give me some direction. This is my first post ever so not really sure how this works, but if you have any thoughts of how to handle this then Iâ€™m willing to listen to anyone..
