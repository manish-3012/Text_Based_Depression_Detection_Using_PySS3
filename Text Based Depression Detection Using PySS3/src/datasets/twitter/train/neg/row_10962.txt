my shitty life is my own faulti had a terrible childhood. i have ptsd and the usual depression/anxiety. i already have a disadvantage to life but i make it worse almost intentionally. i was using any drug i could get my hands on regularly when i was 16. i had sex for money to support my addiction and my spending. i was clean for a year or so, besides marijuana which i have a medical card for now. i'm 19 now, and my ex just got out of prison and it all went out the window. it's not his fault but it's not good for me to be around him. i don't have any willpower. he still uses drugs heavy and now i am too. he didn't pressure me. i wanted it. i was miserable when i was sober. now i'm miserable and high all the time and panicking over how i'll get high again when i'm not. i hate it. i'm not myself anymore. i just got pulled over last night for speeding/reckless driving. i can't afford the fines myself and i can't ask for help from anyone. i don't deserve help. i might even get a month in jail and i really don't think i'll handle that well. i won't be able to afford car insurance when my rates go up so i won't be able to drive. which means i won't be able to get a job because i'm in the middle of nowhere. i need to save up to move out, i love my mother but we are toxic when we're around each other so much.

i just wanted to be done with the legal trouble, at least. but for some reason i have to fuck everything up. i knew what i was risking and i didn't care. i don't know how to stop myself.

i keep thinking i need to end my life before it gets worse, before it becomes unmanageable. well it just became unmanageable.
