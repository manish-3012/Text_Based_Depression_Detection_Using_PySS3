A personal ultimatumEven though Iâ€™m on 100mg of Serotonin right now, I still have these pervasive thoughts. I thought when I decided to change four years ago, that everything would be better eventually moving forward. However, nothing has changed. Iâ€™m still a nobody with no job, no money, no friends and no life. Iâ€™m a waste. I live an empty, meaningless life and every time I want it to change I get the worst tightening in my chest that keeps me glued in my fucking misery. 

The thought of release, to fully give up and sink away into nothing is just so *tempting*. I fantasize about all the ways in which I could do it. 

I swear, if something doesnâ€™t change, I will throw this life away.
