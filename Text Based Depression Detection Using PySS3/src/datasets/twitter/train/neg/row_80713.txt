I have an opportunity to kill myself in a few days.I have to get surgery in a few days and will need to be put  to sleep by anesthesia. Apparently there are things you can do before getting put under that can make sure you do not wake up. It happened to someone in my family. IMO that sounds like a peaceful and painless way to go, especially for someone like me who just wants to disappear. I really don't know anything about anesthesia and am going to look into it more. I am tired of living and hate myself. I have no friends even though at one point I had lots. I've never been the same since my concussion, and I no longer see a point to continue living especially since my life has been downhill since then, and keeps going downhill. I think God wants me to stop existing. I am convinced he is real since that's the only explanation for why I have been punished so much these last 6 years. Funny thing is ive kept it all to myself for all these years. Never told a single soul until now.
