Whenever I listen to classical music, I feel like killing myself.I used to play classically (violin) but I quit because I was lazy. I love classical music, and watching people play. I've never been to a professional concert, but I've watched my peers play in theirs. I love listening to them play live, even if they're not very skilled. The connection people can make with their instruments is so moving to me. I wanted to play professionally and still do. Whenever I hear classical music I feel something eating at me in my guts. I want that connection so badly. I wish I was more committed to practicing, but I know that even if I was allowed to redo my years I'd walk the same path I walked before. I'm lazy as shit and wont ever amount to anything more than mediocre, no matter how many chances I'm given. I'll never learn. Even for the things I love, I won't rise out of bed for it. I won't commit hours to it no matter how much it matters to me. I don't know what's wrong with me. I want to die when I hear classical music. It pains me so much to not be able to play and to have given up so early. I hate being so disabled.
