Wife came back still have thoughts of suicideI'm afraid I keep having these thoughts of suicide. I've gotten worse I've alrdy wrote my letter I have gotten a will and I'm in the process of buying a gun and now I have a plan for when shit goes sour. I tried doing somthing about it and it never goes away I'm working on rebuilding my marriage but I have to have a mask on and bottle my feelings up so ill have any chance of fixing the marriage i can't stress her out or I lose all that matters to me I wish I could see her happy again with me it kills me everyday to see the hurt I caused and if i can't fix this I don't want to hurt anyone else. Witch is why my plan is to disappear without telling them where I'm going if I can't do anything to fix this
