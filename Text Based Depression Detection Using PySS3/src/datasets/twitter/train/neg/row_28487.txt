i wanna tell someoneif anyone here has read the other post i made on here about a week ago, you know i had attempted in february. its something ive been keeping completely to myself unless under the veil of anonymity. i had originally planned to tell my best friend, but that same night i was planning to he practically cut all ties with me.
now, i wanna tell my sister. shes been my rock these past few weeks and one of the main things thats been keeping me from thinking about doing it again. but i dont want her to think that if she were to take a break from being my support that id automatically kill myself, i dont want her to ever have to worry like that. i still struggle with suicidal idealization, but the last thing i want to do is stress her out, especially with the tension in the world these days. but the event is pressing on my mind and i feel like im gonna burst. if theres anyone i trust, its her. how do i tell her without putting too much pressure on her?
