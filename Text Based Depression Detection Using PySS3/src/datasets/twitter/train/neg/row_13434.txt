I know it's getting bad when I stop wanting to talk about it.Lately everything has been so confusing, and I feel like the more I try and make sense of it - the less sense it makes. I am tired of trying to figure it out. I am tired of trying to figure it out alone. Even when I come to conclusions that feel like truth "growth" - it's really doesn't feel worth it. The thing that hurts the most about getting this low is the numbness. I don't reach out to my "support" system anymore. I just let it soak in. I use to have enough energy to combat it that I could muster up a joke, and now that's gone. I don't understand what I am doing on this earth anymore. Nothing I love stays, and nothing that loves me survives.   


I want to find hope. More than anything.
