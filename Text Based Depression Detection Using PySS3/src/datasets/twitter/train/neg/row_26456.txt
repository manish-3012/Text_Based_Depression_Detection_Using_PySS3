I'm doing this for love.I'm worried about someone I care deeply for, he's always moody and never tells me what's wrong. There is a sadness in his eyes, even when I make him smile, and I can't shake the feeling that he's going to hurt himself again. He's my reason to live, but he doesn't seem to be too eager to survive. I love him, and want to make him happy, but this is just too hard. I promsed him I wouldn't cut... I broke that promise. I haven't told him, he's going to be mad at me, I'm done with life, I'm done.
