Taking a lethal dose of diphenhydramine tonightI have depersonalization and derealization and Iâ€™m convinced Iâ€™m living in a simulation and the only way out is by death. My life is made to be shitty and nothing is real Iâ€™m just inside a computer. I feel like my thoughts and actions arenâ€™t even mine and I want to end my depression and this feeling. Tonight I will be taking 5,000 mg of diphenhydramine which will be enough to kill me. If I live, I will be brain dead and in a bed for the rest of my life, miserable. Death is my only option and my only escape
