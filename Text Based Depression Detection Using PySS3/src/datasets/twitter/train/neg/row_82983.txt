I think Iâ€™m replaceable.A little bit of background. Iâ€™m 16 years old and I hate myself. If you want to see how I look just go through my posts Iâ€™m sure you can find me. I think Iâ€™m replaceable. I think no matter what the situation is Iâ€™m the least valuable person. Even in my house, my mom &amp; dad work and supply money, my grandma owns the fucking House, &amp; my brother is the more helpful. All I do is do nothing and complain. In school, in my friend group Iâ€™m the â€œedgy oneâ€ fuck I mean my best friend could easily replace me as the edgy one itâ€™s not hard. Nobody cares in my eyes. I just want to die so I can stop worrying. Nobody cares who you are until youâ€™re dead.
