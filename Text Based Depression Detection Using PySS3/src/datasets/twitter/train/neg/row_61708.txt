At the end of my rope...I don't know what to do...

I have battled depression for several years now, contemplated suicide on occasion, and lately things haven't been helping. I've tried to keep it suppressed and focus on other things. I got married almost two years ago and thought we were happy, but lately she accuses me of cheating on her or contacting other women in general which I don't. I love her more than anything, but she won't even look at me... I can't help but let my depression get the better of me and I feel like it's only a matter of time before I've had enough and end it all.
