Being a virgin, uneducated, having helpless parents and many moreI don't have a good parents, I dropped out of college, I am jobless, I haven't accomplish anything in life. I've dated a man who dumped me and I am always lost at finding a right man with loyalty attached to him. I find myself always struggling financially and socially and nobody accept me since I can't catch up with anyone's life. I don't want to die but sometimes ending my life is the only option here.
