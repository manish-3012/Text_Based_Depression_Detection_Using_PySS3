suicide in familyI am 25 and have been taking anti-depressants for a few years now and just last week my brother who had a severe learning disability hung himself in the kitchen. This really struck a chord with me as I had attempted hanging myself years ago and he was the one who walked in the room and despite being my older brother, in his child like innocence he rescued me.


I had no idea he felt this way, but I have been an emotional wreck ever since. I don't know how to be happy knowing despite his demeanor he was at that point. The only thing stopping me from ending it is what my brothers death had put my parents through and my girlfriend who doesn't deserve what I put her through. I just quit my job tonight as I had a full mental collapse.


I don't know why im putting a cry for help on an anonymous message board, but I am scared and I am without direction.
