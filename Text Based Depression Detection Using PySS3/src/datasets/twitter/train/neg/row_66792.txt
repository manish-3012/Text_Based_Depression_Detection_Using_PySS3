I'm at a lossI'm so sorry if this post is all over the place. I really don't know what to do. I've had cancer three times, this is my fourth time and I'm just so. Fucking. Tired. I can't do this anymore. 

I rented a hotel room under the guise of a business trip but all I want to do is take all of my pain and anxiety meds and drink the two bottles of wine I bought and end everything. I don't know what to do. The only reason I'm typing this all out is because I have people that depend on me and they would be devastated. But what about me? I'm so tired of being strong for everyone else. I just want the physical pain and the looks of pity and the sadness to end. I'm thousands of miles away from my parents and I don't know what to do. I'm 29 but Jesus Christ I need an adult.
