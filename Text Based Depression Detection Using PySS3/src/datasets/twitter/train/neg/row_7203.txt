I cant do this anymoreI just blew a gasket at my parents and i dont know why. I dont feel in control of my life or emotions anymore. My brain feels too overwhelmed. 

I keep telling myself just one more day if its easier to live one more day i should. But i dont know how long i can keep this up i feel like the day when i realize it will be better to kill myself instead of living one more day is approaching fast.

I have had two brain surgeries this summer and i got diagnosed with a brain tumor i had gamma knife two weeks ago. Im supposed to be ok i guess until or if it reoccurs. My toe is infected i think i dont know whats going on. My oncologist referred me to a psycologist but i turned it down im already a disapointment to my parents. I turned down a good job because i was too stressed. 

Im supposed to be ok but im not ok.

Ive been blackmailed overworked manipulated. Why would i want to be alive? 

I dont deserve to live i should have died by now i even promised to kill myself by january 2020 but i didnt and i got a grade 2/3 rare ass brain tumor . Ive been unemployed human trash since may 2019.

I will need to end myself if the brain tumor doesnt do it first.

My toe hurts and its stressing me out alot this never heppened before.

My brain is mush.

I need to die.
