Why is suicide becoming the only option left?Everyday gets harder to go through . Smiling and laughing and thinking all take so much effort. My family think I am lazy and think I just donâ€™t try hard enough. I feel like I am a burden to everyone I know. I donâ€™t have the courage to go through with anything though. But I know one day I will just snap. I feel nothing all the time and I hate it more than feeling all the emotions at once . I hate everything about me and just donâ€™t see a future worth living for . Everyone thinks I am this happy person who is just Wasting their potential. I feel so embarrassed if I even mention how I feel to someone .And they just tell me I am being an overdramatise teenage girl. One day I know I will just have enough and do it . The worst thing is is that itâ€™s a relief knowing itâ€™s an option if everything gets too much . I donâ€™t even care anymore . No one has to reply I just wanted to rant a little .
