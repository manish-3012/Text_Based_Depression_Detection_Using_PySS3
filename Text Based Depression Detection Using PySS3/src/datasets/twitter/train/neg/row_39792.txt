I canâ€™t take this loneliness anymoreI am not going to beat around the bush here. Yesterday I got banned from the only community where I was able to find people with the same interests as me. For the first time in years I had friends, friends with whom I could talk to about all kinds of things, and now, thanks to a single moment where I lost my patience, all that is gone. My performance in college also dropped tremendously compared to the last semester thanks to my awful new timetable. I canâ€™t even go back to the that community since they would be able to recognize my voice. I have never felt so lonely in my whole life. I am seriously considering taking my life tonight and I think this is the only place where I feel comfortable enough to seek help.
