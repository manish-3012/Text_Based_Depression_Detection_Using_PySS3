I'm reaching my limitI feel like an absolute fuck-up, I just spent a week in the psych ward and another week in partial but I just keep getting worse and worse. My guardian says I'm not putting in any effort to get better despite me working on copes for the past two weeks and forcing myself to do stuff even when I was shaking because my anxiety was so high. The only person I care about is probably going to commit suicide at some point and I'll be left all alone. My family probably hate me and think I'm an inconvenience except for my guardian who can use me being a sick teen to help her gain sympathy to get a job.

I just want to die and leave all my pain behind. I'm so sick of this world.
