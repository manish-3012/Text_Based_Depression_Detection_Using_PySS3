I'm not going to kill myself todayI'm not going to kill myself today.  
That doesn't mean I won't sometime in the future,  
but today, I'm going to write, to send out some e-mails,  
to maybe climb a couple ladder rungs. Fuck it,  
maybe I'll climb the whole ladder.  
But if I get stuck halfway up, and the tightness sets in,  
the tension, loneliness, boredom, mental exhaustion that puts the soul in a pressure cooker,  
I'm not going to jump into that chasm of nothing.  
We were just there. Remember?


Remember what that was like? Don't even look down there.  
No, We're not going to jump. We're going to cling  
to the ladder, white knuckling it  
'til we get a better weather report  
'til conditions are right to reach the summit.
  

And if we fall off the ladder  
into the glittering abyss,  
let's not rag-doll, go limp in the moment. The abyss  
wants you to float, mesmerized and inactive.  
It's fools gold. If we fall, let's pick ourselfves up,  
our battered &amp; bruised bodies, and try again.  
Left foot right foot, slow, shaking, but forward.  
Let's not kill ourselves today.
