Why do I bother anyway?I'll never be worth anything, my autism disables me, I can't go out, I can't work, I can't contribute to society. I can't study because of my executive function issues because every time I look at my work I cry.
I'm in an abusive relationship because my partner doesn't know how to deal with me anymore, but we still care about each other and im buried in valentines chocolate but i feel so guilty for eating it because i don't know how i can be with him when he strangles me abd calls me a piece of shit

if i left him i'd die because he's my carer
i can't make phone calls or go out alone
my payments woulkd be cut off i wouldn't be ablw to buy any food.

i don't matter to anyone anyway, they say i do but then i'm never the one they think of first

i can;t help anyone i can't get close to anyone i can't make a difference. I literally sit here everyday,, not living but existing,, and i wonder
why

it hurts to live and i dont want to do it anymore.

I will never be anything to anyone but a fucking piece of shit that nobody cares about when they get too close. so tell me what the fuck i'm here for. i live to feel pain.
