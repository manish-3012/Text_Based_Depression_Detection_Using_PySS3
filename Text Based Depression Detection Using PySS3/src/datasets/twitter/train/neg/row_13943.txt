I'm a burden to everyone I interact withI'm a burden to my family because I barely work and I do almost nothing to support them

I'm a burden to my coworkers because I'm always late and twice now I've called out of work entirely

I'm a burden to my friends because I'm an annoying shit and they have to deal with that

The biggest favor I could ever do for everyone in my life is to kill myself. Then they wouldnt have to be burdened by me. Why wont I just fucking do it
