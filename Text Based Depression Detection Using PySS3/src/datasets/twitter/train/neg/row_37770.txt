I'm just so tired....Don't know how much longer I can continue doing this. Literally have no motivation to stay alive. I just want to rest and not worry about the bullshit of life everyday. I'm sure there's a rope somewhere in my garage. Will probably put it to use soon 

Feels like I'm trapped in my own body
