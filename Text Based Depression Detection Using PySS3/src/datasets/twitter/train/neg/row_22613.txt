Can't see a futureDont know what im looking to get out of this, however the subjects been on my mind for a few weeks now and i cant see a way of getting through it.

Im 22 yrs old, 3 months ago I had a hormonal crash that depleted my testosterone. I have no libido, or no morning erections. Poor memory and little focus. Weight gain and muscle wastage. In short its completely handicapped both my physical and mental health, and left me struggling to get through every day.

A chance of recovery is minimal, and so far ive had little medical sympathy or understanding. 

The worst part is prior to this I was offered and accepted a dream job that I worked my entire education toward. Its due to start in October, but every day is a stab in the heart reminder I will never be able to take it.

Honestly I cant see a future that isnt bitter disappointment and despair. I dont see how i can ever come to terms with this quality of life, and suicide seems the easiest way of avoiding a bleak future.
