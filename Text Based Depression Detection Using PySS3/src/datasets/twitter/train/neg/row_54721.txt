Because I tried to kill myself I had to get a tracheotomy. Please please reach out!!In February I overdosed and was intubated for 2 weeks. Leading to throat problems and me not being able to breathe two weeks ago. They had to do a tracheotomy. 

I wish I could go back and change things. I can barely talk now. This is a nightmare. 

Please please please, if you are feeling suicidal at all, talk to someone. Don't do any permanent damage because of temporary feelings. Life is difficult. That is just life, there will always be suffering, but it isn't all suffering! Please.
