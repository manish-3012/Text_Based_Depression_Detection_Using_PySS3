at a certain point...one has to ask themselves if the car is worth its repairs. I feel like I have so much expected of me, but I'll never be able to do anything but disappoint everyone, because my wiring is faulty. I've gone back to college after six years of nothing, and now I feel like I'm in over my head. What's worse is that now, along with the crushing weight of my own crippling depression, I have live under the burden of student loans. at a certain point, one has to weigh out the cost against the reward, and realize that it may be wiser to just junk the car instead of making a terrible investment. I have made a terrible investment, and I don't know if I can manage to stay alive even till the end of the year.
