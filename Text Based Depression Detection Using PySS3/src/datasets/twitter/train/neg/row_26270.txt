If suicide didn't exist,i think i would fixed my lifePast was terrible,present is somewhat livable,future is looking bleak.

I can't make myself put effort in the present,because i might kill myself in the future,im stuck in that zone forever,nothing seems worth it,i can't imagine living life for very long

Idk what to do,i wish i could  focus and do things,but it just seems so bleak and i feel hopeless...

How to actually focus on living life and not having dark thoughts like that ?
