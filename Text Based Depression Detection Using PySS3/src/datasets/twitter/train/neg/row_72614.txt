I really need a therapist but i guess i'll never reach itwell i guess i have some kind of personality disorder because i'm sick since i hit puberty. social anxiety, depression, mood swings, identity problems, gender identity problems, suicidal behaviours, self-harm, self sabotage, eating disorder, emptiness... etc.

i know that i should get help but i can't. i mean i have no money for a real therapist and yes we have free therapists but i don't fucking know where to go (i wrote e-mail to the hospital they said i go somewhere else i asked where but they didn't reply). i have noone to talk about these things and because most of the time i want myself to feel worse and worse and i just want to die that's why it's fucking hard to find a therapist.

i don't know what to do, i feel hopeless. talking with strangers online about my problems is not for me, it just make me feel worse...

i'm 18

i guess i'll kill myself on the next week, no chance to get help
