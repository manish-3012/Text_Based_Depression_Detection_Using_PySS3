Fuck peopleSitting in IHOP with my ex-wife, we got divorced today, and our two kids and my ex's best friend and her annoying husband. I'm emotionally dead inside. I want to scream. The husband is just annoyingly dumb. In the old days on the way home my wife and I would have complained about him. 

Also I didn't know the couple were coming. My ex didn't tell me they were. 

Oh and it's our sons birthday. So I didn't feel like I could not come. Maybe a car will crash into me on my way home.
