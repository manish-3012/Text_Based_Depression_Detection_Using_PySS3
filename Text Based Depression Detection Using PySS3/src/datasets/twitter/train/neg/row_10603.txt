A couple more hours to goi have fought depression and bipolar disorder for most of my life and have been on medication since 14. I am 18 and transgender. After 8 months of hormones i hate myself more with each passing day. The pain of  gender dysphoria is killing me. I tried to off myself three times previously. All three attempts were overdoses and in each instance someone found me unconscious and called an ambulance. I have been admitted to the psych ward 6 times in the last two years and couldn't go to college even though i did amazing in school because of my mental illnesses.  My social anxiety prevents me from functioning and bulimia and anorexia have wrecked my body.  I have resorted to drug abuse and cutting to try to cope. But all methods have been ineffective. Therapy, medications, and doctors have not helped at all. I have friends but most of them just view me as crazy or someone to hear interesting life stories from. I don't care enough about my partner to stay alive. They are emotionally abusive and controlling. I m pretty sure i sound like i am saying "oh poor me" , but in reality i m trying to justify to myself and anyone who cares why its time for me to go. Once my family heads out to an easter party, i will smoke till i am stoned and then hang myself in a few hours.
