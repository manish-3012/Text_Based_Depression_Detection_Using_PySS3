Notice me. Somebody. Remind me Iâ€™m not a ghost, but a human. ( includes LGTB+ stuff so move it, over to the next post with them haters. )Today, it took me talking up to somebody, and having to interact with everyone for a grade, for them to even notice I was there. Which, leads me to believe, that if I were to commit suicide, they wouldnâ€™t give a fuck about it. This a all an experiment done by me too. To see if it was really that bad. Maybe if that fact that it was a grade for us to talk to each other, that maybe nobody would have noticed me at all. Out of all the people I know and have talked to, I know they all hate me deep down. Keep lying, saying that you donâ€™t hate me. 

But, since I am supposed to be not encouraging suicide, hereâ€™s the only happy thing I found out about today. Well, kind of two: 1. My music teacher is probably bisexual, gay, or is a straight ally fo the LGTB+ people. Why? He wears rainbow shoes, sounds and looks gay ( excuse me, I have a good gaydar. Donâ€™t judge. ) and has lately been wearing a rainbow wristband ( might say pride in gold, but Iâ€™m never close enough ). 2. One of my friends that I actually trusts, supports LGTB+. My best friend and crush is Non-binary and Bisexual, and he supports her. Which is always nice, considering I know Iâ€™m not straight. 

Alright, back to the main point here. Suicide. Note that if the moods suddenly ever change with my posts, note that I have possible ADHD and I want to keep things optimistic ( havenâ€™t been diagnosed yet). 

You know what, Iâ€™m ending the post here. I donâ€™t want to shed and sob too loud.
