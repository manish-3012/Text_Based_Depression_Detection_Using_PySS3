I want the suffering to endI'm at the low point of my life. I can't even support my friends anymore because I'm so upset about everything. I did something productive as hell today and I still want nothing more but to die. There is no meaning in life. I tried to create meaning and that didn't work either. Trying means nothing. There are just some things I can't change. I don't want to accept that. Why did I have to fail? My outlook is so positive when I'm high. But that's illegal. The only drug that's helped me (hint: it's not Paxil, Zoloft, or Cymbalta, which are the three anti-depressants I've tried) grows out of the fucking ground and has the potential to ruin my life if I'm caught with it.

I have known my friends for years, and for years all of us have been taking life's bullshit as it comes, with no sign of improvement, or any improvement being temporary. It gets better? Can it hurry the fuck up? I wish I had a surefire way to kill myself. I'd do it in a heartbeat. I'd rather feel nothing at all than what I'm feeling right now, or what I know I'll feel again in the future.
