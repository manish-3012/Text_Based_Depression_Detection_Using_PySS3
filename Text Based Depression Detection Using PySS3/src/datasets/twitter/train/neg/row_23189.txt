Been thinking about killing myself all dayI thought I was finally moving along and getting better but two nights ago everything came back and hit me like a truck. My girlfriend and the love of my life left me because I was a real shit bag and I just want to end it. She won't listen to me and I could really use just talking to her. I know I don't deserve a second chance and I won't get one I just really wish she would let me speak to her so I can tell her how much I regret everything and how much I love her. I know for a fact she was the one for me and despite what everyone says about there being other people, I just don't want that. I've never felt so alone and destroyed before. I feel like despite telling the few friends I have about this, none can help or don't want to. They all seem stuck on the idea that I can get over this. I've always been known for being determined and not letting anything get in my way but I wish they'd all understand that it's no longer the case and that I'm defeated and too mentally exhausted to keep going. If I had access to a gun right now I think I would do it.
