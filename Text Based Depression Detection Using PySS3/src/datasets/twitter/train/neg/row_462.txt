angry and frustratedeverything is just too much for me right now. this pandemic has driven me back into a deep depression after months of working on myself and bettering my mental health; everything is shot back down to stair 1. iâ€™m not making enough money anymore; and wonâ€™t be for the next few months because of the pandemic. iâ€™m turning 21 this summer and I wanted oh so desperately to move out so I could finally have a taste of adulthood...I have never been able to live on my own because of poor mental health and inability to find room mate. but my mental health was getting better and I finally was making enough money to where I could move out without needing a room mate. i also am so embarrassed and ashamed i live at home; it makes me feel like a loser. my mom is worsening my mental health bc she is now unemployed bc of the pandemic and constantly at home. all she does is nag me and treat my issues as trivial nonsense and acts like she will not allow me to move out...my mother was never strict but ever since I started college she became anal and insanely strict...iâ€™m an adult...
I also am having severe anxiety because of corona and everyone dying is making me upset and paranoid. I want to work because I cannot not be making money, life is way too expensive to just quit but working is stressing me out bc iâ€™m putting myself at risk to contracting the virus
my car also is conveniently breaking right now which is just the icing on top of the cake. 
iâ€™m crying and angry and shaking and I want to cut myself but I know iâ€™m way too old for that, I donâ€™t have enough of any drug right now to abuse it...I just feel hopeless and scared and I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. this happens every time: I have a breakdown and get suicidal, get my act together and life starts going well, then something happens and shoots me down farther than I was before. I just donâ€™t see a point anymore
