i am a failureim about to become 20 years old and i have absolutely no idea what i want to do with my life. i have never had a job and i have social anxiety, although to be honest i guess it's manageable. on top of this, i am extremely anxious and spend all of my time worrying about my future. if i could do anything i would probably study computer science but i am shit at math so that's out of the picture. i took a gap year after high school because of family and personal problems so im already a year behind everyone else and i have no fucking idea what i want to do, and i don't want to waste my time spinning my wheels at a shitty community college. i know i probably sound stupid being so young and so worried, that's what everyone says; but for some reason i'm so upset with myself to the point where i almost fantasize about dying every single day. i guess it's because i am obsessed with being successful (i know it's ironic) and i'm so lost at my age that it just makes me angry with myself.

classes start in a couple of days and i am dreading it because the credits count toward a business degree and i dont think i want to go down that path. i have no passions i would rather just save myself the misery and off myself
