I can be happy for a little bit at a time before I'm reminded of reality.I'm on LOA from work as I absolutely could not get out of bed anymore, I self-injure constantly now, drink a lot, everything has crashed in the last month and I don't know why. I am very alone, no one knows I'm going through this and there's no one to tell anyway, I don't have any close friends or acquaintances.

I desperately need help in the form of someone in real life as I'm now dissociating constantly on the internet and in my mind but I don't know what to do. I've been alone for years and I don't have anyone. 

I promise I won't do anything soon so if you respond and I don't write back or it takes a while I haven't done anything. I don't want anyone to worry.
