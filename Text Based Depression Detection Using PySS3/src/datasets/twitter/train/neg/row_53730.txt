These past few weeks my mental health has been at an all time low
Everything is going wrong, after.my longest clean streak ever, I got back into SH, I have a shot one of work to do 
I cant muster the energy to even fucking move 
I dissapoint everyone, and they hate me.becasue of that 
Im.just a burden they need to carry around
I literally have no positive qualities. 
If I did have some I wouldn't be posting here 
One of my irl friends just started yelling at me that I am apathetic fuck because I didn't day the right thing when I was panicking 
The only people who don't think I'm terrible are my online friends, but they've never seen my face so why should I make them feel in any way possible for my mental well being 

I cant calm down I haven't moved for hours I just am scrolling through my games library aimlessly because I can't seem to do anything, I can't even cry. I'm just listening to music yet its just whote.noise now .

I cant take anything anymore, no one has noticed my absence. 
Is.it worth it? Is there more.to life than laying on my bed and staring qt the wall? Cuz it sure doesn't feel like there's anything left for me. 

One of these days I'm going to snap, but a part of me wants to live, for my friends on my minecraft sever. I don't want to let them.down one last time. 

In sorry for disturbing all of you, hope you are all having a better day than i am
