I like to think I feel normal but then I'm not.Killing myself goes through my mind a lot.  I used to think it was normal and that everyone has these thoughts and theres nothing to worry about. It's been getting more and more frequent of coming to mind. For the past couple months, it feels like there has not been one day that goes by without the thought of ending myself. It scares me because I feel I'm becoming more accepting and/or prone to do it. I'm becoming less afraid to die. Today, I got hit the scariest rush of just wanting to do it. It had never felt so strong in my life before. I'm scared that it's going to get worse.
