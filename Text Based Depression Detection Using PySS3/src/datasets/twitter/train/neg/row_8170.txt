Can something kill me?Iâ€™m tired of it all. Nothing ever changes. Repetitive job, unmotivated in school, shitty family, superficial connections, drugs, so fucking lonely. Life is slowly drowning me. Please, can a lightning bolt strike me? Can someone crash into me? Can my coworker decide to shoot me? Poison my food? Health complications? Please
I have a method, but Iâ€™m too scared of failing to try again.
