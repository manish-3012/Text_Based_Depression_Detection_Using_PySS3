If I Admit, or hint at being suicidal again, I'm gonna land my dumbass back in the mental ward.Last year when I was pushed over the edge by some dumb shit school staff were throwing at me, they called the fucking cops on me and hauled my ass to the hospital. It was one of the scariest experiences I've ever had, and I'm scared that if I let someone know I'm on the verge of being suicidal again I'll have to go through that shit again, and maybe endure it for ever longer. I know they had good intentions when sending me there, but I'm mortified at the thought of doing it again.
