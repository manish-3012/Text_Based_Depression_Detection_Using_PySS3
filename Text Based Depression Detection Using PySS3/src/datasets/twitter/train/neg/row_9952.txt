Gonna kill myself tonight unless anyone has a comeplling reason not toMy mom's dying of cancer. Life fucking sucks. From what I've heard, it will only get a lot worse once she's gone. So I finally decided today to just end this shit so I can finally stop worrying and being in this hell.

And before anyone says it, "your family will suffer" is not a good enough reason. Everyone is gonna die and life sucks anyway. Suffering is unavoidable. 

IDK why I'm posting this here cus I know we are all strangers and it shouldn't really matter to anyone here if I die or not.
