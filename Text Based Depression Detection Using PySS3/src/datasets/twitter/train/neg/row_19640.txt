Fuck it.I've been depressed since I was 12 so a decade now, I have made 3 attempts one of which got me put into the psych ward at 17 involuntarily and that is where i first was medicated. Since then I have done therapy and medications (prozac, celexa, effexor, wellbutrin)ive been depressed since i was 12 so a decade now, I have made 3 attempts one of which got me put into the psych ward involuntarily. I spent 1 week in the psych ward after overdosing on Prozac and chased it with half a handle of Tequila but it was the most serious of my attempts since I decided to kill myself after I was sexually assaulted when I was still a virgin. Since then, I am now 22 and i have done therapy and medications but i feel like these medications have changed me or even altered my personality. I also feel like such a failure for not even being able to kill myself correctly or having the means to do so. I just can't expect the next decade of my life to be anything like the last one...
