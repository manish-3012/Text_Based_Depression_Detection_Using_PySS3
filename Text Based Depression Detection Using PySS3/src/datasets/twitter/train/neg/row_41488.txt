Where to go from hereHi

I'm new to Reddit, but seen this after googling something.

I've suffered with depression and anxiety for the past 7 years. I recently had another breakdown and had been having .y medication reviewed and increased fortnightly. No one seems to listen when I tell them it's not working. I was referred to a mental health clinic. I waited half an hour past my appointment time to be seen. Spoke to two men for 15 minutes and the outcome was being told they deal with people with more severe issues, like bipolar and those that have made an attempt on their lives already. They gave me some telephone numbers and some websites, despite me telling them I've gone through that already.
This is the worst I've ever been. I've never self harmed before this. I now have several cuts on my arms and legs. I'd never considered suicide. I've now written suicide notes, and have a plan in place for when the day comes that I can no longer cope. I've never been so desperate, but here I am.

I've had councilling before and did not find it helpful. I do think if my family and how it would impact them, but I know they will move on. All I seem to be doing now is get in their way and upset or anger them with my issues. 

I've asked for help. I am still asking but no one seems to listen. 

Where do I go from here if not to end it?
