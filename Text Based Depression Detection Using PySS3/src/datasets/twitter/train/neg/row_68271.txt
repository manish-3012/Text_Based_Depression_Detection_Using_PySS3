People don't like me. God doesn't want meWhat the fuck. I keep setting myself up to accidentally die. But for some reason it never works. I tried to get covid. Still test negative. Tried to let the car drive off the road. Pavement and rumble straps kept correcting my car back into the lane. Went rock climbing, fell. Didn't get hurt. Tried to jump. Some kid and her dog wouldn't go away. Â°warning: may cause death, ok. Let me volunteerÂ°

I keep putting myself in situations where I can easily die and it'll be considered an accident. But everytime I try, something happens. Im starting to think God doesn't want me. If there is an afterlife; heaven, hell, and earth are plating hot potato with my soul. In the end. No one wants me. 



Accidents left to try this summer: fall asleep on a pool float in the ocean. Explore an active volcano, mine collapse, defective fireworks, motorcycle accident. If all else fails. A hot shot of heroin and some concrete shoes will do the trick. Im ready to disappear
