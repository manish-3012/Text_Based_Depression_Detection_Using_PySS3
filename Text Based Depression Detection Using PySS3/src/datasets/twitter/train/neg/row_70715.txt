I want this shit to end (rant)Iâ€™ve been bullied all my life for whatever reason, pushed away by people who claimed they loved me and Iâ€™m tired of it. People are constantly treating me like shit when Iâ€™ve never done anything bad to anyone my own family treats me like shit especially since my stupid mother left my dad sheâ€™s constantly trying to start fights with me for no reason and she is so immature towards serious situations for example my older cousin has depression and she literally made fun of him because of it which pisses me off because I feel like I maybe depressed and would like professional help, but how can I do that if the only adult thatâ€™s supposed to â€œcareâ€ for me shows favoritism towards my stupid step sister that only needs me for her own personal gain and makes fun of me constantly. Iâ€™m seriously tired of crying myself to sleep everyday because of all the stress going on in my life I seriously want to kill myself but whenever I try Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to do anything ;,)
