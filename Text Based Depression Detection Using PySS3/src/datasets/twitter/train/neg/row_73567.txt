Im going to leave this flat in an hour and go and jump off a bridge.Ive found the perfect candidate, with a 61 metre or 200ft drop into the water. And only about an hour and half journey away. Ill have to catch a few trains and such. You may even see it on the news when it happens. 

Im sorry. Theres no other way out. This was always going to happen, I didnt know itd be this soon.
