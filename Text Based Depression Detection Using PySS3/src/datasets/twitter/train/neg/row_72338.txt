I want to give up but if noody cares about me I will do itwhen a last person left
seriously nobody cares about me, i mean when my
boyfriend is gone (i hope i won't) i will do this job. I have no family and friends who love me. I'm just alone bf. 

I'm going too far on my bf . I'm afraid that he will be bored with me. I am already a patient with BPD, so I am worried / afraid of a normal person.

I do not care about myself anymore. But I'm in love and I can't go.

idk just i am tried.and i miss you him.bb
