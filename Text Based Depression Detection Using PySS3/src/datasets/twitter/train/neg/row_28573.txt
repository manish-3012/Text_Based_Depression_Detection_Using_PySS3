I want the void to engulf my beingThis grief, sorrow, melancholy are paralyzingly. I canâ€™t move, frozen in the same repetitive thoughts, actions.

Everything moves incredibly slowly, blinking alone taking 10 seconds. I see everything which I can not unsee.

Vomit comes out, oh how I wish how I could leave this corpse, infested with roaches.

I feel so very cold.

Rolling my eyes backwards, to find peace at last.

Iâ€™m greeted with a sudden familiarity.

My consciousness being absorbed, connected with a multitude of others. 

Pain no more. All knowing.
