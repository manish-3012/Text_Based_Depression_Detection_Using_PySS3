Sometimes i wish my girlfriend would break up with me so i could kill myself.Over the past year ive lost all my friends and my family has begun treating me worse and worse. Somehow my girlfriend still thinks im "the best boyfriend ever" and is madly in love with me. On some level it pisses me off because now i can't kill myself. I have to be here for her. Ive stopped taking my meds and am withdrawing and it fucking sucks but my mom won't take me to my psychiatrist to get a refill so oh well lol. She wont let me do therapy. So i just sit at home with nothing and no one. On top of that shitty wifi. Id rather have no wifi because it is so irritating. They call me squidward on account of my voice and they get upset when i am defensive or cold towards them and im just always an asshole. I think about sabatoging my relationship with my girlfriend so i can end it and make the majority happy
