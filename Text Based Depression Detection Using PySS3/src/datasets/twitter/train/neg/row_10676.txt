Iâ€™m gonna be alone foreverIâ€™m a failure. Gonna be 25 in a few months. No one likes me man. I donâ€™t know what it is. I know it has to do with me but Iâ€™m so tired of blaming myself for everything. Iâ€™m so alone and so tired of being an outcast. That shit is painful. I had so much potential but I guess itâ€™s going all down the drain. I pray to god like everyday for help and I get nothing. I hate my life, I hate this world, I just want it to end.
