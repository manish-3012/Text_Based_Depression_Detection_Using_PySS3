I don't know why I bothered getting helpI feel so unbelievably self destructive right now, I've been using drugs to cope more and more, and I have this horrible urge to just kill myself, I've overdosed and I feel like it's worth a second attempt. I reached out for help a while ago, and things were more manageable for a while, but recently it's getting too much again and I just can't be bothered to keep trying. I've stopped contacting friends and not really bothered replying to people who gave me support bc I just cannot be bothered. I'm fed up of this shitty cycle.
