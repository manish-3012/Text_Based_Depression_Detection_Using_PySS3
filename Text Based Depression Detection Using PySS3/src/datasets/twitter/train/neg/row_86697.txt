Here it is and I don't know why2 months without serious suicidal thoughts until now... Strange how nothing seems to get better. I've been severely depressed for 5 sad, long years. Feel like I can say comfortably I'm broken. This is my life. Or what I always come to.

I tried to help myself get better a lot recently. I quit using hard drugs mostly 2 months ago. (Mainly Meth) I'm not homeless or abused anymore. I made 1 friend I think. I'm getting a job... Really, I still feel sad and empty. I've been smoking weed and cigarettes all day everyday, drinking quite a bit of Alcohol too. Everytime I try to calm down on my consumption, cause I can't well afford what I'm doing I go fuck it up. More excuses I make for myself while I burn my money and enjoy what little of life I can while fucked up.  

I still think of just fucking off with my money while I have some and using again. I want to die though. I don't want to be a tweaker anymore I wanna OD. Im not a sad freak show killing herself slowly anymore I suck suck so much  I've got some opiates I can wash down with alcohol but I'm scared. I'm always scared. Fear... Hate myself so mucg I'm 19 I wanna live more . I can't cope
