it really cares if i hurt myself?ps: i have my history of self-harm, not that im thinking of starting.
but ive talk to a friend who understands, he says that i have to take advantage of my life, but i can do both.. 
idk what im saying, idk why it seems like im on my knees begging u to tell me it's okay to do it, I know that you won't tell me that. but.. 
i smoke or drink because i feel like im hurting myself, and no one will tell me to stop, im not going to kill myself, so who cares about scars. i feel like i need that pain to feel present or smtng.. 
i read you, tell me what you think.
