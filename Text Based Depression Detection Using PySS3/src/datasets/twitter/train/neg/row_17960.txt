Getting Really Tired of LifeAs a caretaker for my grandma with late stage dementia, her condition gets progressively worse. We've tried many different meds to help her, but none really work. I emotionally lost her 5 years ago.

As a chronic pain sufferer myself, I deal with agonizing pain with no relief. I live in the US, and I can't get a prescription for my pain. And no OTC meds help whatsoever. That makes being a caretaker much harder.

As a depression sufferer, that almost hurts more than the physical pain in my life. Almost every day, I contemplate suicide, and how much relief it COULD bring. I wish there was a testimonial of heaven, so people like us would know what's on the other side.

These 3 things are soul-crushing. The pain hurts. The anxiety hurts. The caretaking is draining. I'm just getting so tired of living.
