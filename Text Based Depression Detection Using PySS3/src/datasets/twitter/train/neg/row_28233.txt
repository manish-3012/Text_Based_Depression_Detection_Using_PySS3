The world doesnâ€™t help with making me not want to live hereThere is so much hatred in the world now, everyone hates everyone else. I used to want to have children when I was younger but I donâ€™t anymore because itâ€™s such a shitty place to bring a child into.

I miss being a child and not having to care about politics, money or what I want to do with my life. I just really dislike the world today is what Iâ€™m saying
