I want to die to hurt my familyLately Iâ€™ve been feeling suicidal two or three days a week, but every time I start gearing up for it I back out last minute (I want to tie a pair of stocking around my neck, I hope it will work). Tonight I sat in the bathroom while my husband slept and punched myself in the head and stomach until I cried.

I keep thinking about my little cousins and nieces and nephews.... and I know some of them are suicidal, Iâ€™m someone they look up to.

My husband is a cop, so he has been seeing these things for awhile.... but lately heâ€™s become secretive and kind of..... not there. He is the only one who knows about my depression, I put a really really good face on for everyone else.

Weâ€™ve been married for a long time, and all of the sudden itâ€™s like he doesnâ€™t even care when I become depressed. It makes me feel selfish like my depression is just for attention, and it makes me feel guilty and even more depressed.

I was verbally and sexually abused by my parents growing up and it really left a lot of scars on me. Even though I thought I had heated from them theyâ€™re all coming back.
What they did makes me hate myself, they always told me I was a burden. Told me no one would love me because I was disgusting. 
I feel disgusting.

I donâ€™t know if I could ever really kill myself, but I feel like I want to start pushing everyone away now before they find out how selfish I am and leave me. 

Or I want to act so selfish that they leave me on my terms....

I donâ€™t know. I ready need support but I canâ€™t reach out to anyone around me because Iâ€™m their support and it would crush them.
