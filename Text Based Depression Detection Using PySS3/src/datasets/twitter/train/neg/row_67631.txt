Reading holographic principle is tearing me apart I need someone to help meI started reading about the holographic principle and it has been killing me, it's triggered my ocd the worst it's ever been and I just feel like ending it all.
Someone said this to me "It says that what we see happening in three dimensions might be controlled from somewhere else. You think you are a body walking arround but you are actually somewhere else controlling the body. Even that sounds extremely theoretical and like a long stretch"
This idea has driven me crazy, what's the point in living if this is the case? Could someone refute what the person has said? Is the person wrong or right?
