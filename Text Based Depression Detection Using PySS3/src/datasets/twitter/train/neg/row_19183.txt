HelpIm getting tired.  Im sad.  Im fat.  Ive been fat my whole life since I was a baby.  I really think its the reason Ive never asked a girl out.  Im 28.  I live with my dad.  I had a decent job but now they are doing a layoff and I have a month left.  Ive told my mom Ive wanted to kill myself since I was about 10 but she only tells me dont do it.  Which honestly doesnt help.  My dad doesnt know and honestly probably wouldnt help. I dont have the money for a doctor.   Im lonely I want someone to love.  I dont know what I should do.  Im trying to loose weight but im having aches and pains now in my joints and I have been looking for nutrtional ways to help it.  I need help its the reason im writing this.  Im at a very low point lower than ive ever been.  Theres a lot more to this but I cant think of it right now.
