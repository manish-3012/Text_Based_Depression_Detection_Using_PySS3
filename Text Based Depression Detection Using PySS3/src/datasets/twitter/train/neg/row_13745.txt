I don't knowI am so empty. It hurts. I've tried to kill myself before and failed. Thinking about hanging. But I am a piece of shit that's too much of a coward and can't stop thinking about the pain last time I tried. And what if I fail again. I've been failing in everything recently and what if I fail again. Am already very socially withdrawn.
