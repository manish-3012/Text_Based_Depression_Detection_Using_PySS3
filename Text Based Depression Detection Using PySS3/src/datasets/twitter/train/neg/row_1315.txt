I'm back. 6 months on and I'm back in the same place... Please help me Reddit.I posted a few months ago about feeling lost and alone. Well I'm back. Since last time, I have been to therapy and been happy. But now I have started uni. I like what in studying and I made lots of new friends. I feel terrible for having these feelings because I don't want to hurt the people around me. (Im 17 m if that makes any difference) I feel alone, lost, directionless and empty. I feel like a burden to my new friends and I am not happy. I've considered a lot over the past few days.
