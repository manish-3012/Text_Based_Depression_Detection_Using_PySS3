I just drank 60+ pills of tynenolI threw up and my head feels heavy, grandma... grandpa... Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m not going to heaven with you guys, Iâ€™m going straight to hell, Iâ€™m scared I donâ€™t want to end up on the hospital again. I just want the pain to end, dad Iâ€™m sorry I know it was close to your birthday but I canâ€™t do it anymore, Iâ€™m a failure, to my friends, Iâ€™m also sorry... you guys were amazing, I love all of you, to my boyfriend, Iâ€™m sorry I said I liked you, a part of me was lying, Iâ€™m not sure whether I actually did like you or was just desperate.
Mom... mommy.... I love you, please donâ€™t die, I would hate that, I love you, mom Iâ€™m scared, it really hurts.... Iâ€™m sorry mom, I love you so much but I donâ€™t want to suffer anymore, Iâ€™m selfish, I know, please understand me, mom... mom...mommy.... I love you.
Iâ€™m sorry, everyone, Iâ€™m sorry, I really am, I really am just a failure, Iâ€™m sorry.
Goodbye
