Just tired of existingI'm at my limit for my mental well being. I've been diagnosed with incurable rheumatoid arthritis, been seeking treatment for over a year with no medications working. I have gastroparesis, so I have a very difficult relationship with food and often can't eat without severe pain.

My mental health has been down the shitter. Was involuntary committed to a psychiatric facility earlier this year for a laceration to my upper forearm. No meds are working for me. I can barely control the anxiety and depression. I have ptsd from traumatic childhood consisting of physical verbal and mental and sexual abuse. I have ptsd cuz so many doctors have spat on me and told me my symptoms were in my head. Today I threw things, hit doors and walls and fucked up my left arm with cuts after a doctor appt.

I just want to give up and take some fucking pills and go to sleep and never wake up.

I have a husband and two young children. I'm not the mom they deserve and they would be better off without me fucking up their lives.

I'm done. I want out. I want the pain and suffering to stop. My dad committed suicide. I understand his reasons. I hope he can understand mine.
