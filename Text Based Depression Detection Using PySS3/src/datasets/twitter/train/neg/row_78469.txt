What to do with my last two weeks?I have decided I have nothing left to live for anymore.  I'm okay with this; I've been on this road for like fifteen years.  It was a long run.  The only reason I'm not doing it now is because my mom's birthday is this week.  And then I can't do it right after her birthday because my grandmother is turning 80 at the end of the month.  And I know I'm being selfish, but I'm not that selfish.  My mom and my grandma deserve to be happy on their birthdays.

So, one day between February 26 and March 1, and probably February 28 because I won't be missed for a full 7 days, I'm finally going to kill myself.  I don't want to be talked out of it.  I have $77 with nothing else coming in.  What should I do with my last two weeks?  If even serial killers get a last meal, shouldn't I get a last hurrah?

TL;DR I have decided on the when where and how to kill myself, do not wish to be talked out of it, and only want to know how to have inexpensive fun with my last two weeks.
