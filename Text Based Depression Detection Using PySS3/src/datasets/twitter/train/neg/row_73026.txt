HelpCant think straight at all ... I'm feeling like I should hurt myself so that I dont have to go to work tomorrow. This is the second day in a row that I've promised something to work colleagues, then at the last minute had to say I cant deliver. they must think I'm a fucking idiot. I've had to lie and say I've a family emergency to attend to. But they probably dont believe me. How can I go in tomorrow and look them in the eye? I havent felt this acutely suicidal before and its really terrifying. I have been pacing my room just punching myself in the head to try and feel something different.
