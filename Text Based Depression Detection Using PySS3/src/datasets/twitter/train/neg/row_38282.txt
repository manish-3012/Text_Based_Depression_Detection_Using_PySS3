My 16th is in a week but I doubt Iâ€™ll make it to then.My friends ( known for years ) fell out with my 2 months ago then my boyfriend ( of 1year ) dumped me 3 weeks ago for another girl and him and his gf keep harassing me by texting me trying to flex it . Iâ€™m having to go to college with in September as my ex made me enrol there as he was going there and my future is looking bleak . I usually donâ€™t post on reddit but Iâ€™ve ran out of avenues and have no one I can speak to about it . I was supposed to be spending my 16th with him but Iâ€™m spending it with my other friends who I love but one of them canâ€™t even make it and itâ€™s making me feel so anxious as one has strict parents and I donâ€™t want to be alone . I get random waves of happiness then sadness . I was fine for weeks but suddenly now I feel an immense sadness and depression and bleakness for my birthday . I should be happy - but Iâ€™m not . Everyoneâ€™s got an active social life and in relationships and Iâ€™m here alone when I donâ€™t deserve to be . Everyone says Iâ€™m pretty so I should be popular but Iâ€™m not and never have been . I keep waiting for better days but there isnâ€™t any and Iâ€™m getting way to fed up . Iâ€™ve tried suicide before and itâ€™s just left me with weight loss and sickness . Iâ€™m thinking of hanging myself soon in some woods but I donâ€™t even know how to do that and I doubt I can look up a guide on it . I keep looking up and praying things were different but when they are different they still feel the same , Iâ€™m generally unsatisfied . Thanks to whoever read it , Iâ€™m not expecting any comments I just wanted somewhere to post .
