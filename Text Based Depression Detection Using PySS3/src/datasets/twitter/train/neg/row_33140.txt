Situation gets worse - Can't find professional helpMy current mental health is affecting my grades, relationship and daily life to the Point where it's all too much to handle for me. I cry almost everyday and I'm extremely moody and exhausted all the time. I've promised my boyfriend that I will work on myself and get help to do so, because he can't deal with my emotional outbursts no longer.

Problem is, I can't find a psychologist that a) takes patients from my Insurance class (I'm from Germany, we have a 2 Class system), b) is sympathetic to me and c) has open slots for new patients. 

I'm feeling more and more hopeless and I've made some rather whimsical attempts to end it. (Taking few Ibuprofins too much, trying to cut open my arms but I'm not strong enough and/or too scared to make real attemps yet. Thank God I guess?) But I try Harder everytime. 

I argue with my Boyfriend all of the time, I probably wont be able to study what I want to if I let go of school more, can't stand my Peers anymore,... 

What can I do to recieve psychological help quick? I know the psychologists in Hospitals are only for short term treatment and I dont want to go just anywhere... I'm fairly insecure when talking to people I dont find sympathetic. 

It sounds kind of dumb written out but I just want to be in therapy and prove that I want to change quick...
