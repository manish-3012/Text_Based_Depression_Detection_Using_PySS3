giving upi feel like i just need to end it all. i just cannot stand anything in my life. i feel like everyone has gave up on me. my friends, my teachers, my parents. i honestly think no one would care if i die. when iâ€™m sad no ones asks if iâ€™m okay,no one and I canâ€™t stand myself. iâ€™m so ugly, iâ€™m awkward all the time and I like stupid and everyone probably thinks iâ€™m a loser and i mean its not like anyone would care if I died. Iâ€™m just a mistake and everyone knows it and iâ€™m just a giant stupid idiot. nothing stays in my brain and if i get any bad grades then my parents will get a large metal or wooden rod and beat me with it and i canâ€™t stand the feeling of disappointment i cause to people. no one ever want to partner up or sit next to me, because none of the people I know are in my class I must be that ugly right? no one will ever like me so whatâ€™s the point in living?
