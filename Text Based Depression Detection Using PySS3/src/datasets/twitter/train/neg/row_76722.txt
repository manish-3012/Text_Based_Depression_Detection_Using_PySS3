suicide as a control over life, or curiosityNot syre if this goes here byt I'll go anyway.

Basically put; I'm scared shitless of dying. It occupies my thoughts for hours and it never goes away. It keeps me awake at night and makes my heart race. It gives an odd feeling of instense fear I've only experienced a few times in my life.

All I think about during these "episodes" I guess you could call them, is how it would feel to die, when I could die and what happens after I've died. 

It's this sort of curiosity that makes me want to off myself. Then there's also the control factor. Sometimes I manage to convince myself that killing myself is the only logical answer to my problems that ironically puts me in control of my own life and gives it direction, even though I'd be dead.
Why do I feel this way? How do I stop?

I don't realise what I'm thinking until I get distracted by something or fall asleep. Then afterwards I think, wow man, what the fuck?

Can anyone relate?
