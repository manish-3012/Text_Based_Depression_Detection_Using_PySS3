Broken tin soldier laying down his rifle.I am drowning, I am not a normal human being. I am so completely overcome with anxiety that I barely am able to function. I have a wonderful girlfriend that I have destroyed by being the way I am. There is absolutely no hope for me after trying therapy for over 5 years and only being told that there is no hope for me anymore.  I seem unable to fight the fear, the pain and the misery and therefore I am here. It probably won't help much as I have already come to an agreement with myself that if I am not any better when I hit 30, then I am not going to be here. 

I have realized these last 6 months that there is no beauty, safety, happiness, joy or anything good left in the world. There is only waking up in the mornings drenched in sweat and trying your best to feel a little less scared, a little more brave. I am rambling, the only thing I want is to not be a drain on society and my loved ones. Even here I am a drain to whoever bothers to read this. Nothing will ever change.
