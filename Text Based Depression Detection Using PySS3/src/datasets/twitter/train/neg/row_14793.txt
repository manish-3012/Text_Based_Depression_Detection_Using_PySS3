I don't know what to call what I didI've been pressing my knife up to my thigh and neck for a month or so. Today I just pressed the tip of my blade up against my throat to see how far in I could push, I started to feel the blade break skin so I stopped. I felt terrible afterwards, I don't have the courage to tell my therapist and face the consequences. I wish I had someone in my life that I trusted. I just want to be held by someone, I miss human contact.
