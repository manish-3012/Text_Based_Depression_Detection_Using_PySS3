How do I stop?People see me as confident and sometimes egotistical but that'd because I'm desperately trying to hide my low self esteem. I feel like nothing without the approval of other people. Why? Because other people liking you and thinking you're smart and funny is a great way to not be lonely. I hate myself so so much. But at the same time I don't. It's so hard. Idk how to stop.

When I'm by myself I start thinking "hey I'm not too bad, I'm actually pretty good" but at the slightest little jokes from my friends or the slightest form of disapproval I feel like nothing like I have no personality or start to bait people for attention by being annoying.

The slightest criticism of me makes me feel like a worthless zero that should just drive her car off a cliff already.

Why am I like this why can't I stop? I'm so ashamed of myself. Every day I try to rebuild myself to come off as cool or funny or witty but I always ruin it.

I hate myself so much. I used to "be myself" but I was bullied mercilessly for it when I was younger. Which is why I try to hide everything I am behind a facade.

In reality I'm a boring, weird, dimwitted loser (and ugly too.)

I'm 19 and have never had a boyfriend or even a kiss. Boys used to humiliate me and say "a lady? That thing isn't a lady."

I'm just one of those fucked up mistakes of nature and an attention seeker too. My very nature is vile.

I honestly think that I will die by my own hand, sooner or later. I've tried to be better but I can't.
