I don't want to die, but I can't stop thinking about killing myself.I'm at the point where I'm on the floor crying and begging to a god I don't even believe in to get these thoughts of killing myself out of my head. I'm scaring myself and I honestly cannot stop thinking about it. I've been crying all night and I don't know what to do anymore
