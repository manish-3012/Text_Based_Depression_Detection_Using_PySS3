she's given up on us, and i cannot go on anymoreshe's given up on us, and i cannot go on anymore. it really is my last drop. i tried my best to go on, and i tried so much to be by her side. i'd do everything for her, but she gave up. i can't bear to live this life anymore, i kept going with the hopes of being by her side for the rest of my life. i've lost this too now, and officially i have no reason to live.  life wasn't meant for me. i tried so much and in the end, it was for nothing. none of my efforts and my attempts ever amounted to anything. it's simply too much to bear, the pain, the stress and everything is falling apart. i've tried my best to keep on going. the thought of suicide has been giving me so much peace and tranquility lately, and now i feel like i finally gathered all the courage i needed. thank you for giving me the best year of my life and for making me the happiest i've ever been. i prayed and asked god to keep look out for you. i wish you the best of llfe, i love you.
