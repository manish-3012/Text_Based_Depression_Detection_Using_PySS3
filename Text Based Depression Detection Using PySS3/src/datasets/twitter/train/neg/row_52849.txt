I don't know what else to do?It feels like this is all my life was ever going to lead up to and I just want to get it over with. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do or say to make the people around me realize that I'm not ok. I'm just so terrified of failing again and ending up in the hospital again because that would REALLY ruin my life. But I don't know what else I'm supposed to do, I'm just over it.
