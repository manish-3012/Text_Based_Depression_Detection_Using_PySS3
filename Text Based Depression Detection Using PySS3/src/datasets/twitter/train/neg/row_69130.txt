word vomitI've talked to a lot of people about my struggles with depression. I find I always get the same response; you're an incredible person and you have so much to live for. Something along those lines.
I know my friends mean well, but I can't help but think there's some sort of insincerity there. No one's ever stopped and thought, maybe this is the best thing for you.
I really just want some one to sit down with me, tell me it is an option, that not every one's life has to amount to something, that for once in my life I'm allowed to be selfish, that I'm allowed to do something for myself.

I'm not happy. I can't see myself being happy. I'm about to be kicked out of school, it took me 6 years to graduate high school, how did I think University was going to be any different? 
I feel like my life is a constant downward spiral (to be completely cliche). I've come to terms with the fact that I'm going to die alone and unhappy. Why do I have to wait?
