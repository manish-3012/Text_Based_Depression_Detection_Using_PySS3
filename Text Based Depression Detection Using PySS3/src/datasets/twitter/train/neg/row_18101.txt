I am over 40. I have lost everything because of how I was born. I cant do this anymore.Autistic adult. Life destroyed. Everything I worked to build gone in the blink of an eye. Tossed in the trash by the only person who ever really saw me for me. Ultimately rejected because of this fucking brain in my head not able to function properly. I am old now. Born broken but now shattered. Unwanted. I dont even want me around. I struggle each day not to drink a glass of poison. I will lose this fight. I have no one.
