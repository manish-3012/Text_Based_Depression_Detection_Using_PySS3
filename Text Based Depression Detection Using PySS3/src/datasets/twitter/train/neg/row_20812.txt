I feel like I'm a disappointment to everyone in my life, I don't want to live this wayI just hurt the person that I most cherish. My boyfriend, and he doesn't want to be with me anymore. I understand him, I'm a monster. But I don't want to be. I don't know what happen to me, my parents raised me so well, and I'm just a disappointment for them. They don't deserve this.
Now I don't know how I can continue living, with this feeling of failure in everything in my life. I don't want to live with this guilty. But I'm too afraid to kill myself, I don't want to do this with my parents. But I don't know what to do from now on. Every little thing I do is wrong and causes sadness to other people. I already take pills for depression and anxiety,.don't know what to do anymore.
