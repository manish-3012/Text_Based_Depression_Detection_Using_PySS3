I hurt myself.I recently lost a friend. She was like a sister and she meant the world to me. Now that she's pregnant at 17 and about to get married to a guy she met on omegle maybe 3 months ago, I guess I don't mean shit anymore. I tried inviting her over to talk and she said she couldn't. I told her I felt neglected by her lately, and that it had hurt me because I've been feeling really lonely lately. You know what she did? She said she is going through a lot right now and that at least her new friend is willing to help her through it. But where was this new friend when I helped you tell your parents? Where was she when you wanted someone to get you the test and someone to be there when you took it? Who cooked you meals and encouraged you to eat better and to stop smoking? And after all that and more, you still have the nerve to say I haven't done anything for you, keep 25 dollars that you promised me for helping at your dad's shop (I need the money too...), and keep the book my younger brother checked out for you until the fine is 15 dollars and then tell me you gave it to me and I lost it. Yes, you hurt me. You hurt me so much, I started to see your side of things. I haven't been there lately, for like 2 weeks, because I was dealing with suicide episodes and mental breakdowns. Maybe I am a bad person and I'm just deluded into thinking I'm good. Maybe I deserved you using me like you did for years. And if you ask to talk, I'll probably still come around. So I started hating myself more and I had to hurt myself too. I did it with a knife, and it felt good to be in pain. But my boyfriend saw the cuts, and I gave him permission to tell my therapist before my appointment tomorrow because I know I won't. I'm ashamed, and I'm scared of facing my therapist tomorrow. Maybe she'll hate me too because I cut myself or because I'm finally giving up on therapy without medication. Maybe it'd be better if I died tonight.
