This subreddit is a special place.Iâ€™ve been misdiagnosed my entire life. I finally went to an amazing transplant psychiatrist when I needed a kidney. It was the first time I stayed working with someone for almost 2 years. We worked together and she finally told me itâ€™s NOT just bi polar disorder. 

So I just learned my whole life I have been suffering with borderline personality as well. 

Iâ€™m heartbroken for how I lashed out at family. I couldnâ€™t help it. I was just so scared and sad. 

I canâ€™t believe me I made it this far. I think of that poor little kid I was who let people ruin him. He deserved better care, treatment and intense therapy. Iâ€™ve been living while Iâ€™m on burning in a fire that I only I can see and feel for much too long. Iâ€™m checking myself into the hospital for the first time willingly and not for others. This will be my 8th or 9th and I honestly pray my last. Thank you all for sharing your stories. 


They have helped in ways I can ever explain to you. I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll get back but honestly Iâ€™m not rushing this time. 

Thanks for listening
