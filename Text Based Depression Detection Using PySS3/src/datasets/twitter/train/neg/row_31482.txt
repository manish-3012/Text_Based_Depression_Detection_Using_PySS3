[UPDATE] I can't afford to fly back home to see my friends and family for Christmas first. I'll end it the day of instead.Originally I was planning on saying goodbye before I left. I planned on getting plane tickets only to find they were out of reach of what my current job is paying me. Train and bus tickets won't work because of the timeframe that I have off.
The place where I'm staying is going to be empty (except for a cat) as everyone else goes home to see their family. I have friends in the city I'm in but they will also have holiday plans as well.
I am thinking of going quietly; perhaps with sleeping pills and a bottle of cabernet. It's weird thinking that people fear dying alone. I feel it's more convenient. I have roughly a week off, so I'll have plenty of time to think about the various ways of saying goodbye.
