I just need to go for everyone's sakeI can't even be bothered using my throwaway, I'm over it.

I'm just a disgrace to everyone and a waste of air. My girlfriend does everything to support me but I can't be fixed. The longer I put it off the more hurt she gets and the harder it will be for her when I go.

I'm sick of hearing I need to set goals, work on myself, all of that bullshit. I've been selfish my whole life and it's gotten me nowhere. Now I can't fix that I just need to end it so my girlfriend can accept it and move on and I won't have to deal with bullshit life anymore.

I don't help anyone, I don't do anything meaningful, I have no skills or potential to do anything with my life. Why would I keep going? It's a pointless waste of time.
