I'm doneI've been scratching skin off nonstop and hitting myself with whatever is around and I'm just done with everything. I want nothing more than to kill myself in front of my ex so he has to deal with that pain the rest of his life. I wasted three years on him, going to therapy even though I didn't want to, taking anxiety meds that made me feel horrible, quitting other medication that I need because he thought it might make me more stable... all while he refused to seek help for all of the problems he has. Every time I tried to tell him something was wrong or that things he said/did hurt me, he cut off all contact and just made my anxiety and depression worse. I was constantly told that I was wrong, that my feelings were wrong. I wasn't even allowed to briefly mention when I'm feeling suicidal because he always shuts down and makes it seem like it's entirely my fault. That was the person I looked to for understanding and support and instead he would always avoid me or break up with me during my most vulnerable moments. I was the only one who was ever expected to get better and fix my mental health issues, never him. Now I just want to end everything so I don't have to live with all of the negative feelings and problems I have, and I desperately want him to have to watch.
