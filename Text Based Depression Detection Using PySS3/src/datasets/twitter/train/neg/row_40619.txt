first job and I'm not looking forward to it.I'm 19 and haven't had a job yet because I have near crippling anxiety and depression and feel pathetic for it, like I'm behind everyone else. my parents have just supported this mindset. I started applying this week because otherwise I'll get kicked out of my home. it doesn't help that I'm a trans man who just looks like a lesbian living in a hick town where I might get beat up for living this way. maybe I just wanted to vent or wanted to hear I'm not alone but right now it's so so hard to stay alive. I've already tried to kill myself once but stayed alive for my boyfriend who's been there for me through all this. I don't want to burden him or my family anymore.
