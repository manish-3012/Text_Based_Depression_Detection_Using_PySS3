Ideation ended up in making a noose tonight.Or trying too. Or experimenting with putting the belt around the shower rail. Even though I had no real intention of killing myself, I did put my head in and let it choke me a bit and possibly hoped Iâ€™d slip and accidentally end up hanging myself.

I feel like Iâ€™m too sensitive for this world. And that sensitivity is seen as a negativity by most, I care about people too much, I get attached and when Iâ€™m scared to lose them I end up pushing them away because Iâ€™m too intense in wanting to let them know how valued they are to me. Most recently a friend from work, who i admitted having feelings for when drunk on a night out, who was a good friend. A month ago she was telling me how thoughtful I was due to the gifts Iâ€™d got her. Now, she wants nothing to do with me and I know itâ€™s basically because I sent a way too intense text about still wanting to retain the friendship.

This has been a pattern for me - I develop these great friendships and then get close and ruin it - with my best friend after we had kissed and now with this colleague. I try and rein it in but I just canâ€™t help it. With this lady, I genuinely felt we flirted and feel stupid for misreading the signs, she had been getting touchy feely a bit towards the end, patting my butt and joking I was her work-husband (she is single).

When this happens I feel it erases all the positive things they thought about me, because one mistake and I end up losing all that, so it doesnâ€™t matter how funny they found me, how thoughtful she thought I was, in the end I just ruin it.

I donâ€™t feel I have anything to offer because the positive traits werenâ€™t enough and I feel like Iâ€™m just not good enough and there must be something fundamentally wrong with me. My ex told me she loved me, spent one week on holiday with me after she cried 2 hours after getting there due to homesickness, and after 2 weeks of looking after her dumped me when we got back. From â€˜soulmateâ€™ to dumping me after 10 days together where I pretty much just looked after her and cancelled my trip early to get her back home (I had planned it for a year and spent a lot of money).

I feel like Iâ€™m too sensitive for a man, and that Iâ€™m not attractive due to it and have nothing to offer and could never be in a long relationship or close friendship due to how sensitive I am. And that I just at care too much about people and get hurt when they leave.

And I really am just tired of it now. Iâ€™m 31 but I feel like Iâ€™ve been struggling for so long.
