Please help.Obviously a throwaway.

My family has a 20% suicide rate. I know that sounds like bullshit but it's true.

I have anxiety and have my entire life. In the last year my entire life has gone to shit and I'm now living with my mother and unable to work. I'm seeing a psychiatrist, weekly counseling, weekly CBT, and I just can't anymore.

I will ALWAYS be sick. There is no cure, I'm just expected to live with the symptoms, maybe medication will ease them a little. Whatever.

I'm sick of this. I've been suicidal before but right now is the most determined I've ever been. I've never had a plan how I was going to do it. I do now.

PLEASE I don't want to beg fucking internet strangers but I'm NOT telling anybody IRL about this. I need help. Please.
