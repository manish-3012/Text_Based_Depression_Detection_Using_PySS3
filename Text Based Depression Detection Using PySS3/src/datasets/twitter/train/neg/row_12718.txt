HeroIâ€™m riding passenger in the car and we passed a girl standing on the side of the road with a sign â€œTHE WORLD IS BETTER WITH YOU IN ITâ€. And honestly Iâ€™m just crying now. I tried hanging myself 2 months ago and itâ€™s still a struggle. I canâ€™t turn the car back or talk to the girl, but I want everyone like her to know that youâ€™re amazing and you have an impact you canâ€™t understand. Thank you heroes, hang in there everyone like me out there. I believe in us.
