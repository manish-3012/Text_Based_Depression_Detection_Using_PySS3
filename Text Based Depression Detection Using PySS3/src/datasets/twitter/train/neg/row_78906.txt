Anyone in a situation similar to mine?19 y/o male in college, struggling in school, poor mental condition overall, fully lonely (not in physical state, but in state of mind), awful luck with the opposite sex, nothing that genuinely makes you happy, bleak outlook on the future.

i feel this state is pretty common among people my age in school, is anyone like that on here?
