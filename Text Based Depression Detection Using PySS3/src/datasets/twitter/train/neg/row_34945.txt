Iâ€™m trying so hard to hold onHey everyone. Iâ€™ve never posted here, and Iâ€™m sad that I feel compelled to, but I guess Iâ€™m thankful that this sub exists. 

I just feel so, *low*. Iâ€™ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for five years and the longer it gets drug out, the longer I realize I havenâ€™t been helping him with his â€œdepression.â€ Itâ€™s just that every time I push him to get a job, he knows if he acts like his mental illness is flaring up Iâ€™ll back off about it. Iâ€™m tired of not having any support and just giving and giving and giving. But I feel so guilty. Like I canâ€™t leave. 

I loved someone who was great once, but he didnâ€™t love me, naturally. And heâ€™s such a great guy that he even stays my friend through everything. That almost hurts worse. I have a soul mate who I am just a buddy to. Itâ€™s a sick fucking joke and it feels like my chest is being crushed and all I can do is sit back and hope for the best for him, because love is selfless.

Iâ€™m so tired but Iâ€™m really successful at work. Today I got offered a job for almost $90,000 a year in HR management. I could support my boyfriend and I on that money. Itâ€™s 60+ hours a week. I want to take it because if Iâ€™m constantly under pressure, distracted by the neon lights of the warehouse I would work in, I wonâ€™t have time to think about how I could do it in the parking lot at work so my family wouldnâ€™t have to see my body. 

Iâ€™m exhausted. It feels like every day Iâ€™m just going through the motions, mechanically. Nothing matters. Nothing is enjoyable. Iâ€™m just patiently waiting to die and Iâ€™m so fucking lonely. I donâ€™t feel like I can talk to my family or they will take me to the ER. They shouldnâ€™t. I wouldnâ€™t actually kill myself. Itâ€™s like the temptation to rob a bank. A million dollars would be wonderful but itâ€™s unreasonable. I canâ€™t talk to my friends. I feel like a burden. I just hope the time goes by quickly.
