I don't understand love.Speaking mostly of parental love. They tell me they "love" me, but why? Just because I exist? I am a loathsome human being. All of my personality traits are negative. I am a narcissist, racist, sexist. My parents don't even know who I am yet they claim to "love" me.
Why?
If I killed myself, they would be extremely upset, but only because they would think that they failed as parents and therefore are failures themselves. My point being, they don't want me to kill myself because it affects THEM. They don't care about me truly. 
And I don't want to hear that they really do care, because you don't know them and you can't assume things about them. My dad is completely indifferent to my suffering. One of those types who doesn't really believe depression is real.
Back to the main point. What the hell is love? And how can someone who can't experience it ever be happy in this life?
