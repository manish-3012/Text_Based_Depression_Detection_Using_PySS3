just tiredi feel like live keeps throwing shit at me, my phone stolen at work, my car break light going on, my mother who i was very close to not talking to me for 3 months now due to fighting over lgbt stuff and my identity. an abusive father i havenâ€™t spoke to in 3 years but i live in the same house as them still. 

i have a stable job, good money for my area, great friends and management who cares and doesnâ€™t let me get step on. 

but itâ€™s seriously the trauma and abuse and life just ripping me apart making things horrible. iâ€™m living just for events and to get to see them happen versus for myself. iâ€™m so tired of being called a disgrace and disgusting for just existing when iâ€™m trying so hard to be stable and consistent, but all of that is invalid due to being lgbt? iâ€™m just... tired.
