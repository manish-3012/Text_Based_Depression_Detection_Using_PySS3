Anger keeps me hereEvery time I think about ending it, I think about some of the people who have hurt me and how they would just have more shit to talk about me if I killed myself. 
I feel like I'm always fucking things up in my relationships when it would be so easy to just play along. I get so sick of faking it for everyone else though and the minute I quit faking it I make people angry with me and then I hate myself more for ducking it all up.
Ugh it's so frustrating. I feel worthless most of the time and that I don't give enough shits about myself to do anything for me. I feel like everything I do in this world is to please others or make people think I'm normal and have my shit together. I don't at all. 
Just needed to vent. Blah word vomit sorry
