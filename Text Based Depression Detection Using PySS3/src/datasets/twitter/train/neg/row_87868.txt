There is nothing for me here, the drive I once had has left me.I have become too far gone to be of any use in this life, and even if that weren't the case I can no longer tolerate being here. Everyday is monotonous, boring,  and I wake up sick to my stomach every morning. I can't even tolerate myself at this point. Depression has sapped my enjoyment of everything I once loved. Video games, films, reading, exercise. Now all that I do becomes a chore instead of something to accomplish. I feel more obligated instead of them being something I genuinely want to do. 

I want to find work so I can stop being such a financial burden on my family (even if they won't admit it I know I am), but the anxiety I feel is too much to bear. And I zone out or dissociate more now than I ever have before; how am I expected to work if I can't function like a "normal" human being? 

My friend proposed that I try writing and publishing at least one story before I go. But that's the thing,  I can't muster the energy to do it. There is nothing here left for me. I was thinking maybe I could stay if only to see how Game of Thrones ends or experience an upcoming video game called Death Stranding. But I'm near the end of my sanity. I just want off this planet! 

Sleep was my only respite and now I'm losing that. I don't even know why I'm posting here to be honest. I guess I'm just willing to put my thoughts anywhere. 

No, I can't open up to most of my family or friends, and I'm not seeking therapy anymore. All I receive is trite platitudes and empty hope. All anyone wants me to do is swallow pills and tell me life gets better, as if they have supernatural access to the future. Fucking sick of it! I wish i had the courage to hang myself,  or had access to a firearm.
