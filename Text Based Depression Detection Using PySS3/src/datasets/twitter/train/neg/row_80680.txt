Nostalgia-driven DepressionIs this a thing?  Yes, I understand the lack of understand of the disease we call depression.  And yes, I understand it doesn't always need a trigger.  However, as an 18 year-old who has let suicidal thoughts cross my mind (albeit without much real thought and seriousness), I have noticed that I never seem as 'happy' as my memories, but I think a lot of this is nostalgia.  Being 18 is obviously a point of growing up and getting my life together, but I think 18 has made me realize how much enjoyment my life has given.  Drugs have become a part of my life out of recreational purpose and as much as I think they're the culprit for my depression, I believe these drugs have just opened my brain to a different form of happiness.  I think back to my childhood and think of those memories as 'euphoric'.  I'm dumbfounded as a person.  I understand (hopefully) the causes of my sad thoughts and work endlessly to make necessary changes to feel better, but numbness and a feeling of being lost is omnipotent.  When I'm with friends, the feelings subside into a feeling of numbness with enjoyment also.  However, when alone, numbness is the goal but sadness overcomes a lot.
