I have made a terrible mistake I need to talk to someoneToday I made an incredibly stupid and irrational mistake. I for a long time have suffered with my mental health on and off for around two years. I have joined this reddit like website for a while which they provide advice on suicide methods and how to do it correctly. Well I got talking to some people on there and they suggested to me i use sodium Nitrite for a relatively painless way out. I looked on the threads on there about it and it didn't seem all that bad compared to other methods which are painful as hell and leave you disfigured. So what I stupidly did today is I actually bought some Sodium Nitrite 99.9% pure off of ebay. I soon cancelled my order realising how insane and stupid it was what I was doing. I also have heard that in the U.K people who have ordered the stuff have had visits from the police as part of a welfare check. Because I have cancelled my order before it shipped should I be worried about the police coming? I am from the U.K i know on the government website it lists as a poison. Anyways, i deleted my account off that site and i dont plan on ever going on it again. Just want someone to talk to. I had to get this off my chest as it's been worrying me.
