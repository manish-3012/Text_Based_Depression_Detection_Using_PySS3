I don't know what to doEvery day of my life for the past 2 yrs I woke up depressed and stayed that way all day or I just woke up without feeling anything. I've recently been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and I can't even imagine at what point it would be hard for me to live with people treating me like I'm inferior to them because of that. The only friend I had that stayed with me since we were kids died recently from a train accident and now the only thing I care about is my passion for chemistry but it's not enough for me to want to live. Idk if it will get better or not but either way suicide is the best option for me.
