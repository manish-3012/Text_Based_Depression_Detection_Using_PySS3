I really want to dieI just feel so depressed every day. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with depression so iâ€™m not, like, self diagnosed or anything, iâ€™m seriously depressed. I feel so lethargic all the time and like nothing matters. I can hardly ever find a reason to get out of bed in the morning anymore. I just want to die. I want it all to be over
