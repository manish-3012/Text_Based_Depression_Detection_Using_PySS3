Is this really a livable world? What have we done?We, as society, must be doing something really bad. I say this because just in this very subreddit it can be seen the huge amount of people wanting and willing for their deaths. I wouldn't call humane to this world.A world in which there are more people feeling sad, devastated, dying, starving than  living it up or being happy. A world in which there are more people who want to leave as soon as possible to stop the suffering and pain that presumably a life wouldn't be for.Seeing how amazing people kill themselves because of this horrible world we've created. Myself included.
A  world in which people value more than anything money and sex.A disgusting decaying world. Just hate is promoted.I hate you world.
