Just tried to kill myselfI am and mentally unhealthy with high functioning autism and depression and anxiety I am going nowhere and start ing junior high I just learned it is going to be all virtual for the first semester after that I could not take it anymore at night I took my SNES controller and wrapped it around my neck and tied it to my closet hanger and took a chair and kicked it over it didnâ€™t break my neck and for 5 seconds I could not breathe and then the chord snapped I did it again and it failed again I donâ€™t know if this world is worth living in any more this is the first time telling someone about it
