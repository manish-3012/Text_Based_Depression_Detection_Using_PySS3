Too expensive to liveIâ€™ve overdosed. I know it wonâ€™t kill me, but I can dream of dying while I slide into and out of consciousness for the next 12 hours.

Life is getting harder, and harder, and I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m meant to keep going.

My health insurance is going up by a minimum of $20/month in April (Iâ€™m in Australia, health insurance is a must for appropriate inpatient mental health care).

My rent will be going up by $5-10/week as of May. Moving somewhere cheaper means I wonâ€™t be able to access public transport, and will be even more socially isolated.

My physical health isnâ€™t improving. It looks like Iâ€™m collecting more chronic illnesses every year that Iâ€™m alive. None have a cure. Treatment is to manage symptoms. Thereâ€™s no guarantees.

Iâ€™ve already been rejected, and am appealing NDIS. Disability support would be fucking amazing. An electric wheelchair would mean I can leave the house independently, and try to build some kind of life. As it is Iâ€™m stuck at home. I have a small collapsible mobility scooter which allows me to get to the local shops, but no further.

Iâ€™m on disability, and that never increases with the cost of living. 

I had to quit work a year ago because I became too unwell to work, and my manager simply chose not to give me any shifts.

Iâ€™m just done. I donâ€™t think I was ever meant to be alive this long (31). Suicide is entirely logical. It solves so many problems that I canâ€™t otherwise solve.
