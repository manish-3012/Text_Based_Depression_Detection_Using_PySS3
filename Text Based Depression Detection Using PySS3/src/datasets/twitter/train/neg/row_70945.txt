Why canâ€™t I think about the future?Iâ€™m only now opening a bank account for myself, even though itâ€™s a positive step forward for me itâ€™s a huge trigger and itâ€™s making me extremely suicidal. I just canâ€™t think about the future. I donâ€™t want to think about the future. Iâ€™m afraid and whenever I try to think about my future I either see absolutely nothing or I see myself homeless, drowning my problems in alcohol and drugs and dying a slow painful death. Should I end it all now or wait till I inevitably hit rock bottom?
