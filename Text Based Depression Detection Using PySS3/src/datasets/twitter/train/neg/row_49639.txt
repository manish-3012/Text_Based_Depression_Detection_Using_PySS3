To the friends of people who talk of suicide: Speak up! (x-post from /r/offmychest)In the past few days, I've heard from two friends whose teen children have come to the point of suicide. One completed her choice, the other is in the hospital recovering.

These two people are loving parents. They are involved in the lives of their teens, but don't always get much communication. A lot of teens don't want to tell their parents how awful they're feeling and that they're considering suicide. The people who did know what these girls were planning hadn't said anything to anyone.

If a friend is talking about suicide, PLEASE tell someone. It's an absolute myth that people who mention suicide don't want to actually do it. Quite a lot who talk of suicide make an attempt.

You may be the only person they have told. You may save a life. It is vital that you tell someone, a teacher, their parents, an older sibling ... someone who will take it seriously and get help for your friend.

I can't tell you how hard it is for these parents to know their kids were in absolute hell and they didn't know. They wanted to know. They wanted to do something before it got to this point.

TL;DR: **TELL SOMEONE** if you have a friend who talks of committing suicide. It may save a life.
