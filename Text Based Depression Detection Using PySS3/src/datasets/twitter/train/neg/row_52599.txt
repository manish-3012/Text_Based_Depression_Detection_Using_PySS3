I woke up and thought today is my last dayI've reached out to different organizations for help with the nagging thought of ending my life. Each one refers me back to the VA, which I will NOT turn to, due to the fact veterans have killed themselves in the parking lots of VA's when they reached out for help.  I've turned to friends for help, only to have them stare at their phone while I try to explain myself. My family thinks taking my weapons away is the fix to the problem. 
At this point I'm waiting to get off work, find homes for my pets, and then I'm going to end my life. I honestly don't know why today is my day, but my gut just is telling me to say my goodbyes.
