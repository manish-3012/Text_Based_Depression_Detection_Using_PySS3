34(m) last days on earthBored of being born, of being poor.

Tired of complaining.

My daughter wonâ€™t remember me and that hurts but not like everything else. I love her mother but canâ€™t get over what she did. 

I have friends and family but I just donâ€™t know what to say to anyone. 

I just want to be comfortable and warm. I just want this over.
