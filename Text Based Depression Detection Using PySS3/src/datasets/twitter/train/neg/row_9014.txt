Im just sick of my life, i wish it would go awayI just got fired from my shitty amazon job, and im now back at sqaure one. I have no skills or schooling and i cant stop making the same bad decisions over and over again. I think its worthless to keep trying. I just go on autopilot until i fuck up, then i theow a tantrum and repeat. I wish i could just hang myself already but its too scary. Im sad.
