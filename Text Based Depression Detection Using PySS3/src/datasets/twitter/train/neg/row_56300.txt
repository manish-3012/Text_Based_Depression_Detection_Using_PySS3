I don't want to but I need toThe idea has been in my mind. I still feel that I may lack the courage to do it, but I don't really know anymore.

The reason may be stupid. A relationship that ended 2 years ago. And my lack of self esteem and social skills. A few months ago, I may felt it was an stupid idea, but it has been a recurring theme in my mind. I don't what to do anymore.

Please, help.
