Failed at absolutely everything I have ever set out to do. Have a noose tied right in front of me and trying to find a reason not to hang myself.Hello, /r/suicidewatch. I never thought I would ever be pushed so far as to post here, but tonight, I feel as if I have no choice. My particular reason is a relatively unusual one, no abuse, no deaths in the family, no bullying. 

I am 18 years old and I want to kill myself because I have failed at every single goal I have ever set for myself. I have always wanted to be a film director, and after a load of shitty youtube videos, I thought that my newest short film would be the one that would get me even an iota of critical acclaim. Then, I released it and was met with nothing but backlash. This same failure is evident in my love life, or lack thereof.

I know you're thinking "you're only 18, you've got a whole life ahead of you to meet those goals". But, honestly, I have a feeling that my failures now will only be amplified when I am older and have actual problems and not the minuscule ones I have now. Might as well just end it here.
