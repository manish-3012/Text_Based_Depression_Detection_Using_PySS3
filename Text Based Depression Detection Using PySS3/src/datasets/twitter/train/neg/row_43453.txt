I keep putting off writing my suicide noteFor background, I'm a 17 year old transgender female. I've attempted twice before, but failed both times (obviously.) I've been cutting since I was maybe 12 or 13. I checked into a mental hospital, inpatient, about a month ago, hoping I might finally get some help, but I'm worse now than I've ever been. My home life is awful and my parents keep getting stricter, I feel like a burden on all my friends, (who I would consider my actual family,) and I can't keep putting them through this. I find myself unable to find things to talk about aside from killing myself. I've been ready to go since I got out of the hospital, but I'm terrified of attempting again and having it not work, bc I'd be likely very injured and that would make things worse, and my parents would become even stricter and everything would just get so much worse. I've decided that I'm going to wait until I turn 18 so I can legally buy a gun, get really fucking wasted, and do it. I wrote a suicide note the last time I attempted, but I read it again and it didn't say half the things I really wanted to say, so ik that once I've written a suicide note, I'll have nothing left in my way except a little bit of time, but I just keep stalling myself. It's actually kind of nice being able to have time to really think hard about what I want to put in my note instead of just spitting some half assed goodbye out on paper.
