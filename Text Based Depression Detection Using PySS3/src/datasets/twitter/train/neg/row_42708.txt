Not sure if this is allowed here, but Iâ€™d like to get a semicolon tattoo, I just donâ€™t know where to get it.I have a *very* anti-tattoo family. My younger brother got a tattoo and my mother didnâ€™t speak to him for months. While she is far from my primary concern, Iâ€™d still prefer to avoid that confrontation. I also work in a professional job, but I also do have days where I wear a polo to work and it might be awkward if I have a visible tattoo, especially one of this nature. 

On the other hand, I know most semicolon tattoos are on the wrist. That would be fitting for me too. I donâ€™t have visible self-harm scars but I do have a history of it. I also think seeing it on my left wrist every day would be awesome for me. Iâ€™m just torn. I donâ€™t know where I could possibly get it that I could reasonably hide it but also see it regularly enough that it would be meaningful. Iâ€™m a large male (6â€™4, 240 lbs) so I canâ€™t really pull off any kind of dainty ankle tattoo or anything. Just wondering if anyone else has been in this situation. 

Again, I know there are a lot more dire posts on this sub. Iâ€™m in a decent place right now compared to where Iâ€™ve been and not in need of urgent help. If this needs to be removed then feel free.
