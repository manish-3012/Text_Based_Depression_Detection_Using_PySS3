need to put this out thereive never used reddit before ive just lurked, which is perfect because nobody i know will see this. i just feel the need to tell someone.

i am a 17 year old girl and i am planning on committing suicide on my 18th birthday, a little under 4 months from now unless my life somehow miraculously changes. ive been depressed since i was 10 and ive been suicidal since 13 and i genuinely cant deal with this anymore. im scared it will be like this forever. everything is awful and the more i let my pathetic existence drag on the sadder it will become. i dont want to live life as an adult when i know it will be the same. i dont have any friends, ive never had any sort of sexual experience (never even been on a date) and im very traumatized from bad experiences in my childhood. i see a therapist and i take antidepressants but nothing helps. ive been seeing multiple therapists for several years now and none of them make me feel better. they all just say the same things over and over. 

im scared of killing myself but i figure since im going to die one day its probably smartest to do it now and spare myself the suffering.
