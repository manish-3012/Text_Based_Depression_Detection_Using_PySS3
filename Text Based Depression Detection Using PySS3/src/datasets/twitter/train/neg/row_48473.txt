I just want the pain to end.Nothing in life goes my way. Brain is worthless. Relationships are strained. I don't want to die but there's no other way for the pain to end. Not a single thing has gone right for me in 2 years. Feels like the universe is against me. Conspiring to cause me pain in every way. And being the worthless piece of shit that I am, I can't do anything about it. 

I feel betrayed. Unloved. Guilty. Accused of being fake. 

Fine, universe. You fucking win. Dick.
