I don't want to die. I want a miracle that can't happen.I've thought things through a million times, talked to my loved ones, taken medication, posted here, etc., and I just can't come up with a single realistic pathway to a decent life. I made too much of a mess of too many things, and the result is catastrophic failure. The only thing that would help would require an actual miracle, and I don't believe in miracles, except in that moment when I'm about to commit, and part of me desperately hopes for one. That is how I feel right now.
