Never having an understanding connection, even a nonromantic one.I have a facial deformity and there are no other women out there that have NEVER had a guy be attracted or nice to them. Seriously, I'm the only one that hasn't hung myself yet even though I'm almost past the age women can still find a good, loving husband. Here in Eastern Europe, you're considered worthless even sooner than in the west.

Not only am I denied romantic love, I can never have a friend that understands. People suck. Bye and F U.
