Getting really closeHi, I am a 22 year old international student in the UK studying mechanical engineering and have been depressed since I was 17/18. I come from a really good family, financially and loving, but it's just getting too much. I failed and redid my first year and didn't tell my family, only recently came clean (am in the end of 2nd year now) to them and I didnt even tell them the whole story. This semester I've missed 90% of lectures and spent most of my time inside the house. Yesterday I finally left the house to go to a group meeting and was feeling much better but then this morning another group project I have, I sent a message to the group saying that I apologized for everything I did for them and that I would try to make it up to them and I was going into the workshop this morning. Their response was to tell me not to bother coming in, I said ok and again apologized. After that I just cried and turned every means of contact off and next thing I knew I had a knife in my hand and I panicked. dropped the knife and locked myself in my room. This was the closest I've ever been to actually doing something harmful and am afraid that I my housemates are gone this weekend and Ill do something really stupid. Ive contacted university services but they all are closed over the weekend and I dont know what to do.
