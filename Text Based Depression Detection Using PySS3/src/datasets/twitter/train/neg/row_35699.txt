I'm not a good personI'm not a good person. I lie all the time to the ones I love the most, because I don't want others getting hurt. I'm so scared about losing people that I do this. But in reality it just makes things worse. 
I want to be better, but I can't. Honestly life and everyone in it would just be better off without me in it. My family basically outcasted me. My boyfriend is the best person I've ever met but I still fuck things up. I can't keep going on being like this, but I can't change either. I just want to die, so everyone can forget about me. I'd rather rot in a hole than be alive right now. It's probably where I belong anyway. 
In the end, no matter the situation, I'll end up fucking everything over. I don't deserve happiness, love or anything good. I'm horrible, I deserve death. I deserve for people to forget about me.
