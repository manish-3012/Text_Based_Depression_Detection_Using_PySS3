Just need someone to talk to.I honestly don't know how to go on anymore. I've been so depressed this past month due to a sudden break up with my girlfriend who I care so much about as well as several other instances leaving me feel inadequate. The ex-SO in question was a really good friend for years and around six months ago we started dating because we both clicked so well. The tl;dr of it is basically she is a grade older and wants to be single for her freshman year of college which to me seems really shallow. Some of my problems may not seems as large as other people's problems, but they are what they are and I dread waking up the next day to more disappointment. The only thing keeping me from ending everything is the fact that I have no access to any quick ways to end my life. I could really use someone to talk to to vent/a friend to get through this chapter of life. I hate feeling this way because my life is only just beginning but I don't think I have the willpower to go on much longer.
