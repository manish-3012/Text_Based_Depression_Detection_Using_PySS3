My friend is suicidal, what do I doThey have been making jokes about suicide for a long time now, but I didnâ€™t think they were serious until I looked at what subreddits they are in, and noticed this one. I also found a post about â€œwhatâ€™s the fastest way to kill yourself,â€ a comment saying â€œI might be dead in a year,â€ (from half a year ago,) and a whole paragraph about their thoughts about depression, suicide and the quarantine. Now that I know theyâ€™re serious, I canâ€™t just sit around and do nothing. Any advice?
