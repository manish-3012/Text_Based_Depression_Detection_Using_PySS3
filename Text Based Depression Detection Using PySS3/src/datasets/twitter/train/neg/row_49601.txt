Killing myself tonightI dropped out of school because of social anxiety. I've never had a job nor could I handle the anxiety of getting one. I've never had a SO. I can't function nor can I receive treatment. I had a panic attack a few hours ago and it will be my last one, ever. I'm too weak for this, maybe in some other time, some other upbringing some other universe I would be happy to live. Maybe in the next life, if such a thing exists. I can't live like this, tonight is my last.

Goodbye
