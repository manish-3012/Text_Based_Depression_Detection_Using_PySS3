Finding it difficult to keep goingMother has disowned me. Father disappeared over a decade ago not long after divorce. Sister disowned family. Always working low end jobs. Never able to keep romantic relationships going. Friends are slowly becoming to busy for me and my problems. Current GF is out of town for a week and we are on a "break" so she's not been responding much to my cries for help.  I have no expectations for happiness as all attempts to create it for myself ultimately fail and leave me feeling worse. Nothing really matters in the end because we all die and our memory dies with time.   


I attempted suicide years ago and ended up being declared clinically dead before being revived by ER. Haven't tried since but the thoughts have been creeping in more and more over the past few months.
