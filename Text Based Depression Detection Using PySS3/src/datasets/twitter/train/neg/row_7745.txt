I'm a spiteful, vengeful, impulsive, self-destructive alter with little empathy for my host.My host Y has a lot of caring, loving friends who reassure her with constant platitudes of "it will get better!" or "you have so much potential!" and her close friend C even gives her such remarks as "life is a beautiful struggle" and "I will be miserable if you leave this earth". 

But I don't have any friends; no one cares about me, which is just as fitting I suppose, because I don't care about anyone. Just a few hours ago, with the onset of a mixed episode, Y even challenged, "come at me, sadness!" with a sort of gung-ho bravado that I can only deem ridiculous because we both know how horrible mixed episodes are. 

We share a lot of trauma, including extensive child abuse and sexual assault as a college student and then as a sex worker, but where Y remains idealistic and empathetic, I can barely muster any empathy for anyone, perhaps just the bits of Asian social etiquette indoctrinated into us. Y has dreams and aspirations, her mind flowering with research ideas about genetic psychopharmacology and biochemistry -- whereas my mind is just dead, unable to appreciate or recall much of anything. I have no happy memories, just extremely horrible ones.

In the past, fear of pain and the fear that I might be imprisoned into a void of nothingness have pushed me into such compromises as jumping further away from the subway train (to make it more of a game of Russian Roulette -- I have done this about seven times) or sticking my legs out a 6-storey window. We've been hospitalized 21 times in the last 3 years. But I tire of these games, I tire of suffering; no one thinks that I will actually have the courage to do it. I am not afraid of nothingness, anymore -- I would much rather risk that than continue to experience the agony of existence. I can only keep my self-hatred in check for so long. I have just as much rights as Y, and I do not consent to existence.
