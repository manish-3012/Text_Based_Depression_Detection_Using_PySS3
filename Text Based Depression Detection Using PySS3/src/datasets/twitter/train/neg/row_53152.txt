Thereâ€™s nobody who I can go to right now. Iâ€™m seriously going to kill myself.I donâ€™t have anybody who cares about me who I can go to right now. I donâ€™t want to have to kill myself but unfortunately I have to. I wish I had somebody in my life who I could turn to right now but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve tried a suicide hotline a number of times and they only ended up making me feel worse. Thereâ€™s nobody in my life who truly cares for me or my well being. Itâ€™s my own fault probably. Thereâ€™s nowhere I can go.
