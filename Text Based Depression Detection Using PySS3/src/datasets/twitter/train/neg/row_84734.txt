Why give people benzos if they can't be given long term?Why the fuck was I allowed to feel normal enough to function and then have it taken away. None of the other shit fucking does anything beyond making all of the symptoms they're supposed to treat worse, on top of the side effects. I can't fucking drink properly anymore because my hangovers are infinitely fucking worse, and for what?

Finally a light at the end of the tunnel only to watch it cave in right in front of me. Because it's in my best interest to not take a pill that actually works because it might have harmful side effects and because it can be difficult to stop taking, which sounds almost exactly like the *safe* ones I'm taking now and running out of, except they only make things worse. I think it's purely the idea that I'm aware of the fact that benzos can be enjoyable that I cannot be allowed to have them. 

I don't think it would be too hard to get if I had any friends left or just went looking on the dark net, but it's just like, why fucking bother at this point?
