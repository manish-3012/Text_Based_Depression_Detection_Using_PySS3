I have suffered from depression, anxiety, ocd, and quiet bpd for years. I canâ€™t keep living like this, the quality of life is hell.I feel like every day is a horrific struggle and Iâ€™m exhausted. My quiet bpd makes it difficult to cope with extreme emotions and itâ€™s incredibly draining. I want a break and I know Iâ€™ll never find love again in this cruel world. What do I do? Iâ€™m already in intensive therapy and on heavy antipsychotics. I exercise and I eat healthy. Theres nothing else I can do to make my life better.
