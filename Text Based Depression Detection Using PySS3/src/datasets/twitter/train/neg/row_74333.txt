I've never tried to make more of myself, only lessI keep my stuff to a minimum. I try to have as little effect on the world as possible. I push away friends and deliberately alienate new people I meet. I live my life like a ghost. I once spent nearly a month using only the words 'hello' 'goodbye' 'yes' 'no' 'sure' and 'thanks' and nobody noticed anything weird about that. 

For a while I physically tried to make less of myself. I was bulimic for six years and no one knew until I'd been in recovery for two. 

I do everything I can to reduce the impact of my existence in an effort to reduce the impact of my inevitable non-existence. I might as well already be dead. Nothing would change. 

I only have two reasons I haven't yet. One, no one would look after my pet. Two, I don't want to traumatize whoever will find my body. I've been playing with the idea of a time delayed text message so that EMS can whisk it away without anyone having to see. 

I'm so tired. I'm just so ready to be done. My life has only ever been prep for suicide and it'll never be anything else.
