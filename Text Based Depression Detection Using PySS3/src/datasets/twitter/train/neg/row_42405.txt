This week I'm doing it. Sunday. That's the day. It's then or never.People will fuck wit me if I have something they want. Once they get it, I get treated like I dont even exist. Im not perfect I'm the complete opposite but I didnt think it would end this way. I didnt think I would be the most despised person out here but I am. It dont matter what I say or do whether its right or wrong- just be the same results. I lost my parents, my grandmother that took care of me since I was a baby they didnt want me around. Everyone that comes around automatically dont like me or they dont like me but they see a come up. I'm tired man. I'm tired of losing people I care about, nobody loves me. I'm always alone.  This must be how it feels to be cursed. I don't want to live no more and I'm just being honest I dont plan on making it to next week. No one will see this and I just had to let this out before I go.
