I've chosen not to live without herI haven't talked about this to anyone I know, I will end up in a psych ward if I do and having been there a few times I know how things work. I'm not going down that road. I also don't want to be accused of manipulating people.

Things are on their last legs with my g/f (of 10 years), I invested everything I had into this and the thought of losing her was really freaking me out. So I decided I wouldn't, if she leaves me I will end my life. But I will not tell her or anyone else, that would be be a pretty shitty thing to do. Anyway, since I've made that decision I feel a lot better, like I have some control over my life. I will also will give everything I own to her (she really has nothing material wise) and she will need all the help she can get to succeed in university. I've always started actually giving her things (computers/money/etc), I have a decent cover story. Anyway, if I can't be of help to her alive I will help her with my death.
