Just bought the means to my endThings have been going downhill since before my father died a year and a half ago but his death was the straw that broke this camel's back.

I'm still in court fighting for an inheritance his other son is trying to steal.

After he died I gave up on my dream job - great pay but 3000km away from my son. Couldn't do it any longer.

Moved back east and of course had to go to court with the ex-wife. We settle, barely, and within 2 months I get diagnosed with stage 3 cancer.

I took one of the first few jobs I was offered which turned out to be a huge mistake. It's a project that's a year behind schedule and is full of deceptive, lazy, uninterested workers.

It's all too much. I don't know when I will blow my brains out but expect it to be soon. Bought the gun today. I guess it's true that sometimes antidepressants give you the energy to kill yourself before the mood improvements kick in. Either way I feel like one small area of my life, my death, is finally back under my control.
