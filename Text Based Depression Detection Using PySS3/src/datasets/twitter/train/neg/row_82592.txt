Told a receptionist today that I talking to her made me want to kill myself.Called the clinic to schedule an appointment and get some records so that I could show my professors that my complete failure to be a worthwhile human being is in part a product of ongoing health problems

Lady was pretty rude to me while she explained I'd have to sign a release form and offered me very little recourse when I tried to explain that I don't have a computer to download the forms with and I don't have q way to print them and scan them in order to get a physical signature

It was mostly a tone thing, and I think she was just really stressed out but I snapped

When she asked me what appointment I wanted to make I got real quiet and then told her that it was a mental health care appointment (the truth, mind you) but after talking to her, I'd rather just kill myself

Her tone changed to be a lot more sympathetic and she asked again for me to tell her what appointment I wanted to make but I hung up on her before she could finish. There's a part of me that hopes she's struggling right now with fear that I may have done it, and that pretty much definitely makes me a shitty person. It's not about hurting her, I just wish someone cared.

I need to make my appointment but I don't want to call back tomorrow.

I might just follow through with it. I add nothing of value to the world and if more than like three people in the world missed me I'd be fucking shocked.

I turn 30 next month and no amount of therapy or pills have worked and I'm just tired.

p.s. if you try to convince me that YOU care I'm just gonna close this thread and go plan my suicide in peace. You don't know me and you're never going to talk to me after today even if I do live so please don't try to make it out like my suicide would impact you as a person in any meaningful way. It's just... Disingenuous.
