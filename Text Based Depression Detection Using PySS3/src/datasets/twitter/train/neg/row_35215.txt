needed to tell somebody ... here seemed like a good placeI turn 33 in 2 months, I still live with my folks (more on that later) my last girlfriend when I was 18 left me on new years eve.

I have no drive, no forward ambition â€“ I just seem to live in a holding pattern waiting for something to happen (even though I rightly recognise it never will) 

I have a job â€“ 16 hours a week at min wage

my mother is a problem, she has bpd and is a narcassist perhaps also body dismorphia we think(she has her own issues with depression) â€“ at this point I should mention im at at least a little bisexual as it figures into the problems I have with her â€¦ you see my sister is gay and out â€“ my mother has big issues with this (it has caused some huge fights between them) so I can hardly come out â€“ living a lie is preferable to what would result.

Im depressed a lot of the time, I have issues from the past that arnt worth getting into suffice to say they still effect me a lot in the present time, i think about suicide a good amount but mostly i know im too much of a pussy to actually do it.
