I'd like to share a little bit about where I am nowI don't know how socially inept I am but I assume very. There was a period of my life when I really had no friends. I care so much about having friends I act desperate in every situation ever to earn the influence of people and take it very hard when I can't.

I don't like living in a reality where my mind controls me and everything I do, say, and feel, is a result of my mind being chaotic

I always come back to this feeling like I have no choice but to die and it's so paralyzing I just have to wait for it to be over
