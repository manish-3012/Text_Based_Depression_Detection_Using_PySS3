DAE spend most of their time listening to music, daydreaming?I keep daydreaming about a better life, where Iâ€™m finally married and safe and loved and understood and accomplished. 

I donâ€™t have any friends in real life. Iâ€™ve never been in love, Iâ€™m highly sensitive/easily triggered, and I struggle to relate to anyone.

However, in my daydreams, Iâ€™m happy and significantly less stressed since Iâ€™ve finally around people who make me feel normal and are gentle towards me.

These types of daydreams also help stave off the suicidal ideation; they get me through the day.
