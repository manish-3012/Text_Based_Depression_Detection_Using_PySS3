Can someone please listen. Iâ€™m hurting right now.Iâ€™m just insanely frustrated bc I finally got with a good counselor who shares my worldview and helped me work through a lot of the turmoil that has occurred bc of my upbringing in a hyper conservative authoritarian household. I go to college in a conservative area and Iâ€™m afraid bc I canâ€™t find anyone that wouldnâ€™t just reinforce the negative relationship I have with my place on the social hierarchy ladder, and would just try to push religious social values on me. They all have â€œChristianâ€ in their bio and It makes me feel very hopeless as an atheist that I wonâ€™t be accepted. 

This is causing me great distress and idk what to do. Iâ€™m feeling a great combination of anger and resentment at the moment and I want to die super badly. Please just listen and try to help. Someone. Please. It hurts so much.
