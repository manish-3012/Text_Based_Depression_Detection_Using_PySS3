I want outI am conflicted and torn, i want to die but I also don't want to die and both are for the same reason. Family. My parents won't leave me alone they constantly make me feel guilty for my past. My husband doesn't seem to know how to talk to me and goes through phases where he doesn't find me attractive.

Lets rewind a bit, earlier this year I was diagnosed with PTSD from years of child abuse, emotional and mental abuse as well as sexual assault and rape. My PTSD was so bad it was starting to impact my marriage. I went to see someone and was put on zoloft. I started seeing a therapist and things seemed to get better. Then 2 months ago we moved to a different state and I haven't been able to find a new doctor yet. His work schedule sucks, he leaves at 4 am and gets home at 3 pm, then bed at 7pm. On the weekends he locks himself away and plays xbox all day. He told me that if I want to spend some time with him to come up and let him know, but I know he is an introvert and needs alone time to 'recharge' while I'm the polar opposite, so I don't feel comfortable asking him to come downstairs to spend time together. 

Fast forward to today - saturday, like any other weekend he locked himself away. 8 hours later I ask him if he wants to go get stuff for the cats. He said yes, an hour later he said he didn't want to go. This lead to an argument. 2 hours later we finally go. When we got home he wouldn't talk to me. He has gone to bed with out acknowledging my existence and I am ready to be done. If it weren't for the fact that I love him more then I probably should, and I love my grandparents and family I would probably do something incredibly stupid. :( I feel hopeless, helpless and alone and I want it to stop!
