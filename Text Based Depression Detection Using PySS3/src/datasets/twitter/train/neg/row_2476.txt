Only 24 years old male &amp; I donâ€™t wanna live anymore! My mind hurts to much!I struggle every day.... everyday I seem like I lived my life 100 times over if there was an easy way to go I would take it! Iâ€™m so tired in my mind I canâ€™t take it any more I feel like cutting my wrist open and bleeding out but that would hurt to much. Iâ€™m only 24 years old never had a girlfriend I feel like I will always be alone . I really wish I could just put a gun to my head that exactly want I want to do is put a gun to my head! Pull the trigger and be gone then the pain will go away! I would give anyone what they want if they could get me a gun I just donâ€™t have a gun or I would have done it already ! My friend left me he was helping me for a long time we met through work and I told him what I deal with &amp; he helped me for a long time someone to call and just have in my mind as a soldier and warrior against this illness! His women thought we were getting to close or there was something going on &amp; one day he called me up out of the blue and told me we canâ€™t be friends anymore because of his women we no longer talk Iâ€™m at the same company as him but donâ€™t see him! I think about suicide everyday in some manner sometimes 10 times in one day sometimes more! I feel like ounce he left I donâ€™t have a purpose here! I feel like I donâ€™t matter to anyone especially him he left my life bc his women thought we were getting to close I guess he could have just told her hey this is what this kid deals with we are still going to be friends! But no it didnâ€™t go that way! I always planned on my mind if I get my gun Iâ€™ll email him this link to this ted talk about suicide so he knows exactly what I deal with and after that just wait a little and wait and wait and put the gun to my head and pull the trigger! That will be my last message to anyone is that email! I wonâ€™t be heard from again which is fine bc I guess I never mattered to anyone bc he left when I needed someone but thatâ€™s ok bc when everything said and done .... hopefully I will be missed!
