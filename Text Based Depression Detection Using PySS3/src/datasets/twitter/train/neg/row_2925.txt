UpdateSo recently I uploaded [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cmnfy/broke_out_crying_in_school_today/) post and I wanted to do a little update since some stuff happened that felt pretty big. 

Lets just say shit hit the fan because my moms boyfriend complained to my parents and sister in a group text chat about me not liking him. (He does stuff like this occasionally) He said I'm bullying him. I was home alone and my parents were angry at me, texting about how bad I am. They had no clue what it was like having your parents split up then having a guy move in who constantly is using self pity to get everyone to turn on you. 

I was so fucking angry that no one out there got how I was feeling and I was about to snap and finally kill myself. My sister came home to hang out while I was having this breakdown and I realized though she doesn't live with us she has been out in the world a lot and knew kids just don't like parents boyfriends who move in. We talked through my bedroom door and she got me to come out of my room and I told her I'm depressed.

Holy shit. It felt so good to finally tell someone. We talked about everything that happened and about our mom. My sister said it gets better once you move out. I think I might actually remember that moment for the rest of my life. 

I still feel like I'm depressed, but I think I'm getting better now that I've gotten this all off of my chest.
