Please help meI'm 21 years old and my family has a history of bad mental health. I have been struggling with severe depression and anxiety for almost 4 years. I have lost track of how many counsellors I've seen and the psychiatrist I was seeing did nothing but shove medications at me. I went through 7 med changes in 3 months which resulted in me losing my hair, losing 30 pounds, and cutting my wrists. Since I went off the medications I am still losing my hair and I have gained back all the weight and then some. I don't want to die but I don't want to live like this anymore. 

I haven't been happy in years. Everyone keeps telling me it gets better but I just don't care anymore. I just don't care about living. Nothing brings me happiness. I am just existing and going through the motions and I don't see the point anymore. 

The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I have a family that loves me and I don't want to hurt them more than I already have. I've always heard that suicide is the most selfish thing you can ever do, but lately I can't help but think that it's selfish of them to keep asking me to live like this. I have asked for help. I have tried medications. It's been 4 years of hell and nothing has helped. I used to have panic attacks every day that would sometimes last hours. Now I don't feel anything besides sadness and sometimes anger. 

I don't even know what I'm doing right now. I say I want help but really I don't know. I guess I just wanted to write it all out. Maybe to justify to myself that it's ok to say goodbye. That nobody should have to live like this. I don't know anymore.
