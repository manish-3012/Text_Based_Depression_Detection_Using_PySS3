Contemplating shooting myself.Iâ€™m so incredibly sad.  Sooo deeply sad, and angry.  I hate myself, but love my family so much.  It would destroy them.  Iâ€™m engaged to an awesome girl and sheâ€™s pregnant.  But I am not ready for any of this.  I am so sad.  I canâ€™t even cry, I donâ€™t know how to feel anything.  Not looking for any support.  I donâ€™t know what makes me happy.  I seem to fake all sense of the word.  I donâ€™t know what to do.  Scared to eat my shotgun.  Iâ€™ll probably take this down.
