All I can think about is giving up.In the past couple weeks my resolve has been really worn out.  So many compounding things between a bad job, a break up, and physical illness, that I'm having a really hard time staying motivated and keeping an attitude that continuing with life is worth it.  I've started just opening a voice recorder more and more to have someone(something) to talk to and tonight I just broke down saying I want to give up.  I've built my life to be so stressful and I'm never satisfied or fulfilled.  Now it's 4am and i can't fall back asleep with all the defeatist thoughts going in circles.  I could really use someone to talk to, especially just someone to tell me about themselves to take my mind off things and make me feel less isolated.
