I have nothing left to live for.As the title says, I have absolutely nothing left to live for. I'll let you know now that I f***ed up my own life. I have terrible social anxiety, and usually bad at making friends. It wasn't helped when I moved in December 2008, the few friends I had were lost to me now. I had no friends here, and still don't. Because of how I established relations with people. Everyone was always talking about their relationships and such, so I concluded, "sure, tell them you have a girlfriend. They will respect you a bit more." Here is the thing, I didn't. And that isn't even the biggest problem, I made one up. Using this made up girlfriend as a respect beacon worked out far better than I thought, and I soon found myself clinging to the idea, and soon forgetting that it was fake. I didn't know at the time, but I became subconsciously delusional. I started having vivid dreams where this girl was a reality. As I started to make friends here, I started having interactions with girls, but to no avail as I "had" a girlfriend. Then this September I really thought I had found a girl that I really liked. So, as I slowly began to fight back at my 3-year delusion, the whole thing came crashing down on my head. Once again; 0 friends. Why? Because I made up a human being, and lied to people about her. Why would I do that: no friends. Now, this girl that I thought I liked, who I thought I could make see my standpoint. Understand that I loved where I lived so much that I hurts me to not be there. I was wrong. Now, she is distant because I lied to her as well. I didn't mean for this to get out of hand, and now the one person who I thought extended her hand to remove me from the cesspool that is my life, tosses me back to the wolves. I'm on the edge right now, and I think I might have a day before I can convince myself that life isn't worth living. I almost wish to cause my friends anguish, but I cannot bear to do so to my family. Please help.
