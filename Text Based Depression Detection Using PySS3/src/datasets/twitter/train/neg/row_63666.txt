Can someone just say somethingIt doesnâ€˜t matter what, Iâ€˜m in my room and I have enough pills and other stuff to end my life for good.


I was really tempted to do it but Iâ€˜m scared. But I also donâ€˜t want to live anymore. I want to die painlessly


Iâ€˜m crying because no one around me cares and whenever I try to open up, they canâ€˜t help me or emotionally abuse me.


Iâ€˜m sick, I want to die. But Iâ€˜m scared to do it. I donâ€˜t want to traumatize anyone but then again who gives a fuck about me anyway.


Iâ€˜m sorry for annoying you all, I just donâ€˜t have anyone to talk to
