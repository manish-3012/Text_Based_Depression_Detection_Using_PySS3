The endSorry to post this here but it has to be somewhere. Everyone warned me when I first came out as transgender that it would all fall apart eventually and they were right. They supported me at first but a year later they hate me and regret that I was born. I didn't choose to be fucking born but I can choose to fucking die. So I am, maybe life will be easier for them when their shameful tranny mistake is gone.

I hope one of my brothers doesn't find me.
