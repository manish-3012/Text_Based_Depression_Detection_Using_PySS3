A friend of mine is more than likely going to commit suicide tonight.Title pretty much. It's not me, but my friend. I am extremely worried that she's going to go through with it. She said she has done her research to ensure she gets what she wants. Her situation, in my opinion, is very very hard right now, but entirely fixable with time and effort. She is not planning on leaving a note, and I know this will absolutely devastate her parents and friends, and the community as well. 

I've been trying to talk her out of it since last night when she first told me. She was going to do it last night but I got her to postpone it till tonight. There is no reasoning with her. 

Please, what can I do to help this girl? Should I call the police? Tell her parents? 

Edit: So if anybody is keeping up with this at all, I've got some updates. I ended up going out and buying a tub of Ben and Jerry's and driving over to her house, even though she told me not to come over there. Well she wasn't happy to see me and has been very upset with/pissed at me. She kept trying to get me to leave, and I did after she mentioned that her ex boyfriend would probably drop by since one of his friends saw me there, and if I was there when he got there, he would hit her first and then fight me. So I didn't have much of a choice but to leave. After I left, she disclosed that she had taken something but wouldn't tell me what. I begged her to throw it up and counteract it like she said she could, and she told me that she did those things. I think she hates me now for "ruining her plan" though. I have a feeling she will try again and next time just won't tell anyone. I'm quite worried.
