Idk anymoreI can't stop messing up. I can't stop crying. I honestly just want to give up. I'm -$150 because of bills. And I'm trying so hard to find a new job. I can't stop hurting myself. Even when I try my hardest not to. I can't look at my legs anymore. They look awful because of all the cuts and burns. 

Anyway, anything silly or weird happen to any of y'all? Do tell.
