I attempted suicide this morningThis morning I put a bag over my head tied it and then quickly tied my hands ups before i started freaking out, I was able to break out of the zip ties because they werent tie enough. The craziest thing about my situation is that I dont really want to do I just have a 24/7 unbearable headache that makes me pace around and scream. The headache is best described as not being able to feel my head and having an unbearble weight on my brain. It was caused by LSD 12 months ago I was actually coping with it until I checked myself into a psych ward and was taken off my medsnfor 5 days under the doctors motto "if it doesmt work why are you taking it".
