I want to leap into traffic.My latent reservoir of white-hot self-hatred is finally boiling over...and rightly so. I'm stubbornly mired in my own petty insecurities...and the people who loved me most have suffered accordingly. No one deserves a spineless, ugly, toxic piece of shit like me. I constantly fantasize about ripping myself to shreds. I hate myself. I hate myself. I hate myself.
