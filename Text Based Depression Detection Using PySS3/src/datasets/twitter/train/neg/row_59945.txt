I would pay someone to kill me. I'm tired of fighting for myself when no one else will. It's almost like having a chronic health condition makes you push everyone away when you need them the most.
  
I'm exhausted and overwhelmed and beyond stressed out and sick every day and in pain every day.  
  
 How could anyone do this on their own? It's like the answer is to cut ties with everyone and die.   
  
I just want to fucking die. Who would even care? Obviously nobody considering nobody is concerned about the amount of pain I'm in day to day. Not doctors, not friends, not "family".   
  
Fuck, what does it take to get a cyanide pill around here?
