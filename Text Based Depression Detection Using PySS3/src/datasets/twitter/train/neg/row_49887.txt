Iâ€™m ready to dieAfter going to best gore looking at 14 pages of gore in a row, and going to other shock website that was filled with horrible things that is happening around this world and videos that was not shown in the news, I finally became numb to violence so that I would have the courage to kill myself, who would have thought that watching so much gore was a mistake, at first I was watching it to scare myself from not killing myself, seeing how bloody and awful it is to die, but then I became dumb to it and was ready to die, how iconic, at least I also got to watch Kobe Bryant die, but this is goodbye, sorry I couldnâ€™t last, sorry I was too weak to continue, but I already knew how meaningless this world is, now I also know how horrible it is... Iâ€™m going to hang myself
