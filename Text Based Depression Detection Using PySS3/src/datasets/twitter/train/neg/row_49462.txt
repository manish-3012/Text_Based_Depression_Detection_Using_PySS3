The idea of suicide feels more welcoming every dayI've never had a meaningful connection with another person.  I've tried so hard to get out there.  But I always come across as creepy or something.  I've tried a lot of things, from adjusting my appearance to changing how I act.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong and I don't think I ever will.  

I was born a loser but tried very hard to make something of myself.  In some sense I succeeded, but it is a hollow victory without anyone to share it with.  I come home to an empty house every day, and I know I always will. 

The idea of this struggle simply being over feels like a relief.  No more loneliness, no more rejection, no more pursuit of happiness that never comes.  It feels welcoming.
