The only reason I haven't is because I lack conviction in anythingI tell myself I'm going to, every day, have for the past ~10 years. I'm 24, obese, hate myself and my surroundings. I actually resent the fuck out of the people that care about me because their existence keeps me from blowing my head off. I am independent and have a pretty good job. Miserable pile of shit anyway. All social connections have withered, and I have become more inept with interpersonal relationships than ever. I had an on/off again girlfriend for 2 years until last week, now it finally seems actually over. Now I'm realizing how empty my life really is and how just plain stupid I've become. Regardless, I will hold on until I reach the state of decay where it all just collapses. And then carbon monoxide poisoning, because I don't want to leave a mess and I'm too much of a wimp for something more creative. Anyway. Life's been swell.
