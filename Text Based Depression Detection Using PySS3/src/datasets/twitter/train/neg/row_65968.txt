Forcing myself to live is exhaustingThe question used to be "will I commit suicide" but now it's just a matter of when. All I'm doing is exhausting myself physically and mentally. I wish I could stay alive, I think life and all the experiences it comes with are so beautiful, but if I can't live it the way I want then why keep trying? I wish I had some hope to hold onto but everywhere I look there doesn't seem to be anything out there.
