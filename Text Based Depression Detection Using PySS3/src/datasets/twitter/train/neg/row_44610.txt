What do I do if someone is indirectly threatening suicide but not explicitly?This has happened to me in the past when I was much younger (it turned out ok but I didnâ€™t know how to handle it then) and I want to be prepared if it ever happened again.  
If someone texts you and essentially sounds like theyâ€™re saying their goodbyes, but doesnâ€™t say anything explicitly, is it still ok to call the police? Non-emergency line?  
When it happened before, it was my dad. He was apologizing for not being a good enough father, and saying he hopes I have a good life. He never said â€œgoodbyeâ€ outright and didnâ€™t say he was going to kill himself. But it was still very obvious.  
In that situation, should I respond to him asking him if he is planning to kill himself, before calling the police? Or just call them immediately?
