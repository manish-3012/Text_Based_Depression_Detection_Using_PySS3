Well, I'm not feeling very goodSo, I just found out my primary reference is unavailable, so my job search will be significantly impeded. I have a Master's and I can't even get a minimum wage job. Pathetic. I just paid rent and will have to dig into my meager savings. My best friend just went back to Europe (9 hours away), my pills aren't working right now, and none of my so-called friends are around. I think maybe I should take all my antidepressants and every other pill I own. Then it will be over. How else am I going to support myself without sucking the life out of my family? I'm a piece of shit, in debt, and might as well off myself. Also, my insurance sucks. And I'm drunk. What the hell am I supposed to do?
