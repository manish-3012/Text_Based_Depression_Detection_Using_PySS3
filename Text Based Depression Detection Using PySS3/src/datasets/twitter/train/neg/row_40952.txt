Another 30th birthday postI wanted to start with something like "feel free to skip" because that's literally what i would do to any other 30 year old whining on the internet about their imagined life problems, but that seems like guilt tripping so I went with a self-pity laden run on sentence instead.

I am incapable of talking about this with anyone. Probably out of shame, if I'm being honest. I am literally only posting on this board because I made a throwaway account with a dummy email provider while TOR-ing through a VPN.

i.e. I'm so ashamed and humiliated about this that the only way I can ask what other people think is with an anonymous internet post

To save myself a lot of typing and because my problems are apparently common enough that someone else wrote basically what I would have.

Again, neither of those other posts are from me.

Hit 3-0 about 12 hours ago. Around 11 I went and got too high to remember it was my birthday. So that got me to this morning at least.

It was an interesting experience leading up to midnight. I like to think of myself as a logical person, but I watched myself go through a whole period of irrationality leading up to today. I've called in sick and spent the last ...(counting) 91 hours alone in my apartment.

Mostly it was the bargaining that bothers me. I was raised in a cult but eventually realized it for what it was and became an atheist years ago, so I know there's no one to bargain with, or to. Watching myself do it, fully aware of its futility, is a memory I won't be able to forget.

It wasn't even to a god or some deity. Just me crying in a little corner of my mind while pretending my actual tears where from an emotional episode of Psych. Thinking someone, somewhere could hear me, might understand how much pain I felt and then care enough to come save me.

Of course, typing that makes me realized that the irrationality part of it was just an attempt to shift blame onto other people for my problems. (and expect them to be psychic, apparently)

So I guess I don't know what I'm here for. Maybe so there exists one place that explains why? I don't really expect some life changing revelation to come out of a reddit post. I guess I'm just... tired. The specific time doesn't matter as much now, it's just a question of how long until I get too tired to keep pretending.
