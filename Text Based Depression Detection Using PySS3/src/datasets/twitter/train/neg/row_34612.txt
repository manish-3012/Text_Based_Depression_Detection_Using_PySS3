Nearly 18, live with Grandma who's going crazy, worried about being homeless in the future.Honestly don't know what to do anymore. Some days are ok, others not so much and I can feel it coming on. She's on a rampage right now and I just don't know what to do. I'll be doing work at school where I have no friends and I just get overcome by worries regarding the future and what's gonna happen. Often I just ponder killing myself. Any advice?
