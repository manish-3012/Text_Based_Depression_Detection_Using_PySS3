Suicidality survival tips(time-sensitive)Hi 
So I've had a really rough week, been suicidal almost every night. But given my track record, I don't really think I will kill myself any time soon. The problem is that I'm currently writing exams so I can't spend every day in bed feeling like I might die. Does anyone have any tips on how to keep it together long enough to write my exams? I don't really have anyone I can talk to right now. And I don't have a therapist who can write me a sick note. I really need to find a way to do this. Please help.
