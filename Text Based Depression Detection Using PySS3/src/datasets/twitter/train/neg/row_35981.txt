This is. A war I em wasnâ€™t prepared to fightPlease forgive the ramblings. Iâ€™m drunk. I know itâ€™s uncomfortable to listen to people say they want to kill themselves. Iâ€™ve been doing it a lot lately. I should probably tell you to hope or something.i always looked at homeless drunks like â€œwow how do you get to that pointâ€ I couldnâ€™t see the progression. I didnâ€™t know how they went from someoneâ€™s child laughing and happy to homeless on the street people passing them by. My brain couldnâ€™t make it make sense. Life can really blindside you. It does it a lot. Iâ€™m not a stable person I do know that now. Thereâ€™s a lot of liars in the world. They donâ€™t care if youâ€™re dead. But thereâ€™s also a lot of good people too. Try to listen to them, ya know? Cause they want you alive and sometimes you tell yourself horrible things and hurt yourself and you stay in denial because you think itâ€™ll stop and you donâ€™t know how to react but youâ€™ll also stop that person from hurting you and then youâ€™ll feel better. Because there are two yous and one wants you dead and one knows you should live. So try to listen more to the one whoâ€™s trying to protect you cause thereâ€™s a war in your head thatâ€™s exacerbated by the war going on outside so to have a war in your head makes it worse. Weâ€™re all gonna die anyway one day. Iâ€™m gonna try to keep things in perspective and not kill myself even though I want to. Thanks.
