Self HarmThis is my first post so please forgive me if I do not follow the correct protocol/format etc. I am a 20 year old female who lives with her boyfriend.

I have always had bouts of depression ever since I was around 12. Recently I have had an unexpected major bad episode and have attempted suicide through and overdose and hanging myself. Both attempts failed.

I am now on Setraline (which has helped me before) and I'm starting to feel more on an even keel. I have been signed off work and the HR department have been really nice and supportive. I have just bought myself a kitten who I love to pieces already. She has even lifted my mood a lot...I think it may have something to do with her making me feel needed.

However, I still struggle with self harm. I know a lot of people use self harm to seek attention  to gain help from the people around them, but I do not use it this way. I mainly go for areas people can't see (for example inner thigh, inner top of arm, groin etc) and I try to make the cuts seem accidental. I try not to go too deep to try and not leave a scar (but often fail). For some reason when I cut I get a sense of relief. It releases the pressure on my brain if that makes sense and I don't know why it helps?

I don't feel suicidal anymore, but I can feel the thoughts and feelings hiding in the shadows ready to pounce on me again...I'm just scared because I care about my family and my amazing supportive boyfriend, but the logic I have is that I won't care if I am dead, which is terrible I know! 

How do I stop hurting myself but still find a way to get rid of the dark weight in my mind when it comes?
