Clarification please. Anonymity questions.I don't want to die or I wouldn't care if this was anonymous or not. I would like to express myself though, but after events from the last few months I realize how comments can be misinterpreted once they've gone down the line several times. How does this sub actually work? How much freedom do I have to vent before it becomes something more than it was intended to be?
