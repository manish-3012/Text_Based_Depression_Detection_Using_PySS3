I'm back here againI never thought I'd turn back to my old self and that I'd come back here and feel the same I used to a few months ago. I really thought I was done with self harm and everything and I still don't have anyone to tell this not even my therapist because I'm sure she'd take this as a threat to myself and I'll spend the holidays without being able to go out.
I don't understand why it's so hard to just become better and not feel terrible for everything I've done wrong, it's like I can't do anything without being reminded of it and I can't keep on living like this.

I'm happy I hid some pills from last attempt and while I don't think it's worth it I don't feel like my life is worth it either. I've had some minor improvements and I'm not alone anymore but I'm still alone in this constant nightmare and I already know I can't have a good future because of so many things that are only getting worse.

I don't know how I'm supposed to move on from myself even if I improved it's like it's not enough to forget who I was and what I did.
