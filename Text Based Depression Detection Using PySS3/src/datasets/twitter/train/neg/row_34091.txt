I want to leave tonightNot bothering with a throwaway, I donâ€™t know anyone that would care if they found this.  Iâ€™m 32 years old, I have no friends no family. Iâ€™ve felt like dying as long as I can remember at this point. Just been pushing through out of cowardice and bc the hotlines all say it gets better eventually. It never did for me. Had a good job for about a year and an attempt took that from me. Been jobless for a couple of months and just havenâ€™t had the drive to really try to find anything. I sleep as much as my body will let me. 
I wish I had anything left to keep m me doing but I really donâ€™t. Iâ€™m constantly in physical and emotional pain. Iâ€™ve been to so many therapists and psychiatrists but nothing will make this better. I just want to go to whatever is next.  Maybe I can finally go. Maybe reincarnation is real and Iâ€™ll be happier tomorrow.
