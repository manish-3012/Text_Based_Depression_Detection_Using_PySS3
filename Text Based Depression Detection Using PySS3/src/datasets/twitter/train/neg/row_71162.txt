A medical situationTomorrow I will find out whether I have a medical condition which is potentially treatable and possibly wouldn't even shorten my lifespan with treatment but, should I not get treatment, is also potentially fatal.  

I've had a living will (effectively a DNR) for around 15 years now.  I was/am so adamant about it that there is a copy in my lounge and a copy beside my bed.  

Until a few weeks ago, I wouldn't have hesitated to refuse treatment.  However, I recently met someone and I would hate to do that to them.  Now I'm fucking torn.  Where do I go from here?
