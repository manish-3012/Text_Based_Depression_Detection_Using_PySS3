What if I died tomorrow?What if I go through with it?

Will anyone miss me?

Would anyone cry?

Will they just throw my possessions away and not look back?

I don't know. And I don't think anyone that has committed suicide will ever know. 

I want all my pain to go the fuck away, but I know that if I kill myself, I'm just giving that pain to everyone that cares about me. 
I'm giving them more pain than I would ever have to go through. 

Is that fair? 

At this point, I don't care. 

So, fuck...
