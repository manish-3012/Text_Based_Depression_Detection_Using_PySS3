I... just want to dieI am 13. From Romania. Living in a fucked family. My dad went to china when I was 5 or 6 and my mom favoritizes my sister. My sister is 8 and trying to kill me. Or trying to make me kill myself. I am too depressed. Sometimes cant even sleep. She got a tablet from school. She watches retarded things on youtube everytime my mom isn't looking. I never play on my ps4 if its not weekend or I didn't finish homeworks. Mom doesn't punish her at all, anything she does, but today I went and bought a paysafecard or some shit to get psplus to download need for speed payback and play gta with friends and saw that I can't buy the 1 month psplus. She got mad even if I can just put more money and get 3 months of psplus and now she doesn't let me use the ps4, but also took my sister's tablet. After watching countless videos on youtube. There is a lot more that she does, almost anyone would already kill himself. I am living now just for my grandparents and because I want to kill my sister before dying. Mom cares more about my grades and school than my mental state. I became crazy. My mom always told me that my dad is a liar and hides a lot of things. I am starting to think that it's the opposite. My sister is a demon, not a human she will do anything to destroy me. Now I will live only to destroy her. Show everyone who she really is If I succeed to destroy her life, I will probably either kill myself, either see if my life becomes better. No, this is not for r/siblingsfromhell, this is way worse. Please read everything.
