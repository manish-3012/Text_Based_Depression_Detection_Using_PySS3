I'm done, I've had enough. Rape victimHi I'm a rape victim... I honestly have everything to keep on going but I don't want to. People tell me it's not my fault but it is. I ran away with a man so we could live together. He called me his soulmate and soon I came to believe it as well. All I do is go to school come home and sit at my computer listening to music and I draw. It has been more then a year now and my family thinks I should be over this whole event because he is in jail and he is being charged but guess what... it's still my fault... my fault! I subjested we run away and start a new life together, me not him! Sure he was 30 and I was 16 but still it's my fault! He told me I was beautiful and he said I was his everything. I was raped exactly 5 times during he 3 days we where together. The forth day was the worse! The day we got caught. I don't even have enough energy to stand on to feet let alone type this. So ya I'm just done with this whole place full of pain and outright sensitive pricks.
