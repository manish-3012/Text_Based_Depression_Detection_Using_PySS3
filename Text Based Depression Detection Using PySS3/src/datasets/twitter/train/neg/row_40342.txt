idk i kinda just gotta get this off my chesti think i have depression idk searching up symptoms of it and stuff i have a rough idea. i really wanna tell someone but i donâ€™t wanna tell family because theyâ€™ll either laugh, tell me itâ€™s because of social media or say itâ€™s a phase that everyone goes through which they kinda did say. i really wanna die, iâ€™m not motivated to eat, shower, do any activities that i used to find entertaining like i canâ€™t watch netflix because i feel like itâ€™s too much effort. i just canâ€™t find anything in life thatâ€™s worth living for like i guess thereâ€™s some good moments but they arenâ€™t worth living for. i wanna tell my friends about it but iâ€™m not sure if they understand how shit iâ€™m feeling because i kinda am the happy one of the group idk. i also wanna actually diagnose myself professionally before i think to myself that i do have depression and i wanna get help but i really donâ€™t want to tell anyone. iâ€™ve planned out exactly how i wanna kill myself and where iâ€™m going to do it and every minor detail to it and i really really want to do it but itâ€™s getting the supplies and a really tiny part of me that wants someone to help me but iâ€™m too much of a pussy to reach out to someone because iâ€™m deathly afraid of judgement and how if it will go like it has other times. sorry i donâ€™t even know if this belongs here but itâ€™s kinda nice even if one person sees this to get it off my chest.
