I can't do anything right and I'm too scared to follow through with this but here's how I imagine it would beBurial By the Sea

I want the waves to sing me their lullaby 

I want my last sight to be blue

I want to wait five more minutes and see if dolphins guide me somewhere new

It'll be near the cliff side

It'll be near the shore

It'll be so that the sand covers my body to be seen nevermore

Perhaps inside of a tent

To disguise the sight from the tourists' naked eyes

Perhaps outside of the caves

To refrain from having my spirit be alone in the dark

Maybe I'll see stars

Maybe I'll see the moon 

But most likely it'll be when the sun sets after noon 

I think it'll be peaceful 

Not so much for those who find me

But I won't know

Because I'll be home
