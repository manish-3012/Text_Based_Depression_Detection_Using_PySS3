I want things to feel okayI really don't know where to begin with this but I can try. I am 17 years old, I already screwed up my life. I just had a baby who is almost 2 months old and I am drowning with school and picking up a lot of responsibilities that belong to my mother.  Everyday I get up and take care of my baby, I try to do school work (Florida Virtual School) and then I clean the house and do whatever else no on around the house will do. I am bad in school, I am struggling a lot in school and I am trying so hard to understand but geometry and biology have me sunk. My mother is having her own problems I guess and its really taking a toll on me. Tonight I told her I needed a compass to do the geometry problems and she just yelled at me and told me I better have my own money for it. I don't know where that even came from but for some ungodly reason that was my breaking point and it sent me into uncontrollable tears. I am trying so hard to do good and to pass school and take care of my baby, I barely ask her for help, but I feel like I can't do it anymore and I want to give up. I don't know why but I just want to drive into a semi and call it a day and be done with everyone and everything but I know I can't do that. I just don't know what to do anymore.
