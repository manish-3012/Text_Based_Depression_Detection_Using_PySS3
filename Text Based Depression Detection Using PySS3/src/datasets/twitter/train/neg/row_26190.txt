Why do I deserve this?I'm only meant to suffer. I'm just a plaything for my fate. I'm only meant to be abused, raped, shouted at, made to suffer. I'm never meant to be loved. And I fucking hate it.  


Its not in my destiny to be loved. I'm not meant for it. I will never have anyone who'll love me like I love them. I cant live this fucked up life please hope I can hang myself tonight
