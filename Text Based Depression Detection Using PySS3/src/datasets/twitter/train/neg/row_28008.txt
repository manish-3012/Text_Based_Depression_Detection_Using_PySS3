I don't really want to be alive anymore.I don't really want to be alive. Do I think I'll kill myself? No, probably not. I don't have a method in mind. I know that if I died it will hurt my parents, the few people that are my friends, and probably my boyfriend. It's just that life seems very boring and pointless to me. I mean, maybe there are good things that will happen, I just don't know if I want to hang around long enough to see them.
Maybe if I got some kind of help, whether it be therapy (which I don't think we can afford) or medication (I don't know if we could afford this either), then my life would just be considered boring, not necessarily pointless.
I don't know. Every day seems to be the same. I don't see anything really changing anytime soon.
