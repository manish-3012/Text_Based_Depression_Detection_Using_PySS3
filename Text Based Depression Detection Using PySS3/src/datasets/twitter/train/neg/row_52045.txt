Struggling to keep existingI donâ€™t know exactly what Iâ€™m looking for here. I have a shitty (essential) job, a degree that Iâ€™m not using, debt from said degree, very very few friends, Iâ€™m 25 and live with my mother, and have no relationships to speak of, even though I want more than anything to find a loving, supportive partner who accepts me for who I am. But I canâ€™t even accept myself for who I am. Iâ€™ve lived with chronic depression for over a decade. Iâ€™ve suffered a plethora of emotional abuse/neglect in my lifetime. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. 

Iâ€™ve tried therapy (which did help in many ways but I can no longer afford it). Ive tried self help books, meditation. Iâ€™ve tried a dozen antidepressants, none of which helped even marginally. I canâ€™t even fall asleep without a mild tranquilizer and some weed anymore. I had my first panic attack last week and Iâ€™ve been in a pit of despair since. Iâ€™ve never been this depressed. I donâ€™t even want to eat, which was a very unhealthy coping mechanism pf mine for years. I dont want to shower or watch tv or read or do anything I used to enjoy even a little. Im just staring into an abyss wishing I were dead. I donâ€™t see a reason to live anymore and I am utterly hopeless.
