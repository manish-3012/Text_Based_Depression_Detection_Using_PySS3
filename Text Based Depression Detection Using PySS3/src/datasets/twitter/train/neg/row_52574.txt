I wish I wasnâ€™t afraid of killing myselfI donâ€™t know what holds me back. Besides taking care of my cat, I really donâ€™t see why Iâ€™m so afraid of just ending it.

My opinion doesnâ€™t matter. Everyoneâ€™s moving on with their lives, everyone has someone to depend on to rely on at the end of their day.

All Iâ€™m met with at the end of the day is an empty house. I just wish I could just cease to exist.

Iâ€™m not contributing to anything in this world. Everyoneâ€™s lives would be better without me around.

I just want me to go away.
