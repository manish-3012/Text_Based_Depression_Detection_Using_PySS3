I'm sick and tired of people.I don't think I can take much more of people being people. It seems like no matter what I do, the moment I let down my wall and actually let myself trust someone, let myself think there might be anyone who can be there for me, everything comes crashing down again, and I'm left reeling from the pain of watching one more person ditch me.

I try not to let people in, I insist to myself that I'd be better off if I just close off the rest of the world, but I can't do it. I always eventually give in and look for new people, because I want too badly to feel like someone cares. And every time, without fail, I get a cruel reminder that I can't trust people, that they will always leave me.

I don't know what to do. I can't stop myself from needing people, but every time someone hurts me it becomes harder to pick myself up again. Sooner or later I don't think I'll be able to anymore and it scares the hell out of me.
