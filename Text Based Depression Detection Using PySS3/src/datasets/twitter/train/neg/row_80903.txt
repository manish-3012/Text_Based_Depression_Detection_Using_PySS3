HateI can tell that hate is the most important thing in my life, because I've always been hated by people around me: my parents, school teachers, classmates, students, college teachers, just random people I met in my life, on the internet and on Reddit... I'm used to it, and now I realize that even I hate myself. Isn't that one of the perfect reasons to die?
