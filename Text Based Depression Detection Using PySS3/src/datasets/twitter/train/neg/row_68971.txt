Tired of being a looserBackstory- As a child I was badly bullied, because to be honest I'm an ugly looking person. At 13 I had a nervous breakdown and tried to hang myself. It failed. Never told my parents. The abuse continued throughout school. I shut out as much as possible to survive. I never socialized. I was always by myself, to avoid being hurt.

I came to expect rejection, so I didn't even try to start relationships or friendships. I'm a 49 year old male, and I've never had a girlfriend. I lost my virginity at 42 to a random woman I met online, and now I have sex with prostitutes.

I do have a few friends, only because they befriended me. I have no idea how to make friends myself. I constantly look for evidence of betrayal or rejection from my friends, then I get depressed and angry because of the (real or imagined) rejection.
There is one woman I was able to establish a close friendship with. She's a social butterfly and is friends with everyone. But my mind perceives her other friendships as rejection of me. For example if she has lunch with others without inviting me I feel snubbed and rejected. I feel the friendship is more important to me than to her. And this is driving me crazy. Don't know if my perceptions are right or not. Am I seeing rejection where there is none?

Anyway, I'm tired. Tired of trying. Tired of being lonely and feeling rejected (real or imagined).
I don't want to die, but I don't see any reason to keep living. So, maybe it's better to just stop. Haven't I been through enough? Why keep living?

That's what I'm looking for here. Why should I keep living this worthless life?
