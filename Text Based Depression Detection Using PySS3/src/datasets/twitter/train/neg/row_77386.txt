People say it gets easier..Well that was a fucking lie, excuse my language. And I dont really understand why Im feeling the way I do. I think im some kind of freak, I can be happy and jolly for days, and then suddenly im standing in the closet with a makeshift noose. Today was my third time attempting, but I am a coward. I just dont feel much anymore. I can be really annoying to hang around with, I sense that on people sometimes. I dont know what im doing wrong, and im not really trying to please people, I just need constant company or someone to talk to, and I realize this can be very tiring. Ive been through some stuff since very early on, some would say I was kinda doomed from the beginning. But people handle things differently, my hardships are nothing compared to what some people in war ridden countries go through. Compared to them I am very priviledged. Which is a thought I repeat to myself. Im not sure what to do really, I do want to die, but I want to change, I want to live, I just hate myself so much. Maybe one day I will find the strength to go through with it, but till then I guess ill hang around, going through the motions...
