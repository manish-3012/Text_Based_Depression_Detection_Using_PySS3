I literally have no friends, ruin every relationship I get into, jobless, underweight, dumb as shit, borderline autistic, depressed, canâ€™t even step outside without having a panic attack.Literally whatâ€™s the point of living? 

My â€œfriendsâ€ literally left me alone after a night out drinking and I had to sleep on the street. 

Iâ€™m pathetic and worth nothing to anyone
