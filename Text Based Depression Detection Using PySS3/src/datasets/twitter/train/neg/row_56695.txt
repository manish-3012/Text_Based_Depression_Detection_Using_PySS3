I guess that's about it...SW is my last resortI never thought I would end up here...But at this point I'm desperate.

I'm a guy, bisexual for the record. I've been in love with my straight best friend for 4 years, he knows everything. I told him everything and he's perfectly fine. But I can't forget him, even though he rejected me many times and yesterday was the last time. He literally told me there's ZERO chance of anything happening...It's stupid, but I knew that was the answer (even though he likes to tease me from time to time), so why am I feeling this way?

Now that I think of it...I've met a couple of people that I come to love and they all rejected me, wether because they're straight or because they just can't love me. And it hurts. So. Fucking. Much. The thought of not being capable of being loved is overwhelming me. The fact that I've been rejeceted my whole life doesn't help as well. I'm losing all my emotions, I can't cry anymore.

What's left for me? Studying? I'm doing pretty good at my university, working alone is actually the only thing that makes me forget all this. But what's the point? I'm not happy, I never was.

As of now, I'm thinking about isolating myself. I will stop going out with my "friends", I will stop talking to everyone. I will just finish my work like the robot I'm becoming and by the end of it, I hope I'm far away enough from everyone that I will easily vanish without causing suffering to anyone.

Tell me. What's the "other way out"? And please don't say "it gets better". I've been thinking like that for 5 years now (I'm 21), it never got better. WHO can guarantee me that I will find happiness if I keep fighting?
