I'm gonna end it nowI've talked to people too many times to count, it didn't help. Therapists only made it worse. My coping mechanisms are barely working. Self-control is almost impossible to the point that I sometimes find myself shaking. I don't think if I want to talk. I just I wanted to post this before I go.
