The guy I like is getting marriedAt first I didn't know he had a girlfriend. He just reached out to me and befriended me, we talked a lot, he was super sweet. Then he started getting flirty but I ignored it since I was convinced he wasn't serious and I had made it clear I was already dating someone. He swooned me over anyways. When I found out he had a girlfriend I panicked, I went "why didn't you tell me this before??" but he reassured me that he still liked me. Then, after a month of radio silence, I find out from a mutual friend that he was engaged the whole time. It hit me really hard for some reason. I was all sorts of angry, shocked, hurt, even dare I say betrayed. God I want to fucking die, I'm such a fucking moron. MY HEART GOT KICKED RIGHT IN THE DICK, AGAIN. Why does this hurt so much?? How can I stop the pain??
