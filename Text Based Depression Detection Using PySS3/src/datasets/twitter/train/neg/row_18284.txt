I can't deal with life anymoreI am alone and afraid I don't sleep well at all. The quiet of my home is so loud that it's driving me nuts   I wish someone was here right fucking now I just can't take anymore of this shit. I am isolated abandoned by my adoptive family as they only care about money and success but not that I'm on the fucking edge of hanging myself just to end the misery. I have nothing to offer anyone it would seem. Fuck my fucking life. I want to die in the middle of the night and not give a shit how
