I will always be uselessMy mind is constantly reminding me that I am a useless person. I'm a failure in every sense of the word, and as a result I have no purpose or place. No one wants me around and no one would miss me because all I do is cause pain and annoyance to others. I can't keep pretending that things will get better because while circumstances may change, I don't. I will always be useless.
