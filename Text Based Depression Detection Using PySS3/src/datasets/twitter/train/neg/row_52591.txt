If my life does not improve by 1 year, I'm going to kill myselfI'm 23 right now and honestly fucking depressed. Currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology. Thank god my parents are still willing to support me. I have a diploma in IT that i obtained back in 2018. I wanted to take some time of because I felt really depressed at the end of the diploma also I wanted to find work. 

Honestly, I was not prepared for life. I don't know how to self-learn. I thought it would be easier than this when I was younger. My resume is shit, i have no discernable accomplishments despite working hard to get a good gpa for my diploma, even then its only 3.56. I felt little interest in programming because I was always had trouble trying to understand programming.  I got depressed, turned to the only thing i felt happy in, video games and porn. 

I'm 23 now and i told myself I won't do this anymore, I wanna get better. I stopped playing video games and even if i do its very little, like 5-10 minutes per day. I stopped porn but sexual thoughts still linger on and off. I told myself i'm gonna work harder now, try my best to get my degree even though I don't exactly like it. At this point, if things don't improve for me when i'm 24 and life is still shit, i'm just gonna take my life. I don't want to burden and leech off my parents with little to no output.
