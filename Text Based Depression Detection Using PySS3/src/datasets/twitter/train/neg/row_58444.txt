I Am Mentally ill and would rather die then live onI have schizoaffective disorder and major depression. I honestly hate living. The only reason Iâ€™m alive is because I want to own this car one day. I hate how society doesnâ€™t let people chose between life or death. It should be our right to chose. Iâ€™m just so pissed off.
