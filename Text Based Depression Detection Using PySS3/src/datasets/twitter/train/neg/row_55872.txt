I don't understand why anyone wants me to be alive.My parents know that by caring about me they're getting stressed out on top of their stressful job. I don't want them to worry and I'm trying to show them that it's happier without me but they don't understand.

Why do my friends care about me? They never talk to me. Why the fuck would they want me around. I find it funny that they're like: "oH PLeaSe DOn't gO!" when literally nothing would change without me. Why are they doing it? To look like they're good people for the sake of social status? They know I'm going to die and there's no way to save me.

Why are they trying to?
