I want to kill myself, but I couldn't die knowing what I'd do to my family. What do I do?AS the title says. thats pretty much it. I've wanted to do it for probably 5-6 years now, im 22 years old. I just cannot die knowing what it would put my family through. What can I drink/take/consume to distract me enough to get rid of these feelings?
