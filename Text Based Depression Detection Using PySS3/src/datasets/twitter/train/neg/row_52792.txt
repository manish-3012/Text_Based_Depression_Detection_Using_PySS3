I wish I wasn't a failureI wish that I could stop falling behind in life. Everything is moving so fast while I'm cowering in my shell. It's my own fault that I'm like this. I'm regretting everything. It's too late. It's paralyzing. I don't even want to learn from this. I just want to be unconscious forever. I must die.
