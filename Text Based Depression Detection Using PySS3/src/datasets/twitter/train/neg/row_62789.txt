I haven't had a moment in my life with 0 issues. Every day has had some sort of bad part.I just can't live like this anymore. I have so many mental and physical issues it kills me. I with it actually killed me because I don't wanna live anymore. I'll never be truly happy. I always wish I'll get hit by s car or shot or something. Maybe I'll just hang myself and end all this suffering
