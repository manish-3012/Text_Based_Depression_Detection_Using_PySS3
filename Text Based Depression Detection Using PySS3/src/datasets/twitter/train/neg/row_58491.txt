What questions would be helpful for someone to ask you about suicide/depression?My friend lives too far away for me to be there with him and he doesn't like to just talk/rant about his challenges, he prefers to have specific questions that he can answer. So I am wondering, what questions could be useful to ask to spark conversation? I want him to feel loved and cared for. Thank you all so much, I know you are all going through a lot and I truly hope you are doing okay.
