I regret not taking my life earlier when I had the chance.A year ago, I planned everything out. The method of choice, the notes, etc. The only person I was feeling guilty for was my mother, who I could blame for some of the major things happened to me which eased my conscience to some degree. Then, I fell in love and gave myself one last chance. Even though nothing went wrong with my relationship, I am burdened by the same nihilistic thoughts I had back then which gets reminded to me in every little negative thing I experience and I don't want to go through both the physical and mental pain anymore. I'll have a painful surgery in 3 hours which will result in me having facial defects. I was always obsessed with how I look. I took care of myself in every way possible, but everything always got worse. Now, right before the surgery, all I can think of is how much I regret letting another person in my life that I feel responsible for and not taking my life when I could do it. It would only take a moment then I'd be done. Life DOES get better in some ways, but it also gets WORSE. If I couldn't endure it then, what makes it endurable now?
