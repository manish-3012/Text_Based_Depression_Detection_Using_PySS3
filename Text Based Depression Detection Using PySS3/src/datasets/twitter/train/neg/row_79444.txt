I am going to kill myself eventuallyI am back here, on this sub year after year. So what is  the point in continuing to live if it never gets better in the long term. Everything good that has happened in my life has been short lived. 

I am on my own! This depression this despair keeps coming back year after year it is relentless my life is a loop of despair.
