Facing ocd issues... causing grief and concernsI feel like a fool and I know I'm over exaggerating...

I have an issue in with perfection in items and have had a hell of a time getting over it. 

For example, I am a gamer and I have not exchanged 5 oculus quest systems due to faults.  These issues would probably not be noticed by a "normal" person.  For me, they put me into a depression with severe anxiety including an evolution to self harm on many occasions (scratching and panic attacks)

This is ridiculous... it's an item.... a possession... but I just can't relax. I've tried to be a stoic in these situations... but as soon as I see something, my heart sinks and it's all I think and worry about.

I often think about suicide. I've also talked to my wife about separation for her benefit as I feel I'm letting her down due to my stressors. Neither of which I truly want to do.   My wife is everything to me.... and I have a kid... I don't want to let either down.

I just don't know how to relax over this stupidity.

Not sure if this is the correct subreddit but if there is a more suitable please let me know
