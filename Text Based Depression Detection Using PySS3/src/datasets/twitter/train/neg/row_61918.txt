Third post this year, please help.I am a high school student, and I just can't stand it anymore. I am verbally and physically bullied every day. Not to mention a brother who gets looks, smarts and friends, of all of which I have none. Please give me more than "Get through this" or "highschool is a short part of life" because I can't do 3 3/4 more years.
