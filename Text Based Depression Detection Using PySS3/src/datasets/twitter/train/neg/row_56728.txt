I'm some combination of angry, sad, and worried.I'm going to bounce around a lot, so I apologize in advance. I'm going to have to go back to school and a few days, and I'm freaking out. I don't think I'm ready. I don't like people much at the best of times, and I don't want to see anyone. I don't feel ready. On top of that, my best friend is going through so much that I don't know what to do. I love her so much and she's in pain, and I feel so immensely bad. I want her to be happy. I want to be happy. I don't want to kill myself, but I can't help but think like that because it seems like the only opportunity for peace left. People say that it's such a bad idea because it's final, but I like it because of that. It is a permanent end to pain. I hate everything so much and I'm so angry and sad. Currently I feel on edge to the degree that I keep crying at random moments. I hate everything so much, and I'm breaking down, and I don't think I can do it anymore. I don't think I am strong enough. I will not be killing myself tonight, but I sure as hell will be thinking about it. I'm too weak to kill myself. I'm probably in the wrong sub, but I've never gotten good responses in /r/depression. I'm just ready to not be in pain anymore, but I don't know how to fix what's wrong. Thanks for reading.
