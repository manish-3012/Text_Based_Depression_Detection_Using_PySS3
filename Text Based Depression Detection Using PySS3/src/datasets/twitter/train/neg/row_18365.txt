I really don't want to exist anymore.I really really don't want to exist anymore, I can't handle real life. I'm terrorized at home, at school or when I'm out with friends I feel more isolated and weird than I am hidding in bedroom all day. I feel as if I need to erase myself from this earth, from anyone who ever knew me. They will be better off without that weird kid bugging them all the time.

Edit: Not that anyone will care or notice but I am sorry it's so incoherent, I'm really bad at expressing my feelings. 

Should have figured no one would give a shit, I don't even know why I wrote this. Fuck everything


Theres nothing scarier than screaming out for help to a room for a people and they don't even look back 


Edit 2: please... I really need someone
