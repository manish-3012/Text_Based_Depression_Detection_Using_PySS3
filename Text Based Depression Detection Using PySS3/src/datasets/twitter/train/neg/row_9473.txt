I am socially irrelevantI've been phasing myself out of my social circles (all online now, obviously), so I can literally drift away. I'd like to say I'm surprised that not a single person has noticed, but it's a lie. I expected it, but also hoped that someone would give enough of a shit to notice. 
I suppose that makes things easier and makes me feel less guilty.
