How many of you have decided to pull the fucking trigger at some later stage in life ?Iâ€™m 22 now. Depression and like loneliness creeps up on me unannounced. But now Iâ€™ve realised how much of uneventful my life is going to be. So ince I hit 40, Iâ€™ll pull the trigger and end this. It wouldnâ€™t matter as always. But Iâ€™d very much like to make a friend and go on world tour. Plus all my belongings and stuff would passed on to him or her. But thatâ€™s unlikely as autism hasnâ€™t ever allowed me to have a normal life. I havenâ€™t told anyone about this yet. Should I ?
