Struggling.I'm very close to actually wanting to commit suicide. School starts again tomorrow and I hate it. Not because I want to whine but because everyone, my tutors and parents especially, expect me to finish the final year. I know it's a small thing to last one more year but I can't imagine myself doing that. I just want to grab a knife and charge at people just so I could go to jail/get suspended/expelled. I have spoken to the school counsellor after my psychologist told me to. I don't think it's working. 


I just don't see why I should continue living, it doesn't bother me that everyone may be sad. I just don't care. I know it's selfish but I don't care. 


I feel so left out in everything. I can't do shit. I'm always surrounded by people better than me, school, friends etc. I rarely play with people now because having them carry me brings me more down. 
Heck, shooter games with friends are even worse. It's hard to play with anyone, I can't do anything right, I can't practice even. I'm too afraid. What will they say? It's come to the point I haven't played anything with anyone. I know It's stupid.  I just bring everyone down with me.


My breakdowns used to be maybe a total of 2 hours a day but now I feel like I'm always in that mood. I hope I'll be able to commit suicide. I don't want to have a future. 


I've thrown up several times just because i'm crying. 

I need someone to help me kill myself. I'm sorry. I don't know if I feel like replying to any comments later if there are any. I'm really sorry.
