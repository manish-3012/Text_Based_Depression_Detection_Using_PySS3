I can't take anything anymore and I want to end it all for onceI don't even know if anyone will read this or even care, and I don't even know where to start.  


I'm so fucking sad, melancholic and it has been like that for some time, I can't stand so many fucking things, at the moment I feel like I have nobody, I'm not the number 1 person for anyone, my bestfriend has his gf and he's distant from me now, my sister is gone, well I could say the infinity of persons and how I'm not close to them, that is not exactly my problem.  


I really do need those persons physically close to me, I need them, I need someone to be my number 1, all of them were drafted away, I have them by texts, calls, whatever, but I don't feel like I have any of them at reality with me, I can't talk about how I'm feeling with anyone, I'm locking myself up.  


I used to be happy just by myself, I listen to songs which I would vibe all day long, games I played with a gigantic smile in my face and when I see them even though no matter how hard I try, I just cant experience it again, this makes me even more sad, I'm not the same person I used to be, and it has been for the worse.  


I have lived my recent years all with suicidal thoughts but never had the courage to act on them, and suddenly I'm feeling just that I cant take it anymore and I might finally try it out.  


Next week is the 2nd biggest exam in the world for college, I studied a fucking lot but doesn't matter, my mental health if fucking trash.
