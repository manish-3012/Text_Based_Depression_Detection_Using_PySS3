every time someone says to see a professional i am that much closer to killing myselfI SEE PROFESSIONALS. I TAKE MEDICINE. NOTHING HELPS AND NO ONE CAN FIND A SOLUTION FOR IT TO STOP. 
and every time someone says that it just reinforces that no one has an answer and my pain will be here forever and i have to die 
please someone help.
