I just found out Iâ€™m $40k in debt.I have no job, no savings, no skills, no degree, no connections. The college I failed out of just gave me 15 daysâ€™ notice before they start making collections. Iâ€™m going to live in poverty for the rest of my life. I canâ€™t take it anymore. 

I canâ€™t live this life anymore.
