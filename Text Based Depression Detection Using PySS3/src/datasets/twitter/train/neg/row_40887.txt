Dealing with uncomfortable drug addiction.I'm a 24/m and suffer cannabis use disorder. 

I also have problematic uses with alcohol and caffeine as well. 

whenever I run out of pot I have feelings of overwhelming depression, not anxiety, but a really low mood and feeling of helplessness and hopelessness. 

for example my fight/flight is basically dead yet I'll find myself crying for no reason or just simply a low-mood.

My main symptoms of cannabis withdrawal are low mood, depression and suicidal thoughts. 

whenever I can't smoke weed I abused alcohol and if I can't drink alcohol then I just abused caffeine instead and it's an ongoing cycle and it's very uncomfortable.
