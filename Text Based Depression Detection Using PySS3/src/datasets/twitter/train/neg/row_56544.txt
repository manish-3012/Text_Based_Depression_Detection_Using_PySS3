All I do is sleep now [20m]I canâ€™t get sober and I would stay asleep 24/7 if I could. But recently Iâ€™ve been sleeping from 5pm to 9pm and from 4am to 12pm and I canâ€™t really seem to get out of it. Therapy isnâ€™t helping much at all but Iâ€™m still trying. And idk itâ€™s hard to take my meds the way I should.

Recently Iâ€™ve been taking my sleeping meds (tas soon as I wake up in the morning to sleep through out the day when Iâ€™m not smoking weed or stuffing my face. Iâ€™ve made myself such an ugly looking person and among other things life just doesnâ€™t seem worth living anymore.

Iâ€™d love to kill myself but I canâ€™t destroy my parents like that. Yet I still have no idea how to stop feeling so horrible about myself.
