I'm not sad but I dont want to liveI've thought about that for far too long and I hate life. People value life than than they do death. Yeah we get this chance to do something but millions are unlucky and unfortunate. I think death is a beautiful thing that shouldn't be taken for granted or undermined. I love my family and all my friends. They are great and wonderful people and I only hope the best for them. It makes me happy seeing them happy but deep down I know what i truly want nothing in this world could give it to me bc i know it's not real to everyone else but me. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because I dont want the people I care about to be sad over my death. I want them to be happy not because I'm dead but because I wanted this. Life is so miserable that I dont understand why people just keep on going. I'm throwing my life away because the things I'm doing now I just absolutely hate. I'm in college for welding and my dad pushed it into me because it would be a great start for my life. It is I understand that if I get through this I can start a good life but I dont want this. I dont want anything. I don't want to wake up and hear my brother every single minute say some smart ass shit for every little thing I do. All i want is my future gf to get through her cancer and live will me so i can just play games with her and die. Honestly I just want death. I dont want sympathy  I dont want anyone saying "you will always be loved" and " your going to be ok" I just want at least someone to understand I'm not looking for death because I want to die. I and obsessed with death and what's on the other side. I cant believe in religion or anything spiritual or god related because in the end of the day it's all about believe in me and your going to heaven or a good place. I only wish to know what being dead is.
