emotionally numbI feel like I used to be so passionate about things, always smiling and optimistic. I feel the complete opposite now, empty. I lost all goals and ambition and feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I canâ€™t really imagine a future for myself. I try to cheer myself up by doing my hobbies but I instantly lose motivation and energy to do them. I can barely find myself bothered enough to eat.
