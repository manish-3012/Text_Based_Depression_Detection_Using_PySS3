My whole life, I've felt like shitI need help.

I think I pushed one of the best friends I could ever ask for away, by clinging too tightly to our relationship. It happens every time I make a friend. I have few left, and I think we're all lonely people.

Today's my birthday. And I feel so. Abandoned. I'm sitting here in a semi truck cab, my stepdad in the bunk asleep, me curled up in the passenger seat. I'm trying to get my life together. I'm going to be a truck driver. If I can make it through the end of the year.

My anxiety is controlling me though. I can't get through a day without feeling existential dread from the moment I wake up, if I sleep at all. It's been like this for years. It's getting to where I just don't want to live anymore. I just need to push through. But god damn it is hard as fuck. 

I wish I could just. Stop. I wish I could just stop and breathe and not feel this shit anymore. I'm fucking angry and tired of feeling this way. I want to scream. I want to disappear. I want to stand up and yell out loud at anybody who will listen about how much pain I am in. Every. Day.

But I have to get through this. Because I'm too afraid to die.
