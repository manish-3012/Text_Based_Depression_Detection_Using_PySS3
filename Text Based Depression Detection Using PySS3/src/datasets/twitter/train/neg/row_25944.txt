StuckI've attempted once and almost twice. First time failed, second time I told someone and was stopped. Went through extensive therapy and meds. Meds made it worse. 1 yr off meds now. 

I've had some good times since my attempts but I feel like suicidal ideation is my default mode of thinking. It has been since I can remember. 

I feel trapped right now because I've experienced some glimpses of hope in my life but it's been a while since those days. The only way I got there was through insane amounts of self work and I honestly don't even want to try to start that again.

I'm extremely fortunate to have a support group and caring people around me but for some reason that's not enough for me to give two fucks about existing. 

I guess I'm trying to say that in spite of knowing I can try to live a decent life I want it all to end. And nobody I turn to can help me with that unless I take action myself. Which I don't want to. FUCK EVERYTHING.

TLDR: I'm the problem, death is the only absolute answer but the storm it leaves behind is daunting. Too scared to kill myself, and too scared to live. Just trapped.
