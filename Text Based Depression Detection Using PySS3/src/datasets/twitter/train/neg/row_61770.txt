All I ever do is cry.I cry multiple times a day, and sometimes I just cry a continuous stream of tears for hours straight. 

Have you ever cried so much that the tears dry out your face and all you can taste is salt in your mouth? Have you ever cried so much that your chest feels as if itâ€™s being weighed down by multiple anvils and you canâ€™t breathe? Have you ever cried so much that your eyes burn so much and they feel as if theyâ€™re up in flames, and your shirt is soaked in tears?

This may partly be due to the fact I am a hormonal female, but regardless I hate it. 

I hate crying because of my anxious outbursts, but most of all, 
I hate trying to hide it.
