I feel like Iâ€™m yelling into an empty voidI really donâ€™t know how to drag out saying I want to die. I really just want to die. I hate life, and every monotonous, depressing, heartbreaking thing about it. 

My family doesnâ€™t give a shit about my depression, Iâ€™ve told my mom how I feel, and she said I was just selfish and that everyone feels that way, that Iâ€™m just being a crybaby.

I had to play it off as a joke to my dad because he said he was gonna send me to a mental asylum.

I donâ€™t know who to talk to, in fact, Iâ€™m afraid to post this here because if my friends or family find it, then Iâ€™m gonna be sent to a fucking asylum and locked up.

My parents donâ€™t take it seriously, my family doesnâ€™t care, my friends are probably sick of me saying depressing things and donâ€™t offer much help apart from a â€œthat sucks manâ€ and I donâ€™t blame them. I donâ€™t want them to have to constantly reassure me, they have their own life and itâ€™s not up to them to be my constant reassurance.

Iâ€™ve talked to dozens of therapists and councillors, talked to help lines. But they all give the same advice, say the same things, whenever I talk to one of them it feels like Iâ€™m being talked to by a goddman audio loop.

Thereâ€™s none I can talk to, no one who can fix me. You canâ€™t fix me.

Parents will talk to you and say they know best, that youâ€™re overreacting, because they were teens too at one point. But society has changed so much that they will never, and can never understand.

I donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t get a gun where I live, I donâ€™t have the willpower to cut my wrists or hang myself. Itâ€™ll hurt. I donâ€™t want to have to try to kill myself and then get some life altering disability or something from it.

I know life isnâ€™t fair and everything but why couldnâ€™t it at least give us a way out of it?? Itâ€™s fucking bullshit. I didnâ€™t choose to be born, I donâ€™t want to live, so why in the fuck canâ€™t I just die without having to feel a fuck ton of pain?! 

I feel like Iâ€™m trapped in a room with no escape, I want to die, I know I do. But my fucking body wonâ€™t let me.
