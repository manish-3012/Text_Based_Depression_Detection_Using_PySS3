I just don't know what to do anymore....I've been lost for a while now... I don't know what to do... I'm highly considering suicide because life has been so pointless and crap lately and it feels like I'm in my own bubble and no one can help or get to me... no one would want to... I'm sorry for bringing this but I don't have another place to turn
