i will be dead in 24 hours, goodbye. (btw if you dont know i posted something about my situation yesturday so if you wanna know what it is click on the link on the beginning of my suicide note, you wont get what i'm talking about if you don't)This is the link, [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gj0yf8/online\_school\_is\_pissing\_me\_off\_everything\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gj0yf8/online_school_is_pissing_me_off_everything_about/) I've had enough of this, I seriously don't know how people spend 80 years doing this shit, Like seriously, taking zoom classes just ruined me, With the constant pressure by my teachers and parents, (my parents got worse) I got my devices taken once because of my school, WHEN THERE WAS STILL 3 MINUTES UNTIL ONLINE SCHOOL EVEN STARTS, I'm in the same class as last time I posted something in this subreddit, and I'm tired of being spammed by them asking for my video to be on, If you don't know, there's something in zoom called "Ask for video" and for the student it displays this message saying "The host (or co-host) has asked you to start your video. That is single-handedly the MOST ANNOYING THING THAT ZOOM HAS TO OFFER, like once when zoom displayed the message i turned on my video, and apparently they PRESSED THE BUTTON 76 TIMES, Like seriously are you literally dying to see my webcam? Like the fuck? normal school already pissed me off enough, and now when we are home we still have to do this crap, I seriously have the WORST parents for this type of situation, Like they're so unsupportive of me, Literally when I was doing something with my sister (which is in elementary school btw) she likes playing roblox, and espically with me, so I do that sometimes with her, So we were playing this game called UNDEFEATED! in roblox and we were in this round called codebreaker, we had to count how much was in red,green,blue,and yellow, but my sister didnt know we werent actually supposed to add them all so i tried to tell her something, and my mom out of nowhere, starts talking shit about me right infront of my face, and she put SCHOOL in this situation, which is completely irrelevant to anything, but she tried to compare, She still thinks that i barely talk in school but i do at home, THATS NOT EVEN TRUE ANYMORE. So we were arguing for 10 minutes, and my sister was eliminated from the game for not getting the code right, WHICH I COULD'VE HELPED HER WITH IF MY MOM WASNT ACTING LIKE A HEADASS, I swear I never wanted to talk to my parents and call them like this, But the never-ending suffering in my life, I can't take it anymore, I don't hate my parents, I hate the school, It messed up my life and it turned my parents around, I'm failing in school because I can't get this out my head, The never-ending stress, The never-ending torture, The never-ending- You know what I mean, I'm always silenced by my parents when I'm trying to explain to them I didn't do this at school, I didn't do that at school, They think it's excuses because of how often I get in trouble for doing a simple mistake in school, I started cutting myself a couple of weeks ago and every now and then my wrist hurts, I lost my fast typing because of it, Now that gives me yet another reason to die, This isn't really a suicide note so I'm gonna make it feel like it now.

First off, For my teachers, Fuck off, You ruined my life, you always deny it but it's true, I wish I was back at my old school, I'm only gonna call my teachers by the first letter in their names, so.

&amp;#x200B;

Ms. W, (history teacher) You always make these constant excuses to get me in trouble, You got in my way twice and made me accidentally push you, Then you act surprised and send me to ISS, when I did nothing to you, You put me in ISS 3 times, I wish you never got hired as a dean and you were just a history teacher again, You're one of those teachers in online school, That force me to turn on my webcam and when I try to chat you, you never respond, you just talk about another thing I did wrong, I bet you're gonna feel sorry when I die but you never felt sorry about how much you make me suffer.

&amp;#x200B;

Ms. D, (writing and ela teacher) (apparently it's Mrs. D, but I don't believe this evil bitch was able to get a man) You don't realize you are hated by most of the people in middle school, We make one mistake and you send us to detention, Or sometimes, If that person doesn't ACTUALLY have detention, You call our parents and ask them if they can pick us up in 30 minutes after she's done, She makes her own detention, And she makes me miss my bus, I can't talk to my couple of friends that I somehow made because of the fact that this person exists, I wish you never got my mother's number, And I wish you never asked my mom for my dad's number, Because then shit gets real, Back when we could actually go outside, EVERYONE hated you, I don't know how our school allowed her to make these stupid rules, It was literally so horrible, And Ms. W, sometimes goes to the empty classroom, Where I'm the only one there because of the fact that I'm in "Ms. D's detention" and she has that smile on her face, Ms. W thinks it's a good idea, Yeah, Definitely a good idea to keep me in for an extra 30 minutes, My school doesn't end at 3, it ends at 4 pm, so i was stuck in school from 7 am, to 4:30 pm, That's crazy, And that means 9 hours wasted, And in online school, Why the hell do you KICK ME OFF THE FUCKING CLASSROOM, for not turning on my webcam, You're an actual demon, You would compare to Zero Two (her code is 002) if she was an actual person, and not a character from my favorite anime, Your powers as a teacher is too powerful for a middle schooler, go to college or smt and do that shit, Don't put the stress on literal teenagers,

&amp;#x200B;

Ms. T, (not actually a teacher, but a dean) You're annoying, You always call my parents if I don't turn on my webcam, When I said already, I CANT DO SHIT ON THIS THING WHEN IM ON THIS WEBCAM, Before the lockdown, You still would call my parents, Whenever some dumbass teacher tells me to go upstairs to the office, You are always there, And I always know you would be talking shit about me because of the fact I even CAME up, I hate looking at her in the eyes, It's just horrifying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. M, (PE teacher, i never had PE with him though because i was stuck with dumb guided reading, and he's a dean with Ms. T.)I used to think you were a decent teacher, But when I finally got to go to pe after YEARS, You tell me to sit down and I'm not playing PE, Like you're not gonna give me a chance to lose weight, People usually hate PE because it's tiring, But I think PE is fun, because you get to actually do something other then being bored in class, waiting 9 hours just for the final bell, Just to find out that you made that one mistake earlier in the day and that snobby teacher called your parents, And now you're in the bus, Talking to your friends, And your heart is beating fast, because you KNOW you're gonna get in trouble at home because of that one teacher, And then your parents take your phone and you dont get a moment to relax anymore because you're stuck on homework with no phone, But yeah about Mr. M, Remember when I said I got in trouble for doing "sexual gestures"? Yeah he was teaching PE class to the other homeroom, And this guy just decides that he's gonna abandon his entire class just to tell me "HEY! STOP SCREAMING AT YOUR TEACHERS!" and then taking me upstairs where Ms. T is WAITING for me, Literally basically Mr. M was saying "HEY! STOP TRYING TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF WITH A VALID POINT!" because I swear he doesnt get anything, I thought I was gonna be stuck with some stupid punishment when I got back to school which would've been on tuesday, because they said I wouldn't get out of ISS unless a parent comes in the class (Which has happened to me before, I was so embarassed but I couldn't say nothing because I was obviously silenced) before the wonderful news that the school has been closed down for the rest of the school year.

Mr. M, (principal) All I have to say is, Why did you hire such horrible and cold-hearted teachers.

And to my parents, I love you, But in this current state, You've made me hate you, You would always randomly talk trash about me and get in my business, You force me to do EVERYTHING the teachers tell me to do, Even though I never knew them in my life, And whenever I try to explain myself that I never did this in school, You never listen, You've brainwashed me to think that school is the most important part in your life, But really, its my mental health, You always side with my school whenever I get in trouble, EVEN WHEN I SHOW LITERAL PROOF THAT THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN IN SCHOOL. To my mom, You tell random people about my personal life for literally no reason, To my dad, You keep asking what's wrong with me, There's nothing wrong with me, And if you think that there's something wrong with me, There must be something wrong with you to think that. This is most likely my last reddit post, My last message, My last evidence of me living, I spent 2 class periods writing this suicide note, And with that, that is me, I spent 14 years living on this trash earth and its finally coming to an end.

Goodbye.
