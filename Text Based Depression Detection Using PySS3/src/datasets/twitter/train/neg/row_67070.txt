I'm worthless.I have no value, other people already have a whole plan on what they want to do in life and ai am sitting here thinking about how.. fuck that I cannot express my feelings without sounding dumb, english isnt my first language.
My face looks like shit and my life is shit when I try wo fix it.

Other people are so cocky and they just clown on me, they dont really care. If I died they would be over it in less then a week.

Why do I feel like I am always nice to everyone and noone is here for me ever.

Its midnight now, I think I am gonna go for a walk and then Ill workout.

Someone hear me out I need someone
