I almost did it SundayYesterday I took my grandfather's gun out of his closet and just stared at it for a while.  I sat down against his bedroom wall and palmed it for a good half hour.  Somewhere along the way I turned on the safety and it got jammed and I couldn't turn it back off.  I had finally found a surefire way of ending my miserable existence but as always, things never work in my favor

Part of me sincerely wonders if I would have actually pulled the trigger if I could.

Thanks for listening

(and if anyone knows how to fix a 22 mini revolver pls pm me)
