I think my girlfriend might be cutting again, how do I confront her?This might not be the best subreddit for this, but I seriously don't know where else to go.  So, as I said, I think my girlfriend is cutting.  She has a history of cutting, she was wearing long sleeves, and very preoccupied with making sure they were fully covered.  We were watching a movie with the lights out and cuddling and I caress her arm and I thought I felt scabs.  Before I could do anything to double check she recovered the arm with her sleeve.  I've been going through my own rough patch, so the only thing I could think of doing was to not do anything.  Not because I'm not worried, I am, but because as someone who is suffering from depression and a wee bit of suicidal thought, I understand that these things are more complex than they seem.  So, Instead of saying pulling up her sleeve and going "Aha! I knew it" and making her feel guilty, I told her I was tired and left(probably not the smartest thing to do).  So what do I do now?  I feel really guilty for mishandling it, and I'm really worried that I somehow helped cause it.  What do I do SW?
