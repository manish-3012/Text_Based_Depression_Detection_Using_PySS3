im so tiredi dont think im gonna do anything tonight. or anytime soon to be honest but goddamn do i think about it constantly. 

im 22 years old (f) and i still live at home with my parents. i failed out of community college after a term and a half. i cannot for the life of me get a job. and recently i was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. i mean sure ive been dealing with this "disorder" my whole life but for some fucking reason having this official label really effected me. 

i work so damn hard to give off the impression that im doing okay, that im happy. i mostly do it so my mom wont have worry more than she has to. but its exhausting. and when i talk to my (only) friend about it, he just seems so... blase about it, like he isnt taking me seriously. 

i often think about how much easier things would be if i just...ceased to exist. i just...i want my head to be quite and i just ... i just wanna stop crying and i wanna wake up tomorrow and be... okay? i think? better than i am now. i want some one to take me seriously. i want someone who hears me. because i am so tired of shouting into the ocean.
