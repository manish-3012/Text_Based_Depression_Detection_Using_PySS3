On the fenceI have no friends because I have trust issues also I am transgender and neither of my parents support me, it's very stressful. I am having suicidal thoughts, I don't want to die but I don't know what else to do, I can't keep it up like this. I have tried going to the local lgbtq center which was nice, I had friendly conversations but I can't make friends. I haven't spent time with a friend outside of school for several years and I am very lonely. My parents are both emotionally abusive, and I have even more stress from my schoolwork. I have hated my life since I was a kid and I was raised in a church that was more of a cult than a religion who taught that being anything other than a cisgender heterosexual is an evil sin condemned by God, and I was forced to live the first 15 years of my life as something I wasn't. Recently I tried talking to someone about this and they told me they cared about me, I thought things were going to get better but they abandoned me and I don't know why. I just want to be who I am and be loved instead of judged for it.

Also I am attaching some poetry I wrote yesterday

I'll be the 41th percent

Kill me God I can't repent

For who I am


I'll take the burning pit


Brimstone Malebranche


There is nothing worse


If you tell me you love me


For who they say I should be


Then suicide, no regrets, destiny



You can't place yourself above my autonomy


It doesn't matter what you see, my life is mine


I want to bleed out slowly, and kiss every drop 


-my bodies manifestation of all I loved and consequently lost- 


Of my life they stole.


I will watch it drip to hell


Where I'll be tortured again


For who I am



You support the gays, or so you say, 


But my situation is somehow so different? 


I am not you. I hope you bleed bigot, 


But there's no love in your veins,


I am sure I'll see you in hell, 


You'll be my demon again, 


Death is nothing but affirming


No one nor god cared.
