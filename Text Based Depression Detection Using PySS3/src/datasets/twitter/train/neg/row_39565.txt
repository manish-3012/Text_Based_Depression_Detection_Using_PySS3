I just want a life and to be happy.I was told that high school is the best years of your life. Boy, how wrong they were, in relation to me. I'm a senior and it feels like I've accomplished nothing in high school and in life. I don't have many friends. I've been told I'm good looking but I can't talk to girls/guys. I just want a someone I can cuddle with and be happy with. I just want some real friends. I want to actually be able to go outside without anxiety. I don't see myself getting past the end of this year honestly.  

I feel like, in death, people would remember me and know me. No one knows me now. I just want to be happy and have a future, and I don't see it happening anytime soon. I feel like death, the nothingness of it, is comforting.

I'm giving myself until the end of this December or sooner. If things don't get better and I'm not happy, that's it for me.
