I failed collage again and I want to kill myselfI've failed collage\* twice. I've been unemployed for years. I'm mooching off my poor parents - who paid for my course out of their pocket. I don't have any good qualifications. I'm tired of being a waste of space. 

Therapy helped for a while, since it was free at collage, but out of school I can't afford it. I haven't actually told my parents I failed again, I don't know how to tell them.

I really want to end my life, I'm tired of being my families disappointment. And yet, I don't even know how I'd kill myself without any money. Can t buy tools, can't afford to go somewhere remote, not smart enough to die where they'll never find my body. I don't know what to do.
