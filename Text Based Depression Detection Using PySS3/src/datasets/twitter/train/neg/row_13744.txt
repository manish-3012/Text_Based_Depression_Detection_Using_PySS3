the thing that happened todayso today I had an interview, i'm a nervous person generally about what people think of me, but i decided to go ahead and believe in myself. so I went to the place where I was told to meet, the woman I was meeting told me where she was sitting etc so i went up to her, but when I checked she was waiting for me, she told me she wasnt, then got her stuff and left. So i waited 45 minutes, messaging the person I was supposed to be interviewed by, who had earlier told me they were waiting in the meeting place, with no replies. I then realize that the woman I spoke to was the one interviewing me, but she hadn't liked the look of me, so had decided to run off.

It really made me feel awful about myself, having had a bad year and already feeling low, it really made me feel a lot worse. I feel like i'm going to be afraid to meet anyone again.
