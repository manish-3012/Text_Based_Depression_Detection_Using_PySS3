This is my last day on this subreddit :)After pussying out and not jumping off this bridge near me, I vented to 2 friends and I realized they did care and they always have but it felt like it wasnâ€™t enough of a reason to not kill myself but today again on that same bridge, I realized that no I cannot let my demons win especially when Iâ€™ve got 2 friends helping me unconditionally. In an hour Iâ€™m going to come clean to my mom about everything and then go about getting help. I feel like this is gonna be a new phase in my life and I canâ€™t be happier.
