I feel like I don't have anything to hold onto anymore..I'm hurting so much and even after trying to reach out to friends for the past 2 hours.. I'm still left with feeling like I want to let go. I'm in so much pain and it's sad to say but I'm at a point where I don't even care how my family or friends will feel if I commit suicide. People say I'm selfish and stupid for even thinking about it.. saying my trials and situations are petty and shouldn't even be a reason to be depressed.. but honestly I'm just so exhausted and tired of everything. For those of you who have been so close to just calling it quits.. what last resort did you end up going to? What is there to do other than to finally let go and be at peace without all the pain..?
