QuestionsI have a friend that I am extremely close too.  Today we are talking and catching up, but I can see that something is just off.  

I know this year has been extremely hard for him financially, emotionally, and spiritually, but things do seem to be brightening up for him. 


We are very real with each other, and somehow the topic led to Robin Williams.  Eventually that leads to him talking about how he would do it.



He keeps saying that he would never do that,  and he could never hurt his family, but then I just come out and ask him how many times a week does he think about other people killing themselves, or himself figuring out a better way to do it?


He tells me it isnâ€™t every week, but it is every day...

I am scared for him, but he reassured me that he isnâ€™t suicidal.


So my question is, are these thought the start of the process of becoming suicidal?
