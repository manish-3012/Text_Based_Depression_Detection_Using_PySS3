This Is ItHey there, as you might know, I've been thinking about suicidal thoughts.. In a recent post i made on this same community page I said "I made one friend she was the best". Ya, our friendship is over, I found out she was making fun of me online and only using me to get my things. I found this out 2 days ago when I was scrolling through her account. I got really mad and sad and mixed emotions too. I dont know what to do know, I get verbal and physical abuse from my parents and that so called "friend" helped me and lifted me up, but behind my back she mocked me and made fun of me. I don't care about my parents feeling if I die and I dont care what my toxic friend would feel. I hate this world. I'm not clean anymore. I will never be clean.. Cutting soothes me, if I am too scare to hang my self I'll cut myself instead. I really want to say this, i have a sister, right, a horrible sister, not that funny-rude sister, the really mean sister. A sister that would hit you for no reasons and tear your dreams apart, that sister. You have probably never had one but I had. When I was younger I used to have a passion for drawing, I loved it so much, but my sister drew too and she thought I was copying her. She thought I was stealing her idea of drawing and that I should find my own talent because drawing was "her thing" and I would "never be good at it". I still draw I don't give a damn about her opinion. Once in a while she'd be ripping my drawings and scribbling over them with pen, but I dont care, but she doesnt know the pain I go through. I hate this world I want to end it, there's no more hope its drained no more love it's gone and no more happiness, It was never there in the first place.
