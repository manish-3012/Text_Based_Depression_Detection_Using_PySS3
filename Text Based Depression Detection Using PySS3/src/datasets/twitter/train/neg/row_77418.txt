Dear momMom , why must you love my brother more than me. He lashes out at anything I do to help him , and get furious at my retaliation. You come home from work and tell and scream and take it out on me . You say I can come to you about anything , but I've tried and you've mocked me and pushed me away. You're always so negative and degrading. How can I treat my depression , when you're the one that causes it. I can only take so much. I would live for my dog but we put him down and you obviously loved him more than me.you always hate me for loving my dad and my stepmom , because she was more of a mother than you ever were . Your words and actions hurt and you don't give to fucks. If I wasn't scared about going to hell I would kill myself , or better yet kill you , my brother , then myself , because you obviously think I'm a mistake , so I'll show you the pain you've caused me . If only...
