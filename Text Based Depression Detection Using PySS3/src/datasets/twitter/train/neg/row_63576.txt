All the bright placesI had read the book a long time ago and remember loving it. I didnâ€™t remember that it didnâ€™t have a happy ending. This didnâ€™t motivate me to not kill myself it made me angry and upset and angry and sad. 

Has anyone else watched / read it? Does anyone understand and have feelings about it?
