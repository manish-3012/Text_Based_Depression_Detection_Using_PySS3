loops.i donâ€™t really know why i am doing all of this alone. 
today i thought long &amp; hard about slitting my wrists in the shower. 

but yesterday i spent the day with my folks. pretending to be okay. 
it was my momâ€™s birthday. and sheâ€™s not in the best relationship with my father. 
theyâ€™re still together but. they donâ€™t even talk to each other. 

he was pretending yesterday too. to be part of something he isnâ€™t. 

and i really wanted my mother to have a good day. 
so i just sucked it up &amp; faked it. 

and i crashed horribly at the end of the day. in my room. by myself. 
i was crying. i couldnâ€™t sleep. i kept having trouble breathing. 
it felt horrible. 

and i know itâ€™s miles harder to do this alone. but. who exactly is gonna hold me. or hug me. 
i already have such a hard time opening up. my body physically rejects it 

who is gonna get it. 

previously when i planned my suicide. iâ€™d planned for CO poisoning. 
but slitting my wrists feels faster now. 

and i wanna die. i do. 
but. dying. or the thought of dying. doesnâ€™t bring me as much relief as it used to. 
it just feels like a final painful event to this hellish painful life. 

now i also resent how suicidal i am. 
and that adds to the painful feelings i already carry. which makes me not wanna feel them anymore. which makes me want to die. 

itâ€™s yet another hellish loop &amp; god it is *miserable*


i am miserable. 

i do not want to continue living this life. 
i donâ€™t. 
and i resent that my only escape is going to be ending my life. 

and a life where the only escape is death, is not a life i wanna live.
