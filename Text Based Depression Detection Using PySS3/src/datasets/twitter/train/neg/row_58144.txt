Why?Why should I continue to live? What about me is special? Iâ€™m a regular 16 year old kid with nothing special about me, no work ethic, unattainable dreams, and a fuckload of mental health issues.  Iâ€™ve dabbled with the thought of suicide in the past, even tried to kill myself in 8th grade until my dog stopped me. Iâ€™ve kept going for him, but heâ€™s getting old and Iâ€™m afraid that when he croaks Iâ€™m gonna dig myself into a hole I canâ€™t get out of. I donâ€™t have a support system. My parents couldnâ€™t give a shit. Mom lives states away and struggles with her alcoholism while I live with my deadbeat dad. Last time I asked dad for help I went to 3 therapy sessions and got pulled out because he â€œwasnâ€™t wasting any more money if he wasnâ€™t seeing results.â€ You can imagine what a pleasure it is to be living with him. Then I asked him if I could maybe get medicated and he accused me of trying to sell pills. The fucking audacity. Anyway Iâ€™m gonna kill myself within the next week. Or maybe I wonâ€™t. Maybe Iâ€™m just desperate for attention like every other brain dead teenager. Maybe this is just a rant post for me to bitch and moan about how my white suburban family treats me poorly and this is a way for me to dodge responsibility. Iâ€™m gonna go pet my dog and try not to think about the razor blades in my closet. Itâ€™s not as if anyone is gonna see this anyway. Have a good night reddit.
