Back here once againAch, I'm back over here once again, hello again. It's been a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm presented with four options:  
1. Swallow all of my fluoxetine (three weeks worth, 20mgs a day)  
2. Wait until my friends come over, OD in front of them  
3. Wait until my friends come over and go later in the evening, THEN OD  
4. Continue living a meaningless existence, leeching on others and pretending life's ok, stealing from those closest to me like my family, and end up worse than my dad and my taid
