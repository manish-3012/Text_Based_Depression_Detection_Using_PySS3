Completely lost in lifeHello SW, honestly i never use reddit so i dont know how to start this. Im currently a freshman in college and i'm lost. I have no idea what to do, and i have no passions. Everyday i feel my self spiraling further down a rabbit hole of self doubt and confusion. I want do work towards a specific goal in life like getting a good job in a specific field but i cant find anything thats interesting, every day i waste trying to find something to study or research feels wasted. I have literally no idea what to do, and i think the clock is ticking.
