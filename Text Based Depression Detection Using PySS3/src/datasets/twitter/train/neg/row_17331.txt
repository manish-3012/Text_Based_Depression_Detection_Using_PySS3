Lurker w/a positive suggestion for allGood day to all. I wish each of you peace and happiness. BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front): this community is in need of a more thorough online space in which to gather, gain support and share information. A forum based site with many differing topics would be ideal. A single hub to share resources and connect is the concept. Sites such as Reddit and those returned by a search on the topic of suicide would serve as resources while the ability form groups within this proposed site could prove very beneficial in terms of support. In other words, aren't we missing a virtual safe space with centralized resources, organized topics, and the ability to discuss topics in depth? I am hoping there is someone out there willing to build such a site as it is currently a need within the community. Perhaps there is something such as this already?
