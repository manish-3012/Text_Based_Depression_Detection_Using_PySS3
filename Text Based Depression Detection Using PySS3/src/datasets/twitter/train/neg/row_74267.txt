Can anyone give me legitimate copes? Not just stuff like, â€œGo take a walk in nature! :Dâ€Can someone here give me some ways to cope with this? Preferably not drink or most drugs cause of how hard itâ€™d be to get out of it. All I can do is just fucking immerse myself in these feelings until I can finally fall asleep, which takes way too god damned long. All the advice about coping is just bs like â€œSpend time with family or take a walk in nature :Dâ€. Just give me something, anything would be appreciated.
