I don't think I'm even going to have to kill myselfI think that if I wait long enough, and it surely feels like it can't be so very much longer, my body will just give up and die for me. I can feel it waiting, it's impatient, too. But just as humans are weak, we are also strong. Built that way to maximize pointless suffering, I guess.  
So, I guess I'll find out how much time these things can take. 

I have no idea if this was out of line and I apologize if it was. I'm new and my thoughts are all foggy and out of reach and my most positive characteristic in this moment is this disgusting apathy.  Everything degrades during the wait. All I want in the world just now is for you to feel better than this. Thanks for reading.
