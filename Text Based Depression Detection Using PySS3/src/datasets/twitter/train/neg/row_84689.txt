Things SuckSo I hate complaining but I really just want to die at this point because of the amount of people who have said they quite legit hate me. It puts a lot of stress on me and I overall believe and have been told I'm quite stupid. My mom even hates me and doesn't even laugh at my crappy jokes anymore, thankfully my boyfriend is nice to me (which my mom said I should keep a secret because I "don't know what you like") but I just can't shake the urge, a fourth of my friends hate me because "You're a dick" and the other 3/4 don't know how to react when I say I wanna die. Really I just need something, literally anything.
