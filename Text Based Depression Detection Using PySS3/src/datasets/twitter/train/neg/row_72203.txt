I'm not suicidal but I feel that is how I will die one day.There's been suicides in both of my parents families. When I was a baby, my aunt killed herself at 21 after she was forced into an abortion by my grandmother. A few years later my mum's uncle killed himself after he struggled with depression. When I was 7 my mum tried to kill herself after she found out my dad was cheating on her, she was admitted into hospital for a few months. When I was 9 my dad killed himself after his girlfriend left him. He thought we were all better without him. When I was in my mid-teens my youngest brother tried to kill himself as he was struggling with everything.. 

I know what suicide does to those left behind but still I feel like its haunting me. When I was 13 I was actually told by the school therapist that maybe I should just kill myself. I never actually told anyone that at the time, not that anyone would have listened to me. 

I wouldn't do anything to hurt myself right now, it might sound silly but my reason for living right now is my dog. I've seen what his life is like without me caring for him when I was away at college. I couldn't do that again to him. So right now he is my happiness.
