The only thing keeping me alive.I truly hate existence. I have a deep remorse for even having been born. If I could go back in time, I'd pull a reverse Marty McFly and stop my parents conceiving me.

I'm not afraid of death. I embrace it in fact. I am, however, afraid of the impact my passing would have on others. Having friends with depression and anxiety who've been through it, I couldn't hurt them like that. And so I keep moving forward even though I don't want to be here anymore. 

I've already done all the research, decided how I'd like to do it, and found the spot I'd like to do it at too, but I just can't bring myself to jump that hurtle. I see no silver linings anymore. I know I'm a failure and spinning my wheels. I often find myself hoping that one day, they'll all just become to busy and fade away and I won't have to worry about it anymore. Or perhaps I'll be the victim of a terrible accident and die suddenly. I just wish I could give my life to someone who wants to live.

But right now? Well, I'll just continue failing and floundering. Resenting my existence a little more each day until I snap worse than ever.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk. I hope you aren't feeling the way I do.
