Attempted suicide twice in two daysI've been suffering from depression for years and coming to terms with being trans just made things worse. I'm so depressed at this point that I feel nothing and think of suicide all day every day. I came home from work yesterday and tied a noose, hung it, and tried to kill myself. The rope snapped so I went to bed.

Today I got home from work and immediately made my way up to the gap (a cliff here in Sydney). I found a secluded spot and jumped the fence then just sat [here](https://i.imgur.com/L3i5xqd.jpg) contemplating it for 2 hours. I tried to jump multiple times but couldn't get my body to do it. I'd just get the adrenaline rush and my body would stop me as I was going to jump. I feel so useless. I can't even jump off a fucking cliff. I'll try again when I think I can overcome my instincts and jump.

But now I guess I'll sleep and get ready for work tomorrow.

I don't know why I'm writing this, I just needed somewhere to vent.
