Is there any reason to stay?I think that life is suffering right now, and death must be the antithesis to life, so death must be relieving. Because of this, I consider that without a strong reason not to, suicide must be the best course of action, after all, why go through more pain just to have it end later if it could end now.

I have formulated a plan to kill myself in some time, and everywhere I look to find a reason to stay, it's always something in roughly three categories: 

1: it's selfish to commit suicide
Really? I can't think of why assuming my life is just there to appease others and be what they want to see would make me change my mind.

2: it gets better
Throughout my life I have never seen things get better, so I can't imagine this.

3: God argument
These are a little more varied, but they still generally follow the same premise. Because Godâ„¢ï¸ is good/because Godâ„¢ï¸ made you, you shouldn't. To put it simply, I don't believe in a righteous God.

I can't find a reason to wait, I'm getting impatient for a solution that sticks, I would destroy my life by trying to bring something like this to my family and I don't have many close friends, and definitely no friends close enough for this part of me. I keep secrets from my family and friends outside of this as well (though I keep them secret for the same reason).
