im just so tired.im so fucking tired of being alive. like actually, from the bottom of my heart. i just feel myself deteriorating every single day, its like i always feel like im bothering those around me and that they would be better off if i wasnt around. nobody cares about me. nobody checks up on me, nobody makes an effort to speak to me, i just go to school and do nothing, come home and sit on my phone doing nothing for hours until i fall asleep. when i was younger i just felt so loved and full of life, i would actually do things to make myself happy but now i just sit around like the fat lazy fuck i am, wondering why im not good enough for those around me. i really wholeheartedly believe that if i killed myself then it wouldnt be such a big deal. like yeah, maybe my parents would be sad but i just feel so invisible to everyone around me, that they would get over it after like 2 days. i just feel like nobody pays attention to me, nobody is willing to actually listen to what i have to say. it sucks feeling like you have to bottle yourself up because the people around you just dont give a fuck. i really want to kill myself, but i wont. i just wish i could die some way, like i got sick or a car ran me over or something. nobody has to reply to this, i just feel like i dont have anyone to talk to where i can actually open up like this.
