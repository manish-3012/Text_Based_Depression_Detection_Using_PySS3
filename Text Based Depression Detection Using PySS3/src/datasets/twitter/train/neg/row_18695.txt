The months of summer feel endless and without hope.I'm home from my first year at university. It's been a month and I hate how I feel. I have two shitty part-time jobs until the end of August. But all I want to do on my time off is sit in the bottom of the shower and sleep. None of my friends are home from university yet, and I just hang out with my parents. I talk to my best friend from university. He's great, but we were having sex throughout the school year and were dating for a while. It's just a little dangerous of a friendship, if you will. 

I don't know what to do. I went to a counsellor and hated him. He's a family counsellor my parents have used for years. He chalked this all up to my blooming adult relationship with my parents and just told me draw boundaries with my parents. That wasn't my problem at all. He didn't listen either, continuously interrupting me.

I feel like nobody understands how awful I feel. How I just throw up for some relief and emptiness. How I can do anything other sit under the stream of warm running water. How I keep fantasizing that cutting my skin might make me feel something. I hate leaving the house, knowing I'm fat and ugly. I just want to stay home and quietly disappear. 

I'm just so scared. I don't know what do. I don't want to feel like this forever. But I'm so scared if I tell anyone they will be mad or not believe me or just hate me for being sad when I have no reason.

I got a prescription from my doctor for Lexapro though.
