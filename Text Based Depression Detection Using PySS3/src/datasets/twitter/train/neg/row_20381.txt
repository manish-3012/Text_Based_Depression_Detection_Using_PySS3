You are worth the life you live.I couldn't post a picture, it's a tattoo of a fish skeleton. 

I have a few tattoos without much significance but this one carries a lot of meaning. Exactly four years ago I was taking my eldest daughter around the block for a walk. There was a yard sale and she wanted to stop and check it out. She found a watch that was fish bone themed and wanted it.   


I was unemployed, going through a very dark time with depression, really with minimal desire for much. I had $0 to my name, realizing this made me feel very stupid. I had to explain to my 5 yr old I didnâ€™t have any money. She shrugged it off grabbed my hand and said â€œitâ€™s okay papa lets keep walkingâ€. When I got home I hurried around the house looking for any lose change. I found two dollars worth of coins. By this time my daughter had gone home. I went to the yard sale, just to find out it was all put away. I could have walked away but I didnâ€™t, I knocked on the door, asked about the watch and explained to the lady why I had come back. She was kind enough to gift me the watch.   


A week later, I picked up my daughter and told her I had something for her. I pulled out the watch asked her to close her eyes as I put the watch on her small wrist. When she opened her eyes, she looked at the watch, looked at me and said â€œpapa you didnâ€™t have to, I know you couldnâ€™t afford it, and I know youâ€™re in a lot of painâ€. The level of empathy and compassion in how she said that to me truly made me realize the power behind empathy, that if a 5 yr old can be capable of, we all can. This without me sharing with her what I was going through.   


Unbeknownst to the world until now, not long after that I had attempted suicide by hanging. I was numb and it didnâ€™t matter. As I stood on the chair, with the rope around my neck, that memory of her and I came into thought and I realized in that moment, that nobody would ever be able to explain to her why I did it. Nobody would provide enough empathy nor words to comfort her if I had stepped off the chair, I would have betrayed that moment between us.   


This tattoo is a constant reminder, that no matter how hard life is, it is worth living. It is worth fighting for. No matter how hard it gets, no matter how dark it can be, just wait, hang on, wait for that light of hope, even if itâ€™s just a 5 yr old with enough empathy to motivate you hang on. If it wasnâ€™t for that exchange we had over a watch, most likely I wouldnâ€™t be sharing this story. Since then Iâ€™ve come a long way but the work isnâ€™t over yet not for a long time. Know you are worth living.
