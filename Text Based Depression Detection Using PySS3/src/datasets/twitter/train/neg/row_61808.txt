I'm done with life and don't know what to do.I never thought that it would come to me posting online. I dont know where else to post this.  I have no way out and therefore want to die. However I'm not sure what to do before I finally go through with it. I was a victim of narcissistic abuse from a close friend and was unable to deal with and handle it. I've been depressed and have had severe pure ocd for the last eight years. This abuse destroyed my connection humanity turned me psychotic/incredibly stupid and lead me down a path of self destruction which brought on a completely life destroying  mental and physical health condition of which there is no cure. I now do not know what to do. Should I try to or expose this abuser before I go? Everyone in my town doesn't know how evil he is and will probably just think that I was too disturbed and killed my self. The truth is that he knew exactly what he was doing and that I was severely depressed he pushed me over the edge and everyone thinks that I'm just crazy. I've lost my dignity, empowerment and health. I know that killing my self will devistate my family but with my new condition I wont be able to look after myself or live a normal life. How do I say goodbye to my family?
