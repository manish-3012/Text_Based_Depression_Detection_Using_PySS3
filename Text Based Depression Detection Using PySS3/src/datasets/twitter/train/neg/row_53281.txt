So I just learned my uncle is dyingI canâ€™t get home because Iâ€™m in a community service program about 2000 miles away from home and if I leave I will forfeit my time here due to not enough hours. But if I donâ€™t go home Iâ€™ll loose one of the closest people in my life. Iâ€™m really on edge here and donâ€™t know what to do with my life. I feel like Iâ€™m standing on a cliff and am not afraid to jump.
