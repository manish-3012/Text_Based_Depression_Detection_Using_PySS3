My new job is the final nail in the coffin and I want to die so badly.I got a new job. I can't help but panic and stress over it even though I haven't even really begun; just the thought of all the things they're going to tell me to do makes me sick. I get off work at 6 pm but my body is still working, stress prevents me from relaxing; I just feel like a caged animal at all times. 

And it has nothing to do with the competitiveness of the job, it's a high-paying office job but I'm not working 12 hours a day; *I am the reason*. I cannot bring myself to not worry to the highest degree about every little thing, every little uncertainty. So instead in life I am faced with two choices: 1.) Hyper anxiety because I am afraid of failing the "respectable" job or school program I'm in or 2.) Deep depression because I always end up quitting and hating myself for being too much of a coward to work or fight for myself.

I know I will spend the rest of my life either feeling like my heart will explode or feeling a deep self-hatred, my only agency is getting to pick one of those. What doesn't go away is the deep, deep desire to take my life and just erase myself, so I never have to think about any of this ever again. All my hobbies and pleasures are tainted by anxiety and depression, I have nothing anymore.
