I just don't know what to do anymore...I've been severely depressed since I was 12. I'm 15 right now. I've never considered suicide until recently, but now it's constantly on my mind. I've tried listening to music, exercising, hanging out with people, but it seems like nothing can make me happy. I just feel no emotions anymore except for emptiness. Even when I want to be angry or sad, I feel nothing. I just don't get the point of living when there's nothing for me to live for. I don't want to do anything anymore. I think I'm just going to end it sometime in the next week. I'm a hollow shell of a human. Nobody is ever going to love me. I just want my emotions back.
