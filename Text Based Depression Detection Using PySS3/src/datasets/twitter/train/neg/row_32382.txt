Iâ€™ve Been Thinking About Suicide For as Long as I Can RememberI've thought about suicide for a long time, possibly everyday. I have â€goodâ€ days and I have bad ones but each of them with the same thought. I'm diagnosed with depression ptsd anxiety. I try my best to care about myself and get help, therapy, meds, coking skills, etc. Every day I feel the same and I apply everything learned. I feel weight on my shoulders. I don't want to exist. I've dreamt of me being ill enough to die and I felt relieved for the first time ever. I feel terrible for wanting to be ill when others wish they were healthy. Guilt is usually what keeps me here. Guilt because I have many siblings that rely on me to be stable, a boyfriend who relies for me to be stable. and even with them gone, I set myself up to fail because of how much I have the need to be stable. I feel trapped in an existence I never wanted to be in and forced to be the best version of myself even though I hate myself.
