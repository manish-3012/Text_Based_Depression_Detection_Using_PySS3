What do I do now?I have been increasingly feeling down and wanting to end it all. My life isn't really that bad, but I just feel like no one really cares. I have been telling my husband for awhile how down I am and I feel like he gets less and less concerned. I don't know if he thinks I am seeking attention or whatever. Anyways, we got into an argument...it was mostly my fault. I have been feeling down and on edge and not sure how to handle. I felt bad after. Mainly because I hate arguing and I felt awful because we argued in front of the kids. I tried to talk but it went no where. I gave up. I went to the garage and grabbed my graduation cord of all things. I hung it to the beam of the garage. It was only tied in a circle but then I double wrapped it around my neck. I was also standing on a cooler with our grill next to me. I remember crying but then don't remember much except I felt like i was having all these weird dreams. Next thing i know I am on the ground hysterical  and wondering what happened then realizing I kicked the cooler away and began to realize what happened. My husband later came out. He was like whats wrong but didn't hug me or really anything. I had chunks of my hair in the cord and I now have two large marks on my neck as well as skin hanging from my neck. I am so mad at myself. I don't know how to face my kids and I am going through so many emotions. Why am I so stupid, why do I suck so bad, why does my husband not care, just why on alot of things. I don't know if its typical for loved ones to react the same way my husband did or if thats a sign. I almost feel like he wants me to succeed. I am just not sure where to go from here. I feel like such a failure in so many ways.
