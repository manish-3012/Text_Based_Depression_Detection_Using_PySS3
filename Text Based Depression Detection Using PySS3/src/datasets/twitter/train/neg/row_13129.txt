This is the closest I've been to suicide in a long timeI thought i was doing well these past few years, but tonight i just can't shake it. Ive been feeling suicidal for months and it wont leave my head. It's been my backup plan for every situation that goes awry. Hotlines are useless to me, they don't know me, they shouldn't care either. How can i connect to that when it won't even feel genuine? And I feel like I'm bothering everybody else with my problems, and i don't see an end to this. Just looping through the same cycle until I can't take it anymore. Is that what I have to look forward to? There's no hope for me. There's nothing left for me.
