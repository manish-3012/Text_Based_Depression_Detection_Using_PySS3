Finally?So I am sorry for spamming this sub, Iâ€™ve posted here fairly recently and Iâ€™m definitely feeling like Iâ€™m overstaying my welcome in plenty of arenas. Iâ€™m going to do it tonight, I think. My friend is over, I donâ€™t want to traumatize her but I also donâ€™t want my dog to end up in a shelter because she ate my face, so... 
I really donâ€™t think my friend would mind very much. I mean, Iâ€™m REALLY obnoxious. Iâ€™m just the worst. And I really have tried changing. 
Iâ€™m so tired, and Iâ€™m so tired of people getting tired of me. And Iâ€™ve been done with life for a really, really long time. 
Statistically even the worst people hurt somebody by doing this, so to that person I am sorry. And to everyone else I am sorry. 
Bye :)
