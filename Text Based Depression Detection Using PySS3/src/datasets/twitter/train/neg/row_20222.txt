I'm just always tired.I've been feeling like i dont want to move a single fucking muscle all week, im just so tired of everything and it stresses me out. I wish i could actually had a sleeping schedule. Drinking coffee everyday to keep myself awake is just sad and i cant take all of this bs anymore. and in a weird way, i actually dont want to get better, maybe this kind of tiredness and sadness is addictive.
