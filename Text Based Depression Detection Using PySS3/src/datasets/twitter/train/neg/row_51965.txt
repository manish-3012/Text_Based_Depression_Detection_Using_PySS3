Im really scaredI always had it in my mind if things kept up and i felt this way for long enough i could just hang myself, i bought a rope a while ago when things were even worse and thats been my backup since. ive had it round my neck a few times to 'test' it but i know i was hoping id slip and itd be the end. But i just had it round my neck and i couldnt work out how i could hang myself properly and easily and im so scared i lost my out and my backup, im so scared i might have to live so much longer i dont know how to end it now, that was always my plan, i spent 20-30mins trying to figure it out again but i couldnt. I dont know what to do
