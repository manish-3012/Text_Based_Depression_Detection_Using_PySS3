Man, I really need to slit my stupid wristsThis is the third night in a row that I have seriously thought about suicide. I don't even really feel sad anymore. Maybe it's the zoloft? Just a muted numbness. I have been staring at the veins in my wrists, so close to the surface since my limbs are so thin, and have the burning urge to take a kitchen knife to them. Get high and bleed out. I'm out of any drugs stronger than weed, so can't really OD on anything. Scared to hang myself, I have asthma and the sensation of choking makes me panic. I want to light up then go to work carving. I am at my parents right now, but that still isn't enough to stop me. I am rambling now. I could really never see myself living into afulthood anyways, I might as well put an end to it myself. I feel... calm. Maybe more calm than I have felt in awhile. I feel so outside of my head currently, like I am many layers removed from myself. Memories don't seem like my own. I can't remember how I should feel, or why I was ever so content with living. I guess in case this ends up being it, I am not leaving a note. So this is my "just in case" anonymous rant.

Thanks
