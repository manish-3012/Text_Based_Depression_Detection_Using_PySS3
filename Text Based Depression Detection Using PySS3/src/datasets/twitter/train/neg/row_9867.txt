Feeling suicidal about my circumcisionHi community, I know that this may sound weird to you but I hate having been circumcised as an infant without my consent. Especially as an austrian where more than 90% are left intact. I hate it when people claim that nearly one third are circumcised and the vast majority of them are still happy. Of course they are! Even I was a few months ago because I didn't think about something I couldn't change. Initially i tried to supress my feelings beacuse it is considered weak and disrespectful against my parents. But then I realised how unethical it is to cut off a part of my body. I feel so incomplete and raped. Raped with a knife. I feel betrayed nad humiliated from my parents and inferior to the rest of the society. I have already spoken with my parents about it and they utterly regret it and I could forgive them but my feelings stay the same unfortunately. The more I learn about it the more grief I feel.
