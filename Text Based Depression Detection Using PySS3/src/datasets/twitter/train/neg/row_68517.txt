Overdosed on ProzacI took *12x my daily normal amount, so *480mg. Iâ€™ve only ever overdosed on Lamictal and Benadryl combined which was awful but didnâ€™t do extreme damage. Does anyone know what will happen, or if itâ€™s too little? I donâ€™t have any more anyways so I just want to know what might happen to my body tonight.
