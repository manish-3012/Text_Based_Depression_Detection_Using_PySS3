Howdy. If you need someone to chat with or need some advice, I'll be open for a few hours.Edit: Time to sleep. I'll check up on my inbox as soon as I wake up. I care for all of you so much.

The title sums it up pretty well. 

I don't know if I have a reputation, so here's a basic rundown on who I am.

I'm a male that has Dyslexia, ADHD, genetic Serotonin deficiency (I need to do a better job clarifying that and I apologize), and Insomnia. I've had my fair share of trials which lead to 9 years of being suicidal and 5 attempts. I have recovered and will try to help you out any way I can.
