Do you believe in an afterlife? Do you think suicides get punished?I read a lot about the afterlife on the Internet even though I doubt there is one.  I notice a lot of religious people think suicides go to Hell. and even deserve it.  I even notice people that are more "new age" or spiritual type say you get punishment such as going to a Hell realm or reincarnating into another miserable life with the same problems so you keep committing suicide lifetime after lifetime in a vicious cycle.  Do you think this is real or stuff people make up to modify the behavior of others?
