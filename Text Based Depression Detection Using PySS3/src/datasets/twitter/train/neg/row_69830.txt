Never thought it would get to this but I feel like throwing in the towelI'm in my mid fifties, just divorced after a three year separation from an abusive narcissist, I'm unemployed for a couple of years, chronic pain from a few injuries coupled with insomnia for several years has made the past three or four years the darkest of my life.  I've got half physical custody of my kids but I'm barely able to be present for them, I'm close to losing the house I've spent the past 15 years renovating to the bank, and I find it impossible to focus or concentrate. And I've got PTSD according to my shrink.

For a few months I was on an upswing with my meds and therapy I felt like I was getting a handle on things and saw a light ahead. And suddenly my tenuous balance was thrown when I heard from my bank and then watching my ex having the time of her life and being in a position to go on vacations, date, socialize and do all the things that she wouldn't do while we were married. Fuck her anyway, but still, it sucks.

My previous career no longer exists due to computers and the internet, so I don't see any employment options for me (I live in a rural area; miles from east bumfuck and my car is on its last legs) and at my age re-training isn't really an option. Basically, I see homelessness in my near future and don't see any way out of it.

After dealing with depression for most of my life I don't feel like I have  any fight left in me, I see my shrink again in a few days and I'll tell her about it, but unless she's been hiding a magic wand...

The only thing that is keeping me from ending it is thinking of my kids. I am not 100% confident in their mother. If I did kill myself I'd make it look like an accident.
