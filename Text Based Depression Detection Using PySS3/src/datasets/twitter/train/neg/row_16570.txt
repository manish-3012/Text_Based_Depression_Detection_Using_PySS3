How can you want to end your life but youâ€™re so coward to do it?I had a breakdown the other night that scared the shit out of me. The only reason Iâ€™m here right now is because my fiancÃ© was in the car with me. I wanted to hit that wall so hard, so badly. I felt so cowardly because she was in the car. I immediately started balling, she helped calm me down and talked to me. But I canâ€™t help but think what if she wasnâ€™t with me? Or what about next time? Iâ€™ve never been so scared of myself.
