I keep making mistakesI made another mistake last week in my job and I can't stop thinking about it. Whilst it wasn't big it wasn't a very small thing either.

I then make mistakes with my relationship with my wife. I feel like I'm a failure and my anxiety and depression is getting to me. I am at breaking point and just don't know what options I have left. I'm seriously done with my life and if I can't make things work then it's game over and I lose everything.

I am in need of help, suggestions?
