Wow Iâ€™m actually writing thisThis feels like one of the hardest things Iâ€™ve written. Recalling a sequence of events thatâ€™s made you utterly feel like shit your 30+ years of existence.
Iâ€™ve been deadset suicidal for at least 13 years. Things finally came to a boiling point in 2011 when I swallowed over 80 anti depressant tablets, 60 antipsychotics, and close to 100 benzodiazepines. My only regret was wasting all those benzodiazepines, but that landed me in hospital for about a month. Then I was in and out for about 6 other attempts on my life, twice tried standing myself to death. Itâ€™s quite hard doing that. But now I feel more fucking ready to go then ever. And my life is great. I have hobbies, I have friends, I donâ€™t ever care about being â€˜successfulâ€™ but fuck thereâ€™s a voice in my head that wonâ€™t stop and I canâ€™t live with it anymore. 
I always wanted to die as part of the 23 club, without the fame of course, that year I walked into a gun range but I couldnâ€™t do it. I felt bad for witnesses having to see my bloody remains scattered all over a wall. But now Iâ€™m 32 so, you get the picture. 
Anyway I have chronic pain, so a lot of pain killers. I have 7000mg of tramadol on me after filling scrips, every 3 months, and 5 very strong mdma pills. 
This is a big step up from my last OD, I wish I could explain the feeling to people who donâ€™t get it. Itâ€™s indescribable. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this hey. Thatâ€™s enough for tonight.
