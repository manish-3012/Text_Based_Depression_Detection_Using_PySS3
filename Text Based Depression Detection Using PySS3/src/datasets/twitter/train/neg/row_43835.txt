AsphyxiationI have finally found the right method for me if I ever do it. Apparently you just need a belt and a door, or anything that you can squeeze the loose end in. You put your head through the loop and then you let yourself hang. You donâ€™t need to do it quickly or to break the neck, just the lack of blood flow through your neck up into the brain will cause you to pass out before you die, so itâ€™s said to not be painful. What do you think? Would anyone else do it like that too or has any experience?
