I'm just getting worse..Today is my birthday, I really should not have been here.
it felt like everything was in slow motion looking at my cake with the candles that my family got for a grown ass man, my thoughts were just stuck on wishing for my death.
I've been to a hospital, therapy and even talked to my parents (who just tell me to go to church)
There is really no reason I am posting this but I can't talk to anyone about this,
When I'm not self loathing in depression I'm angry and irritable, my wife says she's scared of me because I am "unpredictable" and now I can't look at her the same and it makes me even more distant from her and I don't know what to do. I really don't know what to feel anymore I just don't want to be here anymore...
