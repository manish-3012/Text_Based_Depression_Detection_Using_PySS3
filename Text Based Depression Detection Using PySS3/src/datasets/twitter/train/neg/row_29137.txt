I feel lostMy girlfriend broke up with me 2 weeks ago, we had already planned our future and everything... She was perfect and I knew she was the one even after dumping me our of nowhere I still love her so much and I don't think I can stop. But now she's moving on, she's flirting with other guys and planning on going on flings while I'm still here trying to pull myself back together. I had a suicide attempt before I met her and she promised me that she wouldn't hurt me the way other people did. 
Seeing her is breaking me in every way and everyday I feel like I'm living as if I'm already dead and nothing I do is meaningful. She blocked me on everything and I feel like I'm at my limit. 
I wish that I had the courage to kill myself and that's just the beginning. I want to be happy for her and support her and I really want to but I just end up crying and praying to whoever is listening to take me back to when I was happy. I would kill myself in a heartbeat if I knew that it wouldn't tear my family apart and leave them scarred forever. I've talked to friends, family and gotten help but as soon as I feel like things are going to be okay I wake up the next morning feeling worse than the day before. I'm scared that I'll upset people but I want to do it. I just want to end it. I just wish I had the courage. I wish I had all the answers and could see the potential future but I feel like I've already died and I just need to catch up. 
I'm sorry if this seems like something to minute and silly to have these feelings about, but I didn't have anyone else to listen.
