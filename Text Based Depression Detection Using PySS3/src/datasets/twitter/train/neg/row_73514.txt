I'm doneI don't deserve to keep living. Nobody is as much of a let down piece of shit failure as me. I'm on a one way street straight to suicide. The truth is, I don't want to die, but I really can't keep living an actual life with these horrible thoughts and actions. I'm just done, I can't keep fighting anymore, it's not another rut or hole I've fallen in, just a bottomless pit I'll fall deeper into until I can't see the light at the top.
