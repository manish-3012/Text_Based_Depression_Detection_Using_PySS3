I'm don't check the roads when I cross anymoreI feel like I'm drifting through life, not really touching the ground. But instead ghosting through the years I should enjoy the most. I have brief spells of happiness, but most of the time I couldn't care less if I was hit by oncoming traffic. I'm too much of a coward to kill myself willingly, but I suppose if I were hit by a car it'd be quick and easy. Though I'd feel terrible for the driver.

I don't really know, I just don't have anything to live for, and it seems as good as any other way to go.
