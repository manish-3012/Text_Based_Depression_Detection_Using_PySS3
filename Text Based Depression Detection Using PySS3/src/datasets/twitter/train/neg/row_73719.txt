I feel hopelessI've  been depressed for a better part of my life but now I can't even find a distraction.  Everything is meaningless and all I can think of is how I want it to end.  The only thing that's stopping me is how difficult suicide will be.  What if I fail?  What if someone finds me in a failed attempt? I could admit myself but what good will that do If I feel hopeless?  It's like postponing the inevitable..
