Having suicidal thoughts after 4 months of medical issues resulting in rosacea. Is there some type of place I can go to get better?Hey,

Like it says, I have been having really dark thoughts lately. I'm out of work on an FMLA. After 4 grueling months of tons of medical issues following a weird reaction to a medication, doctors contradicting each other, being told it's all in my head/anxiety, I've become incredibly depressed and drained. There still is no definite diagnosis but I definitely seem to have some sort of complicated rosacea that is incredibly painful/easily flared at the moment. 

I know I can't do this on my own. My panic attacks and depression are making my health issues worse and worse. My worsening medical issue is making my anxiety/depression worse. I'm unable to drive (can't wear my glasses or contacts due to the pain) and too sick to go to work as any stress sets it off again, getting worse with each flare. If I go outside (I live in Florida) the heat or sunlight set it off
 At night, I can't sleep. I have stopped eating as the Prozac makes me feel ill. Now I am on doxycycline as well that messes with my stomach. I am afraid to go outside, eat, or even cry. It's obviously affecting relationships in my life as well 

Is there a medical facility/wellness type center to check into where doctors can help my mental and medical issues? Help me get a hold on this? I'm afraid of what I might do in my current state of mind.
