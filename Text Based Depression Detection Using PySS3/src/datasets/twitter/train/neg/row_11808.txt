I did it once, I did it twice. Now i canâ€™t stopThis all started when my parents were born. They grew up in a shitty home where physical and mental abuse were common. Now I am here, my ass beaten up in a pitch black room with at least a couple ants running around my room. (Iâ€™m extremely afraid of the dark and ants) my parents are alcoholic maniacs, my dad beats me, my siblings and my mom. My mom physiologically tortures me to vent. I cut myself last month, heard itâ€™s a good way to relieve stress. Then I did it again, and again. And  again. I am losing control of everything, crying. The only reason I am not dead is because then my siblings would be fucked.
