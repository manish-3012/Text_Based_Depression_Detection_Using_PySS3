I feel so emptyI feel empty, I don't know that I even feel that sad anymore. I just feel like everything isn't worth the effort maybe. I'm 29, not too far from bachelors I guess, haven't gone to college in years though. My job sucks, I have great opportunities in front of me with law enforcement but I think I am too stressed to go to my first day as a corrections officer Friday. I got married in early Sept, told my wife by October that I think I messed up. She was absolutely wonderful to me for so long, always was, but she always carried a sadness that I didn't want to try to fix anymore, I hate myself for that, she deserves such great things in life. I started dating a girl a month or so after I told my wife we should split, I knew this girl for years and shes always made me feel good so I figured it would be a good idea, I thought I was ok too. I fear she is already getting tired of me honestly, like tired of the sole fact I just want to see her and hold her at night, like that is so bad right? She says it nicely at least, like shes worried to spend too much time together at first, I get that I guess when I want to be logical but at the same time it crushes me. She says she loves me and I am the best she has ever had but its easy to doubt myself. I just feel so very time of trying so hard, my wife deserved better, this new girl is perhaps going to leave one day because how bad my stress and anxiety are. I think I am going to cancel my first day as a corrections officer- its just job shadowing before I would be hired, but it seems that career is only going to make things worse for me probably... seeing all the pain and misery that inmates would have, the attempted suicides I will surely come across. I don't think I can mentally do it... Idk that I am actively this moment thinking of suicide, but I have been thinking that life would be easier if I didn't exist, in the most non-emotional way I can be, just seems like I've given it a good shot for a long time.
