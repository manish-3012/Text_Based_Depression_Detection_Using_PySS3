Just came wayyyyy too close. Not sure where to go from here.Pardon me if this makes little sense. I'm all fucked up on ativan and seroquel right now after taking neither of those for 3 or so months.

I'm probably bipolar, as per the opinion of several psychiatrists. Generally though I hate pills, because they make me sleepy. So I ride out my moods, or at least I've been trying to.

I just wrote a suicide note, left it on my bed, and left the house without any particular plans. Thank god, because while I was out there I thought up about a million easy ways to off myself. At this moment I could pop a couple more of these pills and drink a pint of rum if I want to just end it all.

The only thing that stopped me is that I live with my autistic brother.

What do I do now? I have a history of suicidal thoughts but no attempts. Most of my friends and family resent me, or only talk to me out of pity, because im needy, selfish, depressing, slow, and quick to take offense. I can't even seem to stop any of these things no matter what I do. I don't have a phone, a car, or a job. I don't want to leech off of people anymore. I would honestly rather be dead than be a burden.

help me.
