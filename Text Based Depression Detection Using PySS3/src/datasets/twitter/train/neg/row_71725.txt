Please helpI'm a high school student and I've been struggling with my mental health for as long as I can remember. Lately I've been getting more and more exhausted just from doing daily tasks and nothing seems to help. In the daytime I do actually enjoy some things but after the sun sets and I notice that I've been procrastinating when I should have gone to bed several hours ago, just the thought of getting no more than an hour of sleep and then going to school once again makes me feel like I can't live like this anymore. I may sound entitled saying this but I just feel like life shouldn't feel this difficult every day. I need to escape. I feel like I'm missing something vital in my life but I just can't seem to figure out what it is. The only escape I can think of is death. I just feel like there's nothing else I can do to get relief. Is there anything I can do to feel any better? I'm really losing hope at this point.
