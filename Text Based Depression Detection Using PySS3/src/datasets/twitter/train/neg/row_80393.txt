I'm killing myself by this weekendA train seems like a fun way to go. I wont be missed, it's okay. There better not be a fucking afterlife. For once, I wont be reaching out to friends. 

If you guys see this, I'm sorry. Theres nothing you could have done differently. You are so strong. I'm sorry it had to end like this, I just cant take it anymore. I love each and every one of you. Please take care of my plants for me. Play some videogames for me. Try oblivion for me! Do the little things I enjoyed for me please. Dont contact my parents. That's my main wish. They dont deserve to know. Please take care of yourselves. Cremate me if you can. I like the thought of being buried near a plant. Or throw me into the river. I dont give a damn. Just know, I may not be strong enough, but you are.
Love, Ash
