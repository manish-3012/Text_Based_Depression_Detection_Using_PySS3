Everything is falling apartI'm currently feeling the lowest i've ever felt in my life which is saying a lot since I've been battling depression for near 10 years now. It seems like these past couple months everything has just gone to hell in my life. It started with dropping out of school because I lacked any motivation at all and just hit the wost part today with my long time girlfriend breaking up with me because she "doesn't feel the same way as I do."

Leaving school didn't bug me that much, I like working my shitty retail job. However I could tell my whole family and now ex-girlfriend were very disappointed in me and that kills me a bit inside.

With my girlfriend we had a disagreement late last week and we finally got time to talk about it today and she had already decided to split up. I was honestly blindsided, we've had our problems but the vast majority of our relationship has been amazing. I've gone from planning my proposal to her to  being completely alone and I think thats the last straw for me.

I invested so much in her. As cheesy as it sounds I love her more than anything I could possibly describe, she was literally my other half. I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't have any close friends, just people I occasionally text or talk to on facebook. It's not that I'm anti-social, I'm a very friendly person and I easily make "friends" at work and back at school. I just would rather be alone most times then try and go out with anyone other than my ex..

I don't have anything to wake up and look forward to in the mornings anymore. Im ashamed of myself for feeling this way but I'm at the point that I'm ready to jump off a bridge. The only thing stopping me at this point is knowing I'd put all my family in the emotional state that I'm in right now if I did anything. Im just not sure what to do anymore.
