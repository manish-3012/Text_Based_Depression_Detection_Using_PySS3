Sometimes I really want to kill myself.I don't have a bad life, I have caring friends, caring parents, brother, nice things in my room and somewhat good grades in school, but I don't feel like it.

I'm not from U.S.A, but for you to understand this is my last year of high school and I haven't been wanting to go, to do anything, to live pretty much. I haven't been diagnosed with depression but very deep in my heart I take pity on everything I do, every mistake, every action, thinking it wasn't good enough, and that's killing me. I haven't done my bed in like two weeks, and although that may sound ridiculous, that's the sign for me that something isn't right.

I've tried to kill myself, I think, 4 or 5 times(?) and the last one I almost did it but I didn't felt brave enough, and that was like year and a half ago, I was 16, now I'm almost 18.

Last year was pretty good, but those damn demons in my head came back, they came back to tell me all I do is wrong and I'm not worthy at all, but you know something? I love a lot of things, I love drawing, playing WoW, playing music (I play bass, guitar and drums) and I think I would miss doing those things, I remember how much fun I had doing those things.

Sorry if this post I a little messy, but I needed to spit it out somehow. Not a lot of people know about this, and I think the only who knows about my suicide attemps is a close friend of mine, not even my best friends know about it.

I'm skipping school tomorrow to clear my thoughts (or at least I'll try to skip) and if that doesn't do it, 6th is the charm.
