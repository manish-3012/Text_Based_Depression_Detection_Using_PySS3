I canâ€™tIâ€™m losing motivation for everything extremely quickly.  I have it in my head that suicide is easier than continuing life.  Every time I get scared, I tell myself thatâ€™s ok and that I can just kill myself if shit gets too hard.  I also donâ€™t see a reason to stay besides living life.  I canâ€™t wait til I leave my parents but I donâ€™t know if I can wait that long.  Iâ€™m 19, and I feel embarrassed for still living with them and following every rule but you donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ve been through to end up there.  I tired of feeling like a loser but every time I actually try, everyone just letâ€™s me down and looks down upon me because Iâ€™m ugly, stupid, or broken.  Iâ€™m tired of fighting.  I canâ€™t get any professional help and hotlines has let me down several times.  Iâ€™m tired of being told Iâ€™m just making excuses but you just donâ€™t understand or know.  No one really cares about me, not my family, no one.  I havenâ€™t had a friend in a year and they hate me.  They all hate me.  This isnâ€™t some shit Iâ€™ve decided myself, they actually hate me.  Iâ€™m pretty sure if I died, nobody would notice.  Iâ€™ve attempted before and when I told them I was fine, they said they didnâ€™t even notice.  Now that I have nobody, no one at all will notice.  Iâ€™m currently just wasting oxygen.
