Internalisation.Hey, I'm sure you've had people with my outlook on this subreddit before; but, basically, my problem is that I internalise and rationalise my depression. I take a look at my surrounding circumstances; my problems with my work, my romantic circumstances, my lack of nearby friends, my hopelessly isolated location, my hatred of so many close by to me; and I exacerbate and analyse that to the point where I conclude, in what I admit is twisted logic, that my only real solution is suicide. I can't help it. My entire mind frame has come to accept it as a base fact of reality; that, at some point, I must commit it; and it's just destroyed so many things about me. My social life, my productivity, my faith, my fitness, the fact that I'm in a very unstable position right now anyway; and, for everything that's destroyed, my internal 'logic' rewires this to be yet more evidence. I can't tell anyone with certainty at the beginning of the day that I won't be dead by the end, and I worry now that that's pushing people away from me, which provides more ammunition, which, etc., etc. I've tried- I've signed myself up for CBT, gone to counselling sessions, started taking antidepressants. But I wonder if my cynical, 'logical' undercurrent has grown so strong that I won't be able to gain any benefit from any of these processes. I don't even know what I'm asking on here for. I just felt I needed release. I can never express how I feel in any of the sessions, and  I don't feel I've done it here, either. But I just needed to say.
