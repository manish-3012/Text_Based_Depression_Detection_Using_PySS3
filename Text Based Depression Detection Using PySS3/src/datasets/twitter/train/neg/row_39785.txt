To keep trying is exhaustingI have been diagnosticed in depression 2 years ago. Went to some treatments for some months, saw a psychologist, and felt like it went better... Because my life actually got better. So I stopped the treatment and it went well.

Sadly, my partner of 7 years left me, but I felt okay. I was in a good mood and wanted to move on. Went on Tinder, met new people. Got a new adorable boyfriend  after some months. Today, it's been 1 year together.

But recently, my life doesn't go as well. I don't have a job and struggle to find one, I have projects that I can't reach and I have to go back living with my parents. It doesn't go super well with my boyfriend, I think I expect too much from him, and worst of all... I can't stop thinking of how perfect it was with my previous partner. So I feel guilty, bad, and useless.

I have suicidal thoughts. I think I didn't take enough time to cure myself of depression. I think I went with my new boyfriend just because I felt bad alone. I don't really have "true friends" to whom I can talk to. My family doesn't take my feelings seriously. I feel useless, worthless, like a failure.
I often dream about being dead and it feels good. I often look for How to kill myself, but then I feel bad for my family and my boyfriend, who will maybe think it's their fault. 

My main feeling is "empty". Im always tired, never motivated, and I spend days without taking showers. It's been months I haven't wear make up or did my hair, something that I usually very enjoyed and spent time doing. Nothing makes me happy, nothing is giving me joy. 

I am seeking here for advices and/or good words, because I would like to go better. I still have a tiny bit of hope.
