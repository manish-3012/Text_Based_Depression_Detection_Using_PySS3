29 M just not good enough.I'm off my antidepressant. It just makes me feel okay when things are not okay. I am running out of time. 29 years old and my time to have success or kids is dwindling. I think I don't get to be happy. It's for the rich or the beautiful. Women don't marry down in social or economic class.

I don't think I am overly narrow. I say yes to every date because they are so difficult to get and even if I dont like them. I don't think I can do any better. I try to taje better photos of myself but I hate seeing my face and my thinning hair. I see like 20-30 gorgeous women every day when I go downtown and they all make me sad because I know I'd never catch their eye.

I wish I felt like I was good enough to deserve good things or accept good things that happen to me. I just deserve death reall.y
