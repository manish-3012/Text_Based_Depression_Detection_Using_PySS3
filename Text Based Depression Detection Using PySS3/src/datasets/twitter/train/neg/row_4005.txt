Sucks to be young and healthy sometimesThe reason I say this is because I wish for how fucking awful I feel all the time, I really wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up. Life has always felt like a nightmare. It's hard to connect with people, let alone someone that is willing to connect back. Friendships and relationships feel superficial and a waste of time because in the end, no one cares. As I get older, a part of me really did have hope "that things would/will get better", but it just gets worst. Then as life gets worst, my mental health goes farther down the rabbit hole. Ultimately, I'm tired of suffering.
