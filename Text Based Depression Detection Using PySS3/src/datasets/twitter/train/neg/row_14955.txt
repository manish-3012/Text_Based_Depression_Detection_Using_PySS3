I didn't even know this existedI just cut my forearm in my ex boyfriends apartment. That was after very angrily and erratically driving away from my sister and dad's apartment that they are moving out of. I left so depressed and sad and just so overwhelmed by this lump in my throat that it left these blinders on my eyesight and I drove so fast and recklessly through town ready to veer my car over into anything on the side of the road and smash. Just hit something. Make it hurt and make it fast. But instead I texted my ex asking to come pick up the rest of my things from his apartment. He told me I was welcome to and he would be back for an hour and a half. When I got there it took so much of my energy not to wildly drive up and park and slam every door my hand touched. He was my biggest support for getting through my nearly crippling depression and anxiety. And he can't even stand to hang out with me when I need it most because I want to hurt myself and have no one else to talk to. So I grabbed every kitchen knife he had and just kept pressing them into my forearm trying to make myself bleed. Anything for just a little release. Pro tip: kitchen knives aren't as sharp as one would hope. So I went searching for any of the razor blades I had hidden a time ago and stumbled upon a spare razor head. I know I'm smarter than the average cookie but goddamn it was really easy to take apart a razor head and get 5 free blades. So shortly after that I picked up and left his apartment with a few more of my things and a bloody towel and mess for him to find. Or not. I've calmed down some now but I don't see my therapist until Monday morning and I know I'm not going to be safe for the rest of the weekend. I just don't have a good support system and I start to lose control when I become scared of myself. But all I have is just myself now and I just don't know what to do. I'm just so ready for the pain to go away.
