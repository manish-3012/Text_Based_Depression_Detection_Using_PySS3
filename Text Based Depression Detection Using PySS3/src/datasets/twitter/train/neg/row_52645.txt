Iâ€™m doing it todayMy life has always been fucking garbage, I have anxiety and depression and I always want to fucking crawl in a corner and die. I hate everything about myself. I tried to turn to weed, but I canâ€™t afford it and Iâ€™m not old enough to get medical, even though my parents would pay for it. That would just fuck them over anyways because we canâ€™t afford that. Iâ€™m taking the eight hydrocodone pills I have, four Xanax I have left, a bottle of whiskey, and then Iâ€™m going to hang myself. I just hate my life and Iâ€™m tired of living through this nightmare. The only escape I have is the internet and everyone hates me there too. Nobody texts me or checks in with me. I've had people tell me others would miss me. Yet, nobody ever calls me, nobody asks about me, nobody goes out of their way to see how I am. They clearly don't miss me now. What will change if I'm dead? Nothing will and they all know it. I want to have a final conversation with you guys, not as a convincing me not to, just please a normal conversation. Itâ€™s my last wish
