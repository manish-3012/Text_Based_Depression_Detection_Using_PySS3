Depression has killed my marriage. Now I want to die.I'm 28, husband is 29, and I'm in a sexless marriage. For years I wondered and thought it was me. Maybe I'm ugly, maybe he's just turned off by me, maybe maybe maybe. He would always say he didnt know why he just wouldnt make a move. I was always the one to do it first. 

Today, he finally told me that my depression and anxiety, living with it, has turned him off. He prefaced by saying he knows it wasn't my fault and that he knows I've been trying. He was also hesitant to speak on it out of fear of hurting my feelings. 

Here I am now, feelings hurt. I feel devastated, like a part of me, the hope I had that I could fix this has died. I've been on and off different medications. I've been to therapy. I've been trying. But nothing matters. My work doesnt matter. I dont matter.

So now I'm here alone in my bed. Crying my eyes out to the point of exhaustion. I want to die. The only person keeping me here today is my mother. I know my death would break her heart...

But I just feel so empty. I keep picturing myself slitting my wrist in the tub like a bad movie, or just overdosing on pills. I keep seeing myself running into traffic or driving off the side of the road. Maybe I dont have the guts idk. I just want this to be over. This pain isnt fun. Trying to catch my breath. Beating my head like it's an old television and I'm trying to get good reception, just hoping I can fix it... 

I dont want this. I want help to fix my brain. I hate myself for it. I hate him for not accepting me. I hate the world that lables mental illness. I hate this life. I hate having to live with these secret thoughts day in and day out. I hate that nobody knows me. I hate that I want to die.
