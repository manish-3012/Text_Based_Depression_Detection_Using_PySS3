I'm having homocidal and suicidal thoughtsI'm a 19 yr old university student who deals with mental issues including depression. I've attempted to kill myself 4 times in my life, the first attempt occuring at the age of 10. I now have more access to failproof methods, but haven't killed myself because I started caring about how my family would feel If I went through with it.

I started wishing for my parents and my brother to die so I could kill myself without hesitation. But recently, I've gone from wishing to thinking about poisoning my family then killing myself. Therapy and medication has never done me any good. I feel like I'm gonna snap and do it.
