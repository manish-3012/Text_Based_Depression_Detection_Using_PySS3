I feel like I'll die alone and miserableI've gone through this with my family multiple times, but all they do is complain about me feeling sad all the time... So, I feel like I'll end up alone. The only romantic relationship I've had was with a girl who I though was the love of my life. She made me happy, she made me feel good about myself. I was considering marrying this girl. However, I had a massive mental breakdown at some point, and I started opening up about my past, and the fact that I have depression. I told her that I want to end my own life once in a while and she said to me "Okay, Anon (I'd prefer to not have my name out here), you scare me.". I felt fine for a while about her since I apologised for acting weird.

 However 1 month later she is not responding to my text messages or calls at all and seems to have gone silent, 2 weeks after that she responds to me saying that she has been cheating on me for 1 month... It broke my heart and I went on an episode of smoking, doing drugs and drinking, and now I feel empty. The one girl that made me happy... gone. I'm way too shy to talk to anyone outside my close friend group due to my social anxiety and my depression makes me feel like I'm a worthless piece of garbage that doesn't deserve love. I'm fairly certain that I'll end up on the streets with nothing to my name and no one that cares about me.

 Sorry about the long post, but I feel like I needed to get this out somewhere.
