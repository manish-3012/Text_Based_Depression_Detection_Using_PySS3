I need to get things off ny chest.Sorry if my grammar and spelling are incorrect I'm writing from the heart. My boyfrend is just not the right person for me I realized this just now after an argument, he always insult me, basically mental abuse.. but I seem to can't let him go because we did have some good times, I've been with him for 7 years..but the mental abuse has caused me to feel as if killing myself was better off for me. He has even said I should... I feel lost rn I'd love hear that everything is fine I will be fine without him ðŸ˜ªðŸ’”ðŸ˜¶ pls don't judge me
