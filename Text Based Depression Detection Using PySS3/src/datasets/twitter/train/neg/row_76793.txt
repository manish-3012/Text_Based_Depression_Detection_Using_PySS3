No reason to live.I've got nothing to offer anyone. I've let my depression and anxiety alienate those who love me. Now I have no one. I deserve no one. I'm pretty certain I'm not going to be here much longer, I've accepted it. Not sure how to go about it, I do want it to be painless. Not really sure why I'm posting here, we'll see in a few seconds if I just delete this wall of text anyway. I guess you could call it a cry for help, but I'm not sure if that's what it is because my mind is pretty made up. I've lost those I love most, I'm going nowhere in life.
I have no reason to live this cruel life anymore.
