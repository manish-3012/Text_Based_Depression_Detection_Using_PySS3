This is exactly how I'm feeling right now after the woman I love left my life for what seems like the last time.She took everything from me. She took my heart and she ripped it in half. I just wanted a break to get my shit together. She hasn't said a word to me in a whole month, I think she lost my number just to spite me, and I think maybe she never loved me to begin with. I get the feeling she may have been cheating on me, too. She lied to me, when she said she'd always love me, apparently, because nobody would do this to someone they loved, not the way I love her. I think maybe she was just telling me we'd still talk so I wouldn't make a scene around her, and then she'd just break up with me without telling me when I was home again.

So, I still love you Lily, but I hate you and I hope someday I get the chance to hatefuck the shit out of you like you did to me when you were using me for sex after you stopped talking to me, cuddling me or hugging me, and were largely pretending I didn't exist except for that absolutely painful sex, where you wouldn't stop when I asked you to.

This is how I feel because of you, you right cunt

Now, if you'll just excuse me, I think this is my stop. Where are my pills?
