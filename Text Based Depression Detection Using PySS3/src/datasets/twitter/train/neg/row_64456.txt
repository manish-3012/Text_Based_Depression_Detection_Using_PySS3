Help me.I just want someone there for me. I'm so lonely. I'm here because my girlfriend of 2.5 years left me, I have no friends or anything of the sort, I have no one to talk to. I can't get over her, I can't do anything right. I have a knife, bottles of pills that I don't know what they do but I'll take all of them, a wall socket, or just hang my self from my apartment buliding. I just want it to end. I wish someone knew what I was going through. I just want to be happy for once in my life. I want someone to know what to say or do.
