I should be dead by nowBut life some how manages to fuck that up for me too lol. I've been craving some good Chinese food before I kill myself today, went to my favorite place and it just happens that of all days, today is the day they're doing a "deep clean" in the kitchen so I couldn't order what I wanted. Whatever fuck it, it was just another slap in my already bruised face. I started making my way to the destination where it was going to finally end, I planned the perfect spot for week and what'd you know, roads fucking closed for construction lol... I was trying to be considerate and not leave with a bad image for everyone, but fuck it, firearm it is. âœŒï¸
