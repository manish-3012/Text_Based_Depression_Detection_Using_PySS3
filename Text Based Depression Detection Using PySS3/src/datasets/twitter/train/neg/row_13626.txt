i want to kill myself, and have since i five.hi im alex, this is my first reddit post but ive lurked for years. im not sure why im like this, i always have been. ive never felt normal, and i always fantasized the idea of my own death or suicide. ive had a kind of rough life, well as rough as a suburban life can be. my best friend killed himself, i was raped by a neighbor that i repressed for about a decade, shitty home life, and girls using me for plenty of separate reasons. right now, im formerly graduated, but i havent applied for spring classes, a job, or anything really. im a fucking loser, that doesn't do anything but smoke weed and watch movies. i have a very loving girlfriend, but i know she can do better than me, however im incredibly grateful for her and i love her, shes been with for two years and shes the most supportive and gentle person ive ever met and i do care for her more than pretty much anything. im sorry, im kind of all over the place, ive been crying for the past six hours in my bathroom debating if its worth it or not. i just, i have no idea what to do or where to go, or if its even worth trying anymore. i know im young and this might be just hormones, but its been about fourteen years of this, and im just really tired guys. im sorry if i wasted your time, and thank you for reading.

edit: title's meant to be "have since i was five." im sorry.
