The future scares meIm not suicidal, at least not yet.
I often think about it and belive its a thing ill never resort to doing. Yet i still think that suicide is The end im heading towards.
I feel like if I dont change something with my life soon I wont be able to keep going on living it. 
I feel a creeping lonlinesss yet I have Great friends and family. 
I feel so confused all The time, and I dont understand my own emotions anymore. I feel this damn pressure yet I dont change myself or my way of life at all. 
So The future scares me, so much it almost paralyzes me.
So much that someday it might kill me.
