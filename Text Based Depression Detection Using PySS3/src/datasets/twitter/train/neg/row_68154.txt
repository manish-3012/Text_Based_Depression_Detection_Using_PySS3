Scared this virus is going to kill everyone I love, might as well kill myself firstI've never been suicidal, ever. But living with OCD/Anxiety at a time like this is driving me to have thoughts I never thought I could have. I love my family so much, but they're not being careful. And I can't handle the fact that nothing I can do can save them.

I'm trying my best to keep my mom inside with me, she's 60 and has smoked for 30 years of her life, also has high blood pressure. But, my selfish cunt of a sister is "bored" where she lives and wants to come infect the household. Of course my mom is playing into it and giving her attention, like my sister wants, but it's putting my mom at great risk.

If my mom dies, I do not want to live. And to be honest, my mom 'picking' my sister over me also makes me want to die. She's willing to risk her life to allow my sister into the household when my sister has been partying, going out, eating out, etc, in a city that has 4,000+ cases. My sister is young and will be fucking fine if she gets it.

I'm at my end here and I really hate everything right now. Struggling to find a silver lining in anything.
