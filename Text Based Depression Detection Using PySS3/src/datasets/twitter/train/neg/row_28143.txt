I am so close to just ridding myself off this world.I really just want to get out of this hellhole, but it's so stupid that we can't do it quickly and painlessly. Every passing day, I get even more depressed, which at first I thought would not be possible, but here we are.


I know I am very bad at socializing. I have so much to say to the people around me but I can't. People around me think I am just a regular person doing regular things, but when they find out that I am not a suitable person for them to hang out with they talk stuff behind my back and treat me horribly, as if I just murdered a litter of puppies.


I've been depressed for more than 8 years, I talked about it to my father, only to be laughed at for thinking like that. I have considered suicide several times, but always back out because there's always a chance it fails and I suffer for the rest of my life.


It's so stupid that we can't choose to get out of our bodies and be free and never return to this hell again. I hate living like this in this world, being treated like dirt by your own family, and being talked about behind my back by strangers/peers.
