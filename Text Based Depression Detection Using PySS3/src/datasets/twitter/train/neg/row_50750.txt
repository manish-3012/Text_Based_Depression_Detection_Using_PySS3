I want to dieHello,

Iâ€™m a 26 year old transgender male (female to male) and I want to die

I have fought this battle with myself for years and I feel myself getting weaker. More and more often I feel myself thinking â€œit would be easier if you just gave upâ€

I feel so alone. The love of my life, my wife, cheated on me and left me for this man who is controlling and manipulative after keeping me a secret from her family for 7 years. And yes, she already told them about him..

Iâ€™m basically homeless and broke. I have no idea what I want to do with my life.

I also have a painful autoimmune diseases

Iâ€™m in so much pain both mentally and physically, Iâ€™m not sure I can do this anymore

I have the letters written and the plan in place

Iâ€™m giving myself to the end of August to give my friends more memories of me and then Iâ€™m going to stop fighting
