My best friend has been thinking about suicide for months and he is getting so much worse help!Ok so for the last 2 months he has been telling me how much he wants to die but in the last 3 days he has described how he could do it and it's scaring me. Just now his whole voice and voice pattern has changed. its just short and delayed responses in a monotone voice which has hasnt done before and im worried he might do it.
He has no one to talk to apart from me because he doesnt talk to his mum about it.
