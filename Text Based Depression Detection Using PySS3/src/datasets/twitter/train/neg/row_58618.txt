How to stop my desire of kill myselfI actually got here looking on Google "how to convince myself for suicide?" But I just got a lot of pages trying to convince me to stay  alive. I wish i could just stop my mind and suicidal thoughts by reading the web or just by talking good things to myself but my mind doesnt stop, i Am literally sleeping , no eating got the las 3 days, i should be working in my home based business but cant even step out of bed, last night i put q lot of effort to get myself into the shower because i needed to relax, and stop my stupid mind, but it dos not work, and while i was there i almost went out to grab something to cut my wrist. I tought of my mom so i could and start crying because she doesnt deserve the pain of a death daughter. I stayed under the shower for a couple minutes trying to put myself together. I went to sleep, had lots of bad dreams and this morning the same story. I have no energy, no streght to step out of bed or get me something to eat, i want and i am looking for a way to die. I cant fail if i try because could no live with that shame... does anybody have overcome such a darl phase? I can think of very good reason to stay alive, i actually Love live when i Am not so depressed , but know how to manage my thoughts and i feel scary of my own mind. I do not know for how long i will keep trying to do not listen to the part of me that wants to be death.
