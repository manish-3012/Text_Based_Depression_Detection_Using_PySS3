I wish someone would push me in front of the train or subway cars.I go on the train and subway everyday. I want someone to push me one day or bump into me accidentally. A woman was standing so close behind me today as the train pulled in that I thought she might actually do it. I was scared but excited too. I'm too scared to actually jump in front of the rails by myself. 
One of my closest friends stood in front of the GO train earlier this year and killed herself. It sounds sick but I was jealous.
