Not even sure why I'm even doing this.Like the title, I have nothing planned or *specific* to ask advice about except wanting to vent about how difficult it is to go about trying to commit suicide.

I've failed out of college after assorted attempts of starting, dropping out, going back, dropping out for the past 4 years now. I'm accumulating so much debt because of this. I haven't had a job for 2 years now. I have no desire to move on from any of that at this point. I have no desirable skills or work references. I have anxiety, panic, and depression issues. Pills make it worse, not better. I've been in therapy and after I miss an appointment I don't see the point in continuing treatment since all I get is stupid printouts on "breathing techniques" to help sleep better.

I had no option to begin life, and it just makes my blood boil when I hear people say it's selfish to take your own life. What about how selfish it was to have unprotected sex and have me by accident? How selfish was it to have an abortion the first time you had a son but decided you wanted to go through with it for me after you had a couple of daughters? I'm 22 and find no joy in being around others, and at this point is wait out until I'm summoned to court and eventually go to jail for my student loan debt or just die and have my loans forgiven.

I just want an exit bag and say to hell to everything else.
