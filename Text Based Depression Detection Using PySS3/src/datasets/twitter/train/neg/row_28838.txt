I want to commit suicide, but I'm too scared to hurt myself.I just find it easier to get cancer or AIDS or something rather than just kill myself outright. I don't want to live anymore, but I can't seem to bring myself to kill myself. This probably won't be read and I'll probably be as fit as a fiddle, so looks like I'm gonna have to grow a pair real soon.

Edit: thanks for the replies guys, really appreciate them.
