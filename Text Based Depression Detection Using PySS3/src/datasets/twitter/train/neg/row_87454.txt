life is a fucking jokeI am 20 years old with high functioning autism. I can no longer read or study. Any sound, vibration or movement in the environment can interrupt any line of thought i have. I am left to constantly fight to get my concentration back. It is so incredibly hard to concentrate that it is not worth living. I have deteriorated to the point that all i can do is go for long walks and pace back and forth in my room. I have been locked up in the hospital twice for suicide. The doctors, psychiatrist and therapists cannot help me. All i can think about is cutting open my neck.
