this is for you beani miss the way you looked at me with those beautiful brown eyes. i miss how all my worries went away when you would hold me. i miss the way you laughed, and those sweet little noises you made when you were happy. 

i canâ€™t tell you how much i love you. i know you donâ€™t see it, but youâ€™re something more than just special. one day everyone is going to know your name and it makes me giggle just thinking about it now. all those little kids asking you to sign their copy of your comic... 
your passion to chase your dreams and your creativity will never cease to amaze me.

im sorry about the way everything ended. my heart is still broken and i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll ever come out of it. i donâ€™t blame you for my pain.
i donâ€™t blame you for anything. im just sorry i added to yours. 

i dont see a way out of this numbness anymore. something changed when i came out of the hospital. i guess i just decided to give up. i hope you dont give up though bean. i hope you know how loved you are.
