I donâ€™t know what I wantI feel like much of my reason for living is to make the people that I love happy and I feel like I canâ€™t do that anymore. Iâ€™m sure my husband despises me at this point and itâ€™s broken my heart that no matter how badly I want to make him happy, I just seen to make things worse. My mind feels so confused because I donâ€™t feel like I want to be here anymore and I donâ€™t know what to do..
