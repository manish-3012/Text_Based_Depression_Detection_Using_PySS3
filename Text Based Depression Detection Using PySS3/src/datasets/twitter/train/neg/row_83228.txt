My girlfriend found my noteIâ€™m to the point where Iâ€™m physically acting around everyone. My girlfriend found my note the other day. She always finds a way to find things that I donâ€™t want to be found yet. Iâ€™ve gone to keeping these notes on my person at all times. Iâ€™m able to convince her that Iâ€™m okay and â€œthat was awhile ago that I wrote those, Iâ€™m all better nowâ€. The worst thing is that all the acting is fucking sucking me dry. Anyway, nothing will change what Iâ€™m gonna do. Iâ€™m just pissed I have to act and eventually blow up, then boom Iâ€™m gonna be gone and everyone is gonna remember me as a dickhead instead of someone who loves them. It bothers me. I even made a video as a back-up, although Iâ€™m a sniffling bitch in it, it gets the point across how much I love everyone. Hopefully they find this too and get a little more info on my inconsistent mood lately. Anyway. Thanks. Bye.
