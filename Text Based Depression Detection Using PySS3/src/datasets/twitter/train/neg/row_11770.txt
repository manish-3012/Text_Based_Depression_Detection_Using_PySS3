I miss looking forward to the things in life to come.I miss the time in my life where I had reversible problems, and I had things to look forward to. I had goals. Now it just seems I'm coasting along in this shell of what my life used to be. I'm so over this, I haven't enjoyed my life in a very long time, with everything getting worse I just don't know what to do. Just the other day I was crossing a crosswalk and saw a car speeding across, without even thinking I walked faster to get in front of it. This really scares me, I wasn't even having suicidal thoughts, and I just... dove in front of it. I want to be happy again, but it seems the only time I'm ever slightly happy is alone distracting myself from my problems instead of dealing with them, making it worse. I hate everybody I know more day by day and I've lost the trust of everybody I care for and could talk to about my problems. Just typing into a screen instead of a friend helps me talk without bursting into tears. I'm sorry for my rambling. I'm just so lost in my head and don't know what to do...
