Please Help MeI don't know what to do. This is is. This is really it for me.

I want to die. The drugs aren't working, the counselling isn't working, I just feel worse and worse with every passing day. I really do not know how much more of this I can take. I am just not strong enough.

I'm at my parents' so I don't have access to the equipment for what I'd been planning, but I don't even care. I'm high enough up that I'm pretty sure the jump from the top floor balcony would do the job. I've been pacing it. Tried to call a friend to help me out of it, and they just yelled at me and got angry at me. Made me feel like they felt obligated to listen when they didn't want to. And then they hung up on me. Abandoned me when I needed them the most.

Fuck it. I am so fucking beyond hope.
My family would be upset. But I really don't think I have many options right now. I just want someone to tell me I'm worth saving. I want somebody to want me in their lives. I am tired of people pushing me away all the time, telling me I'm more effort than I'll ever be worth
