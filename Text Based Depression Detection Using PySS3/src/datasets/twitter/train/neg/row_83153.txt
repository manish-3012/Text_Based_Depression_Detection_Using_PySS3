My partner took his life three years ago and I haven't stopped thinking about it sinceI'll keep the back-story short. My partner of four years who I loved more than anything in the world, who showed me that I was loveable, and gave me hope in so many things.... ended his life nearly three years ago. I was 22, he was 26, and I came home from university (I'd only started 6 weeks previous) to find that he'd completed suicide.

At the time people kept telling me it would get better. But honestly I don't know that this could ever be better. I've carried on with my life and still feel utterly lost and empty, and scared that everything could be taken away from me again, with as little warning.

I'm still in uni - pre-med- I am in a relationship with a wonderful guy, I do a lot of volunteering, I have a beautiful little cat at home, I have my family and friends to think about. But it still can't take away the pain I still feel every day. It's crushing every morning when I wake up and it's still the last thing I think of each night. 

I just don't want my life to be like this. Between my past and a 10 year history of major depression, anorexia nervosa and OCD, it feels like far too much to deal with. Giving up seems so much easier. It's almost a comfort to think of.
