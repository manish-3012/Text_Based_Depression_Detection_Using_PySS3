He used to say I made him feel like a punching bagIf I was angry or bitchy when I got home.  So one day he snapped and he made sure I felt like one too.

I have a history of domestic abuse going back to my childhood.  Two years ago I was lucky enough to meet the first man in my life I genuinely thought would never hurt me like that.  It happening has torn me apart, I canâ€™t look at any man without fear in my heart.

I donâ€™t want to spend the rest of my life afraid like this, knowing heâ€™s out there, and he wonâ€™t even check on me.

His friend screamed at me that certainly I must have done something to deserve it.

I feel worthless, Iâ€™m so afraid.  I donâ€™t want to live another day like this.
