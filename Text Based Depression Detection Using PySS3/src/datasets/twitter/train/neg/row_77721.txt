I Have Nothing Left to Live for and I Need to Kill Myself ASAPI apologize as I've posted here before and I fear I'm the Boy Who Cried Wolf. I'm and the end and I have no idea how to reach out for any sort of help.

I am a complete failure. I've lost 15 pounds in the past few months because I hardly ever eat. I'm happy to eat half a sandwich during the day. I stuff my face with as much junk food as I can just to avoid starving to death. I can't even take basic care of myself.

I need to kill myself ASAP. Recently my business has stopped making significant profits. I'm a trader who works for himself and literally things suddenly dried up at the beginning of the summer. I really CAN'T work at an office job with others because I have a disability with sudden and unrelenting fatigue. I'm 25 years old but I don't see things turning around anytime soon. I will be severely disabled from MS in a few decades anyway. 

I have no friends (zero) with whom to enjoy life. No romantic partner (I completely lost interest over a year ago). I hardly ever leave my house and get enjoyment out of.. Nothing. This is a miserable existence and one the world will be glad to rid of.

I am a mistake - my mother wanted to have an abortion. She should have. I am of no value to anyone.

Thanks for reading my rant and I have rope to hang myself with (smart, for once). I SERIOUSLY hope I go through with it.

I have no idea how or where to reach out for help besides the rope.
