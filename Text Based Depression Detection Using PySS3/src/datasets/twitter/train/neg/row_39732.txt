That's it. That's all i had. I'm so sorry.1 pill.

I tried to inspire myself. Like most things i do, very few care, and that includes my own self. I do not have words or emotions to describe the rock i have hit. There is no other option than to take that rock, tie it to my feet, and attempt not to trip before I plunge. I will leave nothing behind. Maybe a faint memory of who i was and what i could have been.
