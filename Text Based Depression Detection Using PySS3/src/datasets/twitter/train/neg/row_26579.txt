My dad found out I told my mom that Iâ€™m suicidal and got pissed off at meI live with my dad, but I texted  my mom about how my dad makes me want to die. My mom became super worried, called the suicide hotline, and ended up having the cops come over. Iâ€™m assuming that my dad thinks Iâ€™m lying. I donâ€™t feel like writing out the details about what happened so Iâ€™ll try to sum up whatâ€™s been going on. After my dad found out that I told my mom I was suicidal he gets pissed off and starts yelling at me to get ready to leave. He starts saying he canâ€™t leave me home alone and that he has to take me everywhere with him so that I donâ€™t hurt myself. I tell him that Iâ€™m staying home, but he decides to physically drag me out of the house. He ends up pulling out my hair, pushing me down some stairs, and then squishing my foot in the car door. After we get back home he just acts like nothing happened. The next day (today) my mom told him how I took a bunch of Tylenol a few days ago. He gets pissed off again and starts messing up my room and claiming that heâ€™s looking for pills. After that I texted my mom. Then she tells me that he said that heâ€™s a good father because I havenâ€™t attempted suicide. Sorry if this post doesnâ€™t make sense I canâ€™t think properly right now
