Suicidal thoughts are backIâ€™m going to Hawaii in two weeks and I think I might kill myself there. 
I used to think about how killing myself would ruin my family and thatâ€™s why I never did it, but I honestly donâ€™t care anymore. My life is going nowhere. Iâ€™m lonely, I have no idea what I want to do with my life, lost all my best friends, lost my boyfriend, I have a shitty job. Prior to all of this I was in a super abusive relationship and was completely lost for a while after that. Life just isnâ€™t giving me a break, and I donâ€™t know what I did to deserve all of this. I look around me and everybody my age is living their life to the fullest and I have the saddest life a 20yr old could have. 

Hawaii is a nice place to die. Iâ€™d like to die there for sure. And I think Iâ€™m gonna do it
