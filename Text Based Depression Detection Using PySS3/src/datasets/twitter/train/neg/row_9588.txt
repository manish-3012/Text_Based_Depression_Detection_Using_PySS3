just lost my best friendlost my best friend that Iâ€™ve had for over a year now. She genuinely meant the world to me. I didnâ€™t have anyone in my life until i met her. I ruined our entire friendship because i was clingy. I needed attention, and i was really insecure. 

I didnâ€™t have friends until i met her. I didnâ€™t understand people the way i could have. And because of this i ruined everything. I felt the need to always be there if the group was hanging out. I felt the need to always be in the party on PlayStation if she was on. These feelings were completely unjustified, and fueled by my anxiety and insecurity. I couldnâ€™t help it. 

She was the only person who showed me genuine kindness. She genuinely cared for me. She was the first person Iâ€™ve ever hungout with. We hungout all the time too, playing games together, going out to eat. Just enjoying eachothers company. 

We actually met at work. Its where i opened up to her and we became really good friends. And because of this Iâ€™m afraid to go to work anymore. 


I canâ€™t process any of this. The first thing my mind jumped to was killing myself. I feel like my social and work life is over. I canâ€™t stop thinking about taking my life. I have no one else in my life. Im back to where i was before i had her in my life. Being alone.
