Iâ€™m just sick of being told I have persisted depression yet they donâ€™t want me to end my lifeWhatâ€™s the point of getting a treatment while theyâ€™re saying â€œthereâ€™s no cure to your depressionâ€. I donâ€™t want to live it. I want it to go away. I donâ€™t want to accept it like itâ€™s my personality. Depression tortures me. Suicide is the only reasonable way to end all of this. Iâ€™m sick of this world anyway.
