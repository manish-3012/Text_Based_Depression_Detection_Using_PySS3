I have been stuck in this deep sadness for to longHi. I'm a 14 year old freshman from washington. Since the middle of this year around October i have been in a state of mind i dont want to be in. To start, my first girlfriend broke u with me in the middle of october. I loved this girl so deeply and it confused me on why she ended it with me. Maybe i was just too attached or head over heels for her, but that one text crushed me. I remember that was the first time i cut myself. I still havent got over it. I got into another relationship a few months after that. Worst mistake i could have made. I started dating this girl for 7 months. This was the girl i lost my virginity too. I recently got scared that i was going to go through the same pain i did with the last girl. So i ended it. She later told me to go kill myself. So I tried. Last week I tried to shoot my self in the head. But I pussied out. So here I am now. I go to the therapist three times a week for evaluations. I take a shitload of pills that are making "happy", but they arent. They just make me more depressed. I have been planning on trying to kill myself one more time. So this is my last stretch for help. Thank you.
