Thoughts of suicideI'm going to start out this post by saying that I will probably end up comitting suicide later in my life when the time comes that I am ready to die. 14m

Right now, I kind of just feel like dying. I will list a few reasons why:

- Life just feels fake to me. Have you ever just took a good look at yourself, inspecting your hands and face just wondering "Why am I me? Why am I conscious as this person? How am I even here" It just makes no sense to me. Where were you before you were born? This just doesn't feel like reality.

- I am kind of on the side in my social life. I am socially awkward and I am never the first person people want to talk to. Around people I kind of know, I can act a little bit funny, but I am really just seen as annoying and a bother in the eyes of other people. When I don't go to school, people actually tell me they were glad I was absent. I honestly feel like people wouldn't even care if I killed myself. 

- I don't have anyone to talk about my personal thoughts to. I only have about 3 friends, and I don't discuss anything this deep to them. I hate how guys are supposed to be all strong and tough but really on the inside I am soft as cotten. I have never had an emotional conversation with anyone and I don't expect to.

- I'm shit at relationships. This one girl seemed to be giving me signs that she liked me, but when I would ask her out she would say she had plans. Her best friend hates me and tells me to go away if I try to talk to this girl. I really like her but I don't think she is interested in me anymore (if she ever even was). I can't ever see myself with another girl.

- I'm afraid of losing my parents or anyone that I care about. I can't go a day without thinking about this happening. If this ever did happen, I would definitely kill myself.

- No one ever wants to talk to me. I feel like each time I talk/text first, people just don't want to talk to me and that I am just an annoyance. I can go months without talking to anyone if I wanted to. As soon as I get home from school, I go upstairs to my computer and play video games. That is the only time I really ever talk to people, but it's only about strategies and such. I am definitely an introvert, and I spend all my time sitting in front of my computer. 

- I just want to be drunk/high all the time. It takes my thoughts away from this bullshit and makes me feel like I'm just floating around. I know it's a bad path but I honestly don't give a fuck at this point.

- I'm athiest and I'm afraid of coming out about this to my religious family. 

That's all.
