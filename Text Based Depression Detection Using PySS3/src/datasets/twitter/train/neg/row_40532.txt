I feel like slicing my stupid fucking neck.I've been thinking to myself for the last couple weeks, what is the point of continuing and suffering, when you can easily end the pain.

At the moment the thought of jumping infront of oncoming traffic tempting, I just dunno the thought of it just makes me feel a bit happier.

all my pain could go away, my misery life will be gone, no more jessica. would i be doing the world a favor most likely.

all it takes is 5 minutes of suffering to end all of my suffering and this miserable life of mine, i can easily walk across the road at any time and jump onto oncoming traffic it's just amazing.

or i could hurt myself badly with this knife, either way i deserve the pain.

i just don't give a shit, i die i hurt 4-5 people around me, they'll get over it. god this is so tempting atm.

just had to post this, my depression is getting bad to the point i can't even cope or function, i just want everything to end.

I could easily just off myself like that, nobody would give a fuck, isn't it amazing.

i've got a knife to my wrist hoping that i can slice though this stupid skin.
