Everything is supposed to be great but I'm miserable anywaysI'm not homeless, not jobless, not friendless but I feel empty

Nothing helps. Everyone tells me I'll feel better tommrow but it just keeps gstting worse. My parents have been sending money for my therapist but they want to stop because they say my life is great, so why am I sad?
I dont know. I have my dream job but every day all I can think about is killing myself. I call my friends and talk for hours but when I hang up I just feel lonely.

What's the point? It's all downhill from here. I have diagnosed depression but I cant get medicated because of my crippling health anxiety. I faint when I walk into the doctors office. Everyone laughs at me and tells me to grow up. 

My parents hate me I'm sure I'm just a burden. They might be sad for a day but then they'd be happy. My best friend wants to kill herself, I've been keeping her alive talking to her. But I feel like shit. Because I'm making to her all the false promises that were made to me. I tell her tommorow will be better. But it's not. It will never be better. At this point its cruel, we are both miserable. Wed both be happier dead.

The only thing that keeps me alive is my health anxiety. If my attempt failed and I rushed to the hospital, that's my worst fear. I dont have any hope. I've tried everything , but I've been miserable my whole life. Every single photo of me as a child or teen I am crying. 

I have to accept that I  wasn't built to live.
