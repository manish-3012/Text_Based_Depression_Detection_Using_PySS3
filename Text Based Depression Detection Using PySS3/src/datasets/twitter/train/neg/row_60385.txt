Today is my BirthdayIts 2 am in NY.  I have turned 34.  I have probably written 100+ posts to submit to this reddit.  And every time I go to submit my goodbye I end up over editing it...to the part where I feel better and simply copy/paste/save to my notepad.  I can't tell you how bad I've felt and how many different ways I've thought of leaving.  But I've been there.  Will still be there.  And I'm here because of this thread.  bless everyone (Lower case bless bc I dont care what religion or no religion).  Growing old is a blessing denied to many.  And I'll probably wake up obsessed with ending it because of my situation but I'll log in - check this thread.  And hold on.  Always hold on.  If you let go - that's it.  If you don't - who knows?  I'll take who knows all day.  Thank you all.  Cheers.
