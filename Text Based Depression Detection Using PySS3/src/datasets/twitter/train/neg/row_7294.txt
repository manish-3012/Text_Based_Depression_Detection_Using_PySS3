Death is better than living with your heartbrokenFor 3 years I have loved you with all of my heart, last year you broke my heart. And 2 months ago you broke it even more by getting into a relationship. I tired of drinking, drugs and cutting. Iâ€™m tired of crying 24/7 a whole year wasted, just wishing you would return my love. If heaven and hell is real, then weâ€™re already in hell.
