getting out of control...I am exhausted.. I am having a hard time staying awake...
But i want to say thanks... I never posted here... But the fact this exists gives me a sliver of hope.
If i make typo, sorry, i threw my phone and cracked the screen
My best friend pointed out he believes i am slipping into depression.
Then i notice things... Like when im depressed.. I become an adrenaline junkie.. I try to pick fights..

I found myself saying out loud, "i hate my life, i hate my life, i hate my life... Why can t this end.. Then i am writing my to do list for tomorrow and i started writing get heko and find a reason to live, or quit.

So, i need help. I am going into the hospital tomorrow.. Afyet sleep tonight and work.
I was on meds... I use to be better... So i know i can be better.

I hate that i put work and everything else ahead of myself and my mental health.. I know. Without my mental health in tact, i wont. Have anything.. No job.. House.. Anythin.

I know its illogical... But i hate myself and i dont like feeling this way.

I will post tomoriow when i have slept and can write properly.

Thank you guys
