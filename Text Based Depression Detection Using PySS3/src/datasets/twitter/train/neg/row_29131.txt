I never really liked my life anyway.I think the thing I hated most about life was the fact that I didn't have what it took to achieve any of the goals I set for myself. Even basic shit like go to college I couldn't even do that. Everything was so stagnate, if it did change it always changed for the worst. I'm fed up with waking up everyday and dealing with my failures. I asked for help and all people can do is point the finger at me. Well fuck world I know I'm a failure. You don't have to keep telling me over and over again. Every time I see something I want I know it's outside my reach. The stuff I want the most is just impossible to get back. My Dad's been dead so long I can't even remember what he sounds like. I don't even like to think about how my Mom was murdered. It haunts me everyday. 

I'm just done with this world. I hate being here on this planet. I don't like place or the company it keeps. 

I just want it all to end, I have no interest in talking to any therapist or doctor or really anyone all together. You've all had your chance to help me and failed, just like I did at life. Soon I'll be dead and none of this will matter.
