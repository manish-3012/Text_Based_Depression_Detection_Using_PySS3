(Iâ€™m safe and not doing anything) I just get these thoughts of putting a gun to my head more and more. Iâ€™m not suicidal but concerned. Help?Iâ€™ve been having insane anger issues this last year especially. I have this reoccurring thought of putting a gun to my right temple and pulling the trigger. Always the same thought. Never anything different. A year ago I had the key to my gun cabinet in my had ready to pull out a pistol but put it back and cried and didnâ€™t tell anyone. I tried therapy online and going to try telehealth with a real therapy office. Iâ€™m just so full of anger and it feels like everything I succeed at I need to fight tooth and nail. It feels like everyoneâ€™s out to get me and Iâ€™ve had to stand up for myself to often recently. People have tried to talk down to me and I corrected them and blocked them from my life. I need the least amount of stress possible and need to be treated with respect that I wasnâ€™t given or even able to talk with these people Iâ€™ve had issues. Iâ€™m just scared about this reoccurring thought because I donâ€™t want to kill my self I have a lot of great things in my life. I am just depressed and itâ€™s hard to enjoy all the bright things and successes when youâ€™re getting kicked while youâ€™re down whenever possible. Any thoughts?
