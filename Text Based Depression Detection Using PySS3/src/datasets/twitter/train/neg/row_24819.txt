Ways to die quicklyAnyone have any suggestions? If I already hate my life at such a young age, how am I supposed to get better when I'm older? I try to be nice to people and be a good friend but all of my friends have left me and never cared about my feelings. No one has given two shits about me. I can't even do my job correctly. It gets harder everyday and I sure as hell don't feel appreciated. I feel like everyday keeps repeating, but I'm getting older and slower and forgetting more things. Fuck this.
