What do I do?My father is old, 75. He's having anxiety and panic attacks, his speech is slowing down. A year ago he was completely fine but now he's slipping fast. I have no good answers, but each time he has an attack it is so heartbreaking and painful that all I can think about is putting him to rest and then taking myself out for being such a goddamned monster. I wish I could give him my life, god knows I've squandered the life I have. Someone please help.
