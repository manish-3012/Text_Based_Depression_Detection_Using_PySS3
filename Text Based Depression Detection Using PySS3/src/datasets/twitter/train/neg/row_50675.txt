Just tried to hang myselfToo nervous to go all the way.

I've suffered from depression for more than a decade now, my entire adult life. I've tried to do the things which make people happy but they don't help, then the depression just eats away at them.

I've had good friendships, good jobs and a great long-lasting relationship. I work hard to get them but none of them have made a bit of difference and now they just decay and fall apart.

There is no source of joy in my life, what's so wrong with wanting to end it?
