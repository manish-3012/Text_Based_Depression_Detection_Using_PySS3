Considering suicide as only way out of money problemsI really don't want to go into too much detail and the title says it all.

I've been a stupid fucking idiot and have amassed so much debt. Payday loans and the like.

My parents can't help me any more and I've nobody else to turn to. I can't face all of this mounting debt and I can't pay the huge arrears I owe. I'm 4 months behind on rent and the landlord is looking to evict me.

I really just want to end it all and not have to worry about money. I feel bad for my parents because they tried. But this is just too much for me. I feel so depressed each day and I can hardly sleep at night. 7

It's all my own fault because I was so stupid but I just want to end it and not need to worry. That seems like such a good option. I've considered this for a while but now the reality has kicked in and I know I can't pay so I just want to end it.
