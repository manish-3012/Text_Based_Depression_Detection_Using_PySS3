I can barely sleep at night because I feel so alone, and this is the time where I'm usually suicidalIt's been going on for awhile now, and I don't know what to do. I can't tell a therapist because I know that they're going to throw me into a psychiatric hospital. I'm really just feeling out of place. Not in terms of just loneliness, I don't feel like I belong here. It just follows me. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm practically destroying myself. Self destruction is pretty much what I'm doing at this point. So here's to the feelings of perpetual loneliness keeping me up again.
