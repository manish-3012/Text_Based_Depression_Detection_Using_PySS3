[UPDATE] 2 years later. Post-suicide attempt: When do things get okay again?This week is special to me. It was one of the worst times of my life, but also one of the experiences I am most grateful for. I learned to be ok with things that were out of my control, and I learned to be ok with myself. Things were never the same after the time I spent in the psych ward, and that's a good thing. 


2 years later, I am in a wonderful relationship. I have amazing friends. I am pursuing the career I've always wanted. When things are looking shitty, I can say with honesty "I am glad to be alive" and that always makes me laugh because I never thought I would say that. 
I've had a few relapses. It hasn't been without its struggles. I'm still on meds and I think I always will be. 

I have been reflecting on my evolution, my pain, my history and remembered that I had made this throwaway so I decided to check it. I can see how badly I was hurting and I wanted to thank you all for helping me, for taking the time to reply, for sharing your stories. 
For all of you going through the rough patches right now, hang on. It's worth it. I know it totally doesn't seem that way, but eventually one day you wake up happy to be alive and that thought is so absurd it makes you laugh. 

-love, 

OP:
&gt; I suffer from depression and had a dissociative episode. I left a note, tried to commit suicide and called my father at the last minute crying. Then, in a true dissociative haze, I tried again. I was taken to the ER, and spent time in the psych ward. I guess that I am asking if things are ever going to be okay again. To a superficial observer, I have a great social life, decent job, lovely family. I'm cute and I laugh often. I'm so weighted though. I'm afraid I'll never be okay again, and really, how can I be okay when I tried to kill myself? EDIT- worth noting, I haven't been able to speak with anyone who has gone through a similar situation, and I really really just want to know.
