Worn outI l am extremely tired of life, I'm not even sad, I'm just bored of living. I'm 17 and am not looking forward to the monotony of adulthood. I've struggled with major depression for the past  two years, and they've just left me feeling apathetic and empty. I told my parents about a half of a year ago and they said they'd help but seem to have just forgotten. I seem like a happy person to people around me buts it's mostly a facade. I don't want to hurt anybody but I also don't want to live anymore
