goodbyeas soon as my parents and sister are asleep, i'm going to drink perfume and hopefully end it. if thats not enough, i have lotion, too. and shampoo. i hope it works.
if i make it through, my parents would need to pay again for me to be hospitalized. i don't want them to waste anymore money on me.
