I'm just sick of being alone. Life isn't worth living by myself.I'm not old (27) but, in my entire life, I've never met someone I can relate to. I'm not deluded enough to think it's because I'm in any way better or unique but whatever the reasons are, the fact remains that I'm utterly alone. Occasionally I'll see a post on r/bisexual or r/2meirl4meirl that is particularly relatable but that doesn't translate into real life.

I want to meet a person that I can deal with being around for extended periods of time. It's not even that I don't like people. I fucking love people. I root for humanity at every turn and generally get along with the people I'm forced to be around (family and coworkers). But it never translates into a true friendship. 

I've never been an important person to someone (other than family). I even lived with a girlfriend for a year but, looking back, I never felt comfortable around her and it was purely a highschool infatuation brought into reality.
