Depressed over a girlOkay, someone said I should post here, so...

Well, there's this girl, ya see, and, well, like all other girls I have ever had an interest in...I know I'll get rejected. It's just, it sucks. Every fucking time I get rejected, every fucking time. Then I meet another girl, quit caring about the last girl, get rejected again, go back to the last girl, and then really meet someone else who will reject me, I fucking hate this. This isn't my only problem but the only I feel like mentioning. So, the current girl, I just fucking know it, I mean, she's attractive, popular, has a bunch of other guys to talk to, and always takes hours to respond to my texts, this fucking sucks, every time I meet someone else that happens, this time I can't even get to know the damn girl. What's worse is that I'm starting to get close to the last girl I was into and I'm scared. I know she really cares about me, hell, more than most people, the thing is, I don't want to develop feelings for her again, except I don't know who else to talk to. Basically, I'm screwed. Jeez, this fucking sucks.

I posted here because I'm tired of feeling all of my extreme emotions and need an out, except the only out I really know to my emotions and depression is from the top of a building.
