An argument for death that became my hopes for life as I wrote it...So, I'm 20 years old, bisexual, non-binary, and have been living with depression for close to three years now. All that time I've had suicidal thoughts but thankfully have managed to avoid acting on them but they keep coming back.

My thinking is always the same and goes something like this.
- Life right now is hard work and not very enjoyable
- My partner of two years left me last September and I'm no closer to finding someone new
- Right now I'm a student so I don't even have the stress of doing a job or worrying about my finances
- Therefore life is almost certainly only going to get harder
- The end point of life for everyone is to die eventually
- So if the journey is going to be hard and the end point is death, then why not skip to the end and just die now?

I used to have so much hope for my life, I was pretty smart, got good grades, was fairly popular (at least amongst people who didn't mind my eccentricity), but since starting uni I've become depressed, I often lack energy, my grades are slipping and I've lost all hope of a high flying career so now I'm planning to just survive, but somehow that life plan doesn't seem like one that's worth living.
I don't have a lot of money, if I did I would go traveling or spend my days in cute coffee shops, searching for inspiration to write or design or somehow be creative, but that all seems out of reach because I need to find a way to make money and live.
I hope it gets better and in writing this I have cleared my thoughts a bit, but I know they'll be back. It might be later today, it might be next week, but they'll be back one day and I'll have to fight them off again...
