anyone want a free steam account?i have a steam account which has 7 days to die, rainbow six ultimate edition, and terraria (and another copy in my inventory to give to your friend?) :) i haven't played much as i played csgo a lot but bought these last december. i thought it would be a great move to give it as im giving all my stuff away. i've already made my letter, i didn't write it physically, it's all scheduled to be sent to my parents and some friends by 12 am tuesday. i'm planning to kill myself tomorrow and already found the opportunity to go. please don't convince me not to, i'm too much of a burden already so i just want to know i made a impact on this world, although small, before i go :))
msg me so i can give the account.stay safe everyone! goodbye :)
