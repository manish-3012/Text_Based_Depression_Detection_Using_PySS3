My pain is all in my head, and I want to express it some howA few months ago, I was drinking alone and was almost at my breaking point. All this pain and loneliness and despair... And it's tiring to just keep it bottled up in my head, as if it doesn't really exist, and is just a fleeting thought or feeling like any other. I wanted to start smashing things up in my apartment and calling the police or health services on myself. Anything to get my pain out and have it recognized. Of course, I didn't do anything, and instead laid on the floor crying for an hour.

It's not that I want to die; it's that I want to kill myself, as a first and final way of expressing my pain.
