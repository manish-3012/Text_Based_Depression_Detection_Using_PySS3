I made a leap of faith today. I also need some advice.I said I'd follow if one of my friends killed herself. That got her not to do it, now we have time to solve her problems.  
She is almost 15 and was dating a girl online, they have been together for close to a year, and she meant the world to her. But today the two broke up.

She keeps saying how she needs her to be happy, and how she doesn't want anyone else. How can I help with this?

She was isolating herself a while ago and went out of all the groups and was blocking people, luckily she re-joined.     I told her to distract herself for a bit, as that seems like the best thing to do right now, to take it slow.

What do I do to help her?
