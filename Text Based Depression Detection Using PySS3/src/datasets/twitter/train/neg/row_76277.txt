DoneI donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m here. I guess I like reading about how others are the same. I donâ€™t even cry about it anymore, Iâ€™ve been numb so long god knows. Iâ€™m 30 and Iâ€™ve wanted to do it since I was 14. On and off meds that helped for a while and didnâ€™t. I was in bed for 3.5 years, 95 lbs and nearly quit, Iâ€™m a high school drop out but became an entrepreneur. I Recommitted to life, Iâ€™m successful now. Earn great money at a job with growth trajectory and flexibility. Iâ€™m engaged. Not fair on him. It doesnâ€™t ducking matter. I still want to die. Suicide isnâ€™t a huge emotion or traumatic idea for me, I just want to go. I canâ€™t be the only one. I also care for animals and have great empathy for other humans suffering. I still want to go. I want to donate myself to science and give my money to charity. Am I fucking crazy? Maybe. But there is this constant. I always have a peace about leaving. I donâ€™t want to be human. Someone please recycle me.
