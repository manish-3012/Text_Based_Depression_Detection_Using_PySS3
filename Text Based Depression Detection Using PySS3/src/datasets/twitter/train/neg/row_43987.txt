I'd ask for help but i don't care anymoreI am not sure why i am even writing here. Life might be good for some, alas, i am not one of them. I have tried to end this sick joke a couple of times already in the past months, but all those attempts were a spur of the moment kind of thing. The fact that noone gives a shit isn't even enough to push me over the edge anymore, which is very frustrating in and of itself. I wish i had the willpower to consciously make the leap.
