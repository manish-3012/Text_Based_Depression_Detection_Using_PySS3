Are near constant thoughts of suicide with no intentions of acting on them normal?For the longest time, I've always imagined scenarios of killing myself. Gunshot seems to be my preferred method, though I know I never will actually commit to it for various reasons.

However, nearly every time I swing into my depression modes, I think of suicide. I know I won't do anything about it, but the thought always lingers, sometimes strong, sometimes just an afterthought. I've heard that considering suicide is a sign of a disorder or something, though I feel normal. I don't feel crazy or broken, just sad a lot with that extra caveat of visions of hanging myself, OD'ing on asprin, or blowing my brains out at the thought of being a lonely failure for the rest of my life.

I'm not sure if this is the place to ask this kind of question, but I suppose yall would be the experts. Thanks.
