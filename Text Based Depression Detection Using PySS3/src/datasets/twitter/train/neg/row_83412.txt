I want to kill myself, and that's alright.It's ok. It's ok for me to want to kill myself. I have come to terms with that. I have been feeling this way since, well, oddly enough, exactly one year ago, December 21st 2017... Its weird that I realize this while typing but its really disappointing that I haven't done it yet. I have already set a date, next month, I want to get through Christmas first, for my family. I don't know what this post's point is, I guess I am just writing what I am thinking so if someone reads it it gives the monologue inside my head meaning. Simply put, I am ugly, I am untalented, I have no future prospects, and the girl I love is with someone else. She was the one who spawned this feeling last year, when I told her I liked her. I read that a relatively large percentage of suicides are caused by romantic love, and that's comforting. I think about her every second of everyday, the idea of her keeps me going. And tonight I realized we can never be together because she does not want someone like me. So I am going to kill myself next month, and thats ok, its okay that I can't beat it.
