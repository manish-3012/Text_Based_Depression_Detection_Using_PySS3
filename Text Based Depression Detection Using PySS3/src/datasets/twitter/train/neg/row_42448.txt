Need help, struggling with economy still and no motivation leftCopying what I wrote in another subreddit

So to start the story, I was a gambling addict before and have around 30-40k in debt thanks to it. I haven't gambled for a year but my job hasn't been great pay so I've been living poor every single month. Now I may have fucked up big time and I won't have any money left for food, rent and bills because I didn't get much work last month. I didnt think about it much until today when I saw the money on my account, I am completely fucked no matter what I do now. I cant loan from any banks obviously and no friends or family to loan from so that makes this even more fucked. I have an extra job now so I work full time but it's a little to late since it will start in January and I cant go 2 months without food lol. I cant buy my gf a Christmas gift and I dont know how to explain it since we've been together 5 years on new year's eve. I'm gonna start working every single day in January till my situation is fixed (no off days until March) to get back on track but I have no motivation to continue with this anymore. I thought about ending my life but cant do it around Christmas time and I cant do it either because I owe my mother 20k, so what the fuck do I do
