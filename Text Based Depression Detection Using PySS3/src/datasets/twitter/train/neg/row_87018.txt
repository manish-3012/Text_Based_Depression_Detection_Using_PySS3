There's no reason to live a lonely lifeI'm at a loss. I have friends, a job, a college education, a few assets and little debt.

This is meaningless as not having money and having money has not changed my life at all in ways I feel matter.

I've been very very poor before, like sleeping under a tent I stitched together from dirty blankets that were either donated or I took from the garbage.

$23,000 dollars was enough to get me not poor and into the working class.

But it hasn't changed my romantic life in the slightest. I'm a virgin at 24 years old, even my friends who are other socially awkward people have had one partner.

You're not supposed to compare but it's human nature a little bit I think.

I'm not ugly, maybe slightly under average height, but I'm not fat. I easily envision hitting the age of 60 and still being a virgin who only understood how to make money.

I attribute value to others because I'm a human. I want to be respected and loved by at least one other person of the opposite sex. I would like a family later in life.

I suppose I'm just trapped in my own head.

I don't even really believe advice from here or online can help me. I don't value online interactions.

They lack social immediacy and intimacy. They don't feel real or impactful.

I don't know. I imagine you'll all tell me to keep going to therapy but it's largely been spinning my wheels.

I'll be alone because I'm afraid to be vulnerable and put myself out there.

I think I'll end myself anyways 

Life hurts
