The bad guy never wins.These days are heavy. Not only with doubt and self resentment, but with responsibility and worry too. Suicide isn't hard to think or imagine about, but the word is like poison to everyones ears. I have tried my whole life to escape the stigmatism of me being garbage, due to my parents bad choices. I have not succeeded. I don't think i ever will, because in every picture i am the bad guy. I help my siblings strive for survival in a world that WANTS us gone. The emotional drain is so severe that some days i wonder if this is real. I don't even need drugs or alcohol to have an out-of-body experience; I'm detached every day. This message might seem chaotic, i apologise, but so are my thoughts at this time.
I know that if i died this night, tomorrows sun would rise all the same and the world would turn with it. So why does this all seem so pointless? Why does it all seem so surreal at times?
I get that my life could be worse- or so I'm told. But i don't live those lives, i live this one.
And in this life the bad guy doesn't win.
