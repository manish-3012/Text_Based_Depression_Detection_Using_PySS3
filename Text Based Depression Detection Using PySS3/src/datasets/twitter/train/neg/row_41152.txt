I wish I could kill myself without having to worry about who Iâ€™m leaving behind.I have an okay life I guess. It could be worse. But I just donâ€™t want to do this anymore.

Tomorrow is my one year anniversary with the love of my life. Heâ€™s absolutely everything to me and in no way do I deserve him. Heâ€™s so supportive and caring, but Iâ€™ve been so emotionally abused that I have a hard time accepting love from others. 

My cat is so dependent on me, he only loves me really. I donâ€™t want to leave him behind. Heâ€™s so soft. I wish he was more cuddly, but heâ€™s still my little brat. Do you think he would know what I did to myself?

I feel so alone. I wish I had more friends and I wish people liked me. I wish I didnâ€™t have to get high in order to feel something other than panic all the time. I wish I could love myself like they want me to. I wish I could just drop off the face of the planet. I wish that Tylenol overdose was as easy as it sounds. 

But it isnâ€™t. And I am alone. And I did screw myself over. If only I had kept my mouth shut about what happened to me years ago, maybe I wouldnâ€™t want to kill myself. Maybe I wouldnâ€™t be thinking of a way to tell my lover that Iâ€™m going to end my life. Maybe I wouldnâ€™t be trying to figure out how our cats can stay together. Maybe I wouldnâ€™t need to write this post.
