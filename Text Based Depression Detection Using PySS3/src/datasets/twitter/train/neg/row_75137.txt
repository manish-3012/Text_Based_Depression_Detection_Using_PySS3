Iâ€™m back again. At the end of the roadI made it another empty, hollow month. I donâ€™t know if I can take any more of it. Iâ€™m teetering on the edge, because of all of the reasons, and more from my last post. Iâ€™m just stuck, and canâ€™t stop myself from wanting to just act in these thoughts and end it all.
