Art can help peopleI didn't think it could, I got in a very bad spot, in and out of hospitals, and a lot of self harm and attempts at my own life, unhealthy coping mechanisms, and I was pretty sure things weren't gonna get better, I still feel that way, but I've found an outlet, talk to your friends, I don't mean tell them about your issues, at least the ones that they can't help with, especially younger people, I've put a lot of my friends through grief because I realized too late that I was actually hurting them, but I found my outlet, music, I used to play guitar, but gave it up after it broke, and I haven't played since, but i picked up a keyboard piano recently and started learning, and found it quite helpful, a creative way to relax and out your mind towards something positive, it might not work for everyone, but it's worth a shot
