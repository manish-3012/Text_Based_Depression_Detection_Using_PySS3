I tried to kill myself, it didn't work. Now what?I'm sixteen, no friends, never talk to anybody, rarely leave the house and am years behind in school. Suicide honestly seems more merciful than anything at this point. I have been depressed and anxious my whole life and suffered from dissociative disorders ever since I was little. I just want to know the least painful way to do it that will actually work. Please help me. I just want this misery to end.
