I was supposed to be dead... and Iâ€™m not... and Iâ€™m to blame...When I was 16 I was hospitalized with severe anorexia... 66lbs.. I wasnâ€™t supposed to survive.. but I did.. and my good friend died instead from suicide.. and all the adults.. my best friends parents... along with most of the kids that didnâ€™t even know us said it should have been me... that it was supposed to be me... and I feel so much guilt.. so much pain everyday for being alive when he isnâ€™t... I donâ€™t know how to live.. even five years later.. I feel so guilty..
