Everyday im losing my will to live a little bit moreI feel like im at my lowest, but i know it will get much, much worse from here. 
Things that used to make me happy are now nothing to me, in the past when i was feeling suicidel i was always reminding myself of the things that i love, but now it doesnt work anymore, like i got numb, and empty.
Suddenly every time something good happens to me, i dont feel anything, But everytime something bad happens to me, it adds a brand new reason to kill myself, i cant take it anymore, everyday this feeling of emptiness gets 1000x stronger.
