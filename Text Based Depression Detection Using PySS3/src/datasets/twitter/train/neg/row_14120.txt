My penia size is destroying me mentallyHello folks,

Right off the bat my problem is obviously my penis size. It has plagued me for a while now and I broke up with my girlfriend because I was too anxious to have any kind of sexual fun with her. I have become so anxious about my size and it is dictating my behavior around girls. I just can't imagine having sex or having a relationship because I would not be able to please my SO. I am holding up quite well despite my shitty self esteem and anxiety. I have decided to either quit life altogether and give up or to live life in celibacy. 

Women want bigger dicks, it has always been this way. Every post on this topic has comments like "Size doesn't matter that much!" or "It is how you use it!" but they are all lies. Sure some may actually prefer smaller ones but the majority of women want big dicks. There are quite a few posts on women forums about having encounters with small dicks and how a small dick will never satisfy them. This always brings great pain to my heart and I always feel like I am worthless. The only reason I am here on earth is to create more life and I am shit at picking up girls anyways. If I ever pick up a girl they will probably leave when they see my penis for the first time. I've read countless stories of men who have had terrible experiences with women. They leave them, make fun of them or even out their penis size to their friends. 

I can't take this anymore. I am always told to "compensate" but a Ferrari will always be faster than a Smart. Of course if the Ferrari crashes the Smart wins, but have a somewhat decent driver in both and the Smart will never have a chance. Compensation is just such a shit expression overall. 

Anyways, if you've made it this far I am glad that you read it. I hope I didn't waste your time. I will live my life in celibacy until I finish my last semester at high school before I kill myself over the summer break. Classmates will be less shocked I hope.
