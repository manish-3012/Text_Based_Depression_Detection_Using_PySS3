Numb* I've been suicidal for quite a while now which, I think stems from regrets and fears especially one about me never being able to succeed in life (I'm jobless now) 
* I feel like there's not a day went by that I didn't think about slitting my wrist this year. 
* I used to feel immense pain when I'm upset or really sad but it's gradually disappearing. Most of the time now, I just feel dead inside or numb even when my mind is in chaos. I learn not to depend on people to improve my mood anymore so I force myself to find happiness online whenever I get overwhelmed by my feelings. (in form of Youtube videos or online gaming)
* They usually work but it's taking more time to feel better now.
