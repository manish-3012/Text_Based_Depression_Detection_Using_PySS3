I just feel helplessSometimes, I'll just be trying to do things that make me happy, such as drawing, watching old movies, playing with my dogs, and it always just feels primative, small, unworth the while.

I'm currently on anti-depressants but I still feel down on days. If I accidentally miss a pill I have no motivation to take it for the next several days, get out of bed, and take care of myself hygienically.

There's only one person I'm really staying alive for and, he's been out of the picture for too long now, and I don't know what to do.

He always tells me what a miserable person I am, and I'm just now really starting to see that he's right, that I'm never happy.

I feel helpless, I'm too timid to do anything by myself or talk to anyone about this. I stopped therapy in February and I don't want to go back,  but I feel like I need to.

I'm 17, and living with my sick mother and mentally ill/unstable father who refuses to be on meds. Who do I talk to? What do I do? I want to feel happy, and change, but can't right now.

And who knows how much more of this I can take.
