Eating feels like a chore.Over the past week or two. Iâ€™ve just lost my appetite. Iâ€™m actually beginning to hate food. So, Iâ€™ve been eating under 800 cal everyday. 
Iâ€™ve started to feel tired and weaker. 
Sometimes I feel slightly lightheaded or like I may pass out if I continue to stand. 
Everyday I feel myself getting worse.
My depression is just darkening, even in my dreams I kill myself. Then I wake up, wishing that the dream was real. 
I honestly feel that there is no getting better.
Iâ€™m a goner.
