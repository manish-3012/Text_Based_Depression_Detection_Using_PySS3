Too late?Im, 23, living in Italy, unskilled worker, big failure, lives in his moms basement. I speak German (mother tongue), Italian and English. Where should I move to have a chance for a restart, because its apparently impossible at my age to have a "clean break". Do society and corporations force me into suicide now, because I had a bad start?
