nothing feels real anymore lolidk what to do. i feel so tired of everything. nothing is how it used to be and im never genuinely happy anymore. i feel gross and trapped inside this meat of a body. yucky. i dont have the balls to commit suicide but who knows, im spontaneous. like who cares anyways right? you do it and its done. no worrying after, nothing.
