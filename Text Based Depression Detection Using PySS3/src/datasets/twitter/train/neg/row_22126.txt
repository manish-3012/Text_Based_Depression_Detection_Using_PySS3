Pathetic attempt @ suicide.I tried to stab myself I guess with a kitchen knife (which was a stupid plan because that thing couldn't even pierce a pillow). My bf called the police and they took me to a psychiatric hospital but the lady there said she "wasn't convinced I wanted to die" and said I could go home if my bf promised to stay with me that night. When he left in the morning I tried to slit my wrists. My legs were like slick with blood and I felt faint but I was still just. Alive. Now my bf is crying all the time, talking about how awful it was for him that I wanted to die (shouldn't I be the one crying???) and calling me 32 times if I don't answer his messages within like 10 minutes and I'm getting REALLY TIRED of babying him when I am the one who feels like I cannot live.  Every time I hear sirens outside my window I panic that he called the police again. I cannot listen to music without feeling pain. I cannot do anything without thinking about how I'll never have even one second of happiness ever again after this attempt. I wish I had died. Should have tried harder.
