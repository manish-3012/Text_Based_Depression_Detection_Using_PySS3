This may sound stupid but I really need some encouraging words.I have a bunch of economic problems going on right now, aside from having several mental illnesses. On top of all that, I recently seem to have developed some sort of lymphoma- it's probably in stage II or III. I don't have the funds to treat it. It wouldn't be so bad if it didn't press down onto my carotid arteries/larynx constantly in a way that is painful. It doesn't help how suicidal I already am at the moment- am thinking of jumping off my balcony tonight, it's *that* bad. I just turned 21, what the fuck. I have no diploma so nobody wants to hire me which would give me chances to solve all of my issues but no. I didn't ask to be traumatized by my parents. I didn't ask to get sick. I don't even have painkillers on me to help the pain. I am getting lightheaded constantly and the pain is like being pinched constantly. I can't do this.
