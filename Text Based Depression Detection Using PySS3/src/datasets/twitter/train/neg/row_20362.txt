IM SO HAPPY Y AHA HAAHoh I can't wait, to stream my suicide, I really can't wait, time is ticking so fast,  I've seen so many miseries and death to the point where I'm completely numb to it, I've seen is world for what it really is, people encouraging me to kill myself, "Do it" "I bet you won't", it all seems so kind that people actually notice my existence for once, oh what great friends I have, such pitiful creatures, I can't wait to let them watch my neck slice open for them all to see while smiling at them with bright smile, I can't wait for that lingering pain to flow through my body, I can't wait for my parents to come home seeing their daughter on the floor rotting  while maggots slowly devour her body, ahhshahhshshsahahaaaha i rea llyy can
