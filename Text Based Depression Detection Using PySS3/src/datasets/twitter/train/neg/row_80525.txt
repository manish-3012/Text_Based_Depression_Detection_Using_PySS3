shameA coworker has been dealing with a difficult situation.  Their spouse has a variety of serious medical conditions that have resulted in slowly deteriorating health over the pat year or so.

The stress of the situation is taking a toll on them and they often appear very sad and despondent while at work.  Recently, they confided in me that the spouse was considering suicide due to the chronic pain that they were experiencing as a result of the medical conditions and treatments they were receiving.

I don't remember the rest of the conversation but I do remember at that moment feeling very uncomfortable.  I was uncomfortable because I felt exposed.  I felt that she knew that I understood the spouse's desire to commit suicide and often consider ending my life on a weekly basis.  It was clear from that moment that I still feel shame for my mental illness.  That I feel like it is something that I need to hide from the world for fear that they will judge and ostracize me.

It is my hope that the spouse can find their way to this sub so that they can express themselves and receive the empathy and support from our community that they deserve in their time of need.
