Psychological questionnaires are weirdâ€œOn a scale of 1 to 10, how strong are your suicidal thoughts?â€ 
Doesnâ€™t sound like a specific question at all, then the psychologist tried to clarify for me â€œ1 is not strong and 10 is extremely strongâ€, thanks thatâ€™s helpful. 

â€œDo you have thoughts of self-harm?â€
â€œDo you have thoughts of suicide?â€ 
I answered â€œyesâ€ to both, then got ten minutes of confused questioning about self-harm. 

Well, if Iâ€™m thinking about killing myself then obviously Iâ€™m thinking about harming myself, rightttt???
