How is a person supposed to cope with knowing they'll eventually kill themselves?I'm not suicidal right now, but I've known for a while that it's how I'm going to expire. I don't know when I'll do it or what the exact catalyst will be. It could be tommorow or it could be 50 years in the future. Sometimes I feel it coming. Does anyone else ever get this sensation of longterm pragmatic suicidal thinking? How is it supposed to be dealt with? Sometimes it scares me...
