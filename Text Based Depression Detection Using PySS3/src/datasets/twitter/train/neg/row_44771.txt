Bf wants to die, so do i.Weâ€™re both depressed as shit. Previous suicide attempts. I could honestly go on with him by my side if he was okay. He canâ€™t work a job or go out or eat barely. Heâ€™s stopped self harming because he canâ€™t even feel pain anymore. I still have my emotions and I can cry and whatnot but I canâ€™t go on without him. He has saved my life before, he gives me a will to live. 

I know itâ€™s toxic. I donâ€™t have friends and Iâ€™ve given up so donâ€™t tell me to keep looking, thereâ€™s no shared values or connections. I always hear â€˜after a breakup it feels impossible but you will move on.â€™ And iâ€™ve been through that with my ex. I tried killing myself multiple times and though e dated for 7 months it took me a year to get over him, and fuck was it painful it destroyed me. I know I canâ€™t go through that same pain of losing someone again, and plus this time it would be 10000x worse. He means the world to me. If a dog is suffering so much youâ€™d put him out of his misery, my quality of life wonâ€™t be livable. Iâ€™m considering a double suicide or some shit right now. I feel so guilty watching him in agony and itâ€™s tearing us both down. The worst part is weâ€™re still so in love but thatâ€™s not enough to keep holding on. My choice is breakup with him and I know heâ€™d kill himself. Or if I stay with him until he eventually does, thereâ€™s not way Iâ€™d be able to go on. Sure itâ€™s co-dependant but when life is awful heâ€™s the only good thing. I canâ€™t stop crying and panicking and i canâ€™t fucking breathe. 

All I can picture is us lying down in a bed and dying together. I promise Iâ€™m not romanticizing it, it scares the shit out of me that this thought is the only thing soothing me. I donâ€™t know how weâ€™d do it. My worst fear is us overdosing and me surviving and seeing him dead. Weâ€™ve been through hospitals and psych wards, everything always comes back down. Itâ€™s been years and nothing has changed. I need a way we can both leave consciousness.
