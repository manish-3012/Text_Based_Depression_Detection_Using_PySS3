The only reason I'm alive right now is because I'm too much of a coward to end it.I feel like a fraud for even posting here, but I'm a teenager with a totally normal life, but I'm an asshole. I hate myself, maybe one person would feel sorta sad if I died, and the only reason I haven't killed myself is that I'm scared of it not succeeding, or of it hurting, or changing my mind. I go through periods of time where I love my life, and periods where there's no point to anything. I hate myself that loves my life and I hate myself now. I'm an coward who shouldn't be allowed to live. I hope you can fix me.
