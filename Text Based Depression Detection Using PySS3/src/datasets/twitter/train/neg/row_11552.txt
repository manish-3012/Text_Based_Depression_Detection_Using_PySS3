You do not know the future and you haven't yet opened all doors.A knowledge i wished i posessed sooner. You see majority of people at least once have a suicidical thought. It is natural but it depends on if the thought becomes an action. In my case, i usually was visiuliazing it but at some times i got close. 

The thing is no one knows the future and no one knows what comes so that alone in itself shows how suicide never is an option. Sit back and wait. Keep fighting. Really i wished i have kept fighting.  I have kept sitting back. We will die one day anyway so why go through all the trouble and kill yourself. Why not feel proud for keep staying strong and moving on.
