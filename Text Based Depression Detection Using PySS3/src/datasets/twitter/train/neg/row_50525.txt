I feel like I have literally no one to talk to.My best friend is in the mental hospital. My boyfriend got so upset today over spilling a beer he punched a hole in the wall. Iâ€™ve been in abusive relationships in the past and itâ€™s fucking traumatizing every time he gets mad like this. I canâ€™t talk to my best friend about it because sheâ€™s in the hospital. I canâ€™t talk to my family about it. And what would I tell my therapist this is the best relationship Iâ€™ve ever had I feel like I canâ€™t tell him Iâ€™m scared? I donâ€™t understand why everyone thinks theyâ€™re the only ones with anything going wrong? I can not remember a time in my life when I didnâ€™t think of killing myself. It has been my gut reaction to many things for many years now. Iâ€™ve worked really hard on trying to get rid of these thoughts with my therapist. I have not acted on a suicidal thought in years. But itâ€™s in my head almost every day. I just want someone to be here for me. Instead of me always having to be the adult in the room and take care of everyone else. Iâ€™m not actively suicidal I just need a place to speak. Thanks.
