I'm too tired to be angry anymore.I've got so much going for me. Good friends, plenty to do and opportunities to be happy and yet I can't make myself feel the smallest bit of joy.

I was angry, was angry. At everything. The smallest things would piss me off incredibly for no reason so I just tried to bury and hide it. Now I don't know what I feel.

Miserable mainly, I'm incredibly lonely and yet I don't feel I can deal with people right now. I have no energy and at times I can barely make myself move. As I said, I can't find joy in anything and as a result all I want to do is sleep or drink.

I feel awful about all this because I have no real reason for it, I just wish I had something to aim these feelings of hopelessness at.
