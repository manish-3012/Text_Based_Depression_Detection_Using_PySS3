Reasons I deserve to dieI keep going over these reasons that I deserve to die...
1. Every friend/partner I have ever known has left me, most hate me.
2. People tell me I'm rude and manipulative but I don't know how to stop.
3. I'm a leech on people, they buy things for me and half of it I don't even use.
4. Society doesn't need another mentally ill faggot like me... 
5. Most people just hate me based on my being pansexual and possibly transgender and if I live in a world where I can't be myself then I just shouldn't be in that world.
6. I know that every moment of my happiness is just an illusion, every time I meet a new friend I feel great but then it always turns out bad because I'm stupid.
7. I already do stuff that will kill me slowly, so why not spare the excess food and such for someone who actually needs it?
8. I want to die, and I think about it constantly. 
9. No one legitimately cares about me, hence no friends and no one wanting to put up with me being depressed or even just me in general.
