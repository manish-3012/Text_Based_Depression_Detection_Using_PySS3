I have suicidal thoughtsHello to everybody reading this. I donâ€™t really know how to put those feelings into words. I am a boy and I like boys. That is not my reason for feeling depressed. I am 28 and I am in a difficult situation. I like a boy who is in a relationship with another man for 3 years. I met him online on accident and we hit it off. We spend a week together and then he went to his boyfriend who is not living in the country I live. The boy I like is liking me back but says he has a relationship and he does not consider anything else. The fucked up thing is that we have much more in common but he is not able to respond to my feelings. Here comes what I have been suffering for the past two years since we met. I tried to be as attractive as possible with gaining weight and  dropping it again. I am to the point where I donâ€™t want to see myself in the mirror. I feel so bad and constantly down. I try to do things to get my mind off this but it does not work. I feel such pain that I tries self harming because it helped a little just by causing physical pain. I canâ€™t tell my friends and actually nobody that I want to kill myself and I feel that way. Thats why I decided to make a profile here and search for some help/advice. I donâ€™t think that people like me in other ways than as a friend. I probably donâ€™t have what it takes for being something more to people. I am accepting this but I struggle with the pain of rejection and the fear of being constantly looked as just somebody to talk to. I feel trapped and the only escape I see is to end all this. I canâ€™t really explain everything but I think I managed to paint the picture. Depression is something I have never faced and its taking everything out of me. I am crying constantly. Even sometimes I cry without even being able to stop it. Thank you for even taking the time to read this and I am sorry to bother anybody with this.
