this is gonna be an unforgettable summerI don't think I've ever been this calm, happy but most importantly peaceful about planning my suicide. I really hope this is it.

I have nothing to complain about, I have everything, but until it's over, until then, you have to live with yourself

and I and the rest of this world has lived long enough with me.

My last term of university has started and I'm giving it my all cause I don't want to let my partner down, she's working so hard, she doesn't deserve to have her grades be dragged down with my lack of intelligence

It's still 7 weeks but then I'm free. I can do whatever I want. I've been so afraid of suicide because of the chance of failure with the inability to stop thinking about it constantly anyways, and now, for some magical reason I'm not scared anymore. It feels as though a weight came off of me. I feel lighter than ever. I just need to get through 7 more weeks.

The only thing now in the back of my mind that scares me is that somehow this lightness will pass again and I'll be stuck between the two sides as always. Too much of a chicken to fucking do something about it, but thinking about it relentlessly nevertheless.
