I feel stupid even saying I attempted suicide because I knew my method was non-fatal. I feel like an imposter.I overdosed on pills. I knew it wasnâ€™t enough but I downed the full bottle of benzos and scribbled the note that I overdosed and to call 911, I loved them, and my phone pin to whoever found me once they did. I ended up getting caught before I fell unconscious and went to the hospital for two days. they made me drink nasty black stuff.

Iâ€™m home now and think, I knew the overdose was non-fatal. can I even call myself a suicide survivor? I feel like an imposter.
