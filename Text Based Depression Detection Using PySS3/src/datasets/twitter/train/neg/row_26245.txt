I just feel so lonely, I think I might kill myselfI feel very lonely. I have no one and I'm always the one reaching out others. A friend of mine just recently started dating and this has made me remember how much I'm unwanted. No one has ever wanted me around. I have been diagnosed with bipolar and my mom wants me to quit my meds -- well, she's actually quite close to ordering me to. I do take some joy in thinking that going cold turkey might lead me to suicide, might finally give me some courage. I'm considering killing myself this week or next. I hope I'll suceed.
