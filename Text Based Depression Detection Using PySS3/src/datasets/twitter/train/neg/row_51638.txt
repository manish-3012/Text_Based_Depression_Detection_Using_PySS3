Free suicide prevention help?Iâ€™m in a horrible, horrible place in my life. 45F with a long history of PTSD, severe depression, and multiple suicide attempts. Just lost my health insurance bc my husband lost his job. For the past three days Iâ€™ve been crying almost nonstop and barely sleeping. I canâ€™t stop thinking that the only way out is to kill myself. 

I need help. I need some serious help if I donâ€™t want to leave my kids without a mother. I donâ€™t know where to go for help. Iâ€™ve gone to the ER feeling this way, but each time they send me home with instructions to call my psychiatrist the following day. Which usually leads to an attempt and hospitalization. 

I canâ€™t see my psychiatrist or my therapist (they both told me to call back when I have insurance). I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold on.

I would like to add that suicide hotlines havenâ€™t been very effective for me in the past. A half-trained college student gets on and says â€œthat must be hardâ€ a half-dozen times, followed by â€œhmmm....â€ I need serious help.

Wow. I can see that people are responding to my post, but Reddit wonâ€™t let me see any of the comments.
