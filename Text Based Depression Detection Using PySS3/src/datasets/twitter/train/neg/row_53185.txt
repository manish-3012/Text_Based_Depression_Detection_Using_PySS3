I need a point.I've been coasting for as long as I can remember. Things definitely started feeling wrong around the age of twelve but after that...16 was when things got terrible. Tried once in 1st year of Uni. Mum came in on me with my knife, so I pushed through. Got through 2nd year on anti-depressants. Still not feeling like anything -  It evened me into a state of functionality with nothing else. I don't remember what it's like to feel stuff. Then relapse but it didn't feel as bad. Finished Uni. NEET now for months. Told people I'm applying, want to do things; haven't been. Feel like I don't know shit about anything. 

At this point I feel like I pushed through to this point just for everyone else. That isn't enough. I need something, but I don't know what I like nor do I know how to find out. I don't like how I look. Can't be bothered to change because I can't envision turning into anything I actually like. I just look wrong. I think. But I don't hate me when I look at myself which is confusing as balls. And I've had every advantage. Money, schools, opportunity, just wasted. I have it so good and shouldn't feel bad. Hell I've had wonderful doctors and therapists but every cycle is harder and there's less left in me.

I can't do this any more. Current thought is the end of march for a definite date. Got some Helium, or a syringe. Air embolism from carotid would hurt but quick and it feels closer every day. That is relaxing.
