Am I becoming suicidal?Does anyone know what the steps of becoming suicidal are?  I feel like Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide a lot more.  Iâ€™ve been anxious/depressed for years, but as a serious hypochondriac I usually feel crippling fear towards dying.  Now Iâ€™m just apathetic about it.  I kind of am like â€œmaybe it would be easier if I die because I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with anxiety anymoreâ€.  I have no active plan to kill myself, nor do I think I will soon, but is this a slippery slope?  I just hate my brain so much, Iâ€™m literally never happy because everything is utterly clouded by stress, anxiety, and depression.  Iâ€™ve always thought about death for multiple hours a day, because my hypochondria convinces me Iâ€™m dying, but my attitude towards it has shifted.  Thoughts?
