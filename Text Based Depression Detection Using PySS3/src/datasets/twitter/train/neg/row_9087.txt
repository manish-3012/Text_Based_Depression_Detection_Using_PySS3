I'm on the edge...For most of the last two years I've had suicidal thoughts, and recently it hasn't been helped by the fact that me being with my girlfriend (who's bulimic) has caused almost all of our friends to betray us and tell all of the secrets shes told them, and begin spreading rumors around our school about us, shes the only one I can talk to about anything anymore, please someone talk to me, I cried myself to sleep last night
EDIT: i...i dont know what to do...she just broke up with me...
