I just want to go at this point 

I am 18 years old and have been burned out to the point I rarely enjoy anything nor can I do things I want. I am working on it with my psychologist , but I am worried I don't have much time left.

My depression is getting worse , I have been suicidal for past 4 years , but now I think I am in danger

I fantasize about death on daily basis and really think it would be a good solution , but damm I cant do that to my mum and friends.

FUCK I am getting way too emotional writing this down and just hope this isn't my final and last thing I post /write

If you wondering why my mind is so messed up it can't decide whether to kill myself or keep on fighting is mostly loosing the fight for many many long years. This kept on so long I started doubt I will ever break out of it or have decent life. And with decent I don't mean money , partner or anything material. A decent life for me would be one I can enjoy or at least stop hurting myself and wishing to die.

I HATE MYSELF so much , I started to get teary just continuing with this post . but at least I know I have some emotions

FUCK this really feels like I am writing a suicide letter. I hate my own my doing this to me. I am fucking lost cause. I should really just write one and do it.

If anybody read this nonsense , thank you .
