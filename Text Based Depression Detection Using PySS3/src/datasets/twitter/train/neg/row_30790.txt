Should i just do itI hate this. I hate living like this. I have a perfect life but I still feel like this. I have friends and a loving family but I still want to just end it all. 

I should do it. If I would die I would be a burden to my friends anymore. I give them a lot of stress and worry and I donâ€™t want to make them feel bad for me anymore.

Maybe I will just fail again and live my life like nothing happened. I wouldnâ€™t tell my friends  about it because they are all ready worried about me.

I donâ€™t speak English so sorry if you canâ€™t understand anything :D
