Anyone hate the crisis textline?They are so freaking useless. They are absolutely zero help. I just opted out of a crisis textline conversation &amp; their organization wouldnâ€™t let me leave until I said I was â€œokâ€, when clearly Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m fucking suicidal and reached out to them for help! But all they wanted to do was call 911 on me by asking if I had a plan to kill my self. I do have a fucking plan to kill myself, but Iâ€™m not dumb enough to tell them that I have a plan. The conversation between me and them literally consisted of 5 messages from them asking me &amp; pleading with me to answer if I had a suicide plan. I kept on refusing to tell them &amp; then they finally snapped and told me we couldnâ€™t continue our conversation if they didnâ€™t know if I was in imminent danger or not. They kept on saying they were there to help &amp; only to help, but thatâ€™s a lie. They just wanted to call the police and emergency services on my ass. God I hate it. Why couldnâ€™t they just talk to me and respect my decision to not answer their question? Now Iâ€™m even more suicidal than I was before.
