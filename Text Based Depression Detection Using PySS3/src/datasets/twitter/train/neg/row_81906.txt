Fake it till you make it: Iâ€™ve been faking it for a long tome. Now that Iâ€™ve sort of made it, Iâ€™m absolutely petrified and ready to kill myselfI am not looking forward to the next year because it will need me to be amazing. Everyone thinks Iâ€™m amazing but I donâ€™t believe I can do it and I think I just want to give up and die. I want this and yet I donâ€™t. Help me. I canâ€™t do it...
