Can this really go on much longer?Iâ€™ve posted here before so I donâ€™t even want to say Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I donâ€™t want to come off as being the boy who cries wolf. 
I need to vent/get this off my chest though. And this is the only place I can do this right now. 
Iâ€™ve felt suicidal most my life. Thereâ€™s been times Iâ€™ve actually attempted it. I still have a huge scar on my wrist. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized twice.

My life has came down to this... at one point I felt on top of the world. I was young. Thought I had my whole life ahead of me. Had an amazing job. Loved what I did. Had my two girls around. Just felt really unstoppable. 
Then one day I wake up (actually it feels like everyday I wake up feeling this way anymore) and Iâ€™m now 46, on disability, have lost my mom. Not close to my dad. Not close with either of my girls and havenâ€™t even talked to my youngest in months. My boyfriend mentally abuses me but I donâ€™t have the mental strength and canâ€™t financially make it without him. I know thatâ€™s a poor excuse but itâ€™s the truth. 

I really feel like Iâ€™ve hit my all time low in life and to be honest I do not ever see coming back from this. I keep thinking that I literally have nothing left to live for. I have two pills I could take that would probably do the job. But sadly Iâ€™m too much of a chicken shit to go through with it. Even though I truly want this nightmare to just be over for me. 

I keep thinking as fast as my life has seemed to go if I just keep holding out that eventually Iâ€™ll be gone anyway. But I also know the longer I keep going the more fucked up mentally I feel and I canâ€™t imagine waiting another 5-10-20 years to just die already. I donâ€™t know what other options I have at this point though. 

I guess thatâ€™s all I want to say for now.
