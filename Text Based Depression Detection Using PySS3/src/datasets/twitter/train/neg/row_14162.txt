My biggest wish is to dieIm 18 yrs and the only thing on my mind is dying. Iâ€™ve never been depressed or went through a hard time in my whole life, i got tons of good friends, a lovely family and iâ€™m economically independent(my parents money not mine). Even though i have a great life my biggest wish is to just die and disappear from everything but the last thing i want is my family and friends to suffer.

I want to die but i donâ€™t know how to make it happen with the least impact on my friends and family, please help.

The reason why i want to die is because i feel like thereâ€™s nothing to life and that i doesnâ€™t deserve any of all the things i get.

I got nobody to talk to about my wish of dying, im about to go crazy having to live a single more day on this earth.

(Excuse my bad english)
