DoneI've got a method in mind, I'm hoping I can finally just go through with it. I'm so tired of living. I always love the wrong people. I can't do it anymore. I'm with a narcissist who beats me for every little thing. Unfortunately, I really, really love him. He says he's tired of me. I want to do him and everyone else a favor. I'm sick of living in pain. Usually the thought of death scares me, but right now I'm so numb that it actually sounds very comfortable. I'd love to sleep and never have to worry about anything ever again.
