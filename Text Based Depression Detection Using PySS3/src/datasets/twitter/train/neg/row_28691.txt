It doesn't endMy life is constant disappointment no matter what I do or say life is alway beating shit out of me like I've done something wrong.Ive tried everything but at this point breathing is to hard and difficult I want end it but I'm too scared do it honestly I just want my life stop hurting me I want be able wake up and not cry because I genuinely don't want continue my day I don't want cry to sleep.And I've attempted get help but when I told my mother she said that I was crazy and no reason think like this and said she try find me help but it never happened.I know if the opportunity truly presented itself I kill myself without hesitation because I don't matter and I'm not needed and life has beaten me down I believe to get that point across.
