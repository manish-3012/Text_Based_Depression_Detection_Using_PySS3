Posted here yesterday about needing help,I just found myself writing a goodbye letter to my mom. 
Yesterday I wrote a goodbye letter to my best friend.

I will just continue to write these letters as a form of therapy. Donâ€™t know if iâ€™ll ever send them, but just writing them helps putting my pain somewhere. 

I find myself in between thoughts most of the day. Iâ€™m writing this post and telling you Iâ€™m writing them as a way of therapy but in my head iâ€™m thinking of ways I could end it all tonight. 
Sorry for this messy post. I just needed to spill my thoughts
