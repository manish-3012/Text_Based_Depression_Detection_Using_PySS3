I am feel worthless and hated by everyoneIn reality I have only two friends, but I am talking with them so rare. Rest of people I know are against me, they are thinking that I am weird and poor, but I am not. Few people tells that I am satanist, because I don't go to church. They try to make me angry, and later tell me that I am aggressive. I don't have any hobby. I have panic disorder, I might get 5 panic attack a day. I haven't reasons to live
