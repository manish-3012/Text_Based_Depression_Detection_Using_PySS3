Drug abuse and so on...Iâ€™m not entirely sure if this is as important to put on here but I donâ€™t know where to turn.

I have a brother that is 16 and right now heâ€™s making everybody in my family sick. Iâ€™ll explain in a bit. Heâ€™s a drug addict (weed, codeine, cocaine) and never at home. Nobody in my family ever knows where he is and whom heâ€™s with. My mother has a heart problem and sheâ€™s gradually getting worse due to his behaviour. 

Due to this my family forgets about me, I get it but I also feel like Iâ€™m not a part of the family. Iâ€™ve also been depressed for about four years now and this isnâ€™t helping. I also canâ€™t tell my parents about it now, because if I donâ€™t keep up the appearance as â€the sane oneâ€ my parents wonâ€™t be able to handle it. He doesnâ€™t care about any of us and right now Iâ€™m so scared for my moms sake. Sheâ€™s the nicest person I know and I  have no idea what Iâ€™d do without her. 

I have absolutely no one around me I could talk to about this because I know no one would understand, and probably judge me. I donâ€™t know how long Iâ€™ll be able to handle all this.
