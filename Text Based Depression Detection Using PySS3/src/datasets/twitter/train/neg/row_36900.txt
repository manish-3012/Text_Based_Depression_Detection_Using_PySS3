Please, I need someone to talk to.First off I'd like to apologize.  I am not suicidal, nor do I want to die.  I guess this post is in the wrong place but I really need someone to talk to.

I am absolutely terrified of death.  I live every moment knowing that everything that I am is going to be erased when I die. 

I am so scared of death, every moment it is on my mind.  The fact that I am going to die and there is not one damned thing I can do about it.

Everything seems so pointless,  there is no reason to do anything at all.   I've been depressed before and what I am experiencing isn't that. I feel absolute meaningless, supreme futility,  and absolute gut wrenching fear in almost every moment I am alive. 

I don't want my consciousness to be snuffed out by the black hole of death.   I am really scared and miserable reddit, and it's been like this now for several years.   SSRIs and lithium don't touch it. I don't think this is depression, it is something worse but completely different.
