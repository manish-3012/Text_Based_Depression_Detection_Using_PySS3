I am terminating myself tonight. I have no career nor relationship prospects.I am about to drop out from my final year of college. I have a goddamn 2.95 GPA, no internship to show for my knowledge, nor the means to pay back 9,500 USD in a deferment plan. I have social anxiety, depression, and HFA/AS- and I have always had autistic issues since I was a baby. I repeat stupid jokes, I have shit body coordination, and I hate the general public.

The sad part is that I should have ended my life sooner than later. Ever since I was a fucking child in Kindergarten, I would space out and had shit social skills. I still space out and have shit social skills. I am a fucking waste of space, and destroying myself would cleanse this goddamn awful planet of my genes.

I have never "outgrown" my autism, nor do I see myself amounting to much of fucking anything. I wish I could leave this fucking country of mine and just volunteer in some support capacity of some faraway land, but I am stuck without a fucking 4 year degree and career experience.

Mom and dad, this is none of your fault. I fucked up for as long as I can remember. The best thing I can do for you guys right now is cease to exist. I love you, mom. I love you, dad. I do not see a living future for myself.

I wish I could enumerate all those I love dearly. I am sorry that I will no longer be here for you.
