I just lost the woman I lovedMy relationship with this amazing girl ended last night. I loved her and due to having a really really hard past where I have been hurt by parents family friends and women it's hard for me to trust. And I trusted and it's gone. For the first time I've not been happy that I have a girlfriend I was happy I had her. I love her. And it's over and I don't have any close friends. She was my best friend. I feel so alone and so hopeless and for once someone loved that I'm just a dork. For once someone saw something in me. For once I felt like I was actually worth something. For once I trusted. So many women are focused on sex and just don't really care. And she was different. She was everything I've ever wanted and we are over. I have had so much go wrong in my life and so little go right. I just hurt so much
