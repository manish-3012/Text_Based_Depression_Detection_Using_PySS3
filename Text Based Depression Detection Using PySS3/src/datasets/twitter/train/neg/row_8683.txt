It never goes awayI donâ€™t understand, Iâ€™m getting great grades, Iâ€™m doing my passion, Iâ€™m eating healthy, Iâ€™m losing weight, Iâ€™m going to the gym, everything is perfect. But no matter how much I tell it to go away, itâ€™s always there. That voice that tells you everything is wrong, I just want it to stop. I want it to end and I donâ€™t know how to make it stop. Please someone tell me. Iâ€™ll do anything.  Please Iâ€™m begging you. Make it stop screaming at me.
