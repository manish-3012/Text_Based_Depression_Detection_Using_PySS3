I canâ€™t live another day knowing such a horrible person. I canâ€™t do it. I thought maybe I could change who I was but today Iâ€™ve realised I canâ€™t even do that.I got banned from a subreddit earlier. And Iâ€™m really glad of that, because it made me finally realise how truly worthless and terrible I am. Iâ€™ve felt this way for years, but I only realised how much I hated myself about 4 months ago.

I managed to convince myself I could change, and I wasnâ€™t as awful as I thought I was. I made an account on this website and tried to help people. I thought I was doing something good. I thought if I could help people I could make myself into a better person.

But I canâ€™t. I didnâ€™t realise until now. But I was right 4 months ago. Iâ€™m a horrible, selfish monster who does nothing but hurt people. Everyone I talk to. Everyone I try to help. Everyone who knows me. Iâ€™m terrible. I canâ€™t do anything right.

I canâ€™t do this anymore. For once in my life Iâ€™m feeling suicidal outside of a panic attack. Because Iâ€™m not panicking anymore. Iâ€™m right. This is the only thing I can do to make everyone happy. I know itâ€™ll hurt people. But I do that every day. Thereâ€™s only about 5 people who care about me, and someday theyâ€™ll realise that itâ€™s good that Iâ€™m gone. Since I wonâ€™t be causing any more trouble for them.

I donâ€™t know exactly how Iâ€™m going to do it yet, but Iâ€™m going to find the best method. I know the perfect method since Iâ€™ve nearly done this before and Iâ€™ve thought about it enough to know how. That way no one in real life will know itâ€™s a suicide, theyâ€™ll think I just died by accident.

I hate to do this so close to Christmas, but I canâ€™t live with myself. I canâ€™t take another day living as such a terrible person.

Iâ€™m sorry to waste everyoneâ€™s time. Iâ€™m sorry to everyone Iâ€™ve hurt. Iâ€™m sorry for causing so much trouble. Iâ€™m sorry I was ever born. I didnâ€™t deserve to be brought into this world, but I can at least do the right thing now and leave it.
