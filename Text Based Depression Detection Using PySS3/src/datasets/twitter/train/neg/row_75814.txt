Just so Tired :/What about depression and suicide caused from pain ... I am 24 and just have been struggling with stomach problems for years and now more issues are arising unfortunately . Despite my great mental health I was always looking to the good never bad but since the past 3 or 4 years have just been the same pain over and over getting worse and worse , seen doctors everyone doesn't know.. just tired .. wanna go to sleep .. just so tired of it you know . I have no clue how someone can put up with pain for so many years... guess I just cant handle it aswell as others or maybe it is serious and I can just die sooner so I dont have to put up with it any longer
