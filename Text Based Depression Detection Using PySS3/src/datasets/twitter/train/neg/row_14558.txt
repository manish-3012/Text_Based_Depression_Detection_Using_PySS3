I just need to vent - itâ€™s getting too much Iâ€™m no matter how hard I try, I just get further into this wholeI did the stupidest thing and tried to get myself out of debt through other debt, I did that twice.. now Iâ€™m fucked, Iâ€™m earning which is great but Iâ€™m barely earning above minimum wage (16k) and very unlikely to receive a pay rise. Iâ€™m not qualified for other jobs and finding something else is unlikeliest than getting a raise. 

My housemate is moving out in 6 months and I donâ€™t think itâ€™s likely that any new landlord will let me rent as Iâ€™m constantly in my over draft and I canâ€™t move back into my parents as my cat - the only reason Iâ€™m still alive - will get run over as they canâ€™t keep her inside the house due to their own cats using a cat flap. 

Iâ€™m really fucking struggling to see a reason any more and I know in 1.5 years roundabout Iâ€™ll be out of 2 of 4 debts but right now Iâ€™m digging deeper and deeper and I donâ€™t want to. Iâ€™ve got to find money to fund stuff to do with my boyfriend as heâ€™s flying back this month and I donâ€™t think heâ€™ll want to just sit around and do nothing but I canâ€™t afford to do anything. He wants to go to a football game and the tickets are Â£30 each and thatâ€™s way more than I can afford without going further into my overdraft, I can barely afford train tickets or a hotel for the Manchester trip he is thinking about.

Iâ€™m just done. Iâ€™m done being stupid. Iâ€™m done dreading every waking moment because thereâ€™s no way out.
