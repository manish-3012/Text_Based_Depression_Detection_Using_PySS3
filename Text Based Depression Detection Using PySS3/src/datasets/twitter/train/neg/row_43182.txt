Short Question! I don't really know how to talk about suicide unless I'm anonymous on the internet.I kind of actually want to talk about it with someone. I really just don't want to die, but I don't want to live in pain, suffering and pointless struggle even more. Nobody knows how suicidal I am. Not my best friend. Or my parents or anybody at all. I'm really scared to even mention it. I'm not even sure what it'll achieve.
