I have a lot going for my life.. and I still want to give up.TLDR: I just need to vent somewhere, thanks to any who read.. it's a mess.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sick of my main work.. however I am heading into the body mod industry quite well which is really the only thing that is keeping me motivated to see how my life will play out. But regardless.. I am devastatingly exhausted, I work all week, no days off between the two jobs and when I am not working I am running around doing something else. The only time I rest is when I sleep and it is never enough anymore. I am beyond burnt out and yet I am drowning in everything I have procrastinated to do.. my room is a pigs din and so is my car. I have barely any time or energy to work on mandatory art projects for my mentor and I just feel I will never get anything done. I paid off my credit cards recently and am still back into debt because I am extremely irresponsible and I find job in buying things. I have a girlfriend as well.. she is one of my comforts but it doesn't change how much of a mess I am in. Idk what the point of this post is. But I find myself frequenting gun shops.. I have enough to buy one. But I am trying to hold off for now.. cause once I do there wont be much time left for me. thanks for anyone who reads this.. I am not even depressed atm, I just feel so suffocated and exhausted.. my head is a tornado.. I want the chaos to stop.
