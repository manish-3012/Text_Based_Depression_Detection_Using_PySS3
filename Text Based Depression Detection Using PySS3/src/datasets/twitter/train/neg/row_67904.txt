I don't know how much longer I can stand being here.I just, I don't know. I tried to do it in September of 2011, and obviously failed.  I feel like I just don't belong anywhere. I was a fluke or something. I'm also a type 1 diabetic and I have realized that this disease alone should have killed me, the Universe didn't want me here I guess. I keep thinking about how I can't wait to die. I have no one to talk to, I talk to myself in my head all day, and I just don't know what to do. All I really want to do is hug some one. I feel so alone.
