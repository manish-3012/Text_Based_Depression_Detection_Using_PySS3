You're still young, there's plenty of time!Yes because it really makes me feel hopeful that my life MAY get better in my later years while most people had a very enjoyable youth and could make most of it.

My few friends have given up on me, their significant other always number one priority. I'm stuck in a loop of self improvement-no rewards in trying to get my life sorted out. I feel like I have everything I need except for a significant other to share my life with and of course I'm stigmatized for it, I'm not entitled to someone's love no matter how hard I work on myself and keep being praised to be this fantastic gorgeous, smart and funny person. I'm in this loop of being told to stay confident and it will happen when you expect it less. Bullshit, not for someone WHO NEVER HAD A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP in his life. I get to be a spectator while I break my back getting what others managed to do without thinking about it.

Im tired of living, the depression never left over those 10 years, medication helped temporary but didn't remove my need for companionship at the back of my head. I was born and raised so others could feel better about themselves. I have to keep working and praying while others watch me with their smug faces believing they also had to struggle to get there.

Im sorry if this sound stubborn but i know for a fact ill never be happy alone. My doctor even asked me if i looked into finding a partner... I couldn't hold my laugh, i've been trying just that for years. Im at a point where people who used to tell me to find happiness elsewhere now telling me to write what I want from a woman in personality traits on a piece of paper, hide it and pray you'll meet that person. Maybe I should sacrifice a lamb to some god, maybe that's gonna do the trick right?!

I'm very tempted to put myself in a situation where people will have to shoot me, or If I can at least have a gun with a bullet to end my suffering.
