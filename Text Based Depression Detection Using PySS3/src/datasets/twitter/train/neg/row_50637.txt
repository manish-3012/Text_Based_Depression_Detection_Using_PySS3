I remember this haunting sceneThis was when I was in elementary school. On a random school day in like grade 5 I can still remember when my mom was making breakfast I went downstairs to our basement to check on our cat and for some reason I decided to do it in the dark. When I got in room where she is normally kept I saw her lying in between some pipes dead and alone, and I decided to poke her with a pole. (She was 18 btw) I left and continued the day like a normal being.

I bawled my eyes out remembering it again I want to join her as well. About 10 more years minimum and Iâ€™m out of this shit world. Thinking about it maybe it was a sign because now Iâ€™m dealing with Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia, OCD, Stress, Low blood sugar, eye problems, back problems, and another disorder that makes me a sociopath.

Please someone send a hi or something my brain is hurting from communicating so little. Peace.
