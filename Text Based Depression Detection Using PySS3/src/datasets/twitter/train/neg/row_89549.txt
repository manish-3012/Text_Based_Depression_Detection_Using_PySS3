Trying to protect my motherAlright, so to start off i already have my suicide planned and i don't really want to make it a subject of my post. I have my reasons, emotional as well as logical, to know it is a correct decision and it's going to help me, and, in a long run, my enviroment. If not for one small problem i can guarantee i would be 100% dead already.

This 'problem' is basically my mother. She went through a lot. She has her own problems, including deppression and paranoia. She is totally overprotective about me and really focused on me. She always says that i'm everything that she has left etc. And the problem is that as soon as she learns i killed myself she is going to go totally crazy and kill herself as well. I know her enough and even small criticism can totally make her go crazy. 

Because of this i know that killing myself i basically kill her as well and this is not allowing me to do this. What would you advise me to do? Call the police and tell them about what my mother is going to do just before commiting suicide? Or should i invite whole family to the house so they can calm her down after? I feel really cornered.
