My life was pretty good, I was born in 2000 to two parents in New York, i vacationed in Massachusetts every summer and I had a dog named charley. I diddnt graduate highschool because of a learning disability and custody disputes. I wish that I had not made the choices that I did but itâ€™s done, Iâ€™ve never gotten to express my feelings but this is nice. 
I died by hanging myself on November 9th 2020  after I got fired from my job. 
I miss the way that things were when I was younger, living with my family, having friends was never something I could do, alone every day but time only goes forward, always forward. 

There isnâ€™t anyone left to say goodbye to, everyone is dead or far away. Iâ€™m alone and will always be alone. I wish that I had been nicer to my mom.
