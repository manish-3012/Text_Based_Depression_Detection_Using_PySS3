Why is suicide not allowed?In some countries, suicide is considered a crime, but I am talking about developed countries here.  Why is suicide not permitted?  It's enforced as if it were a crime, but not punished to the same extent. 

Just a bit of context here I guess.  I have attempted at my life multiple times before.  I've been in the hospital three times, twice on the psychiatric ward, for suicidal ideations or attempts.  After my first hospitalization for 7 weeks, I was sent to a youth custody facility.  Sentenced there by a judge until youth protection deemed it to be okay for me to leave.  I get that they are trying to protect people, but the conditions there are horrible.  I just don't get why they are trying to protect people from themselves?  What's so wrong about ending one's life?  Why do we have freedom if we can't fully decide our own fate?  I know that if I were to commit suicide that it would greatly affect my family, but sometimes I just don't care.  I just want to end my own suffering.  And just because of that, authorities put me into facilities that cause me even more suffering.  I just don't understand how this cycle is supposed to make any sense.  What do we owe to anyone that we have to stay alive?
