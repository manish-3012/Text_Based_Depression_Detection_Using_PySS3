I literally have zero friends or family who really care about me being alive or deadI'm going through a lot right now. I tried my level best to escape from the situation but failed. I used to work in a restaurant before lockdown. Was able to earn enough to pay for my food bills and rent. But I lost my job because of covid. Right now I'm hopeless. (sorry for my poor English) 

I tried learning new employble skills. Finished full stack web developer course on Udemy by Angela Yu. I have a very basic entry level laptop and with the help of it I can build beautiful websites, E commerce store and WebApps. I downloaded this course from torrent because I didn't have any money to buy it legally. After finishing the course I created a account on Fiverr, with a hope of paid work but didn't get any gigs.

Right now I don't know what to do. The more I think about myself, suicide becomes more attractive option. I don't want to die but I really can't afford to live like a stray dog. I'm so coward that can't afford to hang myself with ceiling fan.

I want to end this suffering but don't know how
