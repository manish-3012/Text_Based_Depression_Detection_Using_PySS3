Guys.... I'm having serious thoughts of suicide and its scaring the hell out of me Life is seriously shitty right now, there is a very good chance I'm going to fail out of school again, I'm thousands of dollars in debt and have debt collectors calling everyday about a hospital bill i couldnt pay, my job recently went out of buissness so i have no job and if i fail out of school and cant get student loans then i wont be able to pay for my lease. why do i have to be such a freaking fuck up? ive practically had life handed to me on a freaking silver platter and i cant muster the effort to pass 13 fucking credits of easy shit. its not like im stupid, im actually pretty fucking smart, which makes all of this that much worse.
i honestly cannot see myself doing anything differently either, ive always been a lazy piece of shit. even if all of this shit blows over then what? do i work for fucking walmart in my home town until i fucking die? because that seems to be all that im freaking cut out for. right now it honestly feels like the world would be better off without me. i honestly dont see myself contributing to society in any way or having any semblance of happiness so why continue? if i didnt have an irrational fear of dying i honestly might do it, but i doubt i could muster up the effort to even do that. 
i really dont know what to freaking do and these thoughts of suicide arent really helping

sorry this is so incoherent
