there is no watchThere is no "watch." There is no support group. The hotlines are filled with kids right out of highschool getting paid minimum wage to talk to suicidal people, with monetary incentives if they're able to swindle a location out of you for them to contact the local police. No one cares. Suicide is done purely alone and in solitude. No one is watching. No one cares when you are living. It's only in death where the tears and public displays of affection on social media will appear. There is no suicide watch. No one is watching. Invisible.
