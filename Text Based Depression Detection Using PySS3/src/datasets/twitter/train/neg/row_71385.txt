I Never ChangeI always disappoint and worry those around me. I am one of the luckiest people in the world, a loving family, upper-middle-class, good education. I have it all yet I am is someone who constantly disappoints and causes unnecessary stress, anger, and sadness in people's lives. Why should I keep going?
