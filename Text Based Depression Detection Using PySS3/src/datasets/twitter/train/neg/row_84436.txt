Suicidal againA few months ago I couldn't handle the thought of life and the place I got diagnosed worked hard and quick to get me on some medicine. Now I have been on medicine for a few months, both for depression and excessive thought, yet my suicidal thought are coming back. My anxiety is getting worse and I have no energy anymore. Like hell I can barely even set up my computer so I can work on commission/draw. Or set up my PS4 so I can game and relax. I don't have that energy. Not even to take a bath or clean my room. I feel disgusting but tbh I don't know what I can do... all I really want is to just kill myself.
