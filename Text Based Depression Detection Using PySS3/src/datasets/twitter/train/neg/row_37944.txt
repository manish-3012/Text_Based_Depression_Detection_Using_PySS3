I'm gonna go down as one of the most unimportant people ever bornThere's no reason to keep me alive. Nothing that drives me to live at all. I have barely anything I enjoy doing and I don't have any redeeming qualities at all.

I'm a totally unappealing. I'm just a person in the background. Nobody cares about me. Nobody would care if I died. I'm just a nobody who deserves death

I've accepted that I will have no legacy whatsoever, nothing I do will ever be remembered by anybody. I'm not having any children. I'm not going to marry, I'm not going to do anything productive in my life. Because I'm a hopeless person who should just disappear
