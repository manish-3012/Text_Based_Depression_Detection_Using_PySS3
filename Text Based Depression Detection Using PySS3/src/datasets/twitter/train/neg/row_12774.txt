I can't see the point of living anymore.I've made my decision now, I don't want to be talked out of it, I am an addict and have had mental issues for decades, at 46 I've decided to end things, I don't know how exactly yet but when I find a 100% for sure method then I'm gone. I just wanted to post this because once I'm dead I want somebody to understand why.

I am 65 days sober and clear headed about my choice. 

My wife left me and it is my fault, I was emotionally distant and not able to be enough for our children, our babies that I have not been with since the beginning of October this year. I can't continue like this anymore. Olivia, Atticus, I love you so much and I hope your mother can find somebody to love you and support you the way I cannot.

I have no point to life not being under the same roof with my Angels, I cannot tolerate not seeing them grow and when they get home from school hearing about their days, being there to see how every morning is amazing and wonderful and new.

I am effectively homeless and broke, I have stopped therapy because it isn't helping anymore, my wife says she is happier without me, she says the children are happier without me. So there is no point in trying to go home to them anymore, she has filed for divorce and I can't take the pain of all of this anymore.

I am a failure, and as such I do not wish to live anymore.
