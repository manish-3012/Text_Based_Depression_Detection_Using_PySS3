I'm realizing I'll always be aloneI moved across the country for my bf, and he's wonderful but it's only driven in how alone I am besides him. No one from my home state contacts me. I've offered to host 5 different friends in my apartment if they can grab a plane ticket ($100!).  People from home haven't talked to me in months. I flew home to visit my mom and tried to make plans with 4 of my "best friends" and somehow they were all busy. 

I think I'm just incapable of making friends. I just want people that I can have over, or go see a movie with. I've tried making friends here but everyone already has strong lifelong groups from high school/grade school. 

I don't want to do this anymore. I'm tired and every little thing makes me sad.
