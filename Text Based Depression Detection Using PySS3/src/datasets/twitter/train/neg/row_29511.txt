I really can't take the anxiety anymore.Le vent.  I'm new to a very high-stress, high-reward job, and cannot take it.  I'm new, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, but everyone expects me to already.  I can't lose this job, I can't even quit or I'll have to pay back the ten thousand dollars the company spent moving me across the country (under contract).  And I'll never find a job like this again.

For real.  Doing work, I feel like a dog playing fetch with a stick, but I bring back a fish or something.  Everyone looks at me like a retard.  I'll never get all work done like this, no one is training me, and when I ask for help I have to waste someone else's time.  I don't think I'm cut out for this.  What else is there for me?  I'm ugly and in shit shape.  The only redeeming quality I have is my career potential, and that's going to hell.  I think about going home and going to sleep with my head in a plastic bag every night, or hey, just for laughs, killing myself at work so those fuckbags in corporate can see what they do to me.  Is it really so hard to teach someone THEIR FUCKING JOB before sending asking them to do it?  I am not happy.
