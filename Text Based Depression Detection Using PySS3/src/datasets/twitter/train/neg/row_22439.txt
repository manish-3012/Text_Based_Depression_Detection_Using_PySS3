Every little thing sets me off nowadaysToday the smallest things like my teacher moving me to a different seat completely apart from anyone I know really just instilled a feeling of sadness. Life's hard living with a single mom and a brother who doesn't seem to understand what hes doing to me. Is there really a point to living? I have short bursts of happiness when with friends but apart from that I feel like life has nothing to offer me.
