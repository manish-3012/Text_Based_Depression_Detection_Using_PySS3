Why wonâ€™t god let me die alreadyWhy does god make me live on with this life, I donâ€™t want help, I want the end. Fix me or kill me already, just have it over with. Sick and tired of life and ready to give up, they say 90 days of sadness is depression, idk if it applies to me but itâ€™s like Iâ€™m fine for an hour and then the rest of the day itâ€™s immense urge to die. Itâ€™s been like this for over 3 years. I wish no one was there, no one that I have to hurt to end my suffering, maybe I wonâ€™t go to hell. Hell or not living is worse, that I know. Getting a hobby wonâ€™t help, Iâ€™ve tried it too many times. God just let me die already. I donâ€™t care how much it would hurt physically, wether itâ€™s burning to death or by the bullet, by blade or by rope, I donâ€™t care. I already hate myself enough to do it, people just get in the way, I wish something killed me somewhere.
