I won't go to class!If my parents go through with their plans to sign me up for community college classes tomorrow, I'm going to jump off the highest cliff I can find. I failed university for a reason. I suggested online classes as a compromise to my parents, but they turned that down. They spoke in a manner that suggested they intend to use violence against me.
