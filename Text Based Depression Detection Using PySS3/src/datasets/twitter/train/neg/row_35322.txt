Want to die, don't want to hurt those around meguilt. I feel like that's the only thing keeping me here. My family gives me massive anxiety. My fiancÃ© is wonderful and supportive and I feel like the biggest burden to him. He pays the majority our bills because I started a photography business years ago. And im good at it. But working for yourself is hard. I can't imagine going back to an office or worse retail or something. I just want to sleep and sleep and wake up to a different life. I dream of running away, being missing and disappearing from existence. If people wouldn't miss me I could just die. But I'm well liked. Loved by my friends. I can't even imagine talking to them about this because they would be shocked and I would never want to burden anyone with this shit.  I have weddings booked the rest of the year. I don't even have time to kill myself. I feel lost and hopeless and the more I think about it the more I just don't want to be here anymore. It's all too hard.
