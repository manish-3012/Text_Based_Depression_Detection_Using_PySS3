Stuck in limboI don't know what to do anymore. I feel like all of the damage done to me can't be undone. I can neither heal nor move forward. I'm so tired. I have no one to talk to. I'm sure the people closest to me can sense my cries for help but nobody gives a fuck. Antidepressants aren't doing anything for me. I'm literally stuck and it's so painful. I can't cry but I wish I could. I don't know how to deal with the pain of existence or how to move forward in my life. I failed so many of my uni exams because of apathy/ lack of concentration. I don't know how to exist. I just want to stop suffering.
