Sept 6When you know you're going to die, you'd think you would enjoy every last drop. Nope.

Just going to be my same miserable fuck, piss everyone off on my birthday like i always do, ruin everything all with one "sigh", step on yet another eggshell.

Then I'm going to wake up at 5am when everyone is gone or sleeping, load the gun, and find true happiness at the back of the barrel.

I think I will set fire to the house the same time that I do that. So that all of my stuff and memories can be burned with it.
