I tried &lt;3This year has really kicked my ass. I lost all my friends,  I couldn't keep a job no matter how hard I tried and I failed all of my midterms. It feels like I'm suffocating everyday and I can't bring myself to do anything anymore. My parents think I'm lazy but at this point, but I'm just numb. The reality that I'm not going to make it to see 2021 is setting in and I'm okay with that. Im only disappointed because I tried so hard my entire life to be a good student and a good daughter just for everything to crash and burn. I never even had any fun in highschool. I was just depressed because of how much work I had to do and never had any fun. I just want to be young and dumb for a couple of months before I end it.
