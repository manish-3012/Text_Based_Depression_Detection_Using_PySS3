Very depressed...need help.A friend of mine suggested reddit could help that people will help here...so i made an account. 
Anyway, 
I have been very depressed lately. its my 3rd year in college and all my professors suck this semester which i think is the reason my depression has gotten so bad. I suffer from what i think might be PTSD. I am not certain. i have no money for counseling. I was wondering if i could talk to my school psychologist...i don't know how legit they are or what the process is. i was wondering if anyone would know? has anyone ever talked to a school psychologist? are they nice? does it help? 

EDIT: Thank you all again for replying. it means a lot to me. =)
