The last person I trust is leaving me. I don't think I can go on.I really don't want to go on living. I already gave up on life last year but he came along and stay with me the past year but now as I start to get better like he always urged he said it's too late and he wants to go. I can't. I don't want anything anymore. I just want to die.
