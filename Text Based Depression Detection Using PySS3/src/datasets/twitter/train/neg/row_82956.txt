I am ending it all tomorrowI have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety 2 years ago. Professional help didn't work because they always say the same shit. Nothing has changed and i feel even worse. I am addicted to Xanax. I plan on killing myself tomorrow because i don't see how i can change anything. Just wanted to say goodbye because i feel like this is the best place for it.
