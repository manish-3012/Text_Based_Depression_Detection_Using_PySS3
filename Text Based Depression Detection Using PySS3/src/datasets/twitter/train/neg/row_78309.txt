I'm so lostIm almost there, im supposed to go to college, get a job, i have a girlfriend who loves me. But i still feel so fucking broken. Like no matter how far i get its always gonna feel so soul-suckling awful. Im too fucking demotivated to even try and find a therapist. I couldnt even call back on job applications today. All ive done is cry and be a self pitying black hole. I just cant keep feeling like this anymore I dont want to die but nothing helps. Im so sorry for everyone i know. Im just a broken person in a broken world.
