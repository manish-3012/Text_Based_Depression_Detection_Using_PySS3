I need someone to talk toLook for my whole life my dad has been abusing me. He would throw shit at me and often hit me and sometimes even throw sharp forks or objects at me. This has caused my mum to suicide leaving me with the pain of a man. My dad would also sometimes throw his own faeces at me when i was a child and forced me to eat it otherwise he would abuse me again. This constant abuse is too much and i cant take it anymore, someone please help i just made a reddit account to post this.
