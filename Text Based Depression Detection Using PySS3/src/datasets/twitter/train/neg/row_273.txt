I'm a broken, unlovable person.I found out today I lost a friend because they had romantic feelings for me. I'm devastated to say the least. But I came to the realisation that im a broken, unlovable person. I have severe trust issues, I cannot ever get into a romantic relationship because I just cannot trust. I will fear they will leave or cheat on me. Now I'm second guessing all of my friendships. Maybe they don't really like me. Maybe they'll break up with me, and im just a lamb waiting to be slaughtered. 

I will never find someone. I just cannot. Not even a friendship, they always fail. I don't know what's wrong with me. I just keep getting hurt. There must be something severely messed up with me that I just can't seem to figure out. There will never be someone. I can't do this anymore. Everyone leaves me, everyone hurts me. I don't understand what I did wrong.
