I think part of the reason why Iâ€™m so fucked up is cuz I wasnâ€™t raised properly and lived an extremely sheltered lifeIf Iâ€™m being honest, I donâ€™t think my parents were fit to be parents. I donâ€™t think I was raised properly at all. I know people have it worse but for most of my life I felt an extreme detachment to the world because of how my parents raised me, I felt so much emotional neglect and I feel like they (more so my dad) had children just for the sake of it. For 17 years of my life it was just go to school, go home go to church and the cycle would be the same. My dad would spend most of his time on the computer and not really talk to my sisters and I. My mum would go to work come home watch TV. I spent most of my life just inside the house and not being exposed to much, I feel like they didnâ€™t really â€œraiseâ€ me I was just there, I wasnâ€™t really taught important life lessons. They were extremely strict as well. I wasnâ€™t allowed to do things normal teenagers would do such as party late til night. I wasnâ€™t allowed to stay up past 8.30 even at 17 years, and making us hand over technology. Trying to hide mature topics on TV from us such as â€œsexâ€ â€œabortionâ€ â€œpregnancyâ€ saying â€œThis is not good for kids go to your room.â€ Talking to me like a baby. Even one day I was at work and my dad goes â€œare there boys?â€ Like really wtf Iâ€™m 16. Just treating me like an actual child until I became an adult and now Iâ€™ve been thrown into the real world and I feel so fucked up and behind from everyone else itâ€™s so messed up. Idk this probably sounds so messed up but I just had to get it out there.
