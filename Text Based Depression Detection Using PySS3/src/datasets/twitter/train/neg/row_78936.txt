I thought I was getting better.Itâ€™s been over a year since I wanted to seriously kill myself. I had a note planned out back then but went to therapy. Hashed out some of my problems / depression of 10+ years.. but after being discharged 4~ months ago from therapy Iâ€™m back in this never ending pit of despair and loneliness. 

I just want to take a knife and end it. Iâ€™m 29 5â€™0 tall and 100~ pounds and Asian. I just want to have affection or find someone to grow and learn with. But I never had success relationship wise. Iâ€™ve never even had a girlfriend. Ever. Iâ€™m so sick of doing everything by myself and feel like I will never find love. I have tried improving what I can change. Going to the gym, personality, my passions (music and arts). But I always am good enough to be the friend. 

Iâ€™m tired and honestly donâ€™t think I will win against any of this societal standard that seems to go hand in hand with opportunity. Aka be the handsome somewhat tall manly man.
