I been really tryinI've been depressed since I was real little. I think it runs in my fambly, which just kind of makes me feel worse about it 
I'm 18, living on my own &amp; going to school w/ a scholarship. I go to counseling (but it's getting 2 expensive), trying to see a psychiatrist, buying books myself . doing anxiety and happiness meditations and all this shit  

but nothing helps me too much 

I know the logic bhind why suicide is stupid- but geeeee whizz, that sure aint doing me any favors 

I just feel so bad and scared all the time that the only way I can describe it is that I want to kill myself. 

&amp; I feel like I wouldn't till I was good and old or everyone I loved was dead or something else 

but the narrative in my head is I want to die I want to die I want to die I want to die 

maybe I'm lazy, too, but homework and work and any life thing just kills me 
I don't care, I have no energy, it's pointless to
me 


edit : 

and I've never had friends or been In a relationship 
I've always felt so weird, my whole life, like I was in a movie, disconnected 
not a real person
