I think I'm going to try to kill myselfI'm driving right now and I think at some point I'm going to try to kill myself. I expressed my suicidal feelings at my boyfriends house and he let me leave after this cry for help. I've tried crying for help to all my friends and family in every possible way and nobody cares. Nobody has tried to talk to me or help me but they all know I want to kill my self.  So I'm probably going to do it I'm not 100% sure but I figure if I am going around 80-90 and I hit something solid I should hopefully die. this is my very last cry for help
