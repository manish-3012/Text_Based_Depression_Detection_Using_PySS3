Hiding Why I wanna die...Hello, I'm An 11 Year old girl who is bullied and Tried Overdosing before. It didn't work as you can tell but I'm still thinking of it and wanna try doing it again but like always everyone stops me since its like "Oh you wanna die from bullies grow up!" But that's not the reason. My reason is because I'm scared of my dad, sister, myself etc...
 So should I Keep it to myself or just tell them it's because of them I wanna kill myself?
