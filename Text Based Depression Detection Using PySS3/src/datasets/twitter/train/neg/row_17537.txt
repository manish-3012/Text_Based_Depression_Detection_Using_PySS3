I just can't make close friends and it is literally killing meI do have a group of friends and some outside of the group--but no one really wants to be a close friend to me...

Someone has told me that I'm a little different-although they apparently saw themselves a friends with me (I did not)

Someone else was fine being friends but has told me I am not a priority in their life. He has made no effort to include me in much of anything for a bit now while I continued to extend the friendship branch for a long time hoping for it to grow.

Other friends of friends make minimal to no effort to talk to me. Even though I try to ask some of then about themselves.

Another friend will talk to me and agree when I say lets meet up soon. But then he essentially will imply he is busy and send me snaps of his partying over the weekend

My first ever girlfriend was only with me for a week. Blamed me for her mental health issues and told me we essentially had nothing in common. Like Idk how you would know that in several weeks but you do you 

I am having suicidal thoughts but I don't think I will act on them. I am just somewhat sick of being lonely and struggling to form close bonds socially. It is like whatever I do I can't win.
