Almost broke down in the middle of my work shiftI work in a restaurant, I see people bring their families over here and enjoy a meal cause God knows why. Today there was a group of 30 that magical came in and decided that they wanted to eat here. They were hugging and exchanging gifts and saying that they were lucky to have this whole week off of work to see them. While I'm busting my ass off just to make rent and other bills. One of the people from that group saw me and walked over to me while I was busting a table and they told me that "you must not have any family or friends to see since your working, it's sad that there's people like you." They just smile and said "God bless" and went back I stop what I was doing and was shaking. My manager saw that someone was talking to me but he didn't know about what. I grab my bust tub and walked as quickly as possible to the back so I can cry. But I couldn't right than and there I just wanted to end it all, I've been working 6 days a week this whole month just so I can live in my apartment, I don't have the luxury to take any days off. My manager went up to me and ask what happen all I said was it was nothing. At the end of the day I when I clock out my manager ask me if I needed a ride home I told him I was just going to walk but he insisted. So I went with him, he ask me if I'm okay cause he notice that I wasn't really talking as much as I usually am. I told him what happen and what's happening at home and I started crying when we got to my apartment he hug me and told me that everything will be alright and just to hang in there. I feel ashamed and embarrassed that cried in front of a coworker especially my boss. I don't think I can show my face to him since he saw and heard what's really going through my head and I'm not the happy go lucky girl he see every Tuesday.
