I want to end my life this month.Now, I currently am in eight grade and there is quite a lot of reasons why exactly I want to end it. I do not want to get into too much detail here due to shame. Anyway, I pretty much have been suffering of depressive episodes the last 2-3 years and I'm having one again and living is absolutely unbearable, especially since I've developed an anxiety disorder to that. My question here is how to properly explain this to my friends and family so that they won't be too sad/mad when I'm gone.
