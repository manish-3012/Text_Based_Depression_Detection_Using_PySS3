I tried to kill myself last night.I have been depressed for about a year but these last few months have been unbearable. I don't care about anything anymore. I don't get any joy out of the things I use to or anything. I stopped caring about work and was fired on Tuesday. The one thing that was keeping me going was my best friend/roommate, but I fucked that up last night. So I tried self inflected overdose but I didn't work. I just want to see him happy, I don't want him to feel this way. I can't feel this way anymore, I just want it to end.
