There's no hopeNo hope at all. I keep saying the next year is gonna be better but it isn't. 2020, here I come. Another year of the same, except worse. Slashing myself with my fingernails and praying that death comes soon. I hate myself. I was born broken and I don't think I can ever change. I am simply a shitty person. Better to just cut my losses and shrivel up and die. The only thing that prevents me is causing grief to my family. Maybe if I move far away I could do it and someone could mutter fiction
