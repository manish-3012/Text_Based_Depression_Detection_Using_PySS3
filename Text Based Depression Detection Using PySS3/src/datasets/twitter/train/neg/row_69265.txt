I just want to end my sufferingI'm so tired of how I feel. I do therapy and meds and coping skills and my sadness doesn't go away.
I just found out I'm bipolar and thought I was okay was having meds and finally being stable. Then my boyfriend says we need a break but doesn't know if it's a break forever or not. He gives me all these lines like "I love you but I need some space and I don't know if it will be for the whole summer or not." or "I want to be the best boyfriend for you but treat it like it's permanent." or "I will call you when I'm ready, but I don't know when that will be and this relationship is alot of weight right now." or "I hope we can come back and have a powerful relationship again."
I'm tired of giving so much to people and sacrificing so much of myself for them. This wasn't what I needed. I did so much for people and when I needed help they left. I'm tired of suffering over and over. I just want to go.
