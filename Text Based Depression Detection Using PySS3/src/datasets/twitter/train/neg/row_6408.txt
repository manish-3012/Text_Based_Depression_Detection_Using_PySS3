I get closer to Suicide every day.More and more over the past few months I have been contemplating suicide. I've been depressed for a long time, but haven't truly considered doing the deed until this last year. Now it finds its way into my thoughts daily.

In my eyes, life is meaningless. I wake up, I eat, I go to school, I go to work, I come home, eat, then sleep. This same cycle happens every day, and I can't find any logical reason to keep going with it.

All of my hobbies that I once enjoyed do nothing for me anymore. I don't get any enjoyment out of my life, and I can't say I've actually felt truly happy for years.

People always say that it will get better, but this isn't the kind of issue that gets better. I feel like this is just what the rest of life will be like, doing nothing but working for money to buy survival needs and meaningless materialistic shit. That isn't an issue that solves itself, it's just how life is, and for some reason people are really intent on accepting that fact.

I'm not quite to the end, but I can see it from here. The only reason I haven't yet is because of my family, because I don't want to hurt them. But i'm getting there. 

Suggestions on what to do are welcome.
