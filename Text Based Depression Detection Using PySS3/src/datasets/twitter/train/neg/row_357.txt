Why only people who kill themself fast are suicidal?I see people smoking and dying of lung cancer in 20~30years...no one says they are mentally ill. I see people not caring for free health care and voting for politicians who are against It and not being able to pay for It...no one calls them mentally ill. Why is It considered mentally ill to want to end suffering but not causing it to one self?
