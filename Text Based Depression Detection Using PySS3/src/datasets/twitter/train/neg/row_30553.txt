I threw up the pills. The pain I'm in is nothing compared to the humiliation of my failureI'm back. 

What a sad affair, when someone who finally decided their fate comes crawling back for any morsel of sympathy when destiny denies her.

Why write about it? Am I seeing sympathy or validation? 

Maybe just a pair of eyes. To know I exist. Still. 

I should try again. Go quietly to try and redeem myself. To have control over one thing - my own death. 

I sort of fetishize control in my life. Anorexia, exercise, college courses, being a nurse. I throw myself into these challenges and they give me some relief.

Or they used to. 

Now I am 15 pounds overweight, thanks to antidepressants I started when I lost my caregiving job. I had to drop my online courses. And instead of running, I sleep. 

I have no more control. But it would be easy enough to try something more foolproof. Pills are finicky. 

But I could try something more. 

I was scared of other methods. But I'm running out of options. Fear no longer stays my hand.
