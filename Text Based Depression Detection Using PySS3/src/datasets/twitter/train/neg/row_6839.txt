why keep trying if there is no point?why can't i try to stop my suffering without being judged.

"it will get better"

why make the person live and suffer if there is no reward at the end. it doesn't get better to some.

"get help"

 don't force people to do things they don't want to do. i want to die and i don't want help and i am doing it. don't force me to do that. it's unnecessary.

i would love to die a painless death. i don't want pain.

i want to free myself from this hell.

kill me someone. i don't have the strength to do it.

i just wished assisted suicide was more common and accepted by society than it is now.
