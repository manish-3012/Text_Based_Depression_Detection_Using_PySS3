Please Iâ€™m too young for this, how can I save her...Iâ€™m 17, Iâ€™ve always helped out depressed and lost people, but now my own girlfriend is going through the worst. She lives far away now, but we are always talking and I canâ€™t physically help her anymore. Her ex told her that she should cut off her ugly face and kill herself, random kids from her school would step away from her, some moderator on MINECRAFT (her hobby when bored) said she should kill herself. She always thinks sheâ€™s ugly and fat, and she cuts herself. Iâ€™m so confused, because by the standards of beauty, sheâ€™s actually GORGEOUS AND SKINNY! She attempted to overdose on pills before and failed, just when I thought she was getting better, she attempted to overdose again thanks to another worthless fuck telling her to kill herself.

Why is this world so evil, sheâ€™s so innocent and quiet. Everyone wants her to die and she loses trust in me because she feels Iâ€™ll end up like them too. I love her from all my heart, but she will never listen, she is stunningly gorgeous and cuts herself still. Iâ€™m too young to be someoneâ€™s last communication, help me...
