Nothing helps anymore.This is the first time i ever posted something like this online. 

I never truly had friends, i couldn't get guys as friends because of how much of a F*g i dressed and acted like, females are understandably right to not be friends with someone like me. I didn't care about it that much, it still hurts though. 
I tried therapy and other related stuff, but i ended up never going back to any of those. I started to recently believe that no one ever really gives a sh*t about guys, only because what of what I've seen written about us having a higher suicide rate. 

I used to be on medication, but nothing worked so i faked it by practically saying "i feel alot better, thanks." Obviously i stopped seeing my doctor after that. 
I don't know if speaking about my childhood trauma is allowed, but I'm assuming it's not since there are certain details in it.
I lost someone in my teens though, and a second time just recently in 2018
I used to punch myself alot in private when i thought i did something wrong or stupid, stopped when i turned 18.
I never felt wanted or loved by family, my mother being dead since i was a kid and my father being distant doesn't help at all

I honestly don't know how to write the rest of this since i don't know how to explain or ask it afterwards. I want to start smoking or drinking since it helped a few times growing up, but i know that it'll only make it worse for me since I'm getting more suicidal everyday thinking about the ones i lost to suicide and sids. 
Killing myself is all that i can think of that may be easier than hurting myself even more. I wanna know how to deal with this.


I also apologize for the way i write/type. I don't talk to anyone as much as i did before, i don't have friends to talk to if that clears it up. 
I get anxious about this topic, and it wasn't really easy for me to post this.
