A nurse trying my best to understand youI think school can teach you a lot, but not everything. I work at a level I trauma center in a dense city with many psych patients. It is an everyday thing for me at work to have suicidal patients. Patients that have attempted, get a recent diagnosis and are now thinking of attempting, etc. I am new to reddit and only recently heard of this subreddit, and I am so baffled. I wish I could reach my hands out to each of you and listen and touch you but I find myself coming back here trying to understand each of your posts. What can I do better as a nurse at the hospital to better serve my patients so that they donâ€™t come back here? Is there even anything I CAN do? Or is society so stacked against some unfortunate people? What can I do as a new person to Reddit to help each other you understand, and what can you help me understand about suicide and your willingness and want to let go? Thank you. Sending love
