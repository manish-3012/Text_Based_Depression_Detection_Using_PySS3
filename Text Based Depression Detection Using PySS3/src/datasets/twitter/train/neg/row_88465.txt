I finally told my dad I was suicidal for 2 years now I feel even more suicidalI feel sick to my stomach, I started crying to my dad because of trouble id gotten to recently and he was asking me what was wrong. I just broke down and said i canâ€™t be helped and was sobbing full on. Iâ€™ve been nonstop crying since then. Iâ€™m getting percocets tonight to numb this fucking feeling.

My dad was almost crying trying to comfort me and I feel like I never shouldâ€™ve told him. He has to live with the fact Iâ€™ve been wanting to die for 2 years in silence. Someone please talk to me I feel weak
