Any parents who lost their child to suicide, whatâ€™s it like?Firstly I apologize as this is a difficult topic to discuss, Iâ€™ve been very suicidal this month due to low university grades, a recent breakup, no social life , lockdown blues...   However I keep thinking about my family especially my mom who knows tht Iâ€™m suicidal, and she worries about me all the time. That is whatâ€™s preventing me from going, I love my family to death and Iâ€™m 99% sure Iâ€™ll get though this and live for them. However there are days where my depression surpasses rational thinking and becomes that 1% where I feel hopeless and that suicide is my only option.   Parents who lost their child to suicide, how has the suicide affected you afterwards?
