Had an amazing day in London....On Saturday I went to the Distant Worlds concert and did some other cool stuff in London with my best and only friend. Now I'm on the train back home alone and the entire time, even during London and during the concert, I've been stuck in this disconnected suicidal state. 

I resent the fact my friend paid for a Â£200 day pretty much and I felt like I was too much in another world of anxiety and suicide to enjoy it properly. I appreciate the experience though.

All I can feel is that its a fitting last experience, I enjoyed it and yet knew the whole time that I can never afford to live a consistently fun and comfortable life. I hate myself so much and I've never been in such a busy place since my mental issues have stepped up.

All I can think is that I should just finally hang tonight. I have a little bit of weed left to smoke, I need to write a letter begging for my cats to be left in a good home and explain all about their needs but otherwise my mindset seems to evolve over time and each depressive spout seems worse than the last. More apathy, understanding my limits and being unable to accept. Etc etc

Wish me luck, peace out. All I can't stop worrying about is my cats because I know they love me and I know nobody else really knows them and I just want them to go to a good owner.
