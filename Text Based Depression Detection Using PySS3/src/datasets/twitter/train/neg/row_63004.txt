What even is the point I'm a robotI work 40 hours a week on minimum wage and live in a studio apartment where I can only just afford to pay my bills and keep my car up since my girlfriend left me on my birthday about a month ago. I'm addicted to diazepam and have been at that battle for about 5 years now and am slowly getting myself off but it's so hard I can't cope at work without them but have to to pay bills and live.


A year ago I used to put up chandeliers for A lighting company on a comfortable salary but I was sunbathing in a park and a council truck that was emptying bins didn't see me laying on the ground and drove over my stomache and I almost died and have horrible scars and ptsd that I have to live with and if don't have weed or alchol I mentally refuse to go to sleep. I feel like a robot working 40 hours and coming home to nothing and I'm fucking sick of this life I just don't know what to do, I haven't got friends or family just me, and work, and then rinse and repeat just so I can be poor and depressed. 

What the fuck is the point please?
