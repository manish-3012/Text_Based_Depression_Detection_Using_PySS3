roadim a little less sad than normal cause my bf was angry at me for joking about almost dying. i was driving in a car and a truck driver in front of us had an accident. if he wasnt so good at driving i could have died or ended in the hospital. its just the car that got badly damaged. im less sad because it shows theres at least one person that cares if i die that is not my parent. it was an interesting day because i was staring out of the window and thought ,,if god really loves me he will kill me today". maybe it is a sign but i feel like it doesnt mean anything because i always wanna die. my mom always tells me i have a guardian angel and i can slowly believe that part i guess.
