I donâ€™t know what to do?Iâ€™ve been thinking about killing myself since the second grade, but it was never as bad as now. I think about ways to kill myself daily. The only reason I havenâ€™t done it yet is because of my mom and my grandma. They say they need me in their lives. I feel like Iâ€™m not going to make it past 18. Everyday I think about how there is no need for me in the world and it would be better off without me. Am I just a coward? I keep on telling myself Iâ€™m going to kill myself yet Iâ€™m afraid to go through with it. Mostly because I donâ€™t want my body to be found. I want to like just disappear off the face of earth.
