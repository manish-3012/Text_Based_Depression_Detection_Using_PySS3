Help me pleaseI tried to commit suicide by getting drunk and taking all my depression meds/panadol/ibuprofen/nuromol tablets together with more alcohol, and just ended up vomiting most of the night. The next morning I was still awake and shaking, was taken to the hospital and given fluids and sent home. Spent a week at my mums while she monitored me. I still feel like I'd be better off being dead. I have a noose made up in my wardrobe and I think that if I take a handful of sleeping tablets with more alcohol, hopefully I'll just slowly pass out and then just choke in my sleep. But I'd rather just go out in my sleep, and not need a noose.

Please help me end my life. I just want to know the right concoction of drugs I can get that will end my life as I sleep. Something i can get from a pharmacy or supermarket that I don't need a prescription for. I want to be found in bed asleep, not hanging in front of the door.
