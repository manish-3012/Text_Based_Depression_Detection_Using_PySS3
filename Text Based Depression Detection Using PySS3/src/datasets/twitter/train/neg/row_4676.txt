Ive just had enoughIm sick of getting my hopes up just to have them knocked down. 

Ive been depressed and suicidal for the past few years. I recently finally saw a future for myself: starting over in a different country and doing a job I like

I got hired for the job and everything was settled and taken care of, ive said my goodbyes to people and I was supposed to fly there in the beginning of april. Then corona and the whole world shutting down ruined the only thing I was looking forward to

I feel like this was my only way out but im stuck here at home. Im not even supposed to be here anymore. I am supposed to be there

Now I feel lost and im back to rock bottom. I know for sure if they keep adding months to the lockdown time im not gonna be able to handle that

I just stopped leaving my bed. I dont care about anything anymore. I cant sleep and I binge eat.
I know one of these days I will snap
The bad thoughts are already in my head again.
