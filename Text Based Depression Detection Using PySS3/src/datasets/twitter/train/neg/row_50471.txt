I just want to stop existing but I don't want to hurt anyone who cares about me.I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like my life isn't worth living anymore. I have been depressed for around 4 months now and I just don't know what to do. To be honest I have a pretty good life. I have a family who cares about me, I have friends and I used to be so happy. (I'm 13 by the way) But now it seems like nothing matters anymore. I've attempted suicide a few months ago and I have been somewhat getting better but now I feel like I'm back where I was before. I'm so tired of trying. I just want to disappear. But I don't want to hurt my family or friends if I do anything. I can't take it anymore. I know that other people are going through this and that I'm actually not alone but I can't help but feel isolated from the world. I really don't know what to do and I don't know who to tell because I always feel like I'm a burden and that I'm holding my friends and family back from living their lives. I know I'm not going to try to kill myself but I just can't stop wanting to.
