14 years later, I can't shake this feeling...Ever since I was young, I've felt that I have no right to be alive. My mother abandoned me when I was almost 3. My grandparents who raised me told me I was unwanted  time and time again. Yadda yadda...
Whatever, family is useless and the cause of so, so many problems nowadays. 
It's the fact that every. Single. One. Of my friends has left or betrayed or simply decided they were too awesome for me. I've lost so many best friends in the last five or so years. My best friend of fourteen years over her stupid boyfriend who stole from me. I lost animals who helped me through abusive situations and one child, and my now 3 year old daughter (only for a while, I have her now). Everyone just played it off as me having a "Pity party" and dismissed me as being weak for being abused, or weak for getting out of the situation. I've given all I could for these people. I have tried my hardest to be a good person. Even though I hate myself I act perfectly normal, even confident, and people.still see me as weird and unlikeable. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm the one who works and keeps the house clean, but beyond that I'm not sure my kids would care all too much if I weren't here. Before you say it sounds selfish and whatever, listen, my son will barely look at me, and though my fiance is the disciplinarian, my daughter will say 50 times a day she loves daddy but will not talk to me. I just want to give up. 20 years of pain is too much...
