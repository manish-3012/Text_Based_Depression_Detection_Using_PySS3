Drunk. Its just been so hard everyday. I cant keep my mind off death. I already miss this woman who commited suicide. She was a dietician. She was so beautiful. I just wanna join her but im so fucking scared. I already attempted so many times. Im a fraud at work. Im so got dam lazy. My mind is warped, irrational, and just full of flashbacks. I have no idea how to deal with any of this. I literally have over a 100 demons inside me. Peep this, if I can barely deal with a single thought then how can I deal with darkness? Idk . Im kinda drunk and will drink more. Its suppose to rain tomorrow and Ill be biking to work. Should be fun. But thr countlesa flashbacks are going to be a living hell. I thought tonight if I drank more then that would eliminate my fear when I try to commit.
