I need help srsly.Hey guys i'm going to start now and say that my grammar sucks and to get the fuck over it. i'm also 16 and live in Canada if that somehow helps you guys?. Now if i'm going to be honest right now i don't know where i'm at and i don't know what the future holds, recently I've been having suicidal thoughts and just thinking how i would kill my self if i ever committed which i probably will sooner or later. One of the main reasons i don't want to kill my self is because i don't want to put the burden on my family, even though they're one of the causes i want to ultimately stop existing. Now don't start making assumptions on why i'm having these thoughts if i'm going to be honest my social life's not bad i have lot's of great friends who i assume love and care about me but don't take any of my suicidal hints seriously. My love life is not bad I've done most of it and i'm acc a pretty good looking guy. so that's not one of the reasons one of the main reasons is how people treat me, for example a lot of people just dislike me for no reason and I've been told they just assume i'm a faggot(not gay teenagers just say it without any context), one of them is my really close friend who even told me himself that he thought i was a fag but when he got too know me i turned out different and not what he expected. Long story short i don't like how my little sister treats me, with absolutely no respect, i hate being judged for nothing and getting bullied at school for no reason and if i tell i'm automatically a snitch and get even more  hurt than before. lifes fucked i don't see my self going anywhere my marks are dropping i'm failing English now and i don't know what to do someone help me get through all this please.
