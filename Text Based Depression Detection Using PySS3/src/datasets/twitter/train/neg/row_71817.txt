PLEASE HELP - my friend came over to my house threatening suicide. He is asleep now, what do I do when he wakes up?My friend has been in a downward spiral for a long time now. He is 31 and perpetually abuses drugs and alcohol. Over the last year he has had numerous run-ins with the police, and he has a court date in two days. He keeps coming to me to talk, and I keep trying to convince him that it is a good idea to talk to a counsellor. I have tried everything, including going with him to his therapy sessions, but he doesn't trust any figure of authority. He thinks that the people at the psychiatric hospital are just extensions of the police.
Tonight he showed up drunk on my doorstep at half past midnight. He keeps talking in circles about how he fucked up his life, and I can barely get a word in edgewise. He told me that he has tried to kill himself three times in the past year, and wants to do again because he hates himself. He also said that if I call anyone, be it the police or the hospital, that he's just going to run away and hide, and since he is much stronger than me I really couldnt stop him even if I wanted. I managed to convince him to sleep on my couch so that he isn't out in the cold, rainy night and so I can keep an eye on him and make sure he's safe. I don't know what to do when he wakes up.

TLDR: A suicidal friend is sleeping on my couch and refuses to seek professional help. What do I do when he wakes up?
