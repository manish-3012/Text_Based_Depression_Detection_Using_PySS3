The day has arrivedIâ€™m so excited and nervous and scared at the same time. Iâ€™ve been planning this for over a month and everything is starting to come together. I have no need for notes, my notebook has all the information of why this is happening. Iâ€™m partly sad my family will be upset but itâ€™s my time to go. Iâ€™ve realized happiness is an illusion and nothing will change that. Anyways if this fails Iâ€™ll most likely just try again but I wanted to share this so Iâ€™m not alone in it all.
