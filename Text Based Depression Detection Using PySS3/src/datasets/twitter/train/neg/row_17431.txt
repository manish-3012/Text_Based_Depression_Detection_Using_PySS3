I'm killing myself in a few hours, need company and attention.just ordered my last meal (chinese... with fried chicken). I need to do it in less than four hours, since my mom will get home in 5. I just don't have anyone to talk to so I thought i just might chit chat with the least judgmental ppl i could get that are up to discussing it... I don't want to be alone rn yk. I've been too lonely my whole life, I just wish I could talk to someone who didn't antagonize me for my pain at least in this day.

i'm trying to not cry too much or to be over-dramatic, but even walking around was so overwhelming today. I kinda shuffled around like a zombie lol. I'm just waiting for my chicken.
