I don't knowI'm confused and conflicted with emotion. I got really depressed these last few days over multiple thing. 

The first was washing dishes and cleaning a big knife when a thought passed me to just stab myself. It thought I briefly cried but it passed. 

Today they were talking about opioids on the radio and deaths and I recalled a friend who killed herself a year ago earlier this month due to suicide. Kinda the same as they lived but yet ended it too soon. It was just hard especially with the earlier thought this week

And on top of this I'm going to a Halloween event by myself as I've got no one to go with and it kinda just all hit home. 

Add another thing coming up and I just don't know. Im living by definition by feel like I'm dead on the inside
