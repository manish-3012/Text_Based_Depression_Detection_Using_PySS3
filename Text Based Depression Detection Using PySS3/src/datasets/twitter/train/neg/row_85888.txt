I'm going to distance myself from absolutely everyone I know, that way when I kill myself it won't hurt as much for everyone..18M. Here I am. At rock bottom. 

Not too long ago, I told myself I wouldn't end it all specifically because I wouldn't want to hurt anyone. 
Well, I'm too busy worrying about other people 24/7 and have been doing so for years.. it's time I start thinking about myself.. 

I don't want to fucking live anymore.. I have absolutely nothing for me. I'm a senior in HS by age yet I'm 80 credits behind.. I no longer find my hobby fun and I am quitting the club I'm in.

So I have devised myself a plan.. if I push everyone away and distance myself for a few months it would do 2 things.. people will feel less attached to me as I will be known as "that one guy" and being alone to myself for an extended period of time with no contact with anyone will just encourage the act of suicide.

I am sorry I have failed you mom. My death will be my sincere apology. I love you. I matter but I don't matter.
