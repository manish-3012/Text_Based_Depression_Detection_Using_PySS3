Life is no longer worth it.I have tried. Will I live to see my 20th birthday? I don't know. There's something wrong with my head. I feel mentally ill. I won't go to the hospital. They can't help me. I've seen psychiatrists. No medication has helped. Everything is just piling up on me now. No money. Car just failed inspection, I can't afford to repair it, I only had enough to pay for the inspection. 
I just started a new job after my last one became completely unbearable. That was my last ditch effort at happiness. I don't hate the new job. But I don't get paid for a while. Dad told me to get a full time job and move out. He has a lot of money. He won't help me. Every time he spends more than $20 on me he holds it over my head. Even groceries. I said, I'm supposed to be going back to university, aren't I? But I don't know how that works. I was there before. I was in a car accident and had to stop going. I get migraines now, the ones that leave me blind for several hours. Apparently there are no medications for it that would help. 

As I'm typing this he slid a note under my door that reads, "You have 1 month to figure out what you're doing with your life". I think I will end it.
