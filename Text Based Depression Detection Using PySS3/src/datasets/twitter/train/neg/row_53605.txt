My head hurts and someone probably stole my mailI'm content with my life so far, I don't have much responsibilities, I just have a routine. Then there's my fucking mail, fucking USPS, they say my shit was delivered at 2:22 in the afternoon but I know that fucker doesn't come at that time but what do you know? I come out of a nice bath at 2:44 and run outside to grab my shitty TCG cards and smartphone from my mailbox, oh fucking shit, there's just an flier from Amazon. A few days later and all I have is this cheapass case that I can't put on a cheapass phone I bought from eBay because the USPS guy was probably a lazy turd and delivered it somewhere else and those ghetto ass people will probably be enjoying my shitty $5 TCG cards and broken ass $20 phone.

Or these USPS fuckers were just too lazy to deliver my crap on time and are fucking with me. Hopefully my packages will come tomorrow, I'm getting migraines from my paranoia.

I don't want to be poor and filled with stress, it makes my head hurt and I'm already tired to add to that. I should probably get a doctor, I'm probably hosting some parasites from drinking water directly from a garden tap a while back.
