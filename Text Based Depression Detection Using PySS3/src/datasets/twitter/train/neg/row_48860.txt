What is the reason to stay alive?There is no purpose in having a job or raise a family
All of this one day will be gone. I feel like I'm a slave of the society, money doesn't make any sense 
They are useless just like me 
Nothing I do other than drugs make me excited or interested, everything is so boring I just wanna end it
