I don't feel comfortable asking for the help that I need.I've never been able to talk about it, mostly because for most of my life I didn't even understand that it was a thing. I had no language for it. I simply felt and behaved different than what is considered normal and socially acceptable of my assumed gender. I learned to try to hide it as best I could, but that never really worked and I've been bullied and rejected for it all my life, by both men and women. I've never met anyone that I felt comfortable expressing myself to, despite trying to repeatedly. I feel like suicide is my only option because I know that if I were to tell anyone, even my doctor(s), I would feel even more ashamed and embarassed because then someone knows about it. The thought of revealing it makes me physically ill. I can't bring myself to speak the words out loud to anyone. I have no significant relationships with anyone anymore and I have no interest in working for a living just to merely survive when survival itself has no sense of reward for me. It literally can't get better because I can't change my natural self and society at large doesn't accept people like me, no matter how much popular media currently says that.
