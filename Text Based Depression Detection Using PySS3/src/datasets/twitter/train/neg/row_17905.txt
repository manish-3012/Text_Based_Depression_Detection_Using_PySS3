17 and ready to dieI've been depressed since i was 10 years old, thats almost 8 years now,

Suicide was always on my mind since i was 12 years old, doctors told me i had autism, Dad left me when i was 2,5 years old, my grandpa died because of cancer, got bullied my whole life because i have a huge scar on my cheeck (scooter handle cut through my face) i saw a 5 year old girl getting ripped apart because she got hit by a truck, hands, arms and legs flew around, blood everywhere, her body was stuck between the wheels. Truck driver commited suicide even though it wasn't his fault nor the girls fault.

I was around 14 years old when it was finally time, i was done with everything. I was happy it would all come to an end.

I cut my wrist, lost a lot of blood but was still very calm, i heard my brother screaming and crying, apperantly he saw everything but couldn't help because i locked the door. Ambulance arived really fast (too fast). I am 17 years old right now with a scar on my wrist, i never tell anyone where it came from, not even my best friend. 

i dissapointed my brother, my mom and dad, stephdad and every fucking human being. I am a total failure.

recently lost the love of my life and i don't even know why. I gave her everything, she was broken and i fixed her with my last pieces, 
A week ago i gave her my last piece, nobody can fix me right now

I really hope someone tries to rob me and shoots a whole clip in my body.
i'm not afraid to die.

I don't want to fail suicide one more time.

Sorry for waisting your time, and excuse me for my bad English, it's not my native language. 
Sorry, sorry, sorry
