Itâ€™s too muchIâ€™m maybe an hour away from taking all of the antidepressants I have in hopes that it might kill me. Itâ€™s not the first time Iâ€™ve felt like this. In October, I took myself into the emergency room because it was either that or jump off the top deck of Ohio Stadium. 

Itâ€™s been a long road. I grew up in an emotionally abusive home, I survived an eating disorder, an abusive relationship, rape, bullying, death threats, and a few other suicide attempts. Iâ€™ve been in therapy consistently for 6 years, Iâ€™ve spent 2 weeks in inpatient, I graduated from an intensive outpatient program in December, and Iâ€™be been on meds since I was 18. Iâ€™m not getting any better and Iâ€™m starting to lose hope. 

I just donâ€™t know if I can keep pretending I have hope. No matter how many good people may be out there, there will always be those ones who take and take and take from you and suck up every last drop of joy you could have felt. I donâ€™t care if you think that â€œno one can make you feel bad unless you let them.â€ Itâ€™s exhausting. Iâ€™ve spent my entire life so far drowning in hate from other people and as much as I try to make it seem like it doesnâ€™t get to me, it hurts so deeply. No matter how many good things happen, it will never take away from the pain of people taking and taking and taking. It will never stop. I donâ€™t see the point in fighting anymore. If I kill myself now, Iâ€™ll get to end this pain on my terms. I wonâ€™t have to pretend anymore that Iâ€™m strong or that it doesnâ€™t bother me or that Iâ€™m hopeful that there are still good people in the world. It doesnâ€™t matter if there are good people in the world. Every good person in the world wouldnâ€™t be enough to get rid of the pain I feel from the people whoâ€™ve hurt me. 

Itâ€™s too much. I just donâ€™t want it anymore. I think of how peaceful it would be if I just let it all go and Iâ€™m filled with so much relief. 

Iâ€™m sad for the people and things Iâ€™ll have to leave behind, but even those arenâ€™t enough to save me. Iâ€™m not the best girlfriend and my boyfriend will move on just fine, itâ€™ll roll off his back. My friends will miss me and maybe theyâ€™ll even cry, but theyâ€™ll move on too. My family will hurt, but my mom will make it about herself anyway and soon my life wonâ€™t have even mattered. Every group Iâ€™ve been a part of will suddenly think I matter to them when they havenâ€™t cared about me for as long as theyâ€™ve known me. But after Iâ€™m gone, theyâ€™ll just manipulate the fact that Iâ€™m gone to make themselves seem more appealing and to capitalize on sympathy. It wonâ€™t be about me, itâ€™ll be about them. 

I wonder how long itâ€™ll take for them to find me gone. If I overdose in my bed right now, I bet itâ€™d take at least a day or two before anyone even noticed Iâ€™m not here. My boyfriend would probably call before bed tomorrow, but when I donâ€™t pick up, heâ€™d probably just text me and go to bed. One of my roommates couldnâ€™t care less about me and the other is out of town til Monday, but even then we donâ€™t run into each other around the house much. I guess by Monday night when I donâ€™t show up for my sororityâ€™s chapter meeting, people would wonder whatâ€™s going on. Iâ€™d miss calls until my phone died or my voicemail filled up. Maybe then my roommates would check in on me, but mostly theyâ€™d just be annoyed about how inconvenient it is for me to be dead in their apartment. 

Iâ€™m just ready for this pain to be over. Itâ€™s too much. I canâ€™t start fresh, I canâ€™t get over it, I canâ€™t move on, I canâ€™t heal. Itâ€™s done. At this point staying alive is just torturing myself. 

I donâ€™t want to die but I canâ€™t keep on living like this. Please someone help me
