I don't knowI genuinely want to die. I have been wanting to die for years and years on end.  I don't see anything wrong with it. I keep trying to find ways out, but I feel like I'm trapped by life. I understand that suicide is permanent, and that's what I want. I take medicine only to throw it back up, I've tried to drown myself only to have my survival instincts kick in, I can't overcome my fear of heights, I've tried suffocating, etc. The only thing I can think to do now is blow my brains out, but I have no idea where I would even get a gun, much less have the money for one. I'm plain out of ideas and everything seems useless. I've gone to counseling and it's not helping. They only tell me what I already know. I can't live with the way I am and I can't find a way to die. I don't know what to do.
