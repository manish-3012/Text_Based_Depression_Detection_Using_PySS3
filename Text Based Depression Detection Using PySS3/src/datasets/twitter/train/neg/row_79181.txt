Woo yeah! Summer break!The time of year where I dangle of the cliff of depression, loneliness, and suicidal thoughts the most just because I have no one that cares about me or that I can talk to!~ 

Add to that that I can't fill the void with trivial social interactions and you got yourself a recipe for disaster!~

Really makes me question my choice of becoming a high school teacher.

Edit: does anyone actually have any good tips to combat this for a loser like me?
