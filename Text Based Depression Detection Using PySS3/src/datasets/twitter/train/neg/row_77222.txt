I donâ€™t know what to doMy gf of 5 years left me for a different life style. She placed all of the blame on me and lied about her reasons of breaking up. She said I was being emotionally abusive and she wanted to focus on her career and be single and alone for a while.

Sheâ€™s now something else. Sheâ€™s posting pictures of her body on tumblr and is getting into this whole â€œdaddyâ€ bdsm kink. It makes me feel so sick and pathetic to know that she left me for this life style. I know she is free to do what she wants, itâ€™s her life, but to see someone you gave everything to and spent your life with for 5 years just disrespect herself like that kills you inside. She left me to go find a â€œdaddyâ€ but of course she wouldnâ€™t tell me that. She doesnâ€™t know I know any of this, and honestly I wish I didnâ€™t know it.

I feel so fucking inferior and pathetic, knowing she left me for this. Plus placing all the blame on me, which ate me alive for weeks. I wish I had never fallen in love with her, she was so manipulative and controlling towards me but I fell for it all. It kills me to know that I wasnâ€™t good enough for her, even though I sacrificed so much for her and supported her and everything. I was not a perfect boyfriend, but I always tried to make her happy. I trusted her throughout the relationship until towards the end when I began to feel unloved and noticed she was changing. Thatâ€™s when I became insecure and paranoid. She would always snoop through my stuff, accuse me of things, and controlled me, but the second I begin to assume somethings wrong, Iâ€™m the one over reacting and am called emotionally abusive. She wouldnâ€™t let me communicate, so I didnâ€™t know what to do. All I had left to do was worry. I wanted to trust her again but the lack of communication made it so hard.

I feel so fucked over and empty and pathetic. If someone that was with me for 5 years would leave me like that, then who would ever want to be with me. Iâ€™ve worked on myself since the break up, and have received tons of compliments, but I still feel empty and not good enough. I made my ex so happy and gave her everything and took her everywhere, and it wasnâ€™t enough. Everyone tells me she was the abusive one, but I donâ€™t know what to believe honestly. My head feels so fucked I just want her out of my head I got so damn attached and she just threw it all away so easily.
