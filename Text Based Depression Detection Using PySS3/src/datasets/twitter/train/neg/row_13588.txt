I honestly don't know where else to goI don't see any point in this. I've gone way past the point of feeling guilty potentially leaving anyone, i just don't fucking care anymore. I'm gonna bitch out tonight but it won't leave. Its always there and I honestly don't know what else to do anymore I just cant take this. I don't care if I have a future and i really don't care if it gets any better. Absolutely none of it matters
