Always in my thoughtsI feel badly posting here seeing so many people in crisis and I know I'm not there yet, but I don't know where else to put this and I need to let my brain vomit.

Killing myself is always so close on my thoughts, sometimes just the words 'kill yourself, garbage' or other times detailed plans and imagery and imagined sensations in explicit detail. It feels like the default thought in my head is that I need to die and it's only by conscious effort I remember why that's bad. I've attempted twice before and it's like a switch flipping or a scale being overloaded, suddenly all the reasons to be alive don't matter.

I live with my boyfriend and see a therapist. I feel like such a bitch and dead weight when I see how worried he gets. He insists that he wants to know when I feel like this but I can't tell him. It's all the time and talking about it doesn't really help. My head feels like it's exploding all the time, my mom just got diagnosed with terminal cancer and therapist she I are exploring the possibility I was abused and forgot it so now I feel like I can't trust my memories. I don't even know what I'm asking for. It's hard to fight all the time
