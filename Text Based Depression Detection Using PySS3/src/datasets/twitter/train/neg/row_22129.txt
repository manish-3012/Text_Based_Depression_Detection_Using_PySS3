UndecidedI'm not saying that I am going to do it.  I have no plan to yet.  I don't THINK I will.  But, the thoughts keep popping into my head.  I had something terrible happen to me this morning.  I don't want to let them get any worse. I WANT to live.  But the thoughts keep trickling in faster and faster.  Help please.
