I'm essentially counting down the days for when I become a failure.I have one last year of highschool before I'm forcefully thrusted into the real world. I haven't an idea of what to do or how to do it when I graduate, and I have zero idea where I could turn to. My idea is to work in a trade field and work on my actual passions on the side, but trades aren't my passion, they'd just be a job. So that could fail easily. Furthermore, I can't simply take a break after highschool because my family wouldn't allow it one bit. And besides my family, I'd be 100% alone, since the one very close friend I have is leaving for the airforce after we graduate. So I'll be alone, lost, a laughingstock, a disappointment, mentally destroyed, and most likely suicidal all in one tight bundle. This year is, quite literally, going to be the beginning of the end for me, and I've never felt more dread or anxiety for anything else in my entire life. I better enjoy this last year while I can. I'll be just like my parents. Poor and with dead dreams and aspirations. Here's to failing.
