I'm not sure I'll make itI've gotten close to killing myself in the past, but I'm so afraid that I'm not going to make it through this week or the rest of the month. I feel like I'm walking on thin ice and about to plunge through. I've had a lot going on in my life. I should be using this time to figure out who I am, but I don't know who I am anymore. I only see what I've become. And that means I'm a toxic asshole that just causes pain to everyone around me. I've failed the people that I love. I'm not sure if I can keep going knowing what I've done or who I've become.
