Each weekend is darkerI have entered a depressive down for about a month currently - and it is a lot more deadly than the past ones. My last one which was last spring only rose to suicidal plans. This well, is much worse.

I almost did it. I was set on automation - like a robot - I went to check prices at a gun store, got all my money from home, and drove back to the shop almost laughing maniacally (I shit you not). It wasn't until I got almost to the doors that I broke down crying and freaked out on what I was doing.

I'm afraid one thing is going to set me back into that state - and I won't be strong enough to wake up from it, and before I can do anything, **bang.**
