I see no way outI think i'm done trying to fix my life, i live an empty and ordinary life that doesn't give me any pleasure, nothing makes me feel alive and i'm constantly living in my head in a dream bubble, i have posted on some other groups about the troubles that i'm going through and everyone has been so helpful and caring, i never tought i would encounter such people on the internet, my first post was about why i should keep living if i have so many troubles in life and because of my lack of willpower, i have no desire to do things even if i like them, i received a lot of advices that made me look on others perspectives to my situation and people told me things i have never tought, all of it on this platform, i received so many ideas and advices that if i put them in practice and actually try to apply them, my life would be more fixed and i would certainly be more happy and whole, pursuing my dreams, but i don't apply them, my lack of willpower/motivation and my constant mistake of isolating myself on my bedroom and with my toughts makes me unable to apply any of the advices that i read on my actual life, i just read them, fins them interesting and then never use it, i'm just gonna give up, i'm always on reddit trying to get attention with the fantasy that someone will magically change my life for me, i'm done tryig to fix everything and just going to accept my ordinary meaningless life.
