Dumped by someone I loved, need someone to talk toI posted in /r/relationship_advice if you want details, but I was just dumped by someone I loved because my depression got to be too much for her. I'm occasionally ok, but then I sometimes just get extremely upset about it. It's all my fault that she left, and I can't have her back.

She's gone from my life, and maybe that's good. She should be happy, and I'm not a happy person. But now I'm so alone. I lost my best friend, and she's moving on.

Please help me. I need advice or someone to talk to.
