Iâ€™m 19 and have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for awhile now. I canâ€™t do it anymore, Iâ€™m sick of people telling me itâ€™s gonna be alright with time.Iâ€™m still a teenager and Iâ€™m already done, fuck this. Iâ€™m sick of waking up everyday to go to a shitty minimum wage job because I donâ€™t have the confidence or the determination to make something of myself. Iâ€™ve ghosted all my friends because theyâ€™re better off without me. My dad died a few years ago and my mum hates me. I have no one.

Itâ€™s so unfair that my dad lost his life when he deserved to live it, he was only in his 40â€™s and I wish it was me instead. He was loved and he was a good person, he deserved to live. 

I canâ€™t stand myself, Iâ€™m such a burden to my mum... sheâ€™s so disappointed in how I turned out and doesnâ€™t understand my bad mental health. She tells me to hang on... but what for?! Whatâ€™s the fucking point of anything we do.
