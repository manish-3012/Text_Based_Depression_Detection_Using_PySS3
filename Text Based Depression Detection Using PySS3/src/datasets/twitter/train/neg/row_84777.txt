This is all my fault and I wish I could just end it all..I think about suicide a lot. It takes up a large portion of my thoughts throughout the day.. but Iâ€™m getting to a point where I really think I should and I just wish one person would validate that feeling so Iâ€™d do it..

We are likely getting evicted. When quarantine happened, our roommate stopped paying rent. My SO and I were staying with my uncle during the isolation, while our roommate stayed here with her boyfriend. We paid our rent. They paid nothing. After about two months, we were set to come back. She tells us sheâ€™s bailing on the lease, after already being two months behind.

I should have gotten a job. I have no excuses, my brain just kept panicking every time I thought about it. We are behind and facing eviction and I know itâ€™s my fault. My SO has done everything she could to make sure we didnâ€™t get evicted. My uncle says we can come live with him for considerably less rent.

I just feel like a failure and such a nuisance on my family. I can imagine they are all disappointed and my friends have to be tired of me making excuses, because they have to know this is all my fault.

I just want to be told itâ€™s okay to leave. I want to be done being here and making things harder for people and being a selfish asshole.
