Is there any point?Seriously what is the point. Life is completely pointless. Nothing is enjoyable anymore. I don't understand how people can go about their lives holding down a job, going out with friends and all this pointless crap. I just want to be dead. How do I go through with this?

I'm too afraid to do it but it's literally the only thing that gives me hope. I just wish I could sleep and never wake up.
