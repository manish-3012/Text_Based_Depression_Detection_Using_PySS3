How can I get Antidepressants?Ive been looking around online and a few places say different thing. I am in Aurora,  CO. right now, and I dont have a regular doctor I can talk to, do I just make an appointment? I dont have any money, nor health insurance. I need help. I was thinking that it's time I try antidepressants and see if they can make a difference before I do something I don't think I'll regret. Also, how long would it take to get them? I plan on leaving for Florida in February and if it's a long process I might have to try waiting. Thanks for any help, I need it.
