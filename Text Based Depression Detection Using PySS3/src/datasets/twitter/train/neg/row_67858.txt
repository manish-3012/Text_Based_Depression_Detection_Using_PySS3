Not sure what to postJust feeling invisible, worthless, like I contribute nothing of value to this world. Not close to my family. Not close to my friends. I canâ€™t keep a romantic relationship. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me but it feels like itâ€™s something serious and no one cares enough to tell me what it is. I donâ€™t particularly want to kill myself, but I really donâ€™t see a point to living anymore. What do people do in this limbo? Or to get out of it?
