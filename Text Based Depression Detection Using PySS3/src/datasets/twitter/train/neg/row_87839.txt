I've been abusing acetaminophen this past weekI've been taking about 10-15 pills a day, which is way over the amount that is given alongside with a liver failure warning. Just know, I decided to down the whole bottle of tylenol at work, which was quite a lot. I've just been waiting for liver failure symptoms to kick in for the past few days.
