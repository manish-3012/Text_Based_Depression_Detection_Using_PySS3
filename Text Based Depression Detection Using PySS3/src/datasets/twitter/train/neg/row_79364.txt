I won't fucking be here for another year.Just fuck all of this fucking shit there is no point in living this fucking pointless fucking shit life. I am so fucking broken and there is no fixing this. I am so fucking worthless in any positive way, why the fuck would I stay alive even for others when im just a fucking burden and dragging everyone down. Fuck this. Im gonna try to live past christmas just for my family, seriously there is so much fucking shit, and nothing good in my life, I am so fucking lonely even with my friends. 

My self-esteem is so fucking broken I can't find a one legit good thing in myself, for myself or anybody. Nobody will ever hire me, because I am so fucking dumb, and even if someone did, I would be un-happy doing something shitty for the rest of my "life"

Someone try to give me a reason other than "Everything will turn out to be okay" or other bullshit since I have already hoped and tried to make that happen for too fucking long, just that to be another let-down. There is no fixing me in anyway. I am so fucked. There is nothing to live for, atleast which I could even almost reach.

Goodbye hope everybody else can climb back from this shit, I can't since im born to be this shitty fucking ugly lonely pessimistic jealous shitty loser. I am just so fucking broken.
