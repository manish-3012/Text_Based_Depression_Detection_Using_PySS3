I feel like I'm at a breaking point.I've never wrote one of these, or reached out for help. I've always felt like I'd be humiliated, weak, or ashamed of myself of doing so. But it's different now. Every single day I think about offing myself in numerous way, and it's so overwhelming. I could be walking down the street with the love of my life and I'll still look at the street when a pick-up truck passes by or a big ass truck in general, and just think "Man, that'd be a pretty alright way to go, to throw myself infront of that truck and just die. If it doesn't kill me, I'll be in extreme pain and be put on pain medication which I'd just overdose on and go out in one magnificent rush, yeah. That sounds pretty nice, right?" Or something else on those lines, I feel like I'm destroying myself with my choices, my family hates me and I find very few things to make me happy. I don't know what to do, I've talked with that "Love of my life" about it and still, I continue to pursue suicidal thoughts in my waking and breathing moments.
