Why shouldn't I kill myself? I fucking failed one of my classesI failed one of my classes after my professor humiliated me in front of the entire class. I thought part 1 of the exam was a take home essay based on the vague directions given. I learned, while she singled me out in the class on the final day, that I wasn't supposed to write a take home essay. It ended up being a 15 page paper, and she ripped it right in front of my face aabd threw in it in the trash. 


Why shouldn't I kill myself? I was humiliated. and I have social anxiety. I worked so hard, but I fucking failed. Please help me.
