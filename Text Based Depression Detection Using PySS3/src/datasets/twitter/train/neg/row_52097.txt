incel waiting around to die. friend is locked up, unable to call anyonemad at the world and I don't have any friends I can see on a daily basis. even if I could they never ask about me. they only want to talk about THEIR problems. my best friend is locked up and I can't contact her at all. there are more reasons why, I don't leave the house. I'd really like to kill myself but I bet I wouldn't be able to. and that's another nit-picky type thing given that people love to comment on how weak I am. I would like to call someone but I don't have a phone right now (using my laptop if that's not obvious) and when I try to do the suicide hotline chat it makes me wait for more than an hour and by the time it gets to my turn it won't even let me enter the chat. I don't have many options right now except to post on here. mental health is a joke and when I try to talk to someone about it they say ''yea I understand!'' I'm just annoyed with this life and existence, my life is so depressing. anyway, don't know what I'm trying to get out of this post. last thing I need right now is someone asking me why I haven't killed myself yet or how I would do it.  thanks for reading and be kind
