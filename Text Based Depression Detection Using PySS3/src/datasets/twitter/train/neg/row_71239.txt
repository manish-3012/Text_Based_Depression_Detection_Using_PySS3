I need help finding strength to kill myselfIâ€™m not here looking for someone to prevent my suicide.  I told my parents that I donâ€™t want to live anymore and they laughed it off and told me I was crazy.  Iâ€™ve already decided that I 100% donâ€™t want to continue living anymore.  I just canâ€™t find strength kill myself.  Iâ€™m too weak.  Iâ€™d be so happy if I caught corona or if some looter broke into my house and shot my face off.  I want to either get myself killed or find strength to do it myself.  We have a gun in the house but Iâ€™m not sure where, Iâ€™m afraid to use it on myself.
