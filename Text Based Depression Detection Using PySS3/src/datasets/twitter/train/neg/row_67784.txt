My Very Existence Is WrongMy parents have always treated me like I donâ€™t exist whenever I cry. My mom walked in on me beating myself up and didnâ€™t even say anything. She saw my self harm scars yeaaars ago when I was still a kid and said â€œyouâ€™re such a freakâ€. When I attempted suicide 2 years ago, they agreed to bring me to a therapist. But they still donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m depressed, they said they already provided me with everything and Iâ€™m ungrateful. They shame me for keep seeing my therapist bcs it costs a lot. Its their favorite weapon. â€œWhy did u buy that? Your therapy this month already costed us 300$â€. Maybe it is all just in my head, maybe I am just ungrateful. I donâ€™t know anymore. I hurt myself because it reminds me of the times when I was little, whenever I got sick they would take care of me...so I associated pain with nurture. Reminds me of those times and brings me comfort. I donâ€™t know why they had me in the first place if they donâ€™t want me, they must think Iâ€™m such a bad investment. During this lockdown they wonâ€™t even offer me food whenever they eat out, but they always buy my sister food. I eat instant noodles everyday because I have to buy my own food, Iâ€™m currently a student and I donâ€™t have much income. Idk what I did wrong...I did my best on getting good grades, Iâ€™m sorry that Iâ€™m not normal...I will pay them back someday. They must be very disappointed that their investment turned out to be like this.
