I am a product of other peopleâ€™s interests.I am a product of my parents who birthed me for their own purposes. I was raised to be something I never chose to be. I was molded to do the bidding of others. I am not a man, I am an asset to others. No one has considered the mind behind the eyes and has only used me to further themselves. My only worth is what others take of me and I am left with nothing. I am nothing. I never chose to be alive and I want it to stop. I do not enjoy this world, I do not enjoy my life, I do not enjoy myself. But I am chained. Chained in fear of disappointment or grief. I am made to please, and if I were to kill myself I would go against everything Iâ€™ve worked to do. I wish to die, but I cannot bring it upon myself.
