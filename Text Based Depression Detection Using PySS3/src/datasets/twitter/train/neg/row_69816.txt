Need to vent in a safe place where no one can find it that I knowI'm just tired.   


I've struggled with depression for 15+ years and need a place to vent.  


I'm struggling with it in an extreme way right now. Its one of those days where I just don't feel like doing anything, my energy is tapped, I feel sick and completely useless. I know it will pass in a day or so, but I'm tired of these days coming every couple of months because while they go away, it takes a week or so to recover fully with my energy levels.

I get scared when I get this low because I know I won't commit suicide on ordinary days but my depression is a focus on suicide. I feel like on a day like this if I get bad news or just something pushes me really far, I'll end up considering it because I'm at that point where it feels like I won't be missed anymore. That I'm just a burden to those around me.

Rationally, I know that's not true but my mind is foggy and sometimes its just like, is it worth the struggle to go on for the next say 50 years?

I'm just tired of the struggle. I'm tired of the fight. I'm tired of being tired.

Today isn't the day I commit suicide, I'm just ready to be done, mostly with today.
