Swallowed by the nightI don't know what to say, just skip over this. I'm 15 (M), my family loves me, everything is great in my life, I'm lead designer for my high school robotics team, I'm taking a ten day trip to costa rica in three weeks. Everything should be fine and for most of the day it is but when I'm alone in my room in the dark i get depressed and even suicidal. The only thing keeping me alive is that i don't want to let them down, i don't want them to blame themselves for my stupidity, i don't want them to be sad because of me. I have a knife next to my bed, i got it for my birthday, its a browning model 908, its beautiful and soon it may be stained in blood. 

I just needed to vent, i don't want to talk about it with anyone in my life but i wanted to get it out so i turned to you strangers on the internet.
