Iâ€™ve stopped caring.Iâ€™ve stopped caring about everything and anything. Iâ€™m not suicidal anymore and Iâ€™ve made a promise to myself that as long as my mother lives she wonâ€™t have to attend her sons funeral. Thatâ€™s the least I can do. But Iâ€™m at the point that Iâ€™m just praying to the god I donâ€™t believe in that I get hit by a bus, get struck by lightning, something, anything to finish this â€œlifeâ€ if thatâ€™s what you want to call it. I just donâ€™t want to send my mother to my early funeral. If I die from an accident I donâ€™t think it would hurt her as much, although it would still hurt, at least then she wouldnâ€™t feel responsible because sheâ€™s not. When I was 19 my best friend killed himself while under my supervision, his father left him with me because he trusted me. He left my apartment and drowned himself... I know itâ€™s not my fault, but I still blame myself every day. I still feel his father hugging me at the funeral every day, and that pain I felt from him... sadly that pain is what keeps me here. I canâ€™t pass that on to my mother. But I want out so badly.
