Iâ€™ve read a lot about what â€œcountsâ€ as a suicide attempt...but Iâ€™m going to ask it anywaysMost of those questions had to deal with some actual harm people did to themselves. Yesterday I drove to a bridge with the intent to jump but the bridge was closed and I went home (short version). I feel like that doesnâ€™t count.

I have a hard time even believing my first attempt was â€œrealâ€ because even though I tried and tried and tried I could never get it to work properly and I didnâ€™t even hurt myself. 

I know some people may ask â€œwhy does it matterâ€? I canâ€™t give you any reasons other than it matters to me. I was pegged as a liar growing up (lied about small things like if I finished my food) and I know that everyone hates someone who self diagnoses throws a huge pity party for attention. Normally when I look back on my actions I overthink and make conclusions about what happened that arenâ€™t true (or so my friends have told me). For instance, after my â€œattemptâ€ July 2019 I would look back on it and realize that the method id tried could never have worked. I didnâ€™t have the right materials, I didnâ€™t leave any marks on my body, and I was able to get up and go to work the next day just fine. No actual possibility of dying, no actual harm = not a real attempt. Same with last night. I just drove around for a really long time and then walked up to the gate, saw that it was closed, and left. I think most people would roll their eyes if I said â€œI attempted to jump off the bridgeâ€ but then find out I didnâ€™t even set foot on the bridge itself.
