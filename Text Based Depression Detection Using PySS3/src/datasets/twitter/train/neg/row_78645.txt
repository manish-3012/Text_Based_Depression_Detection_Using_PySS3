Can't do this anymoreI struggled with depression about 3-4 years ago. Since then, I'm less depressed, and I tend to be optimistic.

Recently I feel like I'm living a lie and forcing myself to be happy when I'm really not. I just can't do this anymore.

I have been disowned by over half my family. My mom,  one of the few family members I know loves me,  is sick and will die soon. I've been rejected by my top two dream colleges. My job sucks. My boyfriend of two years broke up with me. My only friend keeps telling me to smoke and drink.

I just can't do this anymore and I want to die. I've ruined all the important relationships in my life. So many people have removed me from their life. I feel like I can't be loved and I want to die.
