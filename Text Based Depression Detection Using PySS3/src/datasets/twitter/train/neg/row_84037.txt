Should I really just do it?I've been through enough bullshit already. Shunned in high school, could never get a woman that I want, I'm fat, I have family issues, I'm lonely, and I feel like l'm not making any progress in life. l'l never become rich and even if I did, I probably won't be happy. I'm just a fucking loser who catches feelings too early or I just move things too fast. I admit it, I fucking lose. I'm not going to win this race. So tell me. What is the point of living if things are going to keep repeating their self? Find me someone else to go for? What if I don't want to? Maybe the person I want is at the end of the track I can't reach. There is only 1 of you. You never know if you'll meet someone better or worse. You could possibly miss your best chance at such a young age. So, where do I go from here? Why does it always end up this way? Why does it always end up one sided for me? Why do I just have absolutely terrible luck with women and it never goes right? It's obviously my fault. I'm just sick of it. Call it petty or not worth it. I am NOT happy. Everyone's situation is different and people are different. I don't know what I should do. Keep trying to reach the end of the track pointlessly because I doubt l'll even make it. Isolate myself and suffer by myself? Try to seek help pointlessly because it won't work. Or should I just end things right now?
