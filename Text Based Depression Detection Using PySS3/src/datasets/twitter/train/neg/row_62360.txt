Pretty much think about suicide 24/7At work? Thinking about suicide. In my free time? Thinking about suicide. In bed trying to sleep? Yep, still thinking about it. I even have constant dreams about me committing suicide or being killed. It's always on my mind from the time I wake up until I go to sleep. At this point I'm strongly considering going into inpatient care because when I'm alone, I just don't trust myself. I'm afraid of myself, especially after drinking heavily. I'm very reluctant to even try seeking that kind of help because I don't think I deserve it, but I know I need it.
