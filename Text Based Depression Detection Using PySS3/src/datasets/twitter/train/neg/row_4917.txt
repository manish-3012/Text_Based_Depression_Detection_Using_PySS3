Darvon cocktailI tried taking a cocktail of pills yesterday.. it did nothing, except make me throw up. 
This time, I've got Darvon, xanax and gravol. I'm thinking this could work. I've got 250mg of abilify left so I might throw that into the mix. I don't care if I end up in a coma instead of dying, sleeping for the rest of my life would be just as good.
