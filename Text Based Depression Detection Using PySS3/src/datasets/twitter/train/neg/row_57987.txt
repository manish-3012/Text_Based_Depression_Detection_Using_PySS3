Keep having dreams of killing myself then waking up disappointed. Every night .Happened again last night and i woke up burned out exhausted. Went to work and my car is on empty by the time i got to Phoenix. Every penny i make goes to bills and taking care of parents and brother.just want to go get my college degree while im still young but things just get progressively worse every day. Can't save up anything without having to use it on family bills and gas. Just turned off car with windows closed its over 100 degrees out. Hoping i can just pass out from the heat and wake up without this life. Cant even make it through my 20's I dont know how people can go through 70 or 80 years of this.

I dont know why i said this i just really wanted to tell someone and i dont have anyone else that i could say this to. Good luxk to all in this sub i feel your pain i honestly do
