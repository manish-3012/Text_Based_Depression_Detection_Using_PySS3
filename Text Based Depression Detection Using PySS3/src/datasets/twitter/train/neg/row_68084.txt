Struggling to hold it togetherI'm 24 (m) and I literally feel like a complete failure at life. I have got a degree but am currently unemployed and living off my parents. I have been suffering from depression on and off for 6 years now. I feel like a complete joke. I have never had a girlfriend and I am struggling to see the point of anything. I also feel like a very weak person. Just sick of everything.

A lot of my friends seem to be making progress in life, but I am still stuck doing nothing. I have made numerous changes in my life multiple times, but I always end up miserable no matter what. I got a job, but I was even more depressed that I was when unemployed. Moved to a different country, still miserable. I have zero motivation and absolutely hate working with/for other people.

I generally have a pessimistic view of humanity and despise about 50% of people. I can't help this. Every time I try to be more optimistic, millions of things prove otherwise. Why kid myself. 

I abuse alcohol/drugs to the point of blacking out 1-2 times a week. I don't really care about stopping this as I don't really see the point. All that happens is I end up getting bored/depressed when sober. At least when I am hammered, I can forget about how much of a failure I am for a few hours.

I am also pretty sure I am suffering with a serious mental illness. A lot of people have said to me that they think I am mentally unwell and need help. My behavior is completely erratic most of the time (especially when drunk).

I have found myself idealizing suicide recently more often. I just think about how easy it would be to make all my problems disappear. I am pretty sure I am doomed to be miserable anyways so what is the point in going on.

The only reason I have not followed through is because of my family. They are very good people and they care about me a lot.

I need help.
