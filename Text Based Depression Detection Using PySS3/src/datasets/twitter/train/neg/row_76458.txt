i don't want to kill myselfi'm so tired of everything to the point i dont even want to write this pice of shit that will not help me in any way. my head hurts because i need to cry and i kept it all in. i cant stop eatingalthough im a few pounds above what i usually think i look good with and i cant stop hating myself. i keep on motivating myself with little plans and stuff like that but i cant anymore. i havent cut myself in so long, havent done anything to harm myself in so long but the thought of pain is just so pleasent right now. i want to overcome this phase, because i know that tomorrow ill be smiling and thinking wow i am so strong but it has been getting so worse and i literally dont even know if im writing shit right... my neck hurts so much it feels like if i have been screaming for a long time and i cant breath
