Tell me with a straight face that Iâ€™m not supposed to be deadMy qualifications for my impending death:

- almost 25 and living with parents

- no fulltime work

- so stressed my hair is falling out in clumps

- romantically invisible

- gaining weight

- no viable career options

- hideously ugly

- multiple suicide attempts 

- almost failed out of school

- so anxious that Iâ€™ve walked out of interviews and quit jobs right before they were supposed to start

- sabotage every opportunity handed to me

- so far behind everyone else my age that I am functionally an ableist slur

- possibly autistic (not even a joke)

- people only spend time with me out of pity and soon enough theyâ€™ll get tired of how deeply immature I am and throw me to the curb

- more or less a 12 year old in an elderly body

- chronically ill (was hospitalized twice last year because Iâ€™m immunocompromised)

To sum up the case, your honor, I am less than human, practically a clump of dirt, have no use or value to society, the judeo-Christian god clearly wants me to die, the universe would celebrate if I died tomorrow, climate change would immediately be fixed, the only problem is that Iâ€™m too coward to spare the world my hideousness and do it

I recommend the harshest possible sentence, though client is too cowardly for torture but certainly deserving of it. May the client one day have the balls to go through with it to make the lives of everyone around them better

Amen
