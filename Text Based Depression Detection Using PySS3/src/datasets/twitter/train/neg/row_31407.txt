Life doesnâ€™t get betterOver the past few years things just keep getting worse. I donâ€™t see the point anymore.Why should I continue living it seems  like a waste of time.I canâ€™t take it anymore.I donâ€™t remember what happiness feels like.i donâ€™t want to spend the rest of my life in misery.people will be better of without me anyways. Iâ€™m not someone that people like anyways. Iâ€™m not someone that contributes anything. I wish I could just erase my entire existence .
