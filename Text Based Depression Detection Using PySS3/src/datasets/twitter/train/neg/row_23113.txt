Exhausted and at a lossI don't know what to do anymore. Sometimes I feel completely fine, but there's always a lurking voice in the back of my mind injecting nasty thoughts. It makes me wonder if people would even care if I died. They'll be sad for awhile, but will move on. No matter how hard I try to get better, it's just perpetual depression. It's always been hard to make friends, and I have so few. I second guess if they are my friends. My boyfriend deserves someone who isn't a giant sack of sad shit. I feel like I have no one to depend on while sober.
