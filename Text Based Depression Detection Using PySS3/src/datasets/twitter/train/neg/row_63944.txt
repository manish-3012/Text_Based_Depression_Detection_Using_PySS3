Constant Thoughts of SuicideI'd say this has been going on for 11 years or so. Some periods are worse, much worse. Sometimes I feel better though, but I don't actually stop thinking about it. It'll be one of those days when I get out of bed immediately, don t feel over tired and walk around with my head up. Rather than the normal thoughts saying I should kill myself, it ends up being "hey I don't feel like dying immediately today, that's nice". That's basically how I take it now, its a very normal thing.

What concerns me the most is how willing I seem to be about dying. I currently have a lump around the middleish of my chest that I was suppose to get followed up on but never went in. I also have constant pressure/minor discomfort and gurgling in my lower right abdomen. I have no clue what that's about but I have no desire to go get either checked out. If it turns out to be something serious and life threatening I think I'd take it quite well. Seems like the easy way out with very little repercussions to the people around me, hell they'll even remember me as some thing better if I die this way. Or maybe I'm over simplifying a situation I couldn't possibly understand without being in. Who knows, this post doesn't really have a point, I don't talk to anybody about this stuff and today I felt like I could. Its also quite rantish now that I'm reading it.
