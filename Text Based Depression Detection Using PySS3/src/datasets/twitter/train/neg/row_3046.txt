I feel so empty...I think its coming...Im 17...By day, im a student..I have fairly good marks and im studying computer science....going to university soon.By night im security researcher/malware dev. I did many bad things online but thats just me. I dont get statisfaction from anything. I have everything in my life i need...Money..Good education..friends..My family loves me. I dont drink neither somke or do drugs because i simply dont find that statisfying...Computers were basically my whole life for past 6 years aside from playing guitar... I had girlfriend twice in my life. Neither of those two relationships were successfull/enjoyable tho.

Despite all the stuff i mentioned above, i feel really empty and useless. I dont know what to do with my life. Every single day feels the same...I constantly have depressions..All the friends around me are constantly asking me why im being so sad/angry  even tho i have no proper reason for it....

I just feel like i want to forget about everything and let it go....be gone...

I know it all sounds dumb...but i just dont know what to do further. Am i going crazy ? I dont really know...Im feeling empty and useless. 

Sorry for the bad english , it is not my native lang.
