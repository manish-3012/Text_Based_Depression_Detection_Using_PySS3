Can't take this any moreI've struggled with Depression and Anxiety for over a decade and any time I take a few steps forward, I eventually take 10 more back. I tried therapy and medications but nothing seems to work. I feel so disconnected from the world all the time and can't really relate to anyone because of it. I tried my best to live a normal life, went to school and got a job but had to stop working because the entire time I had underlying depression and anxiety issues. How am I expected to function after working at a high stress job for 8 hours a day only to come home mentally exhausted, depressed and feeling like crap? I need to fix myself first before I can handle the real world and after many failed attempts, I think I'm giving up. What's the point of living? so I can grow old, miserable and alone? The many years of hardships are just not worth it to me. I'm going to take a bunch of Fentanyl and pass away peacefully.
