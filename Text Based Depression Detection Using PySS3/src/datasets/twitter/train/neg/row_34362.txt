I can't do anythingI'm in my last few weeks of school which means all the final projects are being assigned. But I can't do any of them. I feel like I maybe could like two months from now, but right now I just can't. I can't do anything  and I can't care that I'll fail. My mother keeps telling me that I need to have good grades so colleges will want me but I just keep thinking that I probably won't have a future to worry about. I've had suicidal thoughts for a very long time but they've gotten more insistent as I think about the future I can't handle. \
