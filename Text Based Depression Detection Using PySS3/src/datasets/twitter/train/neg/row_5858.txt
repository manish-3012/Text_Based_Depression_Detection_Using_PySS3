My best furry friendI don't think I can do this, life. She was the light of my mother's life. I moved in with my dad after mom passed, and the cat and I rescued and healed each other. 
My best friend, the love of my life passed suddenly this morning. 10 years old, no diagnosis.
She's my life. I can't do this life without her
