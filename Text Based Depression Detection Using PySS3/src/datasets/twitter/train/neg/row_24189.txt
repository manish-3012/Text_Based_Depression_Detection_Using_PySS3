Unemployed 6 months, interview dead ends, partner left me, mind unravelingCanâ€™t believe Iâ€™m making a throwaway in this sub, but Iâ€™ve graduated from months of anxiety and depression to full-blown suicidal thoughts. Just wanted to get this off my chest. 

I got laid off 6 months ago(although I had been job hunting since January) from a great F100 job doing tech project management. My partner left me around the same time, and everyday since then has been a mix of anxiously searching for jobs on LinkedIn, refreshing my inbox for application updates, and doing interviews. Iâ€™ve applied to 300+ jobs, done 100 interviews (60-70 going to final rounds), spent 700+ hours interviewing or doing take home case studies, and gotten zero offers. 

I had a final round interview yesterday and all my anxiety about my career dead end, my depression about the breakup, and just feeling like I have no control over my life snowballed into me curling up on floor and crying for four hours. I cried so hard I ended up alternately between crying and laughing.

I know this is a first world problem, and Iâ€™m thankful that I still have a roof over my head and can keep afloat with my savings. But getting rejected over and over again, investing 10-15 hours per company for the hopes of a new job and then start over again, destroyed the last shred of my self-confidence.

Iâ€™m a worthless loser that wasted $300k on college and grad school, and obviously canâ€™t hack a long term career in tech. I grew up poor and am the first person in my family to go to college, so Iâ€™ve always prioritized school and my career over everything else. Now, I donâ€™t really have an identity outside of work. Iâ€™m trying to self-destruct, but my bodyâ€™s getting in the way.

If youâ€™ve made it this far, thanks for reading this scream into the abyss.
