So wow. Iâ€™m so suicidal but I was locked out (for 7 minutes) for posting too many encouraging messages in this forumIâ€™m 58 years old. Iâ€™ve had trouble working with people at my jobs as a chemical engineer. Iâ€™m now living rent free in a friendâ€™s lake house. 

Itâ€™s so hard to get out of bed. I look forward to when the day is done and I can just go to sleep. 

My daughter isnâ€™t talking to me for an unknown reason. My son isnâ€™t talking to me but at least he unblocked me on FB. 

I just want to know what will happen after death. Itâ€™s scary to me but I always want to die. I canâ€™t even think about a reason to get up in the mornings. I think my job prospects are ruined, I have health problems but no health insurance. 

My husband killed him self 10 years ago. We always had sort of. suicide pact. Now maybe itâ€™s time for me to fulfill my end of the bargain.
