Anger helps me want to live.But today I have nothing but sadness in my heart. No happiness of course, which isnâ€™t unusual, but also no anger. Not even a tiny tinge of ire. I canâ€™t even be irritated by the usual nonsense around me. Iâ€™m just void of everything but an abysmal sadness.  

I noticed that when I am angry it makes me want to change the way things are. I donâ€™t understand where the anger went. I have been drained somehow. I donâ€™t want to change anymore. No more mountains for me to climb. I just want to get engulfed by my own sadness. The abyss is so deep, who knows how far it goes. I know you all know what I mean. Thanks for those of you who understand.
