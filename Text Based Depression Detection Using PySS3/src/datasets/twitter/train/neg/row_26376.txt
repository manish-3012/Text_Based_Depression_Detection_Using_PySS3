Right to die in Peace&amp;#x200B;

I think a lot of people associate acceptance of circumstances with some sort of peace of mind and a step towards some sort of recovery and good life. I have accepted my circumstances and still feel depressed enough to feel as though suicide is my best option. I will struggle with a life of depression and anxiety which will cause me constant pain. 

I don't understand why those with physical ailments are often supported when they seek out a peaceful way to die, yet someone whose brain will never allow them to be happy is told to keep looking for help that doesn't exist. I physically feel my anxiety in my chest and my depression throughout my whole body(stomach pain, lethargy, tension) and I don't want to deal with it or fight through it anymore, I just want relief. 

I feel bad for my family if I go this route but right now I feel as though I am suffering alone. And to be honest I feel much of my love for them is not reciprocated in the ways it should be anyways. I am an emotional person put in awful circumstances I won't bother going into detail about, but my life has been destroyed and I can't handle it. I don't feel like I should have to either. I feel like the most isolated person on the planet and if you knew my specific circumstances, you would agree. I will never be able to make the connections and relationships everyone else has an opportunity to and I will forever be cast out in many ways. 

I have been waiting for a miracle to save me, something that would have made it all better, I knew it never was coming but I have finally allowed myself to accept reality and this acceptance is not bringing any peace of mind, just more pain.
