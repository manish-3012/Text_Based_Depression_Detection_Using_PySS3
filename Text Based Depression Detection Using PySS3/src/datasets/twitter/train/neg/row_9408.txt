I don't understand the concept of trigger warningsIn terms of trigger warnings for suicide and self harm. I don't get it. Why are they necessary? Not trying to be rude I just don't understand, is it similar to PTSD triggers where it can cause flashbacks, or can it trigger someone to relapse? I've struggled with self harm but have never been affected by hearing of it
