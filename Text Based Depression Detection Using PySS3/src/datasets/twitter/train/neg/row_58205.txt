Iâ€™m not going to get what I need I am going to kill myselfFuckin everyone is gone.  She said I had a friend in her and sheâ€™s blocked me.

Why has everyone rejected me?  

Thereâ€™s no way to recover from this trauma.  Everyone rejects me.  Should I tell the people who caused me irreparable damage that Iâ€™m going to be killing myself?

God I want them to know.  The people who attacked me in high school and college.  I want them to know.  I want them to feel the pleasure of taking out someone as pathetic as me, the pride that theyâ€™ve cut so deep the wound has lasted all these years.  And if they have a conscience now, I want them to feel bad.  Maybe they will stop bullying in the future. 

I want to send this girl a message and tell her how she lied to me cut deep and I had no support network to fall back on.  

The mental health professionals arenâ€™t doing anything.  I am a lost fucking cause.

Iâ€™m going to get fired soon.  I am wondering if anyone could tell me what happens if I die without a will.   Or if I should make a will.  

Where should I send my money
