I want to die and do it killingI lived for nothing, I had no one and no worth, I was useless and mad and nothing could help me.
She came 

She fixed me, she touched all the right cords of a broken violin to make a beautiful melody
I loved for her
Now she's no more
Someone decided that he would lie to her, falsely exposing me as a liar, I'm feeling like shit 
I want to find him, eat him alive, make him feel the pain he deserves, to then die, realising revenge didn't bring her back 
I hate myself
I'm sick
I'm sad
