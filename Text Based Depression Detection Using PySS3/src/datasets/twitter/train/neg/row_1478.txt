My only friend just said im stubborn and toxic.It's the last thing I want to hear and the only friend I have just explained to me how I'm "too much" 

I don't know what to do anymore. Like fuck dude I'm only fourteen but I can't see myself turning fifteen at this point. When I reached out to them about all this- because to be honest I'm scared- they just distanced themself. I've completely given up. I'm either losing or lost everyone I ever had and cared for. 

I regret ever reaching out to anybody man, it just makes me lose them. In a weird way I feel like I deserve all this. Clearly I'm apparently toxic, to be honest I don't know how but I am and I feel awful, and filthy and disgusting. I hate my own existence, I fucking detest it. I can't do anything right. 

Sorry there's so much going through my head at the moment I'm a clusterfuck.

Lmao I'm so broken 

Anyways, I wish I don't wake up tonight. I wish that every night but I wake up anyways and I fucking hate it I hate it so much.
