stupid idea for easy solution...I feel trapped in my relationship (5 years so far) and I don't know, I love him, but I hate him. I struggle with depression and loneliness is one of the easiest way to trigger a really long low point, so I think I'm very dependent on him to keep the status quo. I really want to leave the relationship but I'm too afraid to end it and my go to solution is always suicide and oh my fucking god do i know that's stupid, but I feel so trapped and scared I don't know what to do. It feels like if a leave the pain will never end and I'll just end up killing myself anyway when I can't deal with the combo of loneliness, depression, and loss... idk i know it's stupid but my dumb brain just loops to the same option every time because I don't know how to handle this situation.
