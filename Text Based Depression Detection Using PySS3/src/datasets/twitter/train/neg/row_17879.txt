I just want to die in an accident or be killed by someone. Cannot suicide, but I guess death that isnt through suicide will be okay. I only live for my family. Family is embarassed of me.I have always been living for family, now I am getting to the point where I wonder how long I can live before giving up, because its exhausting and my will weakens. 

There are too many people in the world and the country i am in is also overpopulated. One death out of many wont really impact, and even if I stay alive, I will be useless and leave a meaningless life being a burden to everyone. 

I know my family is embarassed of me, but I also know that they still love me. Even my small sister thats like 14 is fine with my elder or small brother dropping her to school or so, but if its me and noone else is available, she doesnt want to be seen by me, even though at home she interacts the most with me and messes with me. 

I also am sure that any friend or anyone in my life around me will always be embarassed to be seen with me, I am a mess and mess up at everything and I dont deserve to be alive and live. I also do not want to be alive, I dont want to feel, I just want an end, I dont care if I go to hell, I dont care about life after death or not. I just want an end. My family didnt deserve someone like me to be born. I wish I could be replaced and someone else could take my place in my family. I know that besides family love, I will never have any other and even if someone claimed to love me, I could never believe them and feel like they would eventually leave me, cheat on me and things like that. I hope I get kidnapped and killed or run over by some car someday.
