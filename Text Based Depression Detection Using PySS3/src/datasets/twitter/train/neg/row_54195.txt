When I actually started to seek helpI live in a first world country. And although our mental health system is no where near perfect, I know there are avenues here that others cannot access at all; like how we have free councilling but the catch is that the waiting lists are very long. 

I read in a book that having suicidal ideation is a life threatening situation and you can call your emergency services or visit a doctor. So I sat in a doctor's office and gave them the wrap of how i was feeling. I sat in that room for a few hours at the doctor's office until Urgent Care could get ahold of me- a service which bounces you around to the appropriate place to get help. 

Once they did contact me they booked an appointment for three days in advanced and I walked out of there on my own accord. I thought it was a little strange they just let me... leave. I thought I was a danger to myself, but walking out of that place made me feel like nobody else believed I was a danger to myself. There is a very fine thread keeping me holding onto life right now. 

Three days later I visited a mental health centre within a hospital and gave them a similar wrap. 'I want to kill myself all the time' 'suicide is very appealing to me' 'yes I have 5 different ways i could do it at the top of my mind' and at the end of that conversation they let me leave on my own accord again with a nice big prescription. 

I don't want to take drugs.. I don't necessarily want to be admitted to a psych ward or something... I'm not sure what I want but I didnt want to be sent to different places just to end up with medication. None of this has made me feel safer. I'm still a danger to myself :(
