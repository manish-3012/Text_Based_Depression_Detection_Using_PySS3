...I am 14 (turning 15 in a few months) and I want to kill myself nobody notices that i am suicidal...........or do they? Well I've tried to so many times before but they where all failures because i wasn't 100% committed. the reason why i want to do it is because first of all i have always been suicidal ever since i was 6-10 i remember being in my room trying to hang myself at the age of 10 or younger because i thought that i was worthless and useless (back then i didn't even know that suicidal was a thing and what i was doing and thinking was apart of it). Now it has come back but worse than before because every single week i am bound to have a break down or get into a fight with my parents or siblings. Now i am done with the world and i just want to do it i just want to let go and forget about everything and everyone because they all remind me of something that just fucks (sorry for my language) me over and makes everything worse!!! BRUHH I AM DONE!! NOTHING can fucking keep me happy or stop me from ending it anymore now i just want to do it and i know that nobody would care in my family but my friends  i think..............................I hope will!???....

Well all i got to say is that i know it is selfish but nothing can keep me numb any more from the pain because right now i am looking for something that will last in make me feel nothing and right now the only option is to let go.......
