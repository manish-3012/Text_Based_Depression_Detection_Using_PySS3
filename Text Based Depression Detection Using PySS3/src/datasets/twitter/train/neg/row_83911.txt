What I realizedNo matter how suicidal I am and long to be free and to be one with eternity , I still like to have fun, listen to music, laugh , write, act silly. 

I could be planning my suicide for that day but I still want to have fun before then . The fun I can never turn that off and I'm sure if I was rich in could manage staying alive when though being chronically suicidal
