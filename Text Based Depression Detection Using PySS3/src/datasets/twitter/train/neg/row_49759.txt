I'd say its kinda a weird reason to live but, I really like Minecrafti started playing it like when i was 10 back in 2011 and watching videos now of the game it reminds me of when day's weren't stressful, and a place/time when i was at peace with myself. Kinda like if you've ever had a favorite stuffed animal growing up, and you're still fond of it to this day. Lol i started to tear up right as someone was slaughtering a ghast, not cause he was dying, but because I realized how much of an improvement this little game has made in my life.
