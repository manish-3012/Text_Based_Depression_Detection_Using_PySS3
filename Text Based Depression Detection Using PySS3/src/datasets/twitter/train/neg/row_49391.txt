I give up for good this timeI've had social anxiety forever it makes it so hard and awkward to talk to people then pair that with my low self-esteem I'm basically a spectator in most conversation everyone realizes this and it torments me knowing. My parents hate they say they're gonna send me away to rehab because I can't stay fucking clean. My head is so plagued with suicidal thoughts every time it's like a goto solution for me. Instead of actually solving the situation I lay in bed and think about somewhere to tie a stab myself because I'm too much of an unmotivated shit to fix any of my problems. Nothing is fun I can never find a reason to get out of bed in the morning other than to go pop more fucking pills fuck xanax but it feels so good to be that confident person I've always wanted to be. Everyone in my school knows I pop pills I'm known as that crackhead guy. Deep down I know suicide isn't the answer but straight up if I was born into a life where I am constantly battling my brain then I don't want to live. Maybe I'm just some edgy 15 year old but one thing I can assure you is my life is going nowhere anyway. Besides, the drugs are gonna kill me anyway. Not sure when I'm gonna do it today is one of those days if you know what I mean my mom just screamed at me and called me a "fucking disappointment" so I might go get it over with tonight I'm sure she'd be happy to have one less bourdon on her hands.
