[Update] I post short suicide-themed remixes on Insta daily, check them out[Original post]( https://np.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4qbf64/i_post_short_suicidethemed_remixes_on_insta_daily/), [my Insta](https://www.instagram.com/fingerdrum5000/).

So it turns out that most of the likes and comments I was getting were made automatically by an app that likes/comments/follows on behalf of a real person who only picks the hashtags. It's a paid service ($10 per month, there's also a more expensive one, $10 for three days). I'm not talking about spam accounts, those are easy to spot, they usually have Instagram logo as a profile pic.

I thought those likes were genuine. There are a few Grammy-nominated guys who like my vids, and also lots of folks who work with celebrities. How dumb I was for believing that my remixes are good. 

I have nothing to live for anymore. For the last four months I haven't left the house, I've been making vids every day and hoping somebody would offer me a job as a mixing engineer/producer/whatever (it happened twice, but they haven't returned my emails). I haven't felt so lonely in my whole shitty life.
