Failure is in the eye of the beholderI can do anything! I'm fairly successful and I am awesome at what I do! I have an awesome family whom I love very much and I know they love me the same!

The question becomes is how do I feel about me? Like I said, I can do anything! I'm a drummer, pool player, a master auto technician, and so many other things! Anything I do, I do it well,,,,BUT

In my eyes, I am a failure! Why? Because I haven't done the things I wanted to do,,,, I wanted children!

Having children is very easy but having children with the right woman is difficult! Finding a woman today that is not on drugs(yes, to me pot is a drug) ( and yes, drinking alcohol 4 or more nights till you get shitfaced a week is an alcoholic) is almost impossible!

I'm tired! I know I'm not a good looking guy, but does that really matter??? Yes it does!!!

Hopefully, I can fall asleep one night and wake up on the other side of whatever,,, most likely hell! I'm sure God doesn't what any part of me, I'm sure he is not impressed with me!
