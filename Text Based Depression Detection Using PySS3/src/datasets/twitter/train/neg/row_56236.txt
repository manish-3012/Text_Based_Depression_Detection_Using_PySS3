My Parents Don't Care Me And Neither Do I...I was always suicidal, never cared. I had planned to kill myself on my 17th birthday, I had everything ready- a note, pills, rope and knife. My parents were always negligent,compared me to others,called me incompetent. I **KNOW** I worthless and good for nothing. 

I had fucked up I was texting a man(41 y/o) inappropriate things and pictures(which I feel terrible about) just so I could make some person happy. My parents found out what I did, confiscated everything I own didn't let me leave the house,they found my suicide notes too so they took me to a psychiatrist.

After seeing my self harm,and my condition The psychiatrist **strongly** suggested I **should** be admitted in a hospital(Psychiatric care).The first thing my dad says He wants this **'**behind closed doors**'** because if people find out He'll be extremely **ashamed of me**. He can't have his pride hurt. I still don't get why is what others think more important than me; but I guess that's where all the problems started.

My mother was crying,guilting me and I couldn't fucking tell her she wasn't helping the situation much  and she was always the main problem. FFS. My parents **hated** that I had go to a psychiatrist and psychologist; they eventually after 3 visits forcefully stopped sending me saying that I'll become a drug addict and always asked me "Why can't you speak to us? We understand you!" Who was going to tell them that speaking to a psychologist and family is different **\*sigh\***

 I thought my older sister might step-in since this is a serious situation and my parents think she's great. But Our relationship(sis and me) is also bad, always getting beaten up(not a sibling kind)But she did nothing didn't expect much either **LOL**

My next Birthday is coming up **\*yeass\*** and I don't know if I want to live or not. I want to achieve my dreams so I prove my parents I'm not incompetent and then tell my parents to fuck off when I'm old enough with a comfortable life. But It's just a dream you know for know I want to sleep or die.
