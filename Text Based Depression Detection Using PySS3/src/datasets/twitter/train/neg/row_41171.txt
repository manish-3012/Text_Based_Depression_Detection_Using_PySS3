I think it would be better for everyone if I just wasnt around anymoreIm not using a throwaway because I dint think I particularly care if people see me like this anymore. I dont know how to say this in any other way than this:

I'm a fundamentally bad person. In the past I've cheated on my then partner and alienated the closest friends I've had all my life and I just genuinely think I'd be making the world an objectively better place without me.

I've tried to be a better person before but every time I do I convince myself I've changed and then do same things I've always done. Its 1 am right now and I'm thinking of calling samaritans because I keep having thoughts about stepping out in front of a car or injecting an air bubble into my bloodstream and its scaring me. What do you do when you're a bad person at your core no matter what you do?

Please, I need help.
