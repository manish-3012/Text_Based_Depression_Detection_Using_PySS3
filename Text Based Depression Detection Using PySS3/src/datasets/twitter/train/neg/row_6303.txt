When Suicide Shouldn't Be PreventedWhen the pain overrides all the joy of a person, when no one really cares about the suicidal anymore, when the existence of them becomes a burden instead of a joy, when there is legitimately no hope for recovery, suicide prevention becomes bullshit, killing themselves would be a better option. But of course, do it in a civilised and least painful way to reduce anymore suffering the person will go through. No?
