"Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping"A GOT quote and poniente one at that. What am I supposed to interpret this as meaning, nobody wants to save me. No friends, no lovers, no family to care about my wellbeing. Whenever somebody ghosts me or otherwise tries to lure me into a state of apathy what am I supposed to take it as? I am worth nothing to no one, I am the persona not worth helping, the person best left behind. My mental health makes me and everyone around me miserable, I would rather be dead. I hope I have the courage to kill myself because that is simply the best option. Not worth it, that's all I've been told, and it's the truth. I am worth nothing, just a worthless maggot sucking off everyone else, I feel like Gregor Samsa and I can't stop it. Just comment on advice to end it quickly, or none at all. It's up to you. I will probably end up killing myself regardless, this is my greed. Decide where you spend your greed, I must again reiterate though I am low on the totem pole. Thank you and again, please leave suggestions to end it ASAP, I've been thinking about ending it by jumping off of a parking garage, but that seems messy , anyway GG lads later nerds, see you in the afterlife.
