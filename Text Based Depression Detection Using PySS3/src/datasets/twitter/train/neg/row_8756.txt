I'm desperate, I don't know what to do any more.I've posted on here more times than I care to count, second time this week. I tried reaching out to REAL people, and got.. ignored, in what is supposed to be a friendly community. That broke my heart. More than I want to admit. I shared my life with people and they.. looked through me,  like most people do. I'm tired of being a ghost when it comes to social interaction. I'm tired of trying. I just want to leave this crappy world. The only thing that has made me happy has been illegal substances (Nothing heavy) and I don't want to end up like that. I'm constantly depressed otherwise, have been for 11 years, and I don't believe I can get better. I have to be with people to be happy and I have 2 friends left that are too busy to hang out with me, and I do not have the social skills to just.. make more. I've tried, just makes me feel like more of a social ghost. 

I really cannot stand another day of this.
