Death should be a choice. If you want to die there should be a way to do it.I personally believe that death should be a choice that we can all easily do because personally where I life theres no guns so a quick way out isn't an option. I think that we should have the choice if we want to continue to live because we where bought into this world not by choice so atleast give us the free will to leave this world when we want to. We are literally all fucking this planet so let the ones of us who want to leave have an easy way out. it will be good for the planet and also really good for us. Because sometimes you just need to escape yourself and you can try getting help iv done it. iv been to so many therapies iv opened up to people about it. Iv also gone to doctor all with no success because what iv realised is that people can't except death as on option because where still just to underveloped it takes us lifetimes to change who and what we accept but this needs to change becauee we are all equal and should all have the option to do what ever we want with our lifes because we didnt get it willing so why force us to stay in it.
