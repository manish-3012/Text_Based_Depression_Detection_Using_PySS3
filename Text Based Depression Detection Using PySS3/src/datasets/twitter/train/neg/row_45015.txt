I feel so lonely...My name is Mykaell, i'm a 16 yr old. I feel lonely because about 6 months ago I left home with my dog from my momÂ´s house to go live with my dad because she would hit me and let her anger go on me for most of my life with her (15 years), I had enough and so I left. 1 month later my dog dies and my best friend who lives in US leaves our 6 year old friendship. On top of that I donÂ´t really have friends, I have 3 friends just to go out with but they donÂ´t really care about me; my dad is always busy with work, I have 1 stepsister (28) and 1 step brother (30) who hate me so much, they are always cold with me and they never talk to me unless my dad is around. One week after the dead of my dog I adopted a dog that I had found on the street by my highschool, and another dog that i had found by my house, they give me alot of love but I keep remembering the good old days and it makes me cry. For a while I thought it would all be alright but it didnÂ´t, I found some new friends and i girlfriend but she left me after a while and the friends i met on the school donÂ´t talk to me. I had multiple times thoughts about commiting suicide but would end up snaping out of it, exept this one time where I tried killing my self by taking 8 sleeping pills and some how I survived the 14 hours. I love making youtube videos as a hobbie but im just too lazy to go on. I just feel so fucking sad and lonely. And if you know me you would think of me as a person who wouldÂ´nt think of that or feel that way, you think of me as a happy person, but im not, Im really fucking sad.
