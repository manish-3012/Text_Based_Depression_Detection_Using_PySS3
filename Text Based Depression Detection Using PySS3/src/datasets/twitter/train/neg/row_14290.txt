i donâ€™t even fucking know what to donothing feels the same at all anymore, everything is different. no matter how many times i try to end my life, it never fucking works. am i a fucking dumbass or something?
i donâ€™t even know why the fuck iâ€™m posting this honestly, itâ€™s not gonna get me any satisfaction or goodness, iâ€™m just writing i guess. 
iâ€™m just so fucking sick of this life, everything about it. emotions. one second iâ€™m great having fun doing whatever the fuck and the next iâ€™m feeling like this again.
iâ€™m not even fucking sad anymore. 
iâ€™m just fucking empty.
i always fuck up everything good.
i always push everything away from me.
i can never just do the right fucking thing to do good in life.
what even is the point in this life, get a job, find a partner, reproduce, just so they can go through the same shit we all do. sure you can go travel the world, do shit that feels good to do, but for what, weâ€™re all just gonna fucking die anyway.
iâ€™m sorry for this shit iâ€™m just angry and sick of everything.
