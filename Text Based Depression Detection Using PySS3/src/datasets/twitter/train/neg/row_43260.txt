Job is making me want to kill myself. What are my options?I need this job to return to school. I start almost two months ago and all i am thinking is suicide. Before that same thing happened with school and other jobs and i quit. But quitting can cause problems now. Because i am paying my fathers debts and i have my own debt. I am enthuastic about programming and want to work solo because i am not good with people. Current job is a public servant role with toxic coworkers and work overload. What do you guys think i should do? Quit and face the other people. Dont quit and suffer until i kill myself. What should i do to not want to kill myself?
