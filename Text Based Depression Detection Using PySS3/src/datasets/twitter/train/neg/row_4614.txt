Not sure what, or how to feel anymore.The days seem to blur together now. My body feels weak and I can hardly think when I'm alone. However that's all I am now, alone. The people in my life have cut me out because I am no longer fun to be around. I'm sorry, but the desire to want to kill myself makes it difficult to clap my hands and dance for you. To respond to every text, to smile at your jokes and assure you everything is going to be OK when it comes to your needs. the one upping everyone does to me with their problems, even though I wasn't sharing. People just assume I'm better off when they don't know me and don't want to get to know me.

We don't really have access to guns in my country. However, I often think of taking one to my temple and imagining the sudden nothing that will free me from this dread, this despair and desperation I have accumulated for myself. Maybe if I didn't seek sympathy or empathy in this world I would be better off. Or wish to feel desired or have someone to come home to, maybe if I was OK with being alone for the rest of my life.

Without the courage to commit the act, I just wait in darkness, in silence. Every day while I bring myself to tears surrounded by nostalgia and memories. Sometimes I remind myself of the old feeling, the warm feeling you get when you remember something from way back. Those memories seem to bring more pain than my desperation now.

I'm thrown for such a loop that I'm not even sure if I should feel hollow, or break out into tears every time I realize my place in this world. I feel like I've been cursed, like I am forbidden from feeling any happiness or relief. From sharing this life with another. The remaining people in my world are cruel and abuse my kindness that I feel forced to give. All in hopes that someone will see me. Hoping, that someone will look at me and acknowledge that I was once a human being.
