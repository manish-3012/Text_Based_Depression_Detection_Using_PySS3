Took too much paracetamolI have been struggling with mental issues for a long time. I already tried suicide but always try to keep living in the end. I consider my boyfriend to be my only support. One hour ago, we had a fight starting with something stupid but pretty tough. I don't know why, I have been doing better lately but I couldn't take it. I took loads of paracetamol and now I don't know what to do. I think I want to live, so maybe this is not the right place to ask this. But I'm panicked. 

I'm followed by a psychologist, twice a week, who once told me they would send me to psychiatry if I attended suicide-which wouldn't help my case. Furthermore, I live with my father. I don't want him to know, I don't want to call an ambulance.

I tried to vomit, but I couldn't. My boyfriends keeps on ignoring me and doesn't answer my texts.

I read online that the amount of paraceteom wasn't enough to kill me but could cause great liver damages.

I thank you for your understanding and please, if I'm not at the right place on reddit, please show me the way.
