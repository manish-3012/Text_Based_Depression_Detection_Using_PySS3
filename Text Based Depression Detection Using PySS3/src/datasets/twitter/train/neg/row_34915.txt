Getting rid of my shotgunI'm 12 days clean of selfharm. Lately its been really tough, I can't stop thinking about shooting myself. The thoughts are so intrusive and loud; I want it to stop. I've been crying all day. I decided that getting rid of the shotgun might tone down the suicidal thoughts. Its so scary, because I know thats not really who I am. I don't really want to kill myself.

Guess I don't have much to say. Hoping that posting this helps to keep me motivated to follow through with it.

Hope y'all are doing well &lt;3
