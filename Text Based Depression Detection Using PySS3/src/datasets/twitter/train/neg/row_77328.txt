Life is too hardBarely two months into this year and I don't want to live

everyone would laugh at what's threatening to push me over the edge but I might be failing a module in my second year of college.I know it's hysterical that somebody would prepare to kill themselves over something so silly but it's more the final straw than an actual reason. I feel like I;m so mentally ill and unable to cope with life that maybe I wasn't made for this life anyway

Everything is being held so precariously together and this year has been so bad that I don't know if I can keep going

If I fail?? what do I do??? uni drop out too mentally ill to get a job waiting tables for the rest of my life, I'd be alone and I'd die anyway I feel like I just have to get it done with so I don't have to feel so sick and overwhelmed anymore
sorry

I want to go on
but if I fail university there isn't any point
