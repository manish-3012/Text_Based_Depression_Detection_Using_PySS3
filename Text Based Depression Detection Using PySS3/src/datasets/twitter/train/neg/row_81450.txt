He's killing meI've gotten bad again. I realized I never stopped loving my ex and he told me the same thing, but tonight he told me he cannot see or talk to me because being around me causes him severe anxiety and panic attacks. He can't stop thinking about our breakup and what it did to him. He told me that one day he might be able to be okay with me again, but for now he can't. He won't respond to me anymore and I can't see him. The last thing I said to him was that while he is trying to fix is head, he will be killing me. I opened a fresh scalpel blade from my dissection kit and I can finally stop hurting. I can finally stop fucking crying. I want to finish the job unlike the past few fucking times I've tried.
