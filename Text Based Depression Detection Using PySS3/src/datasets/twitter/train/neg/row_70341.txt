I constantly feel like I don't exist.I've been having a lot of trouble with employment lately, and now it had begun affecting my health. Each and every night I get woken up in a coughing fit, often so bad that I end up vomiting. I'm convinced that it's because I worry so much about my finances. Right now I think so have a grand total of $15. Not even close to being able to pay my bills. I tried talking to everyone I could think of. Parents refuse to help. State is broke so there are no funds for charities to help out. I priced myself out of more menial jobs in retail cause I earned $13.25/hr and people are reluctant to hire someone like that at $9/hr.

I cannot survive as a homeless person. I'd much rather kill myself than go homeless.
