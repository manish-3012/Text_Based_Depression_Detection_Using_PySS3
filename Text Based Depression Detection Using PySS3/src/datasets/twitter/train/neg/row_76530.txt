SCRAMBLED MINDFirst let me start by introducing myself, I'm 15 years old and go to a boarding school, last year around mid October I stopped smoking Synthetic Weed for good after 9 months of everyday use. I was suspended because of it from school and the drug has ruined my brain, in the next paragraph I'm going to say what I feel like right now a year later and if you could include in your comments which parts are normal parts of puberty and which parts are not normal, also advice would be helpful ðŸ˜Š.

So far I feel less detached from reality but still VERY detached, it's as if everything is fake, I can't socialise any more unless I analyse the persons body language and I'm still not good because I'm still learning how to socialise from scratch, it's as if I'm a baby. I feel no hope in life because my brain is so fucked, I have the sense that in my mid twenties I'll end up killing myself because I would have made it no where in life, I also have no empathy any more, what used to anger me doesn't, I'm emotionally flat in other words. I have conversations in my head with more than one conscious, also my personality can change based on the situation, basically I negotiate with the consciousness in my head and depending on the situation one can take over. People in my school are also psychopaths and keep using there body language to manipulate my subconscious into thinking bad things so I do what they want without them having to talk... This doesn't help either, I've replaced my sythetic weed hole with exercise, MDMA and alcohol. Also I can hear things in my head sometimes and be in a very bad mood randomly then in s good mood, I am also eating a lot more healthy to try detox. No one knows about this. This is the first time I've told people since I'm anonymous.

If you got through this long paragraph thank you for your time and decent comments will be valued and read,
