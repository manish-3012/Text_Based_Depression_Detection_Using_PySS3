An interesting titleHave you ever felt like you were reading a choose your own adventure novel and realized much later that you're completely unable to change your decisions? You can't flip back and go well fuck, not that one.

I ended a relationship with a girl I thought I would marry because I'm an alcoholic.

Now? I worked out, I'm fit, I got other girls. It means shit.

I can have intimate moments but the 'thing' is missing. There's no excitement about the person, only an expectation of the next pleasure they'll bring which is another drug to push back reality.

I've often wondered if I'm on the autism spectrum but too high functioning.

I want a family but I struggle against it knowing that my family has a history of mental illness. Why should I roll the dice and put someone else through this?

I have a pivotal moment coming up with work which will determine if I call it quits.

I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe one of my sisters will access my phone and find it.

I feel empty. I have to avoid reality. I compartmentalize the parts of my life. When work is over and it's just me, I can't stand it. The hilarious part is I was overwhelmed by the constant wanting of attention in the moment from my ex. It's not a recent break up.

Wish you well team.
