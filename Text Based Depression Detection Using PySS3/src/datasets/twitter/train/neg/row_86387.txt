I will end it todayI will just start by saying that i had a good live i had loving parents and a nice job but somehow i still was always sad. I moved out of my parents house 1 year ago and i told them that i hate them and never want to see them again and so much other horrible stuff wich i didnâ€™t mean at all i love them i just said it cause i donâ€™t want them to worry about me and forget me so i could kill myself and well now i took a month of work and the month will end tomorrow wich means i need to go to work again but i donâ€™t want to 8 hours with nobody to talk to and i canâ€™t even use my phone anyway originally i wanted to travel somewhere in that month but i didnâ€™t i just laid at home in my bed doing absolutely nothing i was always just thinking thinking of how much of an idiot i am how much of a waste i am i never had friends in my life never had a girlfriend it was always just me and my parents and what did i do i just fucked it up since then i was all alone every day the same work and sleep Iâ€™ve never liked me i always hated me Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself for so long but i never did because i was always hoping it would get better but i doesnâ€™t it has gotten worse iâ€™m so much sadder now anyway i have decided that i will end it today i will now just listen to some of my favorite songs and then go outside and end it all
