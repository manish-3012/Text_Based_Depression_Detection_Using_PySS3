I am disappointed.I can't believe it. I pushed through a relationship I wanted to work, even though it wasn't everything I needed. I am probably going to suffer in all aspects of my life, again.

I'm so upset. I must be so ugly inside. Either that, or I'm too ugly on the outside. Whichever way, I'm just not good enough for anyone. I honestly wish I knew what it was so I could fix it, but I don't. I can never get a complete and straightforward answer.

I really don't know if I can diligently work in any part of my life when I'm like this. I really do know though, that what I've said is true.

I need to get better, we all do. Maybe I could make it through this if I found someone to help me through it. Or whatever.

Edit: grammar.
