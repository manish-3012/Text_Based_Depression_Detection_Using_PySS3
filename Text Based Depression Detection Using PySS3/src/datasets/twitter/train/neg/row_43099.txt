I'm so ambivalent about life this time.There's no heartache and release. I just am not valuable to these so-called. I do not appreciate my own value. I can feel the hatred from my sister. A torn relationship that neither of us can mend but that she seeks to make permanent with endless blame.. it hurts. My father is old and is infantilizing himself for love or whatever. I do care for him but I don't care about him. He's not forgiven.

Yep. But that's just whatever.

I have nothing and no-one to fight for. An 18 yr old girl just made a complete long look of disgust at me. so like....this world....I have no duty I care for. Life will go on. And I wanna know what this whole death thing is about...I'm clearly too lazy for life.
