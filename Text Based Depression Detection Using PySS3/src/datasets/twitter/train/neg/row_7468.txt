Burdennot doing well in school. And don't tell me that bs "grades don't define ur intelligence" they define ur life. Mom says I'm useless and that there is no point of me going there after missing the metro. I'm done. I'm doing it now. 
I have to deal with the fact that I'm an attention seeker and no one seems to give a shit.
 My social anxiety is the worst.  
My deadbeat dad doesn't give a shit about me. Mom is deluding herself in lies. She thinks that by saying a million postie affirmation and thinking happy thoughts is gonna make our miserable lives any better.
It's a simple fact that I'm better off sleeping forever than I am living in pain every day. I'm just a nuisance. I went to a consuler once and they just rushed me through to get to the next person. Even though they were probably busy. I can't blame anyone. I don't want to be the type of person to put the whole blame society or me or my parents. I just don't know. I wanted to visit psychiatrists but my mother says writing 'I am happy' 200 times is gonna somehow make the universe grant me happiness. (she's not against me going) I can't do this shit anymore. 
I try so hard in school. I wanna get outta here. But what if I'm being punished for feeling that?
Not only that I have to see the face of the person who assaulted me everyday and everyone just tells me to get over it.
I had a fight with my mom once and I tried TRIED SO FUCKING HARD to tell my father how much pain I was in and he just laughed at me while I was crying.  Mocking me. Then getting mad yelling me that it was a long time ago and that I should be happy with what I have.
I need to die .
this is too much.
