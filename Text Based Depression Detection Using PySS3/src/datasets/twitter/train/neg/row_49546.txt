My friend wants to kill herself and I want to helpI've known about my friend's depression for a long time but it's getting worse. She never wants to go out and often cancels whenever our close group of friends arrange to hang out. She feels like shit whenever she isn't alone in her room. She's told me she fantasizes about suicide and has started to make preparations. And it had me on the verge of tears.

She's a wonderful person who's a joy to hang out with, has a handful of people who care a lot about her, the only person she has a problem with is herself.

She's been in treatment for depression for almost two years, but she often rejects it or does stupid shit to undermine it, like not taking her pills or smoking while taking them.

She also isn't honest with her therapist and says she dislikes him.

Right now, I want to tell this to the person closest to her, but they probably won't be able to help by themselves. So I'm also going to inform her psychiatrist. Other than that and offering support and trying to get her to *do stuff* I don't know what  else. 

But I want to help more, can anyone help? Right now it seems like she's at the point where doesn't even try anymore and just thinks about offing herself instead...

Maybe it's school weighing her down and it'll be better during summer? But I just don't know anything anymore, man.
