Where do I go from here?My dad is a diabetic, but he wont take his medication and lashes out at us all the time, eats everything in the house and sleeps. He does this frequently, then a few weeks in between he's normal again and then he pulls this shit again. I'm just so sick of it, i know this might sound terrible but i just wish he'd die already, he's done nothing but cause my family pain i can't focus on college because of him, my mom's family acts like we're dead to them, we don't have anywhere else to go...honestly, i feel like taking my own life is the only real exit for me, i just wish my dad understood just how much pain he causes me but it's like he doesn't care, he refuses to tell his family he's diabetic so he takes it out on us. i'm tired of dealing with this, i want a way out.
