My thoughts on this sub as an outsiderI randomly happened upon this sub a few days ago by looking at someone's post history. 

This sub has helped me gain perspective. I never knew what it was like to be in the mind of someone who was suicidal. I'm not going to say I haven't had suicidal thoughts before, but the people here who are contemplating suicide have actual mental issues that I cannot relate to at all. I have 0 friends among other issues, but I haven't thought about suicide in a long time. I'm too big on enjoying the small things in life, like seeing something as simple as a bee on a flower.

But my overall impression of this sub is that it is unhealthy *as fuck*. Everybody here is wallowing in a pit of misery. As an outsider, I get so depressed and worried reading these posts about people thing about killing themselves. It brings me back to the dark days that I had in my adolescence. 

For the people who are suicidal, or the people who are just here to talk, do you feel like this sub is making suicidal people more depressed? I know that it is helpful to spill your beans and get attention and care on your personal issues, but just reading these posts has taken a toll on my mental health to some degree, at least while reading them. 

I'm going to stop coming here after this post, because it is a hive of negativity (not to discredit the helpful commenters, but they are a small candle in a large cave). I can't relate and have nothing to offer. At least I learned something about suicide. 

I don't really have any alternatives, I just don't know if this is a great place to come if you are suicidal.
