COVID set me backHello everyone. Iâ€™ve dealt with serious depression over the years. I am now 30, but in my early teens up until 25 I was a heroin addict. Many of my closest childhood friends passed. In those years I had so many bad relationships too and would say I was mentally unstable and insecure. I didnâ€™t care if I died. I got clean when I was 25 and within a year I was working out and going to school. I got in great shape, made it into an honor society, received scholarships and was usually a star student in all of my classes. I was going to begin my bachelors program in September, but none of the resources where I graduated are available to help me apply places or show me how to access my scholarship money so it looks like school is on hold. On top of this the gyms are closed and I am out of shape and insecure again. Iâ€™ve lost my routine and I feel my mental stability slipping. I feel so disconnected from everything. Suicidal ideation is creeping back up on me. A few weeks ago this disconnected feeling was so intense, I wasnâ€™t getting along with my mom or my girlfriend and my anxiety was driving me insane. I kept looking up ways to do it. Eventually I was sitting in front of a lake near me with a couple hundred metoprolols (beta blockers). I really wanted to just end it. I didnâ€™t do it, Iâ€™m still here but it is scary to think back on. When these feelings creep up I am a hazard to myself. I still feel down, Iâ€™m just trying to keep busy working full time. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m ranting on here, I never do, I usually just comment. I guess I canâ€™t talk to those close to me about how close I am to ending it sometimes. So I came to talk to you guys. Iâ€™m scared I may give in, Iâ€™m full of uncertainty and Iâ€™m crying now that Iâ€™m letting this all out. Thanks for listening
