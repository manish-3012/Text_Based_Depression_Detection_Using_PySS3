Goodbye everyone!My 2020 resolution was to decide whether or not I would kill myself, unless something unexpectedly terrible happens between now and the end of the year, Iâ€™ve chosen life! My medication is doing itâ€™s job and things are looking up for me, and I hope you all can say the same soon. Goodbye everyone, and (I mean this in the nicest way possible) may we never meet again!
