Need helpI've been collecting the materials I need to kill myself. I've planned where I'm going to do it. I have written all of my suicide notes. 

I have been telling my friends that I am really depressed, but I think I've annoyed them to the point where they would like to see me kill myself. I wouldn't be a nuisance anymore. 

Please I need help. I am really concerned I will attempt again soon. Last time, it was an impulsive decision. Please. Please.
