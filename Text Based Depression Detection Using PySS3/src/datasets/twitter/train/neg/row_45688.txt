Should I break up with my girlfriend before I kill myself?Everything seems hopeless the only thing good in my life is my girlfriend. I love her so much we have a long distance relationship (different countries).She knows that I've had suicidal thoughts in the past and attempted suicide before. She said she wouldn't know what to do if I killed myself. Should I break up with my girlfriend before killing myself?

I think if I did she would just think I'm avoiding her and she will move on with her life what do y'all think?
