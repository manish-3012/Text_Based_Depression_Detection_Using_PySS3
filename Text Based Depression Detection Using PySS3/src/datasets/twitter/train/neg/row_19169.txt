What a great week it's beenI don't even know where to start. I just need to write this all down because god knows I can't tell anyone.
First of all the New Zealand mental health system is a complete and utter piece of fucking shit. I mean, I knew that already but even the non-severe help sources are useless. I've been on this medication for two years, I tell them it doesn't work /that/ well and they finally listen, so now I've been dropped off it. Fun thing is, They thought it was a good idea to drop my medication entirely then schedule no appointments until a date that's almost a month and a half away. Way to make me safe.

My room mate doesn't help, she's obnoxious and last night it clicked that I wasn't good, and now she's being far too sympathetic (while still obnoxious, no idea how that's working out) and asking me if I'm okay every five minutes.

Work is frustrating me to no end and I've been removed from every task that used to give me pleasure, now I'm just stuck talking to the most pretentious and sheltered woman all morning while doing food prep with her.
My best friend has always been there for me but she's going through some really, really bad shit at the moment and I don't want to bother her at all.

I sleep past my alarm for work because my roommate and friends decide to do very late nights that keep me awake, then I'm mocked mercilessly at work for being a sleepy teenager who needs to man up.

My self harm is getting pretty bad again, really deep- although it's hard to do when you have a roommate who skips all of her classes and is always at home with you. So when it happens, it happens en masse.

I honestly don't know what to do. I've been in hospital before and my parents are fucking twats so if I do this, it needs to be successful. And I want it so, so badly. But I can't fail.

Then again, knowing me, I'll fail at this too.
