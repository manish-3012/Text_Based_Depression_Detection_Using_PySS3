Why is it too much to be ask to be loved the same way you love someone else?My GF went off to college 3 hours away. We loved each other so very much and had been best friends for years. Well we kinda got over that honeymoon phase and had to deal with each other as real people. Long story short i have trust and abandonment issues and i was always worried she may cheat because itâ€™d be so easy for her to. She not only cheated, but had been for a while and her friends were encouraging her to do so. I had plans to marry this girl and had already put back $3k for a ring and wedding and stuff. I have had depression for a while and have had to go through a lot of stuff in my life but Iâ€™ve always chosen to be happy. This was the straw that broke the camels back. Iâ€™m sad all the time, canâ€™t sleep and when i do i wake up in a panic at 4 in the morning without fail. I barely eat. I just go to work and come home. I had gone off to college my first year but then covid hit and when i came back home i realized i didnâ€™t know what i wanted to do with my life so Iâ€™m just taking basics and working a bunch. But when i went off i lost friends from my home town, then coming back i lost friends from college. But because of quarantine i couldnâ€™t really see people from my hometown to get those friendships back. She was there for me through both and was really my only friend. I just feel so alone and like nobody really cares and the longer weâ€™ve been apart the deeper Iâ€™ve sunk into depression and yesterday i was so close to just ending it all. Iâ€™m not sure how much longer i can hold on. I donâ€™t want to hear â€œgive it timeâ€ or â€œit gets betterâ€ please, the people Iâ€™ve talked to have all said that and Iâ€™m not getting any better. Iâ€™m drastically getting worse.
