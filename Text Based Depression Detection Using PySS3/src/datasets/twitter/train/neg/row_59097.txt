idkmy home life is terrible. my parents caught me trying to run away, and they just told me about how I donâ€™t have any actual reasons for it. then they said itâ€™s my fault things are so bad at home. my mom doesnâ€™t care about me. she told me that her life would be easier if I killed myself, and she said Iâ€™m such a burden to her. my dad hates me too and thinks Iâ€™m a slut or something. I canâ€™t deal with this any more. I canâ€™t stay here
