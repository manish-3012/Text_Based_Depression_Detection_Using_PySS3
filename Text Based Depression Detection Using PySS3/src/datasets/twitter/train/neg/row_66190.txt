Losing the love of my lifeHi guys,


This is my first ever post so I donâ€™t really know where to start but. My now ex girlfriend split up with me and today she told me with her friend that she is seeing someone else, already sleeping together and I have a tattoo of her name on my finger, when she told me I tried killing myself by jumping in a river but her and her friend manage to pull me out, Iâ€™m really sad any advice on how to get better, sorry if this isnâ€™t suitable but I donâ€™t know where else to let my emotions out..
