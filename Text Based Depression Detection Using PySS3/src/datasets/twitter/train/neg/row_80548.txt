Desperate. Anyone please, help.First before I start I'd like you to know a few things:

* I've already seen my Psychiatrist 4 times in the past 30 days ( up from only once a month)


* I've been in therapy for 15 years. 
 


* I'm 24/f.


It's silly how some realizations can hit me. I had just gotten off the phone with my father, who I've made plans to see tomorrow, and taken my dogs outside. I was thinking about how I needed to grow up and be more mature about my father seeing a woman who wasn't my mother. I knew they both would start to date. (in fact he dated during the marriage but I digress) 

Then I started thinking of the most violent thoughts of how I just wanted to scare away this woman who has started seeing him. Just horrible shameful things that I'd never really do. I stopped myself, and tried to logically examine why I wanted to hurt this woman who hasn't even done anything. Why I wanted to gut her like a fish when I don't even know her at all. 

She was the proof that my parents marriage was really over. 

I should mention that my family was/is very abusive. It started out with my parents being the abusers, but as they got older and my siblings and I could fight back that stopped. regardless of the violent fights, the emotional pain- I thought that a family had to love each other. If our family was still together then that meant that love really did matter. Love was tangible and real. My family staying together meant that the pain in my life, my past, wasn't- this sounds totally contrary- hurtful.  

**POINT OF ALL THAT BACKSTORY** 

I realized that my life has been a total lie. I don't ever want to be in love. I don't ever want my own family. I realized that I hate  everybody in my life. I realized that the only connection I feel in the whole world is to my dog. A fact which I know shouldn't be as pathetic as it makes me feel when I admit to it.


**
TLDR:*Love isn't real.Life has lost all meaning*


P.S
I could have written a book about how I feel right now ( Side effect of being in therapy for 15 years) but I tried to keep it as short as possible so someone might actually read this.
