What's a good reason to stick around?No, seriously. I'm sick of everything. I can't think of anything enjoyable or meaningful enough that's worth all of this. 

I don't enjoy material things or experiences all that much, and everyone I love either leaves me or disappoints me. I'm stuck in a constant state of doing things I hate, because I have to do more things that don't want to do. My life has no meaning. 

I'm just tired of being alone with nowhere to go.
