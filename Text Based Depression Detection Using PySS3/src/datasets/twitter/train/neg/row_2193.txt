Update on my post yesterdayI've felt the will to live and fight anymore leave me. This is the first day of my life baring surgery that I've spent the day in bed. My stomach would kill the average person, but it's back to normal enough that it's not us cause. I just have no reason to get up. 

I've spent a lot of my life thinking of my death. I called the cops on myself when I was starting at the buchers knife, spit out the pills I was swallowing, and never could just cut the right direction. Now I'm in too much pain and too tired to do anything. Just to lay here in pain praying for death..

Those I love used to keep me grounded, but they suffer anyways at my suffering. Nobody who knows me would be shocked or blame me over suicide. Hell besides my mom they'd probably learn to accept it as a good course of action. So I don't know what's holding me back posting to an internet of strangers who won't understand and who probably don't care a whole lot. Sorry.
