Spoke to Veterans Crisis hotlineWhen I was younger I thought about suicide quite a lot. At some point in my life I decided I was just going to "zombie" through living. Now, that's not to say I don't have moments of happiness or I don't do things for fun - I just decided I would live my life despite not really feeling like there was a point in it all. 

Recently someone at my base committed suicide. For some reason it got me thinking about it A LOT! I think about how he might have did it, what were his thoughts before he passed the point of no return, am I capable of doing the same? I decided last night to talk to a suicide hotline for veterans. The person I spoke to kept referring to helpless and hopeless thoughts and feelings - and I've seen that sentiment in many of the posts here. I don't feel any of those things. I don't have an amazing life, but I don't feel like it's a horrible one either. I just don't see a point in anything. The best way for me to explain it, is to paraphrase a monologue from the beginning of the movie "The Art of Getting by": â€œSince the dawn of recorded history, something like 110 billion human beings have been born into this world.  And not a single one of them made it.  There are 6.8 billion people on the planet.  Roughly 60 million of them die every year. 60 million people.  That comes out to about 160,000 per day.  I read this quote once when I was a kid, â€œWe live alone, we die alone.  Everything else is just an illusion. â€  It used to keep me up at night.  We all die alone.  So, why am I supposed to spend my life working, sweating, struggling? For an illusion?  Because no amount of friends, no girl, no assignments about conjugating the pluperfect or determining the square root of the hypotenuse is gonna help me avoid my fate."

Does anyone else have this problem of wanting to commit suicide, not because of hardships and struggles, but because there honestly isn't a point in living.
