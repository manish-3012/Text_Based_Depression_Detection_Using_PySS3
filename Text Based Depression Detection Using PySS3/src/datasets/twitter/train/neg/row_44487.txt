Having suicidal thoughts.I have been feeling depressed for a few years, but recently  it has got a lot worse. I'm having suicidal thoughts nearly everyday, I'm not sure if I would ever attempt suicide but these constant thought don't help matters. I've been to the doctors twice in the last month and he wasn't really helpful. At random moments in the day I break down in to tears. I have recently booked an appointment with a counselor or a therapist. It just feels like I would be better of dead because I honestly can't take it anymore. I'm 18 now and yeah I probably should man the fuck up.
