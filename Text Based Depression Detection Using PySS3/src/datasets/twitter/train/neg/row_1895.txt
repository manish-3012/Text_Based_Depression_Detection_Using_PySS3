I Wish My Suicide Was SucessfulI donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m alone on this feeling.

Last fall I overdosed on a pretty hefty amount of pills. I took 20 gabapentin pills and about 400 extra strength acetaminophen like a dumbass (since that sort of overdose is apparently a horrible way to go) and ended up in the hospital within 3 hours bc I was violently vomiting :).

I was in ICU for 3 days and known on the third floor as some â€œmiracle childâ€ because apparently other people have overdosed on less and ended up dead.

I donâ€™t feel like my recovery was a miracle. The more I think about it Iâ€™m jealous of people who were able to actually go through with their suicide from start to finish. 

Over the course of the past few months Iâ€™ve still wanted to kill myself nearly everyday and now it feels like Iâ€™m out of options. I can barely swallow a single pillâ€”the meds Iâ€™m now on for my bipolarâ€”without gagging. Iâ€™m too much of a bitch to jump off a bridge (although I used to say that about overdosing and I was able to do that). I donâ€™t have access to a gun. I donâ€™t have a car for carbon monoxide poisoning. Slicing my arms seems too painful to me. I fucking failed at the only thing that would have ended my pain.

And now I canâ€™t stop regretting the fact that I lived. I think about it and regret going to the hospital in the first place. I regret not trying to leave the hospital bed when they were saving me. I feel so stupid for not realizing that I finally had a way out. And I fucked it up just like everything else.
