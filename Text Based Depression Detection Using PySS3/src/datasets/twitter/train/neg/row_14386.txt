If your reading this itâ€™s to lateIdk if Iâ€™m breaking sub rules for posting this but it wonâ€™t matter by the time someone sees this Iâ€™ll be gone. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even writing this or if Iâ€™m even going to post it but if you are reading this just.. stop Iâ€™m wasting your time but if you really want to stay then fine not like anyone will. This is to (not real names) Kevin, Hannah, Hunter, and josh, the only true friends Iâ€™ve had. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry for not telling you. Iâ€™m sorry this is how you found out. And Iâ€™m sorry for not spending more time with you. I know I only know Kevin in real life but itâ€™s like you guys were my real family, you were the only people who have made me smile in years and I want you to know this isnâ€™t your fault. So.. bye.. whoever you are. Not like you cared in the first place. Alright I know this wonâ€™t stop whoever you are from reading this but can you please not read this part if youâ€™re not Kevin. Please.. Kevin.. Iâ€™m sorry I wish I would have told you but I didnâ€™t and now your here.. reading this probably thinking about what you could have done to stop this. If you are stop. There is nothing you could have done. Nothing.. Iâ€™m just sorry I never got to go off roading with you but I couldnâ€™t take it anymore.
