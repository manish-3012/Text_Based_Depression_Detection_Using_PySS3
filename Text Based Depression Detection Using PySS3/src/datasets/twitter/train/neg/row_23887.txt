Texting buddy to keep me sane?Hi guys,

Found out recently that my husband betrayed me and has been lying for 13 years. I'm devastated and haven't been able to sleep for a month. It's 2am now and I'm daydreaming about putting a gun in my mouth.

I am trying so hard to hold on, but it's so hard.   
I gave him everything, and I can't cope with the humiliation and the pain. I can't stand knowing that I tried so hard and gave so much, only to be betrayed like this.

Is the world really such a cruel place? Is it really worth trying again?

Maybe I need someone to check up on me every now and again? 

Maybe it would be healing to just hear that there's still kindness to be found in this world. I don't know.
