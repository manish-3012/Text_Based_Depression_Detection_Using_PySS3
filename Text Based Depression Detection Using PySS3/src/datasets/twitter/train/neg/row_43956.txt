Fuck My Life and Everyone ElseLong story short I've opened up about being suicidal with the few people that care enough about me, and yesterday I got dragged into the school psychologist's office to speak to them and my school counselor. A friend reported me to their counselor for making suicidal statements. I know what to say and what not to say, and I was able to get them to understand the situation. At the end of it the psychologist said they wouldn't be calling the police department on me. I was this fucking close to getting handcuffed in school, thrown into a psych ward, and having that on my permanent record.

I understand my friends intentions but I'm done. I'm just so done. I open up to people about whats in my mind finally, and this happens. Since yesterday i decided to stop talking to people, wnd isolate myself until I graduate. Im barely able to fucking communicate because of my social anxiety, never included or invited to anything by the few 'friends' I have, not a part of anything, so why not? I'm a complete failure socially and I don't what to get my life fucked up even more.
