Honestly wish I was deadI've always been the suicidal type. But lately I feel like I'm going to explode. I've even been thinking about talking my little brother into doing a double suicide despite all this just being a huge misunderstanding. I've got all I need, I'm not super poor, it's not like there's any major hardships going on. Ya know sure, maybe my mom has some money issue's my little brother is throwing a fit over things and then calling it "depression and suicide" just because he's 14 and can't see his girlfriend. Basically saying "I want it now or I'll kill myself." Then my fiance just thinks my mom is raising him wrong. We live in the house and he's making it hard for everyone. My fiance thinks that we can just move out and not be our problem. But think of how DISAPPOINTED my mother will be. How much that will hurt me when I'm already hurting. I don't want to talk about it, I just want to stop shaking and feeling like I'm empty. Nothing's wrong, so why the hell do I feel like I need to just.... stop breathing. Not like I can get help, my fiance thinks psychology and psychiatrists are a bunch of bullshit. Words are cheap, I guess. I hate this country, I hate this world. I wish I lived in Canada. If I can just hold out until I get a job maybe, but I'm not sure about my fiance..... I just want to stop breathing permanently. But I can't.
