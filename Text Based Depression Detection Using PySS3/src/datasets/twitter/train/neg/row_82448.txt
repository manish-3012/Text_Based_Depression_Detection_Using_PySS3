Sometime, for no reason, I get washed over with an almost instinctual need to kill myself.Everything will be going fine, I'll be with family or friends or even just alone, going about my day. And then all of a sudden, I have such an urge to just off myself- I can't even think about living another day. Is anyone else like this sometimes?
