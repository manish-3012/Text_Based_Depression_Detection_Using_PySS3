Canâ€™t stick to it and I hate itI plan and plan and feel so relieved when I know itâ€™s close and still back out. I was planning on shooting my self tonight and yet here I am still bothering everyone. I need to get it done and stop being a burden. I need to do the right thing

Iâ€™m not looking for help. I guess Iâ€™m just writing my thoughts. I should just keep them to myself.
