I have nothing left to giveI got a "temporary" ostomy surgery 6 months ago. The only reason I made it to this point was knowing they'd reverse it. The dr lied. They wont reverse it for "3 months, if ever". I lost my entire life due to this. My gf left me and I cant bring myself to be intimate with anyone else. Who could be attracted to a literal sack of crap anyways? I lost my friends because I can barely walk around without severe pain/exhaustion and this means all i did was hold them back from the activities I used to love that they can still do. I cant exercise as my stomach muscles herniated and the stoma prolapsed. I smell like shit all the time and out in public the bag just inflates so everyone can see me as much as they smell me. I'm done. Fuck everyone and everything. I'd rather be dead than live this shell of a life.
