happening tonightI'm off to go drinking. Drinking makes me hate my life more and it also gives me courage. Both of these are what I need tonight to finally make this happen.
I add no value to this world, so it will be no loss. My coworkers will no longer have a need to gossip about me. My team will now be stronger with the weakest link finally gone. Women across the country will no longer need to worry about some pathetic loser trying to strike up yet another conversation. The bank will not longer receive late payments.
Who am I? I am pathetic and I am nobody. I don't fit. I don't belong. I am not smart. I am not cool. I am not attractive. I am not tough. I am nothing.

Good night, bottoms up, and thanks.
