Not enough energy to kill myself yet.(16 year old guy) I'm going through a deep depression and I want to kill myself, it's all I've been thinking about. However there's a catch, much like everything else in my life right now I don't have any energy to actually do it yet. I feel like if I find the energy to do it I'll kill myself. Feel free to ask questions if it helps you help me better.
