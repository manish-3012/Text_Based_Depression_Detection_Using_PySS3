Cant even manage to tie a nooseLiterally only place I could think of for posting this. Isn't trying to teach yourself to tie a noose with a scarf from YouTube tutorials while your brain is already numbed and scattered, the most weirdly complicated thing in the world? I have degrees in notoriously complex fields but somehow I cant get the hang of this. Pun intended. At this point I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry. Goddamn it!
