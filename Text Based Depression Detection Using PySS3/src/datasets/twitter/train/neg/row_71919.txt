Iâ€™m just too sensitive.Iâ€™m just so fragile. You say the smallest thing to me and I overreact. I try to be myself but when I do people judge me. I need help. I joined this app because of the community. I thought this would be a place where I could be myself behind a username. This pain that this all gives me makes me want to die. I wouldâ€™ve done it all ready but I care about everyone around me too much, but Iâ€™m still in so much pain. Somebody please help me.
