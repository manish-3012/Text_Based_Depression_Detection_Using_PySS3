I can't comprehend my mindsetSince last week I became completely okay with committing suicide. Like I don't feel sadness by thinking about ending it all as I usually did, I don't feel anything at all the last few days. I've got my plan on how to do it and to me it seems very feasable even if I try to pussy-out. But right now I don't feel any urgency to go through with it. I guess it's comforting knowing I can end it now at any point.

I've also started going to a psychiatrist and possibly have to be monitored for a week for further evaluation. But the questions that keeps ringing through my mind is: "why do I not experience any crisis as before?". If I rationolize it, it seems to me like I don't really want to die but at the same time don't really want to live either. Though I'm sure that if I would be left to my own devices and reach another low point, I will kill myself. Right now the only factors that keep me from doing it are the consequences to the people around me e.g. my psychiatrist might face sanctions for not putting me in an institution.

Is there someone who has or is experiencing something similar? I'm having trouble with understanding myself, so I hope that someone can kind of guide me through the steps and fases that might come over my way. Like am I just inhibiting my feelings and will they kind of burst out at some turning point? Or am I getting out of this train of suicidal thoughts? I would be really gratefull if I get any reply.
