I need to talk to someone who's gotten through it. Somebody who's felt the same agony and somehow learned to live anyway.I need to know it's possible to get better from where I am -- from having no hope, from believing myself to be a worthless animal.

I don't want reassurance that I'm great from a stranger who couldn't possibly know. I want to know that you felt the same way but don't any more.

Anyone?
