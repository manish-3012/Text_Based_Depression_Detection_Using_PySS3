Why?Why am do i want to kill myself?

I get pretty good pocket money for my age, have some decent friends, ~~parents~~ father is really nice...

I don't understand.

Yet I'm tempted to jump in front of the train that I see every day, and if I ever got my hands on a gun I'd immediately shoot myself in the head.
