So after some feedback in my work-integration project threw me back into the holeHi, im Lucas from germany and have had a devastating fallback today. The 2 people i had this feedback with were both pretty, id say direct with their words and it just hurts to hear that. Im supposed to go there again tomorrow but im thinking of just..you know giving up

It all is just so hard to hang on, im basically only kept alive by gaming and even thatt isnt cutting it anymore
