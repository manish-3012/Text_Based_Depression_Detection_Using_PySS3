Extreme depression after breakup.My boyfriend of 2 years just decided he was ending it with me. We fight a lot, and I know that Iâ€™m often times the problem. Iâ€™m very mean because Iâ€™m angry. Iâ€™m angry because Iâ€™m tired of being depressed. (I have my own issues that contribute to being depressed, donâ€™t wanna get into.) And I know that itâ€™s my fault. If I really wanted hm I wouldnâ€™t have been so mean all the time. Itâ€™s like I couldnâ€™t help it. I know thatâ€™s a shitty excuse, but I canâ€™t explain it. 

Anyways, he is literally the ONLY reason I havenâ€™t killed myself by now, and now that heâ€™s leaving me, I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t want to die, but I do. I donâ€™t want to start over. I donâ€™t want to live with only two emotional settings. (Sadness/anger). I cry every day driving to work. I canâ€™t focus. Suicide is all Iâ€™m thinking about. I just want him back. I canâ€™t afford therapy or pills and itâ€™s never worked in the past anyways. I donâ€™t know how to pull myself out of this rut. I donâ€™t even know if I want to.
