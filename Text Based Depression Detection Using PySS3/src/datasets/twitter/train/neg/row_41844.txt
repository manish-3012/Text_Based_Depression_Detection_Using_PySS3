Suicidal thoughtsIâ€™m pulled over on the side of the road writing this because I donâ€™t know who to turn to. You canâ€™t tell a therapist you donâ€™t wana live anymore because they legally have to put you in a psych ward. Im a 26 year old male and Iâ€™ve been single all my life and Iâ€™m so lonely. It seems like everyone is on date night and Iâ€™m by myself on a Friday night. Iâ€™m a good looking guy, been told I have a great personality, no disorders or diseases other than Iâ€™m just so lonely. Itâ€™s a pain that I donâ€™t think everyone understands.
