I think I'm ready.Yup, I'm just about ready. Completley cut contact with my ex. I pushed all of my actual close friends far enough away so they won't get hurt. My note has even been shortened down from 4 pages down to about a sentence. Wait. Why even leave a note? No one gives a shit anyway.

Maybe goodbye, If I can be a fucking man for once.
