Need a little HelpI have suicidal and dark thoughts either me dying or those close to me dying, these have gone on for a few years and I think I'm ready to tell some friends about it. I just dont know how to do that without it becoming a pity fest, or that they need to baby me, or that I'm being selfish for telling them. I'm 20 in college, and I have never attempted suicide nor do I think I ever will. These thoughts really hurt though and I dont wanna do it alone anymore. Any advice?
Tldr: how to tell friends about thoughts without it being pity
