Struggling to find any more reasons to stay alive.Iâ€™m a 23 year old female, got a degree but still not working due to anxiety/panic attacks, depression and extreme self doubt and yes I beat myself up about it every day. My doctors havenâ€™t been helpful previously so Iâ€™m too scared to go back, which means Iâ€™m stuck living this miserable existence.

Just ended a 2 year relationship that was very toxic due to my exâ€™s mental health (my clothes were put into a pile and lit on fire after an argument, he would drink and punch through doors, delete messages from girls, be horribly nasty for no reason, get himself in bad even dangerous situations all the time where I had to pick up the pieces) and I donâ€™t know what to do with myself at all now as Iâ€™ve been focusing on trying to get him help with his awful mental health and not myself.

Iâ€™ve isolated myself from my friends over the last year so my social life is now awful. 

Every time Iâ€™ve felt suicidal Iâ€™ve kept on living for solely for my parents, but now I feel like theyâ€™d be better off without me. I think my existence is a burden to them most of the time these days anyway.

For the first time, I donâ€™t feel like I have anything to live for.
