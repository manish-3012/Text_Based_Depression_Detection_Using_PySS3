The â€œmeaningâ€ of life question could be answered pretty easily if you learn philosophyNo offense, I know this is not related to helping suicide prevention, but you do know that if you went to college they teach you about philosophy and the â€œmeaningâ€ of life right? Iâ€™m just sitting here reading a lot of this while other doesnâ€™t realize the answer is literally right in front of them when you can go to a good college that teach you about the meaning of life and other things that are similar to it, the answer was discovered about 100 years ago, Iâ€™ll just give you the fast answer, it might not make sense since you didnâ€™t get the whole explanation here:

1- accept that itâ€™s all meaningless, even if it is meaningless to accept it, and just be human

2-Itâ€™s meaningless nothing matter, do whatever the fuck you want

3-distract yourself with distractions, distract yourself with anything you can find

4-suicide 

5-life is meaningless thatâ€™s the meaning of life, that it is meaningless 

6-the nature meaning of life is to have sex and make children, thatâ€™s why love is a chemical, itâ€™s natural way of manipulating you to have sex, thatâ€™s why you work, to get money to survive so you can have sex, that why your attracted to smart and beautiful people, so you can get those traits to your children, human is like any virus, it does anything to survive, thatâ€™s why people are very greedy creature

Also, some of the methods above only work if you still have  enough energy to get out of bed and do it, also if you think the â€œmeaning of lifeâ€ question were hard to be answered then I think It would surprised our that philosopher come up with answers everyday for it, just like the   Answer to why humans are greedy creatures but are actually not, hereâ€™s a fast answer: â€œalmost all of the violence and crime around the world is caused by anxiety, insecurityâ€™s and fear, I know it might not makes sense but like I said, if you want to get over you view of â€œeverything is bad and humans are greedy creature or life is meaninglessâ€ I suggest you go learn more about it, also that should help you with some feeing if despair, but after you change your mid set, the only thing you need to face left is real depression, which is the hardest the to over come, the only thing I can really say is, get anti-depression or wait for that drug that is being work on to â€œcure all depression and stressâ€ which would probably take forever to make it might never be made, since itâ€™s basically the chemical that makes you happy, I think
