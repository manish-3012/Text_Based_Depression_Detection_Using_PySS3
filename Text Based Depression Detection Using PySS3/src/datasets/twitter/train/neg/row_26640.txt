I need helpI want to see a psychiatrist for my thoughts on suicide, but I don't know how. I am 16 years old. I am afraid to tell my parents because I fear that:

1. They won't take me seriously
2. It will be embarrassing
3. I don't want to worry/stress them

So what do I do? I'm always told suicide is wrong, but nobody has proved it to me yet. I feel if I don't see a professional, I never will be convinced and I will proceed with suicide. Right now it sounds pretty nice.

No more problems. Just nothingness. I simply won't exist, so nothing would matter. Sounds pleasant.

One side of me tells me suicide is wrong, the other side tells me it's peaceful.
