Why are so many families so fucking awful?I've missed out on the golden opportunities of childhood love, and get this, I've had two people interested in me romantically, and WE ALL HAVE PSYCHOLOGICALLY ABUSIVE PARENTS THAT ARE OVERCONTROLLING this fucking is miserable. I see people being happy with their families and I just get confused like ??? the fuck is this??
