Iâ€™ve had enough...but is this enough?Iâ€™m just done. I want the pain to end. But like many others, I want as little physical pain as possible. I donâ€™t have a gun (although Iâ€™ve considered buying one), I donâ€™t think I could jump off a bridge or hang myself, and I donâ€™t have access to a garage...but Iâ€™ve been battling major depression, anxiety, and insomnia for more years than I can count. So I have pills. Right now Iâ€™m looking at 162, 5mg Valium; 16.5, 10mg Ambien; and a few Xanax. And a pretty substantial amount of alcohol.

Is this enough????? I donâ€™t want to wake up in a hospital or psych ward - I just want to die. Please donâ€™t comment if you arenâ€™t going to answer my question. Iâ€™m beyond fixing.
