Where is the line to ask for help?I've been dealing with suicide thoughts for a few years now. I go to college so I have access to help but it's a small university that parents have close ties to. I don't want them finding out. I haven't gotten to the point where I want to kill myself but most of the time I want to die. I have fights with myself almost daily.  I've started skipping class and it's adding to my depression. I'm afraid I'm at a crossroads and I'm not sure what to do to turn this around.
