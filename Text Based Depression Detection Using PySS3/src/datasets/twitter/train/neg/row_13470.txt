"La tristesse durera toujours."Don't cry for me. If you were able to ask me, I would say I cry for you. My fight is over. My battle was fought for too many years. There's nothing where I'm going. All my problems end at the barrel of this gun. But you, you still have a battle to fight. One you've been fighting, and will continue to fight. While my fight is over, I've lost it. But I'm okay with that. I tried, and tried and fought and fought but gained no ground. Don't cry because mine is over, I cry because yours still continues. 

If someone is trapped on the top floor of a burning building, Would you fault them if they jumped to a quick death opposed to watch the flames creep closer knowing it will eventually devour them? I've been trapped for so long. Watching the flames get closer and closer, feeling the heat. I can no longer sit and wait for the fire to consume me. To be burned alive. I decide to jump rather than face the fire in my head... I'm sorry I couldn't suffer longer for you.
