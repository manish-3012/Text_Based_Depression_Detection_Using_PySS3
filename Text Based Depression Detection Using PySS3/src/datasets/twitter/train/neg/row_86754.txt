EyesHave you ever looked at yourself in a mirror...deeply in the eyes and see the gaping hole in your soul? It seems to me that that moment is the only time I'm honest with myself about who I am. I dont know what I like, What makes me happy, where I want to be in 5 years... but I do know that as long as I can tie the mask around my face every day, I'll be..just..fine.
