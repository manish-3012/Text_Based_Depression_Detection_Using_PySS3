Tonight is the night, just running into complications.Done using throwaways. So basically my original plan was down 30 1mg clonazepams, how ever many xanax I can steal (10-20) take the box of 30 Zolofts, buy the strongest over the counter sleeping pills, take all of those and wash it down with a bottle of scotch, but according to some sources that would more than likely me alive but with just long term side effects making things worse. The reason I'm on here right now (and time is of the essence) is what over the counter pills can I take, with what I already have put me into a passed out coma sleep that I can never wake up from?

Nobody seems to be answering this question. I'm done, I dont want to explain why I've reached this level. I just assure you, I've thought about it, I know the severity, I know the repercussions, but no matter what this is happening. I do not have access to a firearm of any kind and cutting wrists seems to unreliably and messy, more than likely my family will ignore the note on the door and be the ones to find me, I want it to be as peaceful looking as possible. I've already "reached out" try "getting help". I truly know what I'm giving up and doing, this is a clear conscious decision.
