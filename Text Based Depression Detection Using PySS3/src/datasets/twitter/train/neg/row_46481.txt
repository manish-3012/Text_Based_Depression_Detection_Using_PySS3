It gets betterLife sucks. Im poor, lonely, and depressed. Life will never get better. please stop telling me it will. It just realistically won't get better. My life will be shit for a very long fucking time. The only thing i have left to turn to is the life of drugs. Drug money pays better then my full time fucking job. Holy shit im fucking losing it, every second im fucking living is another im dragging this dead lifeless body across the pavement. Please someone fucking end my pain. I haven't felt happy without fucking consuming drugs in so long. My life has been shit for 5 years fucking straight. Ive.been doing fucking drugs for a couple of months now and now im just done. I dont even wanna do drugs anymore. I fucking cant even have good trips because im so fucking sad. I wanna die so bad. Plz. Let me.take some poor kids cancer. My life isnt worth a fucking dime. I have 34 dollars to my name. I have work in 6 hours and i would do anything to be dead before then. IT DOESN'T GET BETTER. 

P.S. I wont turn to god. No god can save this man
