Should I kill myself tonight or wait until next week so I can see the new season of True Detective?Serious question. The first season is just so perfect and like I really want to see if Pizzolatto can even begin to top it. But then again, I'm really super drunk right now and have the means to go ahead with it. Now's probably as good a time as any. It's strange that literally the only thing keeping me alive right now is a show about nihilism and the pointlessness of our existence.
