I believe my cousin may be suicidal (or, nearly there), and I'm not sure how to help her.Let me state that I do live half a continent away, so it's very hard for me to physically be there for her.

We used to be best friends, and as close as sisters, until last year when we got in an argument over politics and we hadn't spoken to each other since then.

She reached out to me Friday night, leaving me a voice mail message (I didn't hear my phone ring) and it was obvious from her message she was barely holding it together.

She admitted to me the next day that her marriage is on the rocks and she feels like she's at her wits end.  Her mother has told me that she's repeatedly said that she "doesn't want to be here anymore" and that she's doing a lot of drinking.  

She mentioned that her only support is now gone (her 18 year old daughter, who has just started college) and she's feeling lost.

I've suggested she go see a therapist, but I am not sure if I can force her (or even if I should) to follow through.  I'm very worried about her, and so is her mother.

Any suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated.  I'm trying to find some way to support her from a far distance away, and going out to see her, even for a short visit, is well nigh impossible at this time.
