An ultimatumSo I just recently graduated college with a diploma in some IT course. It was tough (70% drop rate) and I'm somewhat proud of myself for pushing through even with all my issues (depression, ocd, insomnia). But things don't feel any different; I'm still miserable, alone and disconnected with society. 

I'm tired. So tired. The reason I can't sleep at night is because I don't want to wake up to my life. That's why I decided to make a suicide ultimatum: if I don't have a decent job, have a place of my own and am working towards my dreams (or just a little bit happier with life) by the time I turn 22 (3 months), I am going to kill myself. It's either exit bag, jumping from top of building or gun to head.

I just can't stand my life anymore man.
