Exhausted with existingI don't feel like I deserve to live anymore. I'm just so tired. Every day that I have to get out of bed, I'm empty and numb, and it's just exhausting to keep pretending to be okay. I've been thinking about dying pretty much nonstop since last night. I think everyone would be better without me. I just want it to be over. I broke down crying in the bathroom at work today because I just want to die. I don't know what to do.
