I feel like a failure of a human beingMy home life is horrible, my mom is an unemployed drunk and acts like everythingâ€™s fine but itâ€™s not. My only escape was a boy I was talking to and now Iâ€™m almost positive heâ€™s trying to ghost on me. All of my friends are away at college (i go to community college) so i canâ€™t talk to them. i went to my mom to talk to her because sheâ€™s the only one i could talk to, and she of course got angry at me for being upset and cursed me out. i have no one. i just want to be fucking happy. iâ€™m broke and heartbroken and depressed as shit. iâ€™m too depressed to do homework. i feel like a burden on everyone around me. i donâ€™t know what i want more- for all my problems to be solved, or to not be alive. at least i know that if i wasnâ€™t alive i wouldnâ€™t have to deal with my problems anymore.
