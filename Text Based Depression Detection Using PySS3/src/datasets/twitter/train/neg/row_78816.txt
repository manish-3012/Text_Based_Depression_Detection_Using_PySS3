Hi again...I posted about a month or something ago about wanting to OD...as you can probably guess I didnâ€™t have enough pills to do any damage. I was able to go through my days but Iâ€™ve just completely sunk again. 

I think itâ€™s harder to take my life because Iâ€™m faithless...I donâ€™t conform to any religion because they to me are just absolute nonsense. What god would create pain? Thereâ€™s just so many factors stopping me from being able to do it and itâ€™s causing me to live in this grey and painful purgatory. Thereâ€™s no palace in the sky for me or you.

Iâ€™m terrified of death like most people are but Iâ€™ve always viewed life as pointless because we all die anyway at the end and weâ€™ll all occupy the same sized grave. Iâ€™ve always had a really debilitating fear of it but the fear would only ever show up now and again. Iâ€™ve put it down to the fact my brain canâ€™t comprehend the absence of its senses and thatâ€™s what the fear is. 

Is life not meaningless? our personalities are formed from a world that molds us, a world that creates divides, a world full of hatred, a world that youâ€™re consciousness is brought into only to be taken away, everything that makes us has been in existence since existence itself and will continue to exist for as long as existence exists... except from us...the voice in our heads...the voice we abide by, the voice whose silence I want to find solace in.

If I had a pill Iâ€™d take it...not because Iâ€™m what people would view as ill...but because I choose to look at the grim, ugly truth that is the world we live in.

For those who say thereâ€™s reasons to live, maybe itâ€™s time to start questioning the reasons you deem suitable to live a life of shit for. 

Thereâ€™s nothing special about consciousness...everything Iâ€™ve got an emotional attachment to will be gone one day and Iâ€™ll feel the pain of it...why should I be around for that...why should anyone be around for anything.
