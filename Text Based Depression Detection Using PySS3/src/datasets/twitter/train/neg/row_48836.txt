Attempted last Saturday. No reaction about itLet me first say that I'm "okay" right now. I'm not really depressed at the moment, just sleeping a lot to.. recover emotionally and physically. 

I attempted last Saturday by overdosing. Long story short, a friend came to my place and my roommate let her in.. she stopped me from taking any more pills. I had already gotten over x8 my normal dose at least. She wanted me to come to her place so she could watch me, since she's also had her fair share of experience with this stuff. As we were leaving, I hid the bottle on me and she noticed and took them again. 

Well, I didn't die. I only had the effects of it for a few days after. Basically a mixture of weakness, dizziness, nausea, panic attacks and just tripping in general, etc. 

I'm worried that I... don't really have a reaction to having attempted. Now knowing that I didn't have fear doing it, I fear that when I get bad again.. which will be sooner or later as always, that I'll attempt again and succeed.
