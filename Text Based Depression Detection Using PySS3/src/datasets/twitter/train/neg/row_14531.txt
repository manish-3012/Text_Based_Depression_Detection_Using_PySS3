The week after I tried to kill myselfI attempted suicide on Saturday (25 August). I took 19 Paxil pills and 2 glasses of vodka.
I regretted it almost immediately and threw up half an hour later. The pain that night was awful. And the next days too. I felt like my blood was boiling underneath my skin, I was very very dizzy all the time. 
I couldnâ€™t take it anymore so I asked for help. I am now at the hospital in a section for depressed people. Iâ€™m doing well and I was offered an internship for this year and that was exactly what I was looking for! 
Things are looking up.
Donâ€™t give up, asking for help is good. 
Iâ€™m happy Iâ€™m still alive.
I posted this yesterday on r/depression but it got deleted.
I want people to see that there is hope and that asking for help is good. Scary, but good.
