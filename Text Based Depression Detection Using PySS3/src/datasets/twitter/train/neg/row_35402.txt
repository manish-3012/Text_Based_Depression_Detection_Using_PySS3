AdviceIâ€™m a 25M and Iâ€™m still living at home with my parents. Iâ€™m unemployed and havenâ€™t been able to find a job in the past 8 months, I havenâ€™t had a girlfriend in almost 8 years, and I have little to no friends or a social life. I feel like Iâ€™ve hit rock bottom and things are never gonna get better. Am I wrong for feeling this way or am I justified in doing so?
