Monday MorningI think I've decided to go on Monday morning after I've dropped my eldest son off at school (my ex will be collecting him).

I'm 40, in a load of debt, my partner of 10yrs left about 5-6 weeks ago along with my youngest son, so now I live alone in the rundown house and about 5months ago I got told I was likely on the autism spectrum.

I've convinced myself that I have to go now.

I just don't think I can be arsed to play this game anymore, it's a shit game anyway. I've picked the spot (in my house, no chance of being disturbed) and the method. I'm going to write my notes tonight for those who are getting them and then I think I'll check out on Monday. Unless something very particular happens by then which I doubt it will.

I don't even feel afraid anymore. I feel quite calm.
