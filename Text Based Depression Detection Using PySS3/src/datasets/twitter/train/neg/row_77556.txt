Resources for Friends and Family?I've been contemplating suicide for the majority of my life. I'm a 19 year old male, currently going to University. I've been through dozens of therapists, medications, doctors, etc. I've also stayed in a Behavioral Health Hospital for a while (but that was two years ago). Anyways, I've decided to end my life, as I seem to be incapable of being happy and can't stop being anxious. Along with a short note, I'd like to leave behind a list of resources for my family and friends, since they're probably gonna have a rough couple days after my death. Are there any decent websites, support groups (Seattle area), books, or the like, that I should include? Thanks for any possible help!
