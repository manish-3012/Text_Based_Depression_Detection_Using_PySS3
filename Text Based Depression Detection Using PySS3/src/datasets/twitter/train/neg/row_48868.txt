My mother attempted suicide yesterday. What can I do to help the situation?As it said in the title, my mother attempted suicide yesterday. Yesterday was her birthday.

From what I understand (I was not there) she got into an argument with my sister. My sister called her a druggie. She's been having health problems lately with her Multiple Sclerosis, and has been taking pills for her associated seizures and also anxiety meds to keep her relaxed (stress triggers seizures).

She took almost an entire bottle of her xanax (about 60 pills) after having it filled yesterday. My dad luckily noticed her acting strange and called 911. She was baker acted yesterday and is now in a psychiatric ward, where I won't be able to visit her because of the ward's rules. I'm not sure when she will be out, but I've heard about 3 days.

My question is, what do I do now? I have no idea how to react to this at all. Obviously I'm very upset, but I have heard that negative energy will not help the situation at all. I am especially worried that she may try to do it again when she gets out. It just seems like she is on a downhill spiral, but I also don't want to just straight up confront her about it.... She is only in her forties.. I really don't want my mom to die.... Someone please help. I have no experience with suicide whatsoever.
