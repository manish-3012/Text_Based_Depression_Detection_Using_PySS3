IdkI dont know if I want to die. One moment its not a thought. The next i see the means of my escape. I trried as a teen but failed and got really sick. Everyone thought i just drank to much. I walked in on my gf.... I know its not the answer. My brain says give it time the rest of me says we did that for so long already.. I wanna go to sleep not feel so hurt and alone. Ive tried talking to people about what i saw but they are all fuck that bitch. I love her. Ii dont wanna hurt her anymore but i just wanna stop hurting. Ive tried so hard to be a good man. Guess i failed at that too
