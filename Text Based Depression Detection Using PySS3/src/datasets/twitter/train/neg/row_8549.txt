Everything is always the same, nothing changes. Nobody actually sees me.So many ups and downs. Will going to school fix my future? Why are you depressed if you "have" money? Why this, why that. My boss treats me like an incompetent idiot, and all I want to tell her is that I'm proud of actually making it to work that day without turning my car around and completely ruining my chances at a decent resume. Like the resume matters. Here I am, posting to this reddit page because I'm desperate as hell for someone to understand me. To understand that I don't know why anybody lives in the first place, when life is the same every day - over and over again. The threat of my health condition constantly over my head, my grandmother slowly losing it and no parents to be found. I have an amazing fiancÃ©, and I'm glad that he doesn't understand. I'm slowly losing my mind, and I can't wrap my head around staying in this world forever on repeat. It just doesn't make sense. I don't see a point in doing anything at all since it's just going to mean nothing. 

I feel invisible.
