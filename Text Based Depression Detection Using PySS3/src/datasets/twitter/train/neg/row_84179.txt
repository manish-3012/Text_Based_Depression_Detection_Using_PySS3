I have just accepted that suicide is the best option.Iâ€™ve been suicidal for a while now and depressed since I was a kid. Iâ€™m 20 now and everything has been crumbling around me for four years. Tonight I have finally made the decision to die. I donâ€™t know when but I do know how. The when will probably be sooner rather than later. Let me tell you it feels good to finally be done. It feels like a 1000 lb weight has been lifted off of me.
