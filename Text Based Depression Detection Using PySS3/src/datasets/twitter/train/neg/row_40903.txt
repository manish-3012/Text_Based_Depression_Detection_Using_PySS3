Kicked out of the flat (Tl;Dr bottom)Excuse me for the format errors and what not, I'm on phone and also any spelling mistakes or whatever, sobbing so much I can't even think.
Some background because it's needed: mom divorced since I was 2-3, had to move to a different part of the country to work (teacher), so as you might  imagine I don't have much relationship with father and father's relatives other than my aunt. We moved back to where I was born 9 years ago (I was 9 y/o). Was a quite successful student all my life up to first year of highschool, my mother suffered from harrasment in the highschool she was working, in that place they had some language extremist (Galician&gt;Spanish basically) and she was "bullied" for this reason (also she is so immature and fucking blind she didn't and still doesn't know how to approach things). She ended up having chronic depression, which for a fucking 9 y/o was devastating. The first and second year of highschool was just her inside the bed, and fights with me (because fuck me right?) specially from the second year onwards. I lost my mother with 11 years, and all that was left was something that can barely be called a person (unstable as heck, almost seems like she likes picking fights with me). She doesn't reckognize how obnoxious she is, but everybody else does, even my grandparents, specially grandma, know that she's impossible to deal with, because of how scarred she is, and I'm the only one that has been standing her behaviour because, fuck, she is my mother after all. But I shouldn't have, my mental health went downhill (depressed, frustrated, became introverted and starting having violent outburst against objects) as well as my grades and shit. Every year it became harder and harder to bear, I am a simple dude, obedient and what not, but can't and won't stand stupid shit and arguments out of nowhere, which is our everyday basically. 

She bought me a laptop last friday, as a birthday present, with the conditions of studying and not playing during the week, fair enough. Keep studying even in the state of deep depression I am right now, doing all the shit, she even called me out because she saw me use the laptop to fucking listen to spotify while reading and drawing, whatever. Yesterday we had a fight, started the same "You shouldn't use the computer during the week etc" as I was listening to spotify, it scalates to the point she tells me to get out of the living room, get really fucking angry because IT WAS UNFAIR AND UNCALLED, she also shouts profanities at my father's parents when she asks them to pick me up. Not beat her to a bloody pulp because she is my mother after all, and now this morning she told me she had hired a residence dorm for me. Mind you, it's not the same going to a dorm because you need to rather than getting kicked out. It is 10 AM here, she told me this at 9:15, almost 40 minutes after I had woken up.

I've always thought of suicide, and would've done it before if I wasn't so afraid of pain, but right now it is the only answer I see. I can't keep this rythm, I just can't, my grandparents know how fucked up she is but they don't interfere as much as I'd like, and rn they have other problems in mind. Just wanted to get this off my chest, probably end up doing some stupid shit. Thing is: I am alone right now, I have no one that conforts me or supports me, and people don't know how hard it is to endure this abuse constantly over so many years.                                 Tl;Dr or whatever: don't have much relationship with my fathers family, mother kicked me out after a heated argument, depressed student thinks about leaving this piece of shit we call life.
