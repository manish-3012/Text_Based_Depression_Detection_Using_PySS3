A question for people who are living a shitty life for a long timeOk so here's the deal, I'm 21 and I'm dead inside, I lived enough shit to not care for pretty much anything any more except my father. After considering suicide a lot (man wouldn't just be great if I attached an explosive to my head and just let it all end) I concluded that even if somehow I made it look like an accident, it would still crush my dad's heart, so only for him I'll just keep on dragging this useless life until he's dead or I end up dead after smoking 2 packs of cigarretes a day, I'll just keep going for him. My point is, I've been living like this for the past 4, 5 months or so, and even tough it sucks a lot I guess I still can go on like this for some time (it's like a really shitty job that you just have to go through until someday you'll be finally be free of it), from what I've seem there's a lot of people here who are living a life like mine for much longer than I did, right now I'm not really sad or in pain (for the most part) I'm just tired, I pretty much can't find joy in anything, and I truly believe that will not change, never. My question is, people who lived what I'm living for way longer than I am, how harder it will get? Will the pain come back? I really don't care to keep pushing this meaningless life, as long the pain won't come back.
