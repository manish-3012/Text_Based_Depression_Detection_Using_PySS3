What do I do?   I'm sixteen and for the past three years of my life, each winter meant a major seasonal depression. It really sucks, sience I can't function when I need to the most, aka during exams. Anyway, lately I've been having the same thoughts I usually get when winter comes, but this time it's summer. I should be happy, but I can't help to think about the fact that my friends hang out with me, because they feel sorry for me, that I'm a problem to everyone. When I told my mom a year ago, that something was wrong, she said that I'm imagining things. What if I am? I feel so much like burden that I can't even go to the school psychologist anymore without thinking that I'm wasting her time. 

  I made this account, because I found this commuinty and sience I know I won't tell anyone I know, nor call a hotline, I just wanted to know that there was someone like me here.

PS I'm not a native speaker, sorry for mistakes.
