You really can put a price on life hahaTo talk to a professional therapist is like 250 dollars a session.

Looking for other professional help costs even more money.

The free services are generic â€œdonâ€™t kill yourself people care about you.â€

Iâ€™m saying this because I want to prove that people are inherently selfish. No one cares about the lives of others unless they get paid for it.
So why should I have to care about the lives of others.

No one wanted to help me. Not at all. Itâ€™s too late for me. I will be writing my note very soon. Or maybe not. Maybe I want the people that find me to be confused about why he did it.

â€œBut he was going to collegeâ€ â€œbut he wasnâ€™t poorâ€ â€œhe was whatever the fuck.â€

Iâ€™m just tired of people. If I could I would love to be a vigilante and kill criminals and people that cause all the suffering in the world. But I will not because thatâ€™s way too hard. Suicide is easy and readily apparent in my daily life.

I hope I burn in hell for eternity
