I am so close to giving it all upGive what up? I dont have much left.
I have my family, i know, and for them i do not do it. 
I have this incredible, irreplacable man, who makes me smile, sometimes.
But you see, i have nothing else. I lost my house. In two weeks i will be homeless for real. My best friends turned out to be faux. My uni sucks, therefore my grades suck. In my hometown, people talk shit about me. And oh. I may have hpv. I have no symptoms but i may have the virus. 
Reason to live? Hoping it will all turn out fine, maybe. But thinking that i have failed in every way possible, that i will be homeless in two weeks, and there isnt much that i can do about that is.. Overwhelming. And i am tired.
Today is my birthday. Say happy birthday, all. Or not. Whatever. I may end it anyway.
