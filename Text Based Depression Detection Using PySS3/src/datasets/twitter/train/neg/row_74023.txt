I was doing so wellI started going back to school and trying to catch up on work. But then I relapsed (?) and broke down crying in three of my classes. Itâ€™s looking into mirrors and seeing people that are attractive. I just canâ€™t handle looking at myself. Iâ€™m ugly and Iâ€™m never going to be able to accept that. I just canâ€™t. Iâ€™m going to try to hang myself again. I think I read somewhere it takes almost 25 attempts before a successful suicide attempt happens. Itâ€™s just too much. Even if I was at least average. I would be okay with that.
