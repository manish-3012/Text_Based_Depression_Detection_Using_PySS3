I should be so happyI have a pretty okay job. I'm going back to graduate school. I have a great husband. Two really cute (but stupid) dogs. A pretty okay business/side hustle. Really good friends. I'm kind of funny. Kind of attractive. We have a pretty okay house. I can pay all my bills. There's food in my belly. A roof over my head. A bed to sleep in.


And yet, I still want to not be here. I feel like saying I want to die is... Too much? But if I just happened to pull some ending of Infinity War while sitting at my computer desk that wouldn't be too bad you know? I used to see a therapist but a few months back I was doing really well so I got discharged. I feel like going back makes me a failure you know? And how do you go back and explain yourself? Hi I thought I was fine but now I wanna die so here I am! Like, man. I don't know. My throat feels tight, my eyes are puffy, like, I could probably cry for ten years? But I'm actually just gonna play the Sims and stare into space and hope like, darkness consumes me.
