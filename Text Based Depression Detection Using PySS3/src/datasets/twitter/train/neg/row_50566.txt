Thinking of just ending it allStarting to apply for colleges and I did lie to my parents about my recent sat score cause I dropped and didn't want to disappoint them because we are Desi and should be getting high scores. I did study and practice. My dad saw my score and got all mad about me(understand) for lying but I didn't tell them it was because I didn't want to disappoint them. Being Desi is hard I fucking hate it, so much pressure on colleges and scores, job, etc. And my dad said you might as well go to community college and not have a good life, and I said tht I can still transfer to the college I was applying to(just trying to see) after working hard and then he just got mad at me again and was like "you aren't working hard, you are lying and might as well just go live on the street you idiot" it isn't life or death right?!? Is it?!? Idk this just got me so stressed ðŸ˜­. Welp now I'm just thinking about playing with knifes and if I happen to slice my arm, it's whatever. Fuck man, I  don't wanna live anymore. Fuck life.
