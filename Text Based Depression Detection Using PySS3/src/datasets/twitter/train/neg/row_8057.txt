Give me one fucking reason I shouldnâ€™t do itEveryone keeps telling me, oh it will get better, just give it time. How much more fucking time do I have to give it when my whole life has been a slow and steady spiral into hell? There is no solace. Iâ€™m tired of waiting for it to get better, it never does, Iâ€™m tired of doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results 

My whole fucking life has been shit. Raised by an abusive mentally ill narcissist, depressed and suicidal since fifth grade, molested, traumatized, abandoned on repeat until February of 2019 when finally it was better, and someone saw and understood and *loved* me for the first time in my life

And then he fucking died and no matter what anyone says itâ€™s my fucking fault because I didnâ€™t reply in time. No matter what anyone says if I had just fucking replied in time he would be HERE and I would be HAPPY

And everyoneâ€™s just fucking moving on and expecting me to be better like I hadnâ€™t just lost the only person whoâ€™d ever treated me like a human being and cared for me

I quit my job, Iâ€™m not getting into school, my friends are distancing themselves and I havenâ€™t left my bed in days

Give me one fucking reason
