yesterday i failed commiting suicideyesterday I took some heavy painkillers I had laying around from a infected tooth, and went to sleep with a plastic bag tied up around my head. 
I woke up this morning. 
I wrote out a suicide note for people not to grief and why. and I'm awake. 
I feel so lost. I don't know what to do.
