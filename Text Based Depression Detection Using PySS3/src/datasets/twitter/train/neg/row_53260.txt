I am going to be killing myself one of these days or upon impulseI should have done this a long time ago. I don't feel like I fit in with anyone and I believe most people are unbelievably simple minded (truly sorry if this sounds condescending whilst getting mad and emotional at incredibly insignificant problems. I realize there are reasons that people are this stupid and emotional so I really shouldn't be too upset about that. Sometimes I feel like it would be a good idea to kill myself even if my only option was stabbing myself to death. It feels like everybody has it easier than me. I don't want to get a job (unless I like it) yet I realize I have to. I have no loved ones because my own family fucking tortured me for over a year. (Several depending on your definition on torture/abuse).

I am likely to be leaving now since I am afraid I'll get an apathetic response or something that will make me feel like shit again. I just felt like this needed to be posted somewhere for some reason.
