I fear death less and less these days.I used to be absolutely petrified of dying. Scared of the unknown; would I just cease to exist?

Recently my fear has slowly started to fade away and has been replaced with an increasing thought of "maybe just ceasing to exist would be what I need."

I feel like I should just walk out onto the main road out the front of my house and end it. I only haven't committed to it yet as I feel guilty leaving my husband and daughter, but I'm honestly just hanging on by a thread now.

Sometimes I wish that at least one thing in life came somewhat easy to me. One can only dream, right?
