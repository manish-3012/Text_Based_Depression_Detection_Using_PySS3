It's been a long time comingI'm 19 male, and I've been depressed for around 13 years. My therapist thinks I have PTSD from events from early childhood around 18 months I got swept out into the ocean and among other near death experiences that I remember because of my PTSD, I also have insomnia, sleep paralysis, drug addiction, depression, and among other things that make my life a living hell. My Dad is a narcissist and my Mom doesn't know how to help they're separated have been since I was around 11. My grandmother died when I was 8 and I felt nothing didn't even cry at all. I may have more sinister mental illness but I manipulate and lie to my therapist to hide my dark triad personality. The first time I setup thought about suicide I was around 6 years old. Today has been a turning point my sociopathic sister threw a platform shoe at my face and faced no consequences for her actions all I did to provoke her was talking with my little brother. I have been trying to come out of this fog but I'm close to giving up. There seems to be nothing anyone can do to make me change my mind. I'm totally broke just using everyone around haven't had a job for months since I got fired from my last job because of my dark triad personality I know what I'm doing now is just using everyone for personal gain and I'm sure that they don't know it because everyone keeps allowing me to use them even when I try to convince them they shouldn't it's not guilt that keeps me from fully exploiting it. It's my own self hate
