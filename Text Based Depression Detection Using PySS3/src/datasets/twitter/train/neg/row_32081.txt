That drive homeI just donâ€™t know how much longer I can continue to push and wait for the day everything is okay. I just know Iâ€™m losing grip.

Nearly every night on my drive home I think about how great of a tool it could be to end it all.

I could total the car so that my husband isnâ€™t left with the loan. We signed our new lease with a clause, so if we found a house we could get out. 

Thereâ€™s enough in my savings for him to get by without me for a while.

I could quit my job to distance myself from my friends, maybe I can just disappear all together so I donâ€™t hurt anyone.
