Suicide Watch in the MilitaryAny Veterans with a similar experience? I remember suicide watch in boot camp and it was a humiliating experience for those who had to go through it - one of the reasons I never sought help when I was in.

I remember our DI bringing in a kid one night and telling us not to let him out of our sight. Whoever was on firewatch was responsible for his safety and if he tried anything all of us would feel the repercussions. To make sure the suicidal person didn't try anything, a group of people strapped him into his cot, and any time he needed to get up to use the head he had an escort with him. I also remember the DI giving us all a speech about growing a pair and not being weak, while standing next to the strapped down kid. I highly doubt this made him any less suicidal, and the experience scared me enough to never want to voice my own mental health concerns.
