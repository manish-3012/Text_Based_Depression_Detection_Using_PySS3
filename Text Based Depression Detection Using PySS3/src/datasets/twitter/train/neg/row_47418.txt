I'm out of people to talk to. I'm turning to you reddit.A little backstory here. I'm 19, I coasted through high school on intelligence and the ability to bullshit. I hit community college and have hit a wall. I split the costs of college with my parents, I live at home as long as I am going to school. I was never able to learn anything through primary education.  
I work at a dead end job via a mutual friend and it's demanding physical labor and I am exposed to very harmful chemicals with little to no protection. After a 9 hour day I find it hard to come back and get homework done let alone study.
  
I get lots of pressure from my dad to get a four year degree, more so from my step-mother (no one on my dad's side has set foot in a college class). I can't keep disappointing them with my grades.  

I was abused and neglected by my mother as a small child, so I have had depression and women issues for a long time.

Furthermore I stopped believing in God when I was around 8. But I went to church with my step mom (a pastor), a few years ago I came out as an atheist/agnostic and I greatly disappointed the family.

  My go to stress relievers are non existant now, I have no desire to seek out women or play video games, I still run occasionally, but I've lost all joy in it.  

The only thing I look forward to in my day is going to sleep and hope I don't get up in the morning. I'm tired of disappointing myself and everyone around me. Love you reddit, just looking for someone to talk to.
