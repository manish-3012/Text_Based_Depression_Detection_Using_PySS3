How will I ever cope with my sisters suicide???My sister is/was my best friend, my partner in crime and best big sister I could ever have hoped for.

She killed herself in September, and I cannot cope.

I cry everyday (im crying now just typing) I miss her so much.
I hate to think how alone she felt and I know I could have helped her. 

I hate thinking that she thought she had no other option, that the best thing to do was end it all...

Hundreds of people were at her funeral. She was the funniest, most caring, generous person. And it just isnt right that she is gone.

How do you cope?
How do you "move on"??

My parents and my other sisters just dont know how to help me. and neither do I.

My body actually aches with the amount i miss her.

We've both had suicidal moments in our lives, both suffered terribly with depression and we said that if either of us did it how pissed off we would be. We made a pact never to abandon each other. 

And Im left in a dark world without her. 

Any advice would be so appreciated.

p.s. anyone considering suicide, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE dont fucking do it. You have so many options and avenues to take and you have no idea the pain and suffering the people that love you will have to endure for a lifetime, and you wont be there to help them through. SEEK HELP, PHONE A FRIEND, TAKE A DEEP BREATH. Anything. peace and love xxx
