Being open and planning my final days.The lexapro paired with life events really took a turn t the worse for me. I admitted to my mom this morning that Iâ€™ve mentally given up. I said this in my bfâ€™s bathroom. I wanted to confess to him on on anti anxiety meds this morning and even tearede up and told him my fears around what I was going to tell him but I just couldnâ€™t. I ended up telling him it was for another reason. But my mental health is deteriorating and I need help. Iâ€™m ashamed and embarrassed and feel outside of my mom and therapist (who isnâ€™t too empathetic because she said something basically that after a certain age you donâ€™t have these issues) I feel telling anyone will make them see me as crazy. Iâ€™m going through hell mentally and even when I try to fake being better and being optimistic Iâ€™m just not. I actually prayed I wouldnâ€™t see my birthday the other day, pray I wonâ€™t wake up. And told my mom Iâ€™d just get a hotel and hang myself there. I want to get better and practice law of attraction and all of these things but I have just given up. I never thought this would be me at 28 but I can even feel my body responding to it. 

I donâ€™t know if there are any solutions but my anxiety is just too much for me to handle.
