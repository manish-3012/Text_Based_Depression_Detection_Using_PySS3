I fucked upTook 3 easy middle school exams today.

Almost everyone, even idiots, got 100 scores on 3 subjects.

I studied hard and got 1 question wrong on each subjects.

Today's exam was the easiest exam in my middle school life but I fucking made mistakes.

This puts me in a bad position and I don't want to even live anymore.

I fucking deserve to die.

I have 2 more days of exams. 

After that I will fall off my apartment and kill myself.
