Just a bunch of text. Not much here.Idk where else to put this. Got shit on by multiple people, and now I feel like shit. I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point. I don't really know what else to say. I'm pretty much a failure at this point. I feel like I'm just letting everyone down. I'm so broken and lifeless now. I can't seem to figure out how to socialize. I don't know anyone who has the same interests. I'm ready to say goodbye, but I'm also not.
