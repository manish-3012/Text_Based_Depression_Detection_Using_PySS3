PleaseI'm not even sure why I'm posting here again. I made a post nearly a week ago and yet, I'm back. I'm just...tired. I honestly don't want to do this anymore. Even though I kinda feel like a drama queen, posting this to a forum, I just wanted someone to know, I guess. When they find me, maybe they'll see this and it won't be so bad.

I'm just exhausted. I feel heavy and numb and weighted and I just want to give up the fight. Hell, I already have given up. It doesn't help that it's so damn hard to reach out for help. I've been battling for almost ten years and I'm losing. Even though I know people out there care, the more I care about them the less I want to talk to them about what's going on. I know I'm a burden and I don't want them to know that I feel like this. I'm honest to god trying to be a good person and not make them feel bad but I end up isolating myself and faking a smile and telling them that I'm okay, I can handle it, etc.

I feel like I'm already dying. Every part of me feels like it's just turning cold and shriveling up into nothing. I keep wondering what the point is of it all. I don't see the need to go into work. Money is useless to me. I keep forcing myself to do basic things and why? I'm giving up at this point. I can't keep going when everything is telling me to just stop. 

I don't know how I'll kill myself. I don't know when, but probably this week. Hell, I can't even get enough energy out to plan my own death. I just want to stop crying and screaming into a pillow. I want to stop hurting constantly and telling everyone that I'm fine. I think of suicide daily, several times a day. I want to die. I can't breathe here and want it to end already.
