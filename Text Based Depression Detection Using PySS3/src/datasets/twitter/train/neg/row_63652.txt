I cant deal with this anymoreI need mental help then after a year on a waiting list I'm told I've been put on another 6 month at least long waiting list. Why the fuck does this happen I've had some many thoughts of self harm I feel I'm gonna actually do it but noone in my life knows how distressed, depressed and sick of waiting i am
