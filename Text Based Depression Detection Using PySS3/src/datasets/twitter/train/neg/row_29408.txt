I have tried everything....I just don't know what to do anymore. I have BDD and all I can think about is how fat and pasty and fucking disgusting I am, how I'm getting saggy and old and what the fuck is the point of trying, I can't make freinds, I'm a paranoid wreck of a girl... I exercise every single day, I sleep before 9pm most nights I eat raw vegan most of the time, I try and meditate, I try to socialise.... I don't smoke or drink or take drugs anymore, I don't eat junk food, and I still look like a fucking tubby abused piece of shit. 


I am so fucking angry I am trying everything I can, I eat well, sleep enough, drink enough, exercise everything, fucking everything and I am still just a fucking average price of shit destined for the grave. 

I was suicidal a couple of years ago, and the feelings are creeping back, I'm just stuck in this fight or flight low, to depressed think anything is of any value, to anxious and self loathing to let myself do nothing. 

I just want it to end!
