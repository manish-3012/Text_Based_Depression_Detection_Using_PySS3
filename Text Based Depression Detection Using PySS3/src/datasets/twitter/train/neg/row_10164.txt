I'm scared of death but I also want to die at the same timeIn my old apartment we had a balcony and I used to stand on that balcony and look down for up to an hour, we moved recently to an apartment with no balcony. I have a fear of dying one day but I also hate myself and how lazy and unproductive I am. I feel like I will never accomplish anything good
