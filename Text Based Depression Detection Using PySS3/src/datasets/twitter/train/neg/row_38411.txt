Pill bottles open, waiting for something to sway me one way or the other.I've been feeling like dying for a few days now, but i've been depressed for the past few months. 

My ex dumped me in November, but we're on the same swim team so I see her everyday. She's made my life a living hell, she never told me why she left me, and she's been spreading rumors about me and turned half the team against me. My friendship with my best friend is on the fence because she heard I called her a bitch when I didn't, and I just found out the girl I've been crushing on heavily for the past month has feelings for another guy on the team.  

My parents are below water in debt, yet they are still paying for my schooling (tuition $35000 annually). My grades have been slipping out of my control, I don't understand the material in classes and no amounts of tutoring or office hours are helping.

I honestly feel as though there is nothing else in this world to live for, as all of my friends have turned their backs on me, as injuries have kept me from doing what I love, as I have no idea what to do with my life.  I fell like I'm a hinderance to the people who 'care' about me.  

I haven't taken any pills yet because the feeling comes in waves. Right now, I want to die, but the urge isn't there. I don't know why I'm typing this even.

EDIT: 15 pills deep. Didn't do the research first. Its Ibuprofen so I'm just gonna get sick at this point. I don't have enough to kill myself :(
