I lied to my friends about my drug relapse being a one time thing, confessed my lie out of guilt and probably lost them entirely... keep trying to write apology letters just for closure and they keep turning into suicide notesI wonâ€™t tell them this. I canâ€™t be that person who tells someone that their silent treatment is why I am feeling suicidal. Iâ€™m not that toxic, though thatâ€™s all I have going for me. Iâ€™m trying my best but thatâ€™s the problem. My best isnâ€™t good enough. It never is. I am giving it all I have and I cannot try any harder but I am still missing the mark so far. When Iâ€™m up I can do things. I try to take care of people. But when Iâ€™m down or in pain I am such a slacker and it doesnâ€™t matter which I am because both up and down it isnâ€™t enough.

I am tired of being me. I want to be someone else. Who I am hurts people. Who I am is gross and dirty and needs to be killed off like a virus that infects everyone I love.

Ten years of being suicidal, itâ€™s never felt this close to the end.
