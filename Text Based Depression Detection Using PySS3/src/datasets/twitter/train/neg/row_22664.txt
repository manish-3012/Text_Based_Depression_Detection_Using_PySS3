I think I'm fucking ugly and fat and I want to die.I fucking hate how I look. I've always hated how I look. 

I weigh 120LBS and look fat as fuck. My breasts are 32F I want a reduction badly but I can't afford it, i want kids in the future which will fuck my boobs up again and because I want to work to like them but I cant. My arms are covered in fat. I have a muffin top. My chest area (not my boobs, the part above them) is empty, there's nothing there. I have broad shoulders. 

My face is fucking ugly and narrow. I can't find sunglasses that fit my fugly face. I'm pale. Blue eyes and blonde hair. I look 12. I have braces too which fucked my bone structure up. Before I got them I had a decent and sharp structure but now I don't. 

I fucking have always hated my physical appearance. I wish I was pretty. I see pretty girls everywhere. All of my friends are so attractive and thin and have normal faces. I'm the odd one out and I always have been. 

I'm fucking deranged.
