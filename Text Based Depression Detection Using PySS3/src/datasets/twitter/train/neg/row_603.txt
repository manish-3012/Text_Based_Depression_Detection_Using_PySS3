I decided to fight last night and I am currently terrified it wont lastI posted my really long google doc explain my whole situation here and on r/depression yesterday and some of the responses I received resonated with me. I finally sent the document to my gaming clan, who hold me in high regard, after 30 minutes of physical agony trying to press enter. About 20 minutes later it felt amazing, like the wound healing after the bandage was ripped off. I didn't know what was healing, but it was, and any healing is good. As I've been saying, a thousand mile journey starts with a single step, right?

But I'm currently shaking and my heart is racing because I have a strong feeling I'll lose the willpower to live again. My chest hurts just thinking about it, and I cant stop thinking about it. I played a game and had a little bit of fun last night and I dont want to lose that again.
I'm scared to my core right now.
