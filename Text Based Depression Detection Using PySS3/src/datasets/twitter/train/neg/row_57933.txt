It's The MoneyOr, the lack thereof. I am 30 years old. I served 7 years in The United States Army. 3 years Active Duty, 4 years in the Reserves. I left the Reserves unfavorably and received an Other Than Honorable Discharge. I'm attending the Department of Veteran Affairs Hospital, and there I have been diagnosed with severe depression and Psychotic Disorder. I am severely depressed. I also think I'm basically going crazy. I have plenty of work experience, but I always end up leaving because of the thoughts in my mind. I have a job now, and I don't know. I just don't know at all.

It's the money. I'm only making 26k a year, but I have so much debt. I live at home with my older brother and mother, and if it weren't for them I would be homeless I think, or dead. I am battling suicidal thoughts. Sometimes they hit me in waves, other times they are minuscule. Right now, I need money. I need a way out. I feel like my financial situation is the only thing holding me back, and yet I am 100% the reason for my current situation. It hurts. It kills me every minute of the day, everyday. I want to end it all. I dream of jumping off of a cliff, hanging myself, buying a gun and just blowing my face off. I tell my mother how much pain I am in, and she reassures me that I am fine, and recommends that I check in to the VA. I don't know if medicine is helping. Right now all I know is that money would help me. It would help so much.

I am breaking apart. One day, and I know it will come swiftly and without much thought, I might just end my life. I wish things were different.
