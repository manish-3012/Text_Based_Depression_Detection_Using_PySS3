I need adviceI don't know where else to put this, but it's my girlfriend, not me. She's 17, I'm 18. She lives with her mother, and she just got into a screaming match with her, and I listened to the whole thing over the phone. Afterwards she picked the phone back up and told me she was going to kill herself. I called her back in tears and she picked up, and I told her not to do it, she is worth everything to me, and a lot of other things like that. We calmed down a bit and she said she needed to take a shower. She takes her phone in the shower and we're texting as I post this. Her mother often yells at her, and she doesn't really have anywhere else to go. I just need advice on what to do. I can provide more information if needed. Thank you
