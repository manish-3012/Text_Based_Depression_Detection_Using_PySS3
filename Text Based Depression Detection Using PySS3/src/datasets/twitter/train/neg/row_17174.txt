I am an emotional garbage fire, and all i want to do is extinguish it.I've lost so many friends, so many acquaintances because I am an emotional garbage fire.
I never learned how to correctly deal with my emotions since I always hid them, even from myself. Now whenever I allow myself to show them, I cant filter myself, I project and they're so volatile when I do that it just makes everyone else around me worse off. I swore off finding new friends after I lost my old best friend chai because of all this, but then I met my fiancee, and now I realize that he doesn't think I care about him and his feelings because of how much I project and talk about things that are hard for him to hear when I know he's going through shit himself.
I'm doing it again, I'm doing all of this over again
I just want it to stop, please, just stop, I just want to be normal and be able to deal with my feelings without hurting others and dumping my baggage on them
Therapy, psychology, pills, medications, nothing works, I cant fix it
I don't know what to do
God I can't do this
I just want it to be over
I try to fix it it just never stays fixed
I feel so alone cause I drive everyone away
I don't want to lose the only person I have  left.


I'm considering just drinking the antifreeze in my car. 
I dont want to but I just feel worse and worse. I dont know whays wrong with me.
I'm sorry...
I just want something to fix this. I want to be normal I want to be able to have friends and npt be deathly afraid of doing this shit to them.
The world is better off without someone like me.
What am I even doing anymore?
