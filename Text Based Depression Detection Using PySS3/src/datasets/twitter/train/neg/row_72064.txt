Death seems to be the only option.I (21F) have lived with my abusive, narcissistic parents my entire life, and I am done. I don't want to die, but I can't keep living like this, and I see no other way out. Since I am in college, I am financially dependent on them. I work part-time and have saved three grand, but it's not nearly enough to help me move out. Even if it was, I have nowhere to go. Even if it was, the memories, reminders, and nightmares of the trauma that my parents put me through will haunt me forever. I can't drop out of school. I can't quit my job. I have no friends, no family, nobody to help me out. The local homeless shelter isn't safe. Sleeping in my car isn't legal here. I have utilized every single therapist option here, and all they did was diagnose me and keep referring me elsewhere because nobody wants to deal with me. I can't contact a crisis line because I volunteer for one and that's part of our contract. I am tired of suffering, and I am tired of burdening every single person who attempts to love me. I am so tired. There is no other way out for me. I was dealt a bad deck of cards, and I feel helpless.
