More rambling.It frustrates me that whenever people talk about suicide, it's always about helping the family heal. It almost seems like the person who died didn't even matter - people say how much they miss the person, but it's all bullshit. People don't give a damn about you when you're alive, and when you're gone, when they say that you were a "bright light in a dark room to them" they are lying to make themselves appear more genuine. Fuck those people.

Instead of caring about the person who died and working out a way to stop it, they switch their focus to making the family feel better. There is no remorse for the dead. Granted there's nothing that can be done for the person at that point, but people who die by suicide are seen as terrible, awful people who should be shunned. Where is the support? Why can't suicide be seen as something that's ok? There's so much stigma around it and that is what keeps people from talking to others about this. Talking just makes everything worse.
