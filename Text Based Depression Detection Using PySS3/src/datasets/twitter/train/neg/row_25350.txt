DesolatedI have no friends, never had. Terrible childhood, adolescence... Bipolarity, anxiety. I'm broke, can't pay for therapy, I take four pills everyday, prescripted. I've tried to post on my social media how much of a hard time I'm having, no one cared, not a comment, not a like, nothing, completely invisible. People left me, actually, I'm starting to believe they were never here. All my boyfriend left me, last one left a big hole at my chest... I don't have anyone to comfort me, I believe people go to their friends at times like this? I'm tired, I've pushed so hard, I thought things was getting better, but it was all an illusion, now I'm going downhill, no hope for someone like me... I'm invisible right now, nobody cares.
