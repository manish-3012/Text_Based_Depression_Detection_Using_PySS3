I just can't shake the urges.No matter what I try I can't get rid of my suicidal thoughts.  I'm 26, have a great family, and I'm finishing up my degree.  Sure I have a crummy job and about 20k in debt but compared to some people I know I'm doing alright.  Why then is it that *every* night I am contemplating ending it all as I lie in bed.  I tell myself that I'm just being stupid but they wont go away.
