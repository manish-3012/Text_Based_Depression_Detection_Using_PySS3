Unemployed with BSc and MSc degrees. 32. Not sure I have the energy to fight anymore.I was unemployed before the pandemic.

Now I can't even get temp work. Retail is shut down so no part-time work there either.

I have a first class BSc in physics (2015) and an MSc in nuclear science / engineering (2019) from a Russel Group university here in the UK. I'm getting nowhere. I must not have the job connections and confidence that everyone else has.

I need to re-train and I don't know if I have the energy anymore. I applied to medical school last year and got rejected again. All that money and effort for nothing.

To apply again I'll need to pay Â£250 of my hard earnt money for the fucking GAMSAT, study and then there is no guarentee of getting into medical school. If I get in then I'll be studying until I'm 40.

What else can I do? Not another masters surely. I studied engineering and ended up unemployed.

I'm bitter as hell at all the effort I have put in throughout life to end up in this situation.

I also have no friends anymore (lost my last one in 2012), no girlfriend and I can't even socialise due to the pandemic.

THIS IS HELL ON EARTH.
