Death seems welcomingHonestly just wrote a note for me to leave behind. Sitting here crying uncontrollably. I don't see any reason to live, only reason I'm not gone yet is thinking how much I will hurt my family and my close friends. I'm over it now I can't go on, I hate life, I'm bored of life and genuinely do not want to live. I'm a disappointment to everyone and have terrible addiction habits. I guess I'm entering the final few days or weeks of my life. Guess I needed to share.
