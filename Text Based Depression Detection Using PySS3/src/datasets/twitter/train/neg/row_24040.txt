Oh hi reddit.So I'm suicidal. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about it, or don't want to I guess. Don't want to upset family, my mom killed herself. Don't want to bother boyfriend, plus he always looks at suicide memes and crap. Friends don't really exist in my life cept one who has her own thing going on and don't want to weigh her down.

I'm just sick of it all. I feel like shit. I'm not happy. I'm tried of pretending to be happy. It's fucking hard. I'm not getting what I need from my relationship anymore and I don't know if it's part of my depression or what. I work as a teacher and most days the kids are the only thing that keep me alive, but even then there is constant drama that drains me. I don't want to do anything. I have nothing to look forward to. I feel number to everything. I just wanted to write this down for some reason, and let the thoughts exist outside my head.
