I want to scream for help and I have no oneIts almost my 19th birthday and I feel like im drowning. Another birthday with no plans and no friends digs into me like a knife in my chest. I dont want to spend my birthday with my boyfriends friends like a pathetic loser. I just want my own friends. I dont understand why no one likes me. I work now but everyone at my job is much older and theres no common ground. Im so so so tired of being so alone. I dont even try to reach out much online anymore because it all just feels like a bunch of guys hitting on me or sending dick pics. I want my own life and friends so bad and I have no clue where to make any or where i fit in in this world. My boyfriend is going to go out with his friends and get drunk tonight and I cant help but be so jealous. I want my own life and to feel like i belong somewhere. I want friends that love me and call me asking to hang out. Its not fait. I dont get what Im doing wrong, or why no one liked me in high school. Managing a stressful job with all these suicidal thoughts is so hard. I feel stuck, and like all I do is work and sleep. Someone please help me, I need advice :(
