Best Friend Doesnâ€™t Get The Seriousness...this might be a bit of a rant, Iâ€™m not even really sure where to start. I have severe depression, anxiety/panic disorder and I hear voices sometimes. Iâ€™m under a psychiatrist however due to COVID I havenâ€™t seen anyone face to face now for a long time &amp; my appointments are 3 months apart. 
My best friend has known since we met that I suffer with really bad mental health problems, he knows I have self harmed in the past and knows that Iâ€™ve really been struggling lately. 
Heâ€™s been away for just over a week I believe, so weâ€™ve not spoke as much or seen each other however I have told him every day of my increasing issues, low mood and wanting to not be here anymore. 
Last night I finally said that I may ring for help today, he offered to ring me and I politely said no, explaining that Iâ€™ll just cry and work myself up more. After venting some more then over text message I got â€œjust ring tomorrow thenâ€ 
I just told you I couldnâ€™t do this anymore, Iâ€™ve spoke about not wanting to be here for over two weeks now, and as my best friend thatâ€™s all you say? I feel like I shouldnâ€™t be angry because I shouldnâ€™t expect so much, but I recently helped him through a very tough patch, and now it just seems like when I need help no one is there. 
I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do, Iâ€™ve told him I wonâ€™t bother him with my issues anymore. 
I still have plans to commit suicide, i just havenâ€™t picked out a day yet.
