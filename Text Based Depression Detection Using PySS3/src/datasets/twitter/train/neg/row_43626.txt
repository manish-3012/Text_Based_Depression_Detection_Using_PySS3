You existHowdy there person reading this. Iâ€™ll be posting this then heading to bed, but instinct told me to post this and it hasnâ€™t failed me yet.

You exist. You matter. Even if it feels like the entire world has abandoned you and that nobody sees you, you exist. Whether it be the cashier who took the money for your food or even just a bird that gave you their weird looks from a telephone pole, they are the proof that you exist. 

The holidays are a very long and painful time, I fully understand that, trust me I do. Please continue to stick around just a little bit longer, as this can be your start. I Mister_4Eyes, a random guy on the internet who at least somewhat understands that horrible pain, hereby acknowledges that you exist and I acknowledge that even if it is for something that seems inconsequential, that you matter. Now is the time to show them all the same thing, but first before you can do that just live. 

May we all continue to support each other and be the beams we need in each otherâ€™s lives.
