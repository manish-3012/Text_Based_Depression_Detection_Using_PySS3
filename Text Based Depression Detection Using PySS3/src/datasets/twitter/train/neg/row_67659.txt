I just feel stuck.. nothing is waitingThe girl I love left and got out of my life, my friends are distant and we don't talk much anymore, I met a friend online and we talked for a few months but she's starting to leave me too. Am I seriously that unloved and useless everyone leaves? Maybe I should just end it.. I've been feeling like shit for almost 6 months now and I don't see an end beside the ultimate one.. I don't know what to do anymore.
