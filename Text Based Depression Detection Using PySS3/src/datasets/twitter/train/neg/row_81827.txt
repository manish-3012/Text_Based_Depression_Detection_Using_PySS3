Help and input pleaseI know I will probably kill myself one day, I don't know when but one day I will find peace, either I will overcome my problems or I will die. And I'm trying to write my suicide note for when that day comes. I don't know what my state of mind will be like when I decide to kill myself so I want to write it now. The problem is I don't know what to write. I could do something really clichÃ©d but I'd rather not. I know the basic points I want to get across and I'm usually quite articulate but I just don't know what to write. Also should I make multiple notes addressing different people or should I just do one for everyone? If I only do one should I do separate paragraphs for people? I just don't know
