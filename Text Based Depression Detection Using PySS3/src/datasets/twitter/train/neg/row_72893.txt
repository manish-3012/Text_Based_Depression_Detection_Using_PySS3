Today for the first time I felt down around friends.Like a lot of you guys I have some pretty self destructive thoughts most days. I have become very efficient at filling my day with distractions. It's mostly mindlessly browsing Reddit, playing video games, binging stuff Netflix or hanging with friends.
In the last few weeks I've lost all interest in video games and Netflix. I'm even getting bored of reddit.

I was fine with all that because I still had my friends, good supportive group of people. I've pretty much spent this entire day just hanging but something was different. For the last few hours I've been having these really bad intrusive thoughts that only happened when I was alone. I'm rambling now but what I'm getting at is it scares me. I thought I had the coping mechanisms down but they're all failing me one by one. I just don't know anymore.
