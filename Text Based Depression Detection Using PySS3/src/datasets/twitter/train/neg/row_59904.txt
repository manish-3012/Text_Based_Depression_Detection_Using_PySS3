Should I end my life?I am going through a break up and I donâ€™t think I will find love again given the kind of person I am. I donâ€™t enjoy my work and due to certain reasons I canâ€™t even quit it. Even if I do quit it somehow, I donâ€™t know what to do next. I donâ€™t have a good relationship with my parents or with anybody. I think I should just stop wasting my time.
