I want help, but I don't want to lose my only friends in the process.They're people I met over the internet a few years ago. While I've never met them in real life, they are my best and only friends. I scared my old friends many years ago away with my talk about how I wanted to die and how I self harmed.

I've started to hurt myself again and I want to tell them, but I'm afraid of what they'll say. I don't want to lose my only friends just because I couldn't keep my mouth shut about problems that aren't really their business anyway...

I've already lost friends because of this, I don't think I could handle losing them again.
