If this is the rest of my life, I will commit suicideIf the people I count on for love and support choke me out and push me and squeeze the life out of me like this I will end my life. My parents never provided the support I needed, and my friends whom I turned to when my parents failed me have pushed me into a corner. I want to jump in front of a bus. How tempting- 5 minutes from now it could all be over. No more being let down by people. No more life as a human puppet with people's hand up my anus controlling my every move. Nothing but nothing and all it takes is 5 minutes for me to walk out of this flat and in front of a bus. Then I won't have to endure this shit fest that I had not choice but to be born into. I didn't choose to be born. I didn't choose depression. I am dealing with the consequences of something I didn't want. I don't want life, why should I have to suffer through it?
