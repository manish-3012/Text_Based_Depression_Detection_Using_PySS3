I'm only 14. What's wrong with me?before i begin, I'm 14, female, and a freshman in high school..

its like this.

i want to die. i really do. there's something inside of me that's just so disconnected from the world around me. im constantly sad. theres a hole that can not be filled. i truly believe i will never be genuinely happy. im constantly worried or stressed or nervous or anxious. i can't find the light anymore. i cant find my reason to live. on the really bad days, ill spend hours upon hours thinking about it. fantasizing about it. how i would do it. the ways there are to do it. if i would leave a note, say goodbye. if anyone would even notice. i would think about how all of my internet friends would find out, maybe they wouldnt. what about my friends that live so far away? the friends that i really love the most. how would they find out? what about my depressed friends, would i make them worse? what about my family. my half brother really. i havent seen him in almost a year and how would he react? i think he would be disappointed in me. He doesnt even call anymore. 

I don't have anyone. I really don't. I know already some of you will say tell my parents or a doctor. I have. It. Doesnt. Help. 

I'm so messed up, I'm such a freak. People dont think like this. People dont cry themselves to sleep every night. people dont do this.

i think about how easy it would be. how nice it would be. i wouldnt be sad anymore. i wouldnt have that empty space. nobody could hurt me anymore. 
nobody could hurt me.

except for myself.

im the only one hurting myself really, because of the way i react to everything. but i cant go back now.

right now, it seems like there are two choices.
1. to kill myself
2. to not kill myself

but in my mind, ive already chosen.
