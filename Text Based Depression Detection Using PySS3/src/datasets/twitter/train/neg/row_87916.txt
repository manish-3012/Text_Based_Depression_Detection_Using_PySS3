I don't wanna die, I just wanna get closeI don't want to get super-personal, but I've been abused by people I loved in almost every other way besides sexual. I've been left by so many people who I loved: my dad and the friends I make every 2 years (I move a lot). I'm afraid that my only parent will leave me if I come out of the closet (she's very religious;believes it's a choice;voices dislike for a their "lifestyle"). She also"doesn't "believe in" depression, which I speculate I have (haven't been diagnosed though). My siblings are so distant and care more about their friends than me.

I think about what would happen if I attempted suicide sometimes and think about how everyone would act. I don't actually consider DOING it, but I think about it. Mom would actually recognize that who I love doesn't matter, my siblings would realize that they weren't acknowledging me. My dad would hear the news and realize he was a dick. Everyone would recognize I need love and give me so much of it too.

...what's wrong with me?
