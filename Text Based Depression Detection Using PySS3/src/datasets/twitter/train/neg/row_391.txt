Scared sister is going to do itMy dad and my sister have never been good friends. Today they started screaming at each other, my sister started swearing (we're Christians) and my dad tried to hit my sister (but I stopped him). She said she couldn't take it anymore and ran to her room. I'm scared out of my life that she's going to kill herself. What do/can I do?
