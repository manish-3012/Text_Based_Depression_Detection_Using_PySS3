Ive been thinking a lot about killing myself...I had a baby a couple months ago and since then Iâ€™ve been pretty much a stay at home mom. I got my degree two weeks before giving birth but Iâ€™ve had no luck job hunting. His father had been nothing but supportive but nothing makes me feel better. Everything about my situation has been getting to me to the point that Iâ€™ve thought about killing myself more than60% of the time in the last couple days. Iâ€™ve been using drugs and sex to cope but at the end of the day, I still feel the same. I donâ€™t know what I can do at this point. I donâ€™t want to have these thoughts because I now have a baby that needs me but Iâ€™m too broke to be able to pay for a therapist.
