I'm autistic and want to dieEvery single bad thing that's happened to me in my life has been because of autism. My schooling (where I was in the gifted program) was rife with disciplinary action resulting from my autistic meltdowns, and I was in trouble with the law at age 15. I've always had trouble being close to people because I either am hyperaware of how odd my interactions seem to the point that I think they hate me, or they leave because they see me have a meltdown and freak out. I want nothing more than good things for everyone, and the issue is that when I need to take space for myself, I can't. I cannotI have never hurt anyone that wasn't myself, and I hurt myself a lot. Hurting myself is the only thing that lets me focus and stop whatever stimulus is setting me off from permeating into my brain. My partner, who I have been dating for a very long time, is not equipped to deal with me and my panic attacks, and we both know that. Some people are like fucking angels and snap me out of it easily. These people are my best friends. But the fact that I have meltdowns at all is almost always the start of a fight between me and my partner, and it always ends up hurting both of us more to the point of having screaming matches twice per week. I have a college degree and I make barely above minimum wage, and I'm becoming more disillusioned with the horrifying state of the world around me, especially the more I know about it. My understanding of institutions and power structures has made me realize how powerless I am to fix literally any injustice in the world. Maybe it's because I'm autistic, maybe it's because I'm an asshole, but I don't want to live in this world anymore, because it's not made for, built by, or bearable for people like me. The problem is I'm not sure how.
