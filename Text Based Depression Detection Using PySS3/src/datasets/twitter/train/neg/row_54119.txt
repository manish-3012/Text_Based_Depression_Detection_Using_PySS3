People don't believe I want to kill myself and that i'm depressed.I have gotten so fucking good at faking emotions that when I finally had a moment where I couldn't fake it someone at school asked me if i'm depressed. I said yes and I also said i wanted to die. Now everyone thinks I fake it because I'm good at hiding my emotions. People have litterally started bullying me for "Faking depression". And of course I had the luck to get depression during Covid so I can't fucking go to a doctor because all the doctors work on helping Covid patients, so I can't fucking get proof either. And the only way to go to a doctor right now is to pay for a fucking private doctor and they are expensive as fuck.
