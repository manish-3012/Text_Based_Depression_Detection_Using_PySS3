Buffer timeBack in the beginning of the year I found myself homeless. Kicked out of my home by my now ex wife. I was hanging on by a thread before then. At the beginning of the year after being kicked out i gave myself until the the first third of the year to see if my life would get any better. Well the time is up. I have tried to make positive changes. I am now on suboxone for for opiate abuse. I have my own place and see my kids about half time. But I am no more happier than before. I would say I am worse off. So what is your advice and options. If they make sense ill take it. If not then well I will consider all my options. If you want to know why I am leaning towards this feel free to ask.
