please just tell me not to do iteverything hurts and i feel so alone and I can't burden my friends or my roommate so I went to omegle to just tlak to anyone who might understand and because that's where i first met the girl i fell in love with who's put me here and i guess i thought maybe it could happen again and instead multiple people told me to just kill myself and i don't see why I shouldn't and now i'm just drinking in my room alone trying to numb it all but it's not working i'm just dizzy and in pain and i want it all to stop i just want it all to stop
