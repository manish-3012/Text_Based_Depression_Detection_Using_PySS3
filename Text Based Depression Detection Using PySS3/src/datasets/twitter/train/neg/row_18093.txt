Ive got my suicide all planned out. I just need the guts to do it.Ive hung a scarf in my closet that i could use to hang myself whenever i need to. No one will disturb me b/c i live alone.
I really wish it didnt have to be like this. But my health problems make me anxious about the future.  I have been suffering nearly everyday for the last 3 years because of my health problems and it just keeps getting worse.

I just want to die peacefully.
