Pushing people away;People spend their whole lives looking for someone to love them, but when it happens to me, I have the overwhelming urge to run away. As soon as I feel myself slipping into that sweet intoxicating feeling of reciprocal love, I immediately shut down. Itâ€™s not rose-colored bliss for me. Itâ€™s a tangled knot of anxiety, an endless battle between my head and my heart.Logically, I know Iâ€™m being crazy. I realize that when you find someone who cares about you, youâ€™re never supposed to let him or her go. But then my heart always seems to loudly protest, declaring that it doesnâ€™t want to be anyone elseâ€™s. That itâ€™s safer if it were only my own.
The undeniable truth about getting close to someone is that you give them part of your heart. It doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s big or small, you give part of it away. And once you do that, the person who holds your heart controls some part of your happiness. All of a sudden, you canâ€™t help but feel butterflies when they look at you or quiet the pounding in your chest when they say your name. You wish you could make it stop, to gain back some of the control of your emotions, thoughts, sanity, but you canâ€™t. You hate that they can make you more joyful that you could even imagine or the fact that in a second, they could break you. And thatâ€™s the beautiful, messy and truly terrifying part of it.He asked me not to run away, but would understand if I did. The thought of him walking out of my life was far more heartbreaking than the fear ending up heartbroken.
