About to pop some pills and mess up my armI am a complete failure in life, I failed Uni and now I am basically doing nothing with my existence. I've got severe OCD, bipolar disorder and histrionic personality disorder with self harming too. I pop pills just to get through the day but I am thinking of OD'ing on antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzos and antiemetics. My parents aren't supportive of my illnesses but I think they would be devastated if they found my body. I can't do that to them at their age but I don't want to live either... I wish I could find a job but I have no degree, experience or motivation. Just trying to get through the day
