I can't kill myself, can someone do it for me?My ex informed me he's going to start seeing a therapist, which means he's doing pretty bad. He was very short on the phone, to the point. 

I can't handle this anymore. Please, I don't want to do this anymore. Everything hurts too much. My chest hurts. I can't sleep. Please.
