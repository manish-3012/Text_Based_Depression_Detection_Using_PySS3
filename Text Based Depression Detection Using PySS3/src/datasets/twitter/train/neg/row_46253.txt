I feel like it's all already over, so why bother keep going if it will aways be like this?I don't even know where to start on this. 

My life was never "good", i was mentally unwell since i was a kid. Aways thought about killing myself or running away to a family who really liked me (i was an accident and they couldn't abort). As a teen it got worse, i didn't do well in school, picked the wrong trade to learn, had to get a job and tried to off myself at 16. 

I still have mixed feelings about it because life did not get better at all. It kept getting worse, i developed bad anxiety, but kept going on autopilot. 

And now i'm here, still on autopilot, life situation still getting worse because my parents are aging and the plans i had to take one last shot at happiness are gone. I have to care for them with my dead end job and have to go to college late because this dead end job won't cover all the expenses.

Like fuck, what is the point? to keep crying in the shower everyday because i can't stand setting foot at my job and doing the same bullshit again?  i can't study, can't have fun, can't sleep, can't get a relationship because of homophobia, can't escape, can't ask for help or they throw me in a psych ward...

It would be selfish for sure but i just keep thinking of ending it. My friends will go on since i can't even talk to them most days, my parents don't even like me, yeah they need me alive for money soon but i don't even care about it much, as bad as it sounds they didn't care about me growing up so whatever. In life i may not have that courage but i would be dead so it's fine.

It's the only way out i'm seeing. Makes no difference if i go a little early since eveeyday is the same and going by in a blur anyway.
