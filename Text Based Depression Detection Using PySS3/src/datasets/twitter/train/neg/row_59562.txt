I didn't know who else to tellNearly a year ago I knew this was a possibility. The money ran out. My prospects have run out. I started distancing myself from everyone. Today seems like the best day to end it for me. 

I don't want anyone to talk me out of it. I won't be checking the account anymore. I just needed to tell someone. I needed to get it out there. 

Thanks for providing me a way to give myself closure. I appreciate that so much.
