I want revengeBack again and the feeling of emptiness and hatred is consuming me. Sometimes seeing they all forgot about me makes me just wanna hide from the world and die. Other times like tonight makes me wanna die but make sure they know they are guilty and should hurt like i did. 
I know this makes me a bad evil person but i dont know if i care any more. All i want now is for them to feel as sad and alone and as awful as i do.
And forgiving and letting go isnt an option, i wish it was. I always catch wind thru various ways of their lack of caring and their happiness as if i never existed. I find myself constantly alone and thinking about it unable to scrape the thoughts from my head and at night the nightmares never go away.
