Reasons Why (trigger warning: rape, self harm, sexual assault)- Chronic pain from TMJ (I canâ€™t even eat, eat mushy or liquid foods), canâ€™t talk or sing much anymore, just lay in bed and sleep to escape pain 

- Chronic sinus infections (I canâ€™t breathe, always feel like Iâ€™m about to sneeze, eyes swollen shut half the day)

- I try to be a kind person the best I can. Iâ€™ve never yelled at a stranger or friend or boyfriend. Iâ€™ve never cheated. Iâ€™m not clingy. I support everyone with everything they do, and I give people hundreds of chances to change. I make food for people. If someone has a problem, even a random person who hasnâ€™t been the nicest, I will talk to them and try to give them solutions. I try to put out good karma into this world. I know I wonâ€™t be here much longer, so might as well make a positive impact. I try to not be stepped on either though. 

- Chronic inflammation and skin conditions (acne, eczema, every pore on my leg is purple and inflamed, eyelids are always inflamed and crusty and often swollen completely shut, family thinks I exaggerate these symptoms and that I just naturally look swollen and red or whatever)

- Zero friends. Not exaggerating. Not one friend. Never had a close friend before. Iâ€™ve had depression ever since Iâ€™m 10. I text some people occasionally but no one Iâ€™m close to who I can share my feelings or hang out with.

- Was raped. No one acknowledged, and when they did realize, told me to be more picky with my sexual partners. I couldnâ€™t have been more picky. I was passed out.

- Not in school (even though I had a 4.2 GPA and 1550 SAT). Was homeschooled 10-12th grade high school. Went to liberal arts college in another state has manic/psychotic episodes had to go back home. Started community college but parents pulled me out during my depressive episode.

- No trust in men. I can never have a normal relationship. Besides being raped, I had men bombard me with videos of porn stars and detail why I wasnâ€™t as hot as them, inspect me for flaws, take advantage of my past trauma as part of their kink, lie to me about being married, tell me that the only reason they like me is because Iâ€™m psycho or dumb, etc. I shouldnâ€™t have been dating during this bad time. During my Klonopin withdrawal period, I had a panic attack and a guy just drove away.

- OCD thoughts nonstop. Iâ€™m scared of even thinking certain thoughts. Iâ€™m convinced certain thoughts or not having certainty thoughts will jinx my future. Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m a sexual deviant (even though I have no libido and am a straight vanilla female with only 2 sexual partners ever 3 including rape). Iâ€™m convinced Iâ€™m becoming a hermaphrodite, or that Iâ€™m actually transgender. Weird thoughts.

- Eating disorder. Scared of being fat, also scared of being skinny. I just want to look ill. I donâ€™t want to look like a girl that men fetishize. Look small and thin and pedophiles will want to rape me. Look curvy and Iâ€™ll be objectified. I canâ€™t stop bingeing and purging. I was underweight then a guy was checking me out now I want to become fat.

- Mom harassed me for my nude photos. She imitated how I took the photos, this is what drove me to attempt suicide. She showed them to my dad and sister and now everyone thinks Iâ€™m a slut and my sister tells my cousin about how I sleep with many men on the first date. 

- Blatant preferential treatment for my sister. She gets her laptop fixed, I donâ€™t. She gets haircuts, I donâ€™t. While I was getting a seizure from Klonopin withdrawals, my mom was shopping for a custom coat for my sister for hours and when I told my mom what happened she said something like â€œoh thatâ€™s not nice.â€

- Hundreds of people know my diagnosis and think Iâ€™m crazy. My sister had a fundraiser for mental illness to help her get into a good college and to make it more inspirational she shared my health information with many people who now treat me weird.

- Everyone outside our family like extended family and family friends also are super patronizing and treat me as this person you want to be cordial with but also not get close to and are super patronizing 

I need someone to talk to so badly. Iâ€™ve felt this way for so so so long. No one cares. I feel invisible. I swear I can tell aloud that I want to kill my self and no one would care. I wish someone could ask me if
