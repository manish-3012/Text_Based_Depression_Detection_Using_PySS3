I'm just brokenI have all in my life to be happy. A good job, money, a beautiful house, a good health... but I have no love. I never had. I've never heard words like I love you, I think of you, I miss you. 

My family is toxic, my parents broke me. My childhood was horrible. I considered suicide since I was 9. I endured humiliation, threats, violence. 

I'm 35 now and nobody loves me. I try to be positive and sympathetic with everyone but people always leave. Life is always the same: humiliation, threats, violence. 

 I'm alone. I'm a disgusting girl. I don't deserve to be loved. I hate myself and I wanna die.
