I'm losing my only will to liveBack in the summer of 16 I was grateful to have been able to become closer to one of my friends. (we've been friends a year but we didn't talk a lot, just aquanauts) We got to know each other and became very close in a short amount of time. For some background info, I am a very reserved person and am not comfortable sharing personal stuff or stuff about my mental health. When I've done it in the past it backfired and now I have issues trussing people. Also I don't have a lot of friends so the ones I do have (2-3) I try to keep close (to mostly failed attempts). So as time went on we become as close as too friends can be, she knew me better then anyone and sometimes more then myself. 

For the first time in my life I had someone that I felt comfortable telling anything to because I knew she could support me and help me through it. Eventually she picked up on the fact that I was depressed and I opened up to her. She was able to help and she got me back on my feet. She was the one person who could truly make me happy, just talking to her or seeing her could put a smile on my face. But as of late, I feel like I'm losing her. I feel like as with friends I've had in the past, she just dose not want to be there for me anymore. She has a must wider web of friends so I'm just a drop in the bucket. I was led to believe that I was important to her and that was what led me to want to live, the fact that I was important to someone. But without her, I have nothing and I just feel empty and sick all the time. I just can't handle this pain and I want it to stop and I can't see another way out of this hell other then to be dead. I know I don't matter to other people, I can be replaced, I'm not special, I'm not useful, I am nothing to everyone. This is someone I can't move on from because they are everything to me despite the fact that the only person that could save me, is now killing me.
