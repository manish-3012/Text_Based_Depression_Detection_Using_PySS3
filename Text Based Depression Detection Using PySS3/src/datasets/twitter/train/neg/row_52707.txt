Im done. I got into the classic mindset again and wont come out.So ive recently found myself planning again. Its very concrete and i know of myself that i wont be able to let go. 

My mind is clear again and i finally have a goal in life. Its comforting and i just want the time to go by.

I dont even know why i write this, not like i want to be helped. Maybe i just want to vent a bit and be at peace. If the day comes ill surely write again.
