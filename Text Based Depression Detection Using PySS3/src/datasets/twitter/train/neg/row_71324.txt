How am I to last here, I do not think I am depressed but I yearn for the release of death.My thoughts may one day get the best of me, everyday has become a civil war in my brain between rational and irrational thoughts, this civil war had ended for 3 days last week, my head was clear, I was happy for 3 days, but it went to shit again.
