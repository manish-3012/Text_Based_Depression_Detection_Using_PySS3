I don't know what to do...death seems easier at this point.Things have been rough for me the past few years. I never managed to do anything worthwhile with my life and now I'm starting to fall into so many health issues that I don't know if I can keep going.

It seems like every thing that I enjoy is worthless, my friends don't care about my interests. I'm alone in all of my hobbies. I never got a career off the ground, dropped out of college, couldn't afford my pilots certifications. Now I'm nearly 30 years old, still living with my parents and working at a call center making minimum wage. I've gained 80lbs in the past year alone.

Now lately at the urging of my mother I started to use my health insurance for something. Got my wisdom teeth out, discovered I'm hypertensive and got put on medications. Now I find out that I might have colorectal cancer and I'm going for a colonoscopy in a few weeks to find out.

I was going to see a psychiatrist but now I'm wondering whats the point? I've basically ruined my whole life by being a loser and now I'm probably going to die of cancer. I feel like I'm never going to be able to do any of the things I wanted for my life growing up so why even bother trying? Every single night I think about going up to the Skyway and jumping. The only thing stopping me is worry for my family and that I'd somehow survive the fall.

I wanted help...but I'm not sure that I'll ever have the life I want and that's just not acceptable to me. I'd rather be dead than settle in this misery. I hate being poor. I hate living with my parents at 26. I hate not being able to afford anything. I hate driving a barely-functional ancient car. I hate my weight/appearance. I hate that I can't share my interests with any of my friends. I hate not being able to afford higher education. I hate my life. 

I just want at least one reason to keep fighting, I want some glimmer of hope, but right now I'm just not seeing anything.
