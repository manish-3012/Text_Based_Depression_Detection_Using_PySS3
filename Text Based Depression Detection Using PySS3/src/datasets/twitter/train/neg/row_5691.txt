I have never felt more suicidalLast week my dog nearly died and was in and out of the animal hospital costing me $1000 I donâ€™t have. I am behind on school work because I was taking care of her so I am stressed to the max. Then this week my bf broke up with me. And I have been so stressed out I canâ€™t eat or sleep or breathe. I have been vomiting to the point of passing out and hospitalization.

Every object I see is a way to kill myself. I walk into the bathroom and I want to hang myself with the shower curtain. I walk into the kitchen. And I want to stab myself. I walk to my car and I want to jump into in coming traffic. Any heavy object I want to pick up and smash my head in. Every medication I debate dumping the whole bottle down my throat. When Iâ€™m not hyperventilating while doing homework Iâ€™m crying.

I have no one. I was in the hospital alone and the doctors insisted someone drive me home so I pretended I had a ride so I could leave. They told me someone needs to monitor my condition so I told them that someone would. But I lay here alone shaking on the ground hoping and praying to any deity that might exist that I may die. 

I have never wanted to die this bad not even when I attempted suicide before. It hurts too bad and I am utterly alone.
