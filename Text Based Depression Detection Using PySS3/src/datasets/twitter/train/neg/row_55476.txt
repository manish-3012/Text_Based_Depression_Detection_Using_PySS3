Sometimes I wonder if maybe I should just commit suicideI'm not really planning on it, but sometimes I find myself thinking that it would be a relief so often, that I don't know why my mind is still averse to the thought of actually doing it. I mean I still have a few basic reasons not to, like the fact that it would hurt some people, and I genuinely worry that if I commit suicide it might trigger one or two more, and I always want to imagine that I'll figure things out someday.

But the thought of dying sounds so relieving. I never feel relief in my life. Relief is super rare but I still keep doing things and pushing forward and I feel like this lack of relief will always keep me too demotivated to make positive changes. So why not just end it?

Sometimes though, I wish someone in my personal life would hear my problems and instead of getting uncomfortable or having some typical reaction, would actually be concerned and just give me an understanding ear.
