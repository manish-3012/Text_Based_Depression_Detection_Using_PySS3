How long before it's acceptable?I've been diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder and have had severe anxiety and depression issues since I was 10. Now I am 41 years old. I have quit the job I loved and filed for disability so that I can focus on getting better. However, with my state of mind constantly whipping back and forth, I dont feel I have made much progress with therapy. Meds dont help. I'm just tired, I want it all to be over.  I feel like everyone is holding me emotionally hostage by telling me how much they would miss me. They dont understand that I just want peace. How long do I have to go on like this before it is acceptable to drop the curtain?
