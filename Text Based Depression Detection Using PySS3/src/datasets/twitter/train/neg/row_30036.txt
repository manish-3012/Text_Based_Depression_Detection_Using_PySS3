Revealing secrets fucking sucksFrom coming out to admitting you fucked something up instead of covering it up, it all fucking sucks. Fuck why am I doing this? I only seriously attempted once. Fuck I hate my dad's racism and *insert dumbass hatred of minority here*. I never wanted to do this. I didn't ask to be different. I never wanted to die. I want to be normal. I don't want to have another shitty coming out experience. Fuck it, everyone I'm bisexual and obviously not proud. I hate saying it, thinking it. It's the root of my suffering. Countless hours crying on the bathroom floor. Lying to my dad. Lying to my friends, my teachers, doctors, sister. I don't want to die. I just want to be normal. I don't want a neurological condition, I don't want asthma, I don't want to be ashamed of myself when I look in the mirror anymore. I want to be happy again. I want to go to therapy. But I can't. Because I lie on every psych eval. "Have you ever tried to kill yourself?" I get flashbacks to that night. All the emotional suffering stays secret. The cause stays hidden. Fuck revealing secrets, lying is easier anyway and the only thing I'm good at
