The more the days go by, the more the pain amounts, the more I realize the one who hurt me is the only one that can help me. But she won't. I feel the end is nigh.The girl I loved and was with for two and a half years left me in a heart best. I've talked to so many people, suicide hotlines as well, and the answers that everyone gives me won't help me. The one who hurt me in the end and did all those things to me is the only one who can help me. I didn't do a thing to deserve what she did to me. And she hurt me more than any physical pain I have left. She won't speak to me because it hurts too much. But if she doesn't, I may end it sooner than I want. I need to speak to her. I need my best friend back. I need my love back. I need my relationship back. I need that old girl I fell in love with back. Because nothing will heal me otherwise. Time won't, friends won't, family won't. Only her. I'm trapped. I'm lost. She won't ever come back. Ironic, isn't it? The one who hurt me is the only one can help me. I'm so screwed up now.

The memories still haunt me everyday. It's a constant bombardment of all the memories and feelings and things we shared. All of our firsts together. I almost did it once. I told her. She used it against me in the end to justify what she did. Now she's looking for dated and everything. And two and a half years with her, being with her through the hardest times of her life, never judged her, always loved her no matter what. But she left me. And she won't speak to me. I need her to. I don't know what to do. And I have nothing left I care about to keep me going. 

I feel stupid being this way. There are people going through way worse. But I had a part of me lost when she left me. Now, I can't live without that part. It's gone, and gone forever.
