is suicide prevention lifeline a good organization?Hi I am looking to donate a lot to a good suicide prevention / help organization and was wondering if anyone had experience with the suicide prevention lifeline? From my research they seem to be the largest one in the united states and their website looks good. Is this a good organization to donate to?
