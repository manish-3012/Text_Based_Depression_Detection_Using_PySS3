Hail Mary pass (ironically)The Church says it's a mortal sin. I know it's a selfish act but living has been suffering and fear and shame for years now. I have self-talked myself into near insanity, I've kept going/trying/hoping but hope deferred makes the heart grow sick. As Red said, "Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane." I have utterly failed in my life. A lot of it is my fault, a lot isn't. I was thinking that going by infection would hide the act but suddenly leaving and then not seeking medical help would be, at least, odd. It would hurt my mother, I know, even if she didn't think it was a suicide, which she would torture herself wondering. That is an issue for me. Her waking up every day with that loss and those questions would be a cruelty. Yet another of a seemingly endless list of misdeeds I'm nearly famous for. But I know I'm seriously considering it because it scares me yet I continue to plan. I would have to leave home to seek out infection and then not return, of course, to protect the family. I would have to find a location, fill the gas tank, etc. first to minimize transmission. I would have to isolate somewhere for, I'm guessing a good month+. I can isolate in a hotel/motel but I don't think I could afford that long at 40-80+ a night (not even thinking about food). Airbnb might have a rentable place for more than a month (right now I doubt it) but money is still an issue; would that put others in danger even though I actively isolate?. Obviously no shelters or centers etc. Camping, maybe. I like to read. Sorry for the novel.
