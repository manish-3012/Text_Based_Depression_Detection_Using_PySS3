I just want to ventiAlmost a year ago I tried to kill myself. I took 26 vicodins and washed them down with some vodka, took three tabs of lsd because I had them on hand and thought â€˜fuck it Iâ€™m gonna die anyway why not.â€™ I locked myself in my bathroom and when I started feeling the effects, went to my family room and gave my sister a hug. Following that I fell asleep. I have no idea why I didnâ€™t stop breathing in my sleep, but I woke up hours later and I thought that I failed. I knew I would have severe liver damage if I lived, so I had my mom take me to the hospital where I stayed until I was put into a psych ward for kids who have severe depression. After being put on meds, I was doing better until school started up (Iâ€™m still in high school) Since the meds stopped working or whatever, Iâ€™ve started cutting a bit, and am having fairly common suicidal thoughts again. Iâ€™ve also stated using drugs and alcohol again. 

Thanks for reading this if you got all the way through and I really just wanted to put this all out since I have t talked about my attempt since it happened.
