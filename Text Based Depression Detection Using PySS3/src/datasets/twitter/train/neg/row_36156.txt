Failed uni admission test, I feel like a dumb idiot, I've been messing things up all day. I feel like everyone looks at me and think I'm this stupid idiot.Also the security guard at the shop asked me to check my bag, I asked him why wouldn't he check the ladies purses and he told me with a sarcastic tone cause I'm male and that wouldn't even matter that much, but then proceed to say that they do this check for gyps. Now that made me feel like even shittier. 

Every so often I get stopped at the train station by the police that asks me for my ID, like do I look that bad? I try to look as good as possible, am I that bad?
