How does one keep living when one has made such terrible mistakes?Itâ€™s funny, I never thought Iâ€™d be the one to ever consider suicide. Iâ€™m not tat suicidal at this very moment, but the idea has started to set in. Iâ€™ve been living with terrible guilt for the past year over mistakes that could ruin my life if people find out what I did. Iâ€™ve learned from my mistakes, but the thought of my mistakes coming back to haunt me fill me with such dread. I no longer have the confidence I used to, I donâ€™t smile nearly as much as I used to. My mistakes occupy every moment of every day. I donâ€™t feel worthy of finding love. I donâ€™t feel worthy of good things that come my way. On top of that Iâ€™m in a slump in life as it is. I suppose Iâ€™m depressed, but itâ€™s like a situational depression. I fake it so well, that Iâ€™m okay. I finally understand now why some people take their lives unexpectedly. You never truly know what people are dealing with beneath the surface. Iâ€™m so much more aware. Iâ€™m so much wiser, but in the worst ways. I want to live a good life from here on out but I donâ€™t know how. What I did isnâ€™t important. I didnâ€™t physically harm anyone, but I made some shitty choices that could come back to haunt me, and turn me into a social outcast. I know my family will always love me, and I know itâ€™s possible to find a partner, but I would feel so guilty to subject them to my past, who I am. I donâ€™t want to be my past, but I always will be. I canâ€™t forget. What do I do? I see no light.
