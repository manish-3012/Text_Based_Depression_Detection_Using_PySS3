I'm severely depressedI went to the ER on Wednesday afternoon, while on my lunch break at work because literally no one (professional) had time to talk. So, the only thing I knew to do was drive myself to the hospital. I work in the rough part of town, so I wasn't aware of the area or where everything was. I probably looked like I had two heads while I spoke to the front desk to get myself admitted. I have had suicidal thoughts, basically non-stop all month. So there, they had me stay in the waiting room (whaat?!) for several minutes until they could take my vitals. I guess my BP was through the roof but outwardly, I looked calm. I was trying to keep myself together. All that morning, I was crying. After vitals were taken, I was to wait in the waiting room again until they had a bed for me. I didn't need a freaking bed. I needed to talk to someone! They soon had a room for me, but I didn't need to change into a gown. Instead, I sat on the gurney in my work clothes (business casual) and waited. Four hours later, a social worker came in to evaluate me. She said she'd have to run my responses with the psychiatrist, but on the phone, at the nurses station. 

Even at the hospital, I couldn't talk to anyone. What. The. Fuck.

They ended up not admitting me as inpatient. Two hours later, they discharged me and strongly recommended I do outpatient therapy. So the next morning I wake up and call to make an appointment with outpatient (it's really for IOP/Intensive Outpatient Program-Therapy) and they say that the soonest appointment is not until 7/31. Over a week away. 

What. The. Fuck.

So. I'm home. Not working. I can't reach my therapist. I am stuck. I medicate myself with my anti-anxiety meds so I don't fly off the handle but otherwise, I'm stuck until next Monday.

US Mental Healthcare sucks. It really does.

**Edit

Forgot to mention. So.. what are my options? I don't want to die, nor do I want to be ignored. How the hell do I get some help?
