In my headI was watching Intervention today. Yesterday, the time just passed by and I have no idea what I did, so I guess maybe I at least did something. She was talking about how she wanted to be a normal mother to her kids. I realized that's me. And I'm not even on drugs. I'm present but sometimes consumed in what's going on in my own head. I'm so selfish. Sometimes I'm normal and wonderful. On the outside. Sometimes, I'm in bed for three days. I will never get better. I will never not have crippling depression. There's nothing I can do.  I wish there was an Intervention for me. My thoughts are my drug. Killing me, slowly. I think every day about killing myself. Every hour of every day. I can't, because my husband's already dead. I feel like I can't kill myself because that would be so selfish of me to hurt other people. I can't leave my kids. Then I feel like I'm kidding myself to think people wouldn't be better off without me anyway. I'm such a shitbag. I'm going to drag myself up for a shower and maybe start dinner, play with the kids after school. It's going to be normal and wonderful. On the outside. I will be in my head, waiting for the time when everybody goes to sleep, so I can get back in bed and cry. I hope I get better. I hope I get hit by a bus. Neither one of those things is likely to happen.
