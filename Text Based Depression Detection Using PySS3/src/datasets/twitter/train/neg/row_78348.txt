Looking for a bit of advice.So I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll do anything crazy. But for the past few weeks or even a month, everyday I been having thoughts and talking to myself and saying maybe you should just end it all. 

Not usually a suicidal person but the thoughts are a bit intrusive. Been having a rough time lately the past three months. Essentially lost the place I thought was home, good chunk of my savings and the girl I thought I was going to marry. 

I know this is just a tough time but the thought â€œjust end itâ€ is being very intrusive and it happens daily and on more than one occasion per day. 

I try to distract myself best I can and hang out with family and friends when I am able to. 

Thanks in advance for any help. My question is for those that attempted or are also thinking about ending it, what did you do to curve the thought. Did you get on medication to help?
