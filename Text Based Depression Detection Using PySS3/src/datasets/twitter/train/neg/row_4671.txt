Living in fear; Phone calls, letters, people knocking on your door.Just another day in Unemployment town. :)

I barely look forward to answering my phone, since the only people who love me are people from the Welfare offices reminding me how much of a loser I am for not having a job, and how payments will be cancelled if I don't do this, or don't do that.

Letters are usually just about unpaid bills and debt, and more love from the Welfare office .. also known as Centrelink in Australia, or Job centre in the UK.

I guess I'm proud to say that I'm a representative of the Good for nothing, 20-somethings who are a thorn in the ass of any major developed country. One of the undesirables, the bag of trash lying around the corner that hasn't been yet taken to the dump.

In many ways, I'm actually glad I had parents who never supported me in my dreams and ambitions. I don't even have friends to turn to for help. . everyone I've ever met in my life has turned their back on me, sooner or later .. which is why I don't try anymore.

It's just me against the world, baby. I feel privileged. Maybe if you had legalized voluntary euthanasia, there would be a lot less people on welfare .. but since you want me to live at all cost, I am going to continue being that thorn on your ass.

Oh well. I've already got a pretty good subscriber base on YouTube. Whatever happens, whether I end up homeless or lying dead on the streets .. I will make sure the entire nation finds out. I will let the world know, just how pathetic your system really is.
