I am alone and running out of reasons.I don't talk to anyone at all. I've tried to get in touch with people who I used to know but it's radio silence. I sit alone all night and stare at my phone. I wish someone cared but they don't and I can't change that. 

Started going to a therapist a couple of months ago. I can't handle talking about my shit. I totally broke down during the first appointment and I can't make myself go back. 

I attempted four years ago. I haven't found a reason to live since then. You hear so many stories about people who attempted and then found some sort of reason for life. I haven't felt that.

I've been barely existing for so long. I don't know what to do.
