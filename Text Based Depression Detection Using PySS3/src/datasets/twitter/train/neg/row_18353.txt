I sincerely believe I am biologically inferior and therefore have no place in this world.I suffer from extreme bouts of depression, adhd, ocd and anxiety. After nearly 18 years of experience, I have concluded that I am too weak to survive in the modern world. I am incapable of handling simple tasks or following instructions. I am in a state of constant fatigue, no matter how long I sleep. 

I've been pumped up with various medications and have gone through countless therapies since I was 9 and nothing has helped. 

I can't bear the thought of living as an adult and having to hold a job. I should just jump off of my balcony and save myself from so much future suffering.
