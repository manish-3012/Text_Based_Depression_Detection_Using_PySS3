I'm sick of feeling like a loser.I'm 33 years old. I haven't got an education. My job only gives me 20 hours a week and not enough to live off. I don't have a home. I'm living on a friends couch.

I'm a loser. I'm actually very smart. But I have wasted every chance life ever gave me. I'm a loser and I'm sick of feeling this way.
