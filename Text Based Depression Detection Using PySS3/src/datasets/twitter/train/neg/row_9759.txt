Live vicariously through meI think about suicide all the time. I am sooooo broke, depressed, and now live in my car even though I work a full time job and do side gigs. I am my grandmothers sponsor therefore Iâ€™m financially responsible for her. Itâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m alive. If I was gone, no one would be pay for her assisted living or even watch out for her. I love her and resent her. Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide ever since I can remember. I donâ€™t even remember the last time I was actually even semi happy but Iâ€™m stuck because I love her. 

If this wasnâ€™t the case and I actually had some money, Iâ€™d go far far away. Somewhere like Tuvalu where people actually seem to care about each other. Where life moves slow and not everything involves so much technology and material things. I think thatâ€™d be the one thing that could help me with my suicidal thoughts.. just completely changing my life. 

But I canâ€™t do that, so if you have the means to do so, why donâ€™t you try? Donâ€™t move to a different city.. move to a different continent. If you are planning to kill yourself, move somewhere else. Change everything. You have nothing to lose and maybe just maybe youâ€™ll actually be happy to Alive and if so, Iâ€™d love to live vicariously through you.
