i took 4 blood pressure pills and now i very sleepy~~the first pill i took was at 6 the effects started at 9 and i took the other 3 pills  at 9 so after 3 hours ill see what will happen 
*so the pills i took were low blood pressure pills so i should be very sleepy 
*they are my fathers and the Dr only recommended him to take only 1 he now only takes half
*the effects of the first pill was 
1. i couldn't hear my heart beat as i normally would
 meaning its very weak 
2. sleepy 
3. tired 
4.i think one of my kidney started to hurt a little bit 
* what surprised me the most was i just took the pills like that thinking its better to just die than stay alive 
* i wanted to take the pills because 
1.im useless said by every one in my family 
2.im tired of everything
3.and there is no meaning in life 
 i hope this gets to my brother 
the other 3 pills should make me ultra sleepy and then gets into a coma and then ..
all of this because of school and family i blame them both and my country had i big effect because well lets face it its Iraq 
i cant go out because family wants me to stay alive so i dont go boom boom 
* im not gay or a girl
my brother is an asshole and found out about this 
* he saw me writing in SuicideWatch and said nice the moment he said that i said nope and closed the window and i didn't know if responing a closed window would have (((every))) word there so he saw and made me tell my parents 
* then he called his doctor friend tolled him the name of my pills and his friend told him not to worry is not a big thing i wont die because the blood pressure pills are depression/sleeping/anxiety pills
* he made me finish this 
sorry i wasted your time 
* i also took 6 pills of pain/headache/ pills (aspirin)
*all of this because  family is putting pressure on me because of the exams and all they do is comparing me to others and its really insulting
