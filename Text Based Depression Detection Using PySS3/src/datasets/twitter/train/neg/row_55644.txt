i wish people who donâ€™t care about me would quit trying to stop mei cannot wait until i figure out how to secure a method that doesnâ€™t fail. i am so sick of the very same people whoâ€™ve made me this miserable also trying to stop me from doing anything about it. 

people say that they care until itâ€™s time for them to show up.

PHP/IOP helped a bit but it apparently was not a long-term solution. i donâ€™t think one of those actually exists.
