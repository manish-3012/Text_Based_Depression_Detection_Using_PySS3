Thinking about ending it. Don't see many other ways I'll turn out happy in this lifeI recently had a mental break down and a panic attack and now I'm feeling pretty hopeless. I told my school counselor that I was depressed and instead of helping me all he did was tell my dad about how I'm doing bad in my classes. My dad gave his long winded speech about how I need a positive attitude and saying how the world doesn't give a shit about me. He's fucking delusional. Every single year of my life I've had to deal with his bullshit. His undermining and verbal abuse, neglect and alcoholism all that shit makes me want to just fucking end it. I'd rather die than have to spend another 5 years with him. School fucking sucks I'm doing awful in all my classes and my teachers hate me. I don't disrespect them. I'm not mean to them. Why do they hate me so much? My dad took my money away from Christmas and ever since my mental breakdown I can't control my emotions. Even when I wasn't depressed I can't do good in school. I never did homework. I'm sick of this life. Even if I'm not depressed anymore I still have to live with my dad and still go to school just to be at some fucking college that I don't want to be at to get a stupid fucking degree I don't want and get a job where I'll probably miserable. My mom is bipolar and in poverty,  can't turn to her, my grandparents died when I was 8 and 10 and I'm fucking suicidal. What else should I do? What can I do? I'm sick of this life and want to die already.
