I wouldn't consider myself suicidal but...I dont know if this is the right place to post this but yeahh...

I wouldn't say i'm suicidal but I don't see myself in the future being happy living in this world. Maybe i'm just lazy... idk. Im pretty analytical and I just think that killing myself would be my best option. im not afraid of dying. i know how i'm going to kill myself. im a junior in highschool, help me understand what this means. I don't really ever feel motivated. Im not really happy most of my time but im not particularly depressed. sorry for the ramble. Ive talked to a doctor before (not about this but about depression) and i just have terrible ADHD. If my mom loses her job im doing it. I dont feel like dealing with her shit. i just dont feel like ever doing anything. prolly going to delete this ramble... 

tl;dr : I cant imagine a future and I dont want to live in this backwards society. I wouldn't consider myself suicidal but i just wonder if anybody else knows the feel.
