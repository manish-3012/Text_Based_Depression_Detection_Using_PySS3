Help with something, pleaseLong story short, smoked a lot of those toxic marijuana cartridges, now my mouth is always frowning. My doctor said theres nothing wrong and offered medication. My doctor is wrong. My mouth is always in a frowning state, like some kind of facial paralysis. I need this fixed asap. I hate to say it but if not i really want to kill myself. Ive been stuck with this since around February. I finally quit smoking a few months ago. Jobless and broke because my face keeps me from getting jobs. What do i do? Can i walk into a hospital and tell someone about this?
