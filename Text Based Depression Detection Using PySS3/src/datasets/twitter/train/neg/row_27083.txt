Should I commit suicide due to ageism and being a late bloomer?Because I'm 28 and attempting a bachelor of science in computer science. Unfortunately, I've heard that ageism in technology is high.

I don't think life was fair to me. I was bullied severely to the point of not wanting to take school seriously, since I felt unwanted. I then tried desperately to retool myself by attending a college away from home, but I ended up incurring $28,000 ($16,000 now) in student loans and graduated with a degree in health sciences.

Gravitating towards technology and not wanting to stay within the lower ranks, I got a master's in cybersecurity, online because I didn't want to take out student loans. But from my experience, it's quite useless.

Now that my university has an online program for computer science, established 2017, I want it. But I'm a poor man, at $37,000 yearly salary. I can only afford one class per semester and I don't want to take out student loans.

Even when I graduate, I'll be much older by then, like 35, and I don't know if the companies will want to hire an old geezer like me. 

I wish I had known about this when I was younger and more marketable. Now that I'm 28, I feel that I've wasted my youth and am doomed for failure. Sometimes, I just feel like placing a pistol in my mouth and pulling the trigger.
