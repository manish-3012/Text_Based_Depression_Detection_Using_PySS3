I think about it pretty much all the time now.I look back and regret so many missed opportunities and bad decisions. And I have reached the point where there are certainly fewer years ahead than behind for me. Itâ€™s too late to tear down this prison I built for myself, and anyway, Iâ€™m too tired to try. 

Am I supposed to suffer from one sparse fleeting moment of mild joy to the next just to spare a few acquaintances and a family I hate a moment of â€œoh gee whiz, he never really seemed that unhappyâ€?

In the grand scheme of things the truth is that No Lives Matter. So I really see no point in prolonging this.
