The value of my life.Last night at 3:30am, for the first time since I can remember, I was crying. I simply couldn't sleep and got hit by a hard dose of reality. What's the point of my life? I've done nothing, seen nothing, I'm broken and I can't seem to be able to live with myself any more.

Do I want to kill myself? *Yes.* But, like everything else I've ever wanted, I'm too scared to reach for it.

*I'll go back. I'll start from the beginning.* My earliest memories are of me and my grandmother, who wasn't really my grandmother but the closest thing I've had to one, I guess the correct term for her would be a babysitter, my parents were working a lot to survive and didn't have time to look out for me. She was teaching me to talk, I was pretty big then but never learned how to talk. I think I loved that woman, she definitely loved me, she was more of a mother to me than my own. But then I grew up and never visited, never talked to her any more, left her to die alone. Didn't even go to her funeral. I didn't even consider it an option. All this despite the fact that she lived in the building in front of mine.

*I feel dead inside.* I grew with distant parents. My mother feared my father more than anything; still does really. But continues to live with him because she has nowhere to go otherwise. She lives in constant fear of being 'interrogated', every move she makes questioned and harshly commented upon. She hardly ever leaves the house and when she does, she's afraid. For that reason I imagine, I was never shown affection in a way that I've seen parents on TV act. I was never told I was loved and now these words feel so strange for me to utter. I'm ashamed to say them to another human or even animal. Not that that would be a problem as I don't know if I'm capable of it anyway. I've only been in one relationship in my life and I felt nothing for her. I did enjoy the company, the idea of being in a couple rather than a single, but never felt anything. In fact, the only feeling I ever remember having inside of me was hate, typically directed towards myself. When she left me, I didn't shed a tear, didn't feel sadness, just... went back to being alone.

*I hate my personality.* I'm dark and bitter. Sarcastic and hateful. I don't want to be this way, I've tried so hard to change in the past years but I can't. I'm in a prison inside myself, I can't talk to people without it feeling strange or ashamed. I'm socially awkward and as introvert as introvercy goes, and I know some introverts enjoy their alone time, I don't. I crave human contact so badly but how do you even make friends?

*I grew up alone.* I can count my friends over the span of 25 years on one hand and still have fingers left. My first childhood friend was a bad influence on me and ultimately turned out to be a criminal. My second was an amazing guy with whom I simply lost contact with because this time I was the bad influence. You'd think it's hard to lose contact with someone who lives about 5 feet from you, right? I'm not even exaggerating, he used to live next door. He had such a beautiful personality too, I really wish some of it rubbed off on me. He was well liked by everyone, very friendly and open. I was somewhat jealous of him and his ability to make friends so easily. After that I've been alone until highschool. I can't really remember when I lost contact with my second friend but between then and the time I've made a new one, it's been a few good years. Time I've spent inside at the PC. Then, highschool came and I met someone else. Who've I've taken a liking for and sabotaged his life because that's my idea of friendship I guess. I was never a smart person, I didn't enjoy the social aspect of school and as a result school was a red-zone for me. I wasn't bullied or anything but there were people there and people scared me. They wanted to socialize. Teachers wanted me to talk in front of everyone. Those things were the scariest things I could ever imagine. For that reason I used to skip school a lot and instead go to internet cafes. And it wouldn't be fitting to not take my friend with me. Got him hooked first on Dota then on World of Warcraft. I could pace myself, still attend school but he couldn't. He used to not come in for months. For that reason he failed all his classes and was left behind a year. He eventually graduated after moving to a different highschool and went to college and I'm happy for him. In the 10th grade I was reassigned to a class for kids with learning problems, that's also the year my friend was left behind and left the school. I wouldn't get to see him again for a few years after that. That new class was scary. The worst of the worst were put there. I refused to go to school at that point until my father who knew the principal convinced him to move me out. The new one was better and I've met someone else. Someone worse than me, someone who introduced me to new experiences. Drinking, and later drugs. Two things I've never enjoyed. I never got addicted to them, I just did them so I have something in common with my new 'buddy'. And he was my friend until I was done with highschool and a few years beyond that, until I felt a little human contact isn't worth hurting myself with alcohol and drugs. So I was alone again and ever since. But I've been alcohol and drug free so I guess that's nice. It's strange, you'd think with my disputable sanity, I'd enjoy an escape like drugs or at least alcohol.

*I'm hardly educated and alone.* It's ok, I'm not the only one, right? I guess I should simply get a job and live some sort of life, maybe I'll even find someone else who I can try and love or at least enjoy the company of. But how do I do that? Wouldn't I have to actually interact to people to get there? Yes, I would and that's a problem. And even if I do get a job, what could I ever do with 200 euro a month? Which is about the minimum wage in my country. I'll never be able to afford a place to live, a car, not that I want a car, I am too afraid of learning how to drive, the idea of me behind a wheel scares the hell out of me. But I do have this fantasy of a perfect life. I imagine a girl I love and who loves me, don't we all, right? For a while I even put [a face](http://i.imgur.com/AalKlO1.jpg) on her. This girl was amazing and of course I was too scared to ever talk to her. I imagine two kids, two girls I(*we*) adopted. I always had this plan to adopt kids because in this country abandoned kids are simply kept in a abusive system that doesn't care for them and even worse, hurts and steals from them until they are 18, then they kick them out to live on the street. I know I can't save everyone, or, really anyone, but in this fantasy of mine I saved two kids. The four of us living somewhere in a little place outside of town. With a dog. I never had an animal and I kind of fear dogs but I think kids should have a dog growing up. I think that should be something everybody does. And this fantasy, although I know will never happen, keeps me sane.

*I live in my fantasy.* I often escape reality in my own mind, imagining myself having some sort of superpower and helping people. I know you don't need superpowers to help people but that's what makes me happy in my own mind. I'm not even that big a fan of superheroes. I fuel my imagination with games and movies instead of books. Being the uneducated man I am, I've never read a book in my life. I always wanted to but never did. 

*I exist and I'm tired.* I want to die, so badly. Really I wish I wasn't born but it's too late for that now, isn't it.. and I don't want to hurt my parents, even though they never knew how to show it, I knew they care about me, and they wasted their best years raising me, and it's killing me that I can't repay them in any way. Sometimes I fantasize I get in some sort of accident and die, that would be easy and unintentional, that would be a good kind of escape. Sometimes I fantasize the world will end and we all die. There's so much suffering in the world and mine is such a small piece of it and feels so overwhelming, it could all end, for everyone, and if everyone is dead there's nobody to suffer about their loved ones dying. And greed and lust and evil will die with everyone. The only realistic option of escape is suicide and I know that, I'm contemplating it, I don't know if I could ever do it, I'm scared of it, I'm scared of the repercussions of it but maybe one day I'll be brave enough. One moment of being brave is all it takes and it can be over and that really scares me. It really really scares me. I'm not a brave man. And now I'm crying again.

This is my little story, I'm sorry you had to read it.
