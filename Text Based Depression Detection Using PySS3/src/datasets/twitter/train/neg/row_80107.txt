Over it.I've posted a lot on here for the past month. I deleted a lot of my old posts though. I'm 18, female and in college.

I'm failing at life already. I have no money, parents have no money, no way to continue my education, no skills to get a job, huge student loans, and severe depression and anxiety. Recently, upon some research, I have discovered that there is a huge likelihood that I have borderline personality disorder. I have friends and family, but most don't understand or have too many problems of their own to help. 

I'm miserable almost everyday. I'm failing school because I'm too depressed to get out of bed some days, or too tired because I couldn't sleep because of all the thoughts of killing myself running through my head. 

I destroyed my relationship and the person I love the most and he now hates me. I destroyed him and if anything, he would be happy if I was gone. He's the only person that I believe can help me at this point.

People always say it gets better but does it really? With my fucked up head I don't think it's possible. And with my lack of education I won't get a job, and no money leads to stress... It's an endless cycle. A cycle that's not worth it when life is basically meaningless.

Basically, I don't think my mind is strong enough to make it in the world when I can't even handle someone leaving me without going batshit crazy. I'd rather save everyone the trouble and end it now.
