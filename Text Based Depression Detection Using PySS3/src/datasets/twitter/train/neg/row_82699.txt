I feel like I donâ€™t have the â€˜rightâ€™ to be depressed and suicidalMy life honestly hasnâ€™t been bad. I havenâ€™t ever been abused physically or mentally. So why am I depressed and suicidal. I feel like I donâ€™t have the â€˜rightâ€™ to be depressed and that only makes it worse. 
Please tell me Iâ€™m not the only one.
I know Iâ€™m a massive drama queen and thatâ€™s probably why Iâ€™m depressed but I donâ€™t really believe that. Iâ€™ve convinced myself but I donâ€™t fully believe it.
