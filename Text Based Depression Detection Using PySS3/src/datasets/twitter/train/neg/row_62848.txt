I feel horribly depressed and it makes me feel like dying wouldn't be that big of a dealSometimes I get horribly depressed but idk if it's actual depression because I was never properly diagnosed. It gets so bad to the point where I don't want to act on hurting myself but I think "It wouldn't bother me if I just dropped dead." During these depressive episodes I get an intense amount of self loathing and intrusive thoughts saying "You're ugly" or "You're horrible at art." Or "The reason why you're like this is because you're an accident, your parents would be better without you and everyone secretly hates you"
