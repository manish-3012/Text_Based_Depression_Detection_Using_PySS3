Every single human is out of my leagueIt's like I'm on a completely different level than everyone else and I deserve to be degraded and put down because I'm of some subhuman species. Doesn't matter how much plastic surgery or how little I weigh or how good of grades I get I will always always be last and inferior. I hate this life so much I can't stand it having to exist and know that every single person on this Earth inherently deserves more than you do. I am scum and don't deserve to exist anymore and I can't really keep doing it for much longer. I will never have someone love me back. I will never be successful. I will never be good enough.
