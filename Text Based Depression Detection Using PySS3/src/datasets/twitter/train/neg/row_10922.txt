So mehI don't even have energy to type this out.
I just want to stop.
Stop myself that's all it is
It's plain and clear like the blue sky near
But nothing moves me not even fear.
I'm sick and guilty all the time
The anger only adds to the crime
I feel like I've already done my time.
So let me out of here.
