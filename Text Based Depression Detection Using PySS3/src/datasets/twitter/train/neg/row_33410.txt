Girlfriend is the only reason I hold onI just can't keep going, but I can't break her heart. I've done a lot of research and have decided how I'm going to do it about a year a go. I'm tired of being a burden and I just can't handle my bpd anymore. it makes me crazy. I get mad when she's with her friends because she's not with me, even if I'm at work. I'm not poor I have a nice mid 2000s car and a full time job with benefits and a pension plan at 19 years old but money can't stop the fact that I want to die. Living s day in my mind is hell
