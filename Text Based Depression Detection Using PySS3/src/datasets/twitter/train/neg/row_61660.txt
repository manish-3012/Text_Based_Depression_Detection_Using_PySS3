Definitely going to commit tomorrow, but have a few questionsFirstly I have thought this through a lot over a long time. Don't bother telling me not to

Anyway, I have some things I wish to give to close family and friends after my suicide. I don't have a professional will, is it enough to just write the items I have and who should get them in my suicide note? Is that enough to be legally binding?
