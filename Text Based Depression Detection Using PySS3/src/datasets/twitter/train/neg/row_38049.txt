i canâ€™t do this anymore.iâ€™m not sure where else to go. this post is a last resort.

iâ€™m 14 years old. iâ€™m failing school. iâ€™ve been taken off my meds and my depression is getting worse. i dissociate almost every hour of the day and have nightmares every night due to being molested when i was five. 

i donâ€™t see a future for myself. i was a gifted child whoâ€™s worth was determined by my performance in school, and now iâ€™m a burnt out failure. everyday it feels like mounds of schoolwork bear down on my already burdened soul. the only thing i can ever find comfort in anymore is video games and reading.

i look around at my very few friends and theyâ€™re all better than me. more talented. more smart. more happy. it feels like they donâ€™t even see me, much less care about me. i wouldnâ€™t care either.

i wish to say that i want to keep hanging on, just for the off chance that thereâ€™s even a slither of hope for me. but i know thereâ€™s not. i donâ€™t know why i was put here. i wish i was never born.
