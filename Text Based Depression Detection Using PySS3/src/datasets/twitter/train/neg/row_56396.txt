Why does life feel like a movie that has been on for way too long?I don't feel like killing myself as much as I just feel disappointed by life itself. Nothing is new or exciting. Nothing is stimulating. Everything feels like it is either predictable or simply happens for little to no reason. How do people get fulfillment from existing like this? How are people able to build relationships with one another when there are so many obvious flaws to life that have simple solutions but will never actually come to light? All memes aside I feel like I am taking crazy pills and like I am the only person still actually paying attention to what's going on around them, as arrogant as that sounds. What the fuck is this world and why is it so void of reason.
