my gf is highly suicidalhi everyone,

i was looking for some advice regarding helping my gf with her depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. she's had all of these for a while (3+ years) and has attempted suicide 3 times. we got into a small argument and i'm in a rut right nowâ€”she believes that she will not get better and is not willing to get better. it scares me a lot because she told me earlier this week she was willing to try for me but because of our argument she feels like i'm not always going to be there for her. i'm really scared that if we were to break up that she would be gone very soon after. i know being with her is an incentive not to commit suicide and i fully believe that she will get better if we continue to be together. however during depressive episodes and arguments she voids out that i exist or that i'm a support system and i was looking for advice on that.

i know that i can only do so much and that there's no cure. but i wanna know how i can help when we get into arguments and she feels like i can't be there. she currently has no outside motivation aside from me (she dislikes all her family and her friends are not a priority). 

as a final point, i'm scared of the idea breaking up because i know the inevitable consequence and the guilt i'd feel. she has admitted already that if i'm not there, then she has no reason to keep going

any advice is appreciated. she's the person i love and care for the most and the increasing frequency of suicidal thoughts/tendency to act on those thoughts is alarming to me
