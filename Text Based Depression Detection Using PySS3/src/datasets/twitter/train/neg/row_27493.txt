What to doThere's just so much in my head yet I can't put any of it into words. I know I'm probably just filling this thread with something useless when other people need help more than I do but the people seem so nice. Basically I can't shake the belief that I will never amount to anything. I graduated highschool a year early, have a wonderful boyfriend and parents, currently go to school abroad and I still want to end it all. What the fuck is wrong with me. There's a global pandemic going on, people are losing their jobs and loved ones, and I want to die for what? Just because I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel? Online classes make me want to drop out, and the depression brain fog makes it that much worse. I feel like my brain is going at a snail's pace when doing anything productive but it's on fire the moment I criticize myself or fantasize about death. My parents waste so much money on the stupid school abroad and I want to drop out because I'll never be enough for it to be considered money well spent. Sure I could drop out since I graduated highschool, but then what? I never wrote college apps, and I'm clearly not in a state to go to college noticing how much I want to drop out of the current school I'm in, it would just be more wasted money. The days in quarantine seem to fly by and I can't get anything done during them. Isn't everyone being super productive with this time? I've done jackshit and once this is all over the productive facade I've built up will crumble. My psychiatrist told me my depressive episode had finished so I could come off my meds and I'm starting to think they were very wrong.. I thought depression was a lifelong illness, not an episode that lasted 9 months to a year. Maybe I'm just ignorant, I should trust the professional right? Sorry for wasting anyone's time who read this, I know it's all over the place.
