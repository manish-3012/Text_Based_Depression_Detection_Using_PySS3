Parents hate me, cut off contact with friends, 0 to live forMy dad ran off with someone else a few months ago and haven't seen him since, my mum's been more vocal about her hatred for me recently, dropped out of 6th form (UK version of college) and don't have the guts to tell my friends why so I suppose I'm just cutting off contact with them, every day I have a sickly sinking feeling in my stomach, just at my wit's end with this now. There's no way back from this.
