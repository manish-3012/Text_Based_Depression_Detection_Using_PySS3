I don't have a single foundation in this life...How the f\*ck am i supposed to do something with thist shi\*ty life, when i dont have a SINGLE foundation in this life? Family, friends, classmates, country, someone to love, God, anything??? Where do i start? Im the type of person to have a massive will power and motivation, but i dont give a damn anymore, everything has been taken from me. My childhood, my social skills, my love... I don't know... I don't care
