My children would be better off without meMy daughter was born on 30 June of this year. I also have a four year old son. I'm afraid to bathe my daughter in case I accidentally drown her. I'm awake all night listening out for the sound of her breathing because I'm convinced she's going to die in her sleep. I'm scared when I nurse her that my milk has turned poisonous and will kill her. I even test my son's food before I give it to him so I can make sure it's not poisonous. When I go out in public with my children, I hear people around me whispering what a terrible mother I am and how my children should be taken away from me. I can hear them telling me I'm dangerous. I am so afraid, I can't even begin to explain the fear I feel. I'm afraid to tell my partner what I'm feeling in case he catches the thoughts from me. It's getting to the stage where I'm afraid to even hold my daughter in case I drop her. The only way I can save my children's lives is by ending my own.
