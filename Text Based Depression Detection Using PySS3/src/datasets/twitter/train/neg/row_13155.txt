I do not know what to do.I don't know what to do I feel so lost. All of middle school through high school I have been bullied and been beaten down.  I am currently in college and it hasn't been any better. I am a senior in college right now and have made no friends at all. I have tried, but due to my anxiety it is really difficult. I have experienced depression all my life. College is getting really stressful and all this work is piling up. Every time I try to speak or say anything about how I am feeling I just can't. My family they expect so much from me I am the oldest sibling out of 6 (he left us) I have no father and my mother just keeps telling me to stop pretending and I will get over it. I have had suicidal thoughts and I have planned it, but have not gone through it. I am currently taking medicine, but it does not seem to "work". I can not sleep, but when I do it only last an hour and its difficult to sleep again. I do not know all my thoughts are mixed up and can not think straight. My medication is making me see stuff that I know doesn't exist and giving me constant headaches. When it comes to work I had 1 co worker who i was talking to very often and I thought of as a friend, but because of recent accident that I was not part of, but was blamed for it because I am an easy target she does not want to speak to me anymore and if i try to talk to her she would say "if you talk to me I will report you" so there's that. All my hobbies that I enjoyed painting/drawing/gaming/reading I just don't seem to have fun anymore. I sometimes forget to even go to work/school.  I do not know I just want to escape all these problems and making this pain go away. Just thinking about the escape route makes me shake so much I just want all this to stop, everything. I just want to stop feeling so lonely, tired, depressed. I just want this to get better and want advice **please!** Yes, I know all my thoughts are mixed up and probably doesn't make sense I just don't know.
