Second. I don't really think people want to die. I belive that everybody wants to live a happy life. But that's not always the case. Sometimes we just can't take it anymore.
Sorry mom, for making you hate me. Sorry dad for doing this. Sorry sister, that i was never a brother you could have looked up to.
It's all my fault. All my fault.
