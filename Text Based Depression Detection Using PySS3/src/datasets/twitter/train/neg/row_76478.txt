How 2020 treated me

On the second day of the year I got assaulted with a head open &amp; commotion


A week later I got threatened to get beaten up. Had to get driven by the cops home just to be safe. People searched for my address afterwards.


2 weeks later, I had a privates related surgery


In February, I witnessed my relationship going downhill and got paused. 

In March's spring break, I was on travel with my parents meaning I had to spend 24/7 with them. I didn't even have a private place to cry. When I came back, I got drunk, had a panick attack, tried to kill myself multiple times, got so drunk I blacked out &amp; had a severe hangover. Now the girl that paused doesn't even care about me because she doesn't wanna be put in the same spot of stress &amp; pain while I had my mental issues. On top of that, numerous encounters with the police


I have no one. I have no one that cares about me. I'm 15, I fucked up this badly this young. 


I'm a fucking worthless burden piece of shit
