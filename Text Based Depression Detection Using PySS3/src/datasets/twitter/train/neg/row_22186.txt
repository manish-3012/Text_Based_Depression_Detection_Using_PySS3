I dont know what to doI've been feeling really low lately and this voice in my head just said "I think I am ready to die." 
I don't know what to do. I don't want to hurt my family. I don't want to suffer anymore either. I cannot find my will to live. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I need a hospital or if I just need to try and ride out this low. I don't know. I'm just not getting better.
