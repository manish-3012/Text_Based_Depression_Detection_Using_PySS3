17 and thinking about doing it...Hello, my name is Jordan and I've been on the fence about suicide for a while now. My girlfriend recently broke up with me and I've now realized how empty and pointless my life is without her. I'm not here to complain about a relationship though. I have now realized that I have nothing going for me, literally every single girl I have pursues has rejected me and I feel like I don't fit in anywhere.  I don't have anything going for me in life at all. I see a counselor regularly but it doesn't do much, I don't know what to do and I feel like I have no reason nor do I have the will to live anymore. Please, anyone just give me yoyr advice or thoughts, I'd be thankful for any gelp at this point.
