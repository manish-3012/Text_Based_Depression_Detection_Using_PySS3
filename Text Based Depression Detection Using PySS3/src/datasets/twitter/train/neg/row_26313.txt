Kinda scared it doesnt go smoothlyThis is the day. Ive been drinking all night and when Im about to pass out Im gonna take every antipsychotic drug I have. I have about 2500mg of quetiapine, 2500mg of levomepromazine and about 3000mg  of chlorprothixene. Im scared that it will be slow and painful. Worst case scenario being found in time and turning in to a vegetable for the rest of my life or falling to a coma.
