Iâ€™ve fucked myself.Iâ€™ve made very poor decisions in life that led me to where I am right now. Depressed and suicidal. 

For starters, I dropped out of high school and havenâ€™t taken my GED yet. I doubt Iâ€™ll pass it because Iâ€™m retarded when it comes to everything other than the writing/english portion. I feel like a failure. 

I moved from NYC to FL to be with some asshole guy who manipulates me and makes me feel broken. I want to leave but itâ€™s not that easy for multiple reasons. If I had a car, (donâ€™t even have a license) Iâ€™d pack all my shit and just go. I canâ€™t possibly bring all my things and my cat on a plane with me and I really want to take my shit because at this point, I have nothing back at my momâ€™s place in NY. I gave away/took everything. 

I donâ€™t have a job for a couple reasons I wonâ€™t get into. Bottom line is I canâ€™t start working until a couple months from now. And even when I do, Iâ€™ll be pissed off because minimum wage here is nearly half of what it was in NYC. And I made way more there because I worked at a high end salon. every product I sold was $50 in cash that day. I had a great job and I fucking quit it for something stupid. 

My momâ€™s made some stupid mistake that resulted in me losing my insurance that used to cover therapy. I canâ€™t get fucking therapy anymore or anything I need because she did something really really stupid but itâ€™s too much to get into right now. 

I quit my antidepressants cold turkey 5-6 months ago. I donâ€™t know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. 

I used to have an eating disorder. Still fucks with me to this day even though Iâ€™m â€œrecoveredâ€ and I lost my entire support system. my boyfriend thinks Iâ€™m being ridiculous whenever I talk about it. real comforting. 

Iâ€™m a girl, I feel like since Iâ€™ve been down in the dumps, I havenâ€™t taken care of my appearance at all. I feel ugly. 

My only solace is writing. Iâ€™m almost done with a novel that Iâ€™ve been relentlessly working on for years. Thatâ€™s all I have. After that, I donâ€™t know what to do. And since Iâ€™ve been so fucking depressed, I canâ€™t make out any good work anymore. 

I just want to die and the only thing holding me back is the fact that I donâ€™t own a gun.
