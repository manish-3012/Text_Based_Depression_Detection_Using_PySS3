I'm back here againI got through the last few days, but today I just can't do it anymore. I've been in bed sobbing for the last few hours. I feel my insides screaming. I don't want to talk it out, I have no one to talk it out with anyway. I just cannot do it anymore. I have depression and anxiety. I just can't deal anymore. It hurts to be alive. Every moment is full of pain.
