My best friend will eventually kill himself and there is nothing I can doHe's going to enlist in the army and try to get shot in Iraq so he doesn't bring shame on his family. I know its selfish to try and keep someone here, but it hurts so fucking much. He's only 22. Men shouldn't die so young, man. We were playing among us and he got real depressed real quick. It's not just him either. It feels like all my friends want to die; I think that we all, deep down, know that life is meaningless and hollow. Makes me feel like shit, I can't do anything but wait
