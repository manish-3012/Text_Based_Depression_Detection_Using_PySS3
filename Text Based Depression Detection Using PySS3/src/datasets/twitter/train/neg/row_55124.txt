I like to know I have an option.I cant help but feel like I am not meant for happiness. As if my neurochemistry is just devastatingly incorrect. Any happiness I obtain, I sabotage. I don't feel like I do it on purpose, but Im consistent. 

Something about being happy is just so uncomfortable. Its like.. living on the edge, and I dont feel like I deserve it so it is only a matter of time before I do something to change it. Have a nice girlfriend? End relationship. Have a promising career? Postpone the opportunity. I don't know why I do this but I do. 

Depression is just so comfortable. Sulking all day, eating like shit, chain smoking, and keeping myself vaguely busy are really all I do now outside of work. I try my best to stay busy with friends, but I feel like a burden. I just feel empty, with nothing to share. 

I'm trying not to break any of the rules here, but I used to always make sure I had a hidden way of ending my life. Whether it was pills, a belt, etc. It was always very comforting to me to know I had that option, even when I did feel happy. 

Now, I have a certain narcotic, and all I find myself thinking about is whether I should save it and hold on to it as a comforting option. My original plan was to use it recreationally, but I cant stop thinking about how easy and calm it would be to take my life. I'm just tired of feeling like such a failure and I'm scared of success and I don't really know why.
