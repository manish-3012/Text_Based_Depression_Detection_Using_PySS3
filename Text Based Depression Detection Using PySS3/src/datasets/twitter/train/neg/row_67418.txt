i donâ€™t know what to doI donâ€™t know what to do anymore

This year has been the absolute hardest year of my
life. I made mistake after mistake and destroyed something that could have been everything for me. I hurt so many people. I hurt myself even more. I wish I could see a bright side or a way out of this. I am so alone. I am so lost. I donâ€™t see an end to this pain. I donâ€™t deserve sympathy. I deserve all the bad things that are happening to me. I wreck the people I love. I canâ€™t be trusted. Everything is completely falling apart and I canâ€™t fix any of it. Itâ€™s too late to make up for the mistakes that I made. I just want out of this existence. Iâ€™ll never have love. I donâ€™t deserve it. I hate waking up every day and having to be me. Having to relive those horrible things Iâ€™ve done. Every one deserves so much more and I have nothing to give. I fucked up. I ruined everything. Iâ€™ve always ruined everything. I sabotage every good thing in my life. Iâ€™m sorry. So fucking sorry.

Iâ€™m not right for this life. Itâ€™s a waste. I shouldnâ€™t be here anymore...
