My boyfriend wants to kill himself and I donâ€™t know what to doHe tells me that everyone will just forget and move on if he dies and that nobody would care.

He tells me I would find somebody better than him. 

He tells me nobody cares about him and that being dead would be so much better. No more stress. 

Iâ€™m scared. 

Whenever he doesnâ€™t answer his phone I start to panic and wonder if heâ€™s ok. 

Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll wake up one day and heâ€™ll be gone. 

He refuses to get help and doesnâ€™t want anyone to know. Iâ€™m the only one who knows, and itâ€™s a lot to carry. 

I feel so useless. All I can do is tell him that he can call me any hour of the day, whenever heâ€™s not feeling good. I want to help but I donâ€™t know how. 

All I can do is tell him I love him and hope for the best.
