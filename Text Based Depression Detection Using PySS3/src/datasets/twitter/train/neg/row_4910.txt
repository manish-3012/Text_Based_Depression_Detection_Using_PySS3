Instead of killing myself maybe sleeping is betterI know that when I asleep I am in better place. So I want to try to sleep for a day two I don't care how much. But more then now. I can't sleep more then 5 6 hours max. Getting up feeling shity going to work helping family with whatever they need and the only thing on my mind is, I want to sleep and not feel anything at all. Is this too much? Maybe taking multi sleeping pills will help.
