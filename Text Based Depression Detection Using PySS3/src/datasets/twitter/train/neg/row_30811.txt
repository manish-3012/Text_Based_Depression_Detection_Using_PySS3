I Feel Like Shit All The Time And Just Want To End ItI'm 14, Fat, and because of something I did last February I get called crazy by people I don't even know.

As I mentioned, I'm fat which means I'm prone to bullying, and also the thing I did in combination with being fat really doesn't help. Just last night I was on the bus going home with my mum and these two kids on the back of the bus, It was mostly empty apart from 1 or 2 people, who were talking about me and my mum said she could hear them say "I'd hate to be a obese"
"I'd hate to be a beast" 
And then when we get off they said my name and this has really put me down.
