There's no way in hell I'll live to see tomorrow. I'm dreading life so much now. It's going to be impossible for me to not pull this trigger tonight. 

There's no advancement in life. I'm incapable of fixing my life problems. Thinking of how much it will take to get out of the hole I've somehow gotten myself into makes me physically sick. 

Thinking about being dead calms me. I actually start breathing slower when I think about how I'll never have to wake up again. There will be no more needs or wants. It will be over and I won't have to share this Earth with the people I hate. The things I can never have. 

I want it to be over and I'm lucky there is no one left alive that would care. Just a bunch of liberals that pretend to care just to look good in front of their liberal friends. 

It will be over tonight. I will make it happen. 

I will be a prisoner no more.
