I think tonight is the nightI just donâ€™t think I can do this anymore. Iâ€™m just going to end it tonight, take a bunch of pills and just be done with it. Maybe then I wonâ€™t burden my family with my failures anymore. All I do is play and then watch people stream video games online, which is just making me a bigger waste of space. Itâ€™s all I do. I just want to end it all.
