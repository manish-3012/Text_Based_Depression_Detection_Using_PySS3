Back here eh?I have been here months ago talking to people thinking of ways to kill myself I went to therapy for around 3 months now and it's still going I figured out things with my family I am mostly OK except for the frequent anxiety nightmares, but I am not here to talk about that! I am here talk to other people that are here right now listen I know you can't think of another way out you feel pain you feel like you can't sort things nobody likes you and stuff like that I understand but I want you to understand this too...I know this world is not going to a good place anytime soon but if everybody good in heart goes away who will be here to protect the beautiful things that are here on this place I know you are good-hearted I know you have passions thats why you should keep going think of the good things about yourself and stick together!
