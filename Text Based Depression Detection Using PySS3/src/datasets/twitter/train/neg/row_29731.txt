Im over it. I'm so fucking over it.I find it comical at this point, i have been struggling for soooo long. Everyone around me ignores it. I have nobody turn to, but honestly I understand. I'm helpless. No matter how many times someone says "youre not alone" take it from me, you are. People only care about themselves. Its human nature. Thanks life- you fucked me up real good.
