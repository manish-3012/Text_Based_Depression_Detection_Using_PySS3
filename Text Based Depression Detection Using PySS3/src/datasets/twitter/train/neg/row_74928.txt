Why should I want to live?I can't handle the responsibilities of adult life. I have very little motivation to try and change this. There is essentially nothing I want to do with my life. Given these facts, why go on?

I realize there are people who care about me in the world. My death would make them sad, and be a huge hassle to boot. For that reason, and that reason alone, I have not killed myself, and probably never will. 

All the same, it really seems... inadequate, if not deeply depressing, to stake my continued existence on the rough mental calculus that says I'd be slightly more of a bother if I died than if I keep on living. So, please, reddit. Give me the best reasons you can think of for why, *for my own sake*, I ought to keep on living.

(I'm not presently on the verge of suicide, it's just an option that pops up in my mind in times of stress, and I'm taking it more and more seriously as time goes on. Sorry if, given that, this is the wrong place to make this post.)
