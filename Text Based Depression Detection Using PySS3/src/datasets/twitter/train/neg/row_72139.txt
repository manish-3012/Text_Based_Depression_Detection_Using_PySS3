I don't understand sex, it makes me want to kill myselfDon't get me wrong, I know the internet is probably the worst place to look for people to help me, but here I am.
I get horny, turned on, fool around a little with my boyfriend even, but I just don't feel like a "real" person because I don't watch porn and masturbate all day. I feel like sex is a big driving force in everyone else's lives that is just... isn't for me. 
I want to be happy, in love and with someone and sure sex will be great then I'm sure... but I feel like I'm lacking that  fundamental "OH MY GOD MUST GET ALL THE SEX NOW" quality that everyone has.
and here's where it turns bad...
It's been like this for a while, especially since I've gotten older. I'm lucky I date a nice guy who is nice enough to respect me and not force me to have sex. And he's great and makes me happy, but I know that he'll get bored of me and leave and that sucks. I also can't relate to people around me. I feel alienated, like everyone will hate me when they figure out what I am like. It's gotten so bad that I plan to turn away from everyone and kill myself. All the time. 
I feel broken, like because I don't need to fuck everything, because sex makes me feel awkward and uncomfortable, I shouldn't be alive.
Help.
