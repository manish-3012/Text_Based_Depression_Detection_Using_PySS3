Tired of tryingLost my job, my relationship, and the will to live all in the last month. There's literally nothing for me anymore and I'm about to get evicted from my apartment. 

I had my doctor switch my meds back in late December, but now they don't even work anymore and I was honestly tired of taking them anyway. 

I'm financially screwed and even if I wasn't, there's nothing left for me anyway. I'm broken and there's no reason to keep up the fight. Tonight might be goodbye.
