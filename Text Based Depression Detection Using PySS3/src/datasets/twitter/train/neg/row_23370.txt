I can't do this anymoreI'm debating on ending it all tonight, I might wait a couple days. Everything that could possibly go wrong, did. Everything went to shit and I can't handle it anymore. I've dealt with alot of shit but this is too much and I'm just tired. I'm about to be homeless, the most important person to me doesn't care about me anymore and won't talk to me. I've lost everything and I'm not strong enough to start over. This is the end of the road i give up. No matter how hard you try or how good of a plan you have or how big a heart, things can still go wrong. I guess I'm making this so people can see it, cause I feel like I'm screaming but no one can here me. I'm sorry. Goodbye.
