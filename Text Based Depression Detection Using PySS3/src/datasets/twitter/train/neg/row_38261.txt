Trying to make sense of my lifeI'm 23, male, have a wonderful family and we are financially well off.  I graduated college, and should be pretty happy about that, but for years I've been the most depressed person.  I have no friends currently and have never even had a girlfriend.  I'm too shy and feel like I am a very weird person and a SO couldn't love me.  I believe I stick out like a sore thumb when I hang out with other people, as am reticent and don't make eye contact.  I say negatve, depressed person things.  Others tell me I have a bad attitude, and I believe them and am trying to change my thinking.  But just when I think I am aware of all of my flaws and deficiencies, and I try with everything I have to correct them, life seems to become too hard and I fail at many tasks.  I struggle in life, and I look around and many friends and family members are doing better than me.  I just feel so much hurt and pain, and I am starting to think I have failed at becoming a normal human.  I want to change.  Where do I start?  What should I do?
