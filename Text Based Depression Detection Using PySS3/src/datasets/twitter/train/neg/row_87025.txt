Hold on - is this all that life is?So you work for 8+ hours a day in a meaningless job, spend 2+ hours commuting, then 3+3 (hours are separated, depends on when the job starts) being anxious about the upcoming struggle in your workplace or doing the things you don't enjoy (because depression prevents enjoying anything). Then you spend 2 days a week being depressed in your small and empty flat, because nobody wants to hang out with those who have mental illnesses. And this whole cycle goes on for over 40 years straight.


All of this because I was unfortunate enough to be born?


And they dare say that people with depression have no right to suicide?
