I wish I could kill myselfI canâ€™t due to people in extended family counting on me and Dogs. Due to health reasons I get fatigued easily and can not exercise as often as I used to, I have hormone imbalances causing severe anxiety and stress. Dr tried to help but it doesnâ€™t work. It is A hormone imbalance. Not psychological. Antidepressants do not work for me, microdosing maybe helps a small bit with the stress. I have gained 40 pounds in five months when I was so vibrant and hiked several times a week.  I am so miserable, I donâ€™t want to kill self except these issues are making life bad.i lay in bed most of the time and barely work like I need to. I used to like socializing meeting new people, now I get so tired I canâ€™t. Energy supplements and caffeine help at Times but I still feel tired.
