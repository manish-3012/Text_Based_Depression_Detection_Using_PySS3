What keeps you guys going?I'm just lost, and beginning to think i have depression or some shit. In school, i laugh a lot, i'm happy, everything's fine, but i hate school. At home, the one thing I get enjoyment out of is being on my computer. My parents don't want me on it constantly however, even though i'm in pretty decent shape as is. Last week, someone at my school killed themselves by jumping in front of a train, and I'd LOVE to do the same, but I'd feel bad leaving my family and friends. Also, I kind of hate myself. I hate that I'm a furry, that I'm (most likely) gay - not like there's an issue with being either, it's just I myself hate being those two things. I don't even know where I'm going with this, i'm just typing whatever comes to mind. Sorry if this sounds stupid. Thanks for reading.

EDIT: Also music, I love listening to and playing music and it calms me down. Playing my sax is the other real thing I enjoy doing at home.
