Still HereIâ€™m still here. 12 days ago I made a post where I declared Iâ€™d be dead within 24 hours. It didnâ€™t happen obviously.

Iâ€™m still struggling mentally, and Iâ€™m still cutting myself. After I didnâ€™t kill myself, I had a drug relapse. But luckily that ended like 5 days ago.

It sucks. It always sucks. But I wouldâ€™ve missed out on a very meaningful text exchange if I had left 11 days ago. And I wouldâ€™ve hurt the person involved in that text exchange. She deserves better than that. So it sucks, but maybe some things make it worthwhile.
