Why is it worth it?Life, that is. People say life is worth living. The only real thing that makes life worth living is my partner. I'm also fairly sure he wants out too and we are just keeping it together for each other. 

So really, why the fuck is it worth staying anymore? I'm tired of fighting just to survive. FUck this fight. I give up. I've lost. 

Edit: I just went to /r/reasontolive and that really just emphasised how pathetic the reasons are. A video game, a new song... That does not even put a dent on the reasons not to live.
