I am a bad, toxic person and I need to kill myselfI attempted suicide last year by taking a bunch of pills, and I ended up not going to the hospital. I wish I succeeded so badly. My life is so shitty because I'm a shitty person. I lie to people, I'm passive aggressive, I'm petty, I'm negative, and on top of all of that I have multiple mental disorders. I feel like I'm the person everyone warns you to stay away from. I am alone, and I just want to die.


I promised myself I wouldn't go down the pill route again, but I'm seriously considering it. I feel like I need to take my life. I don't want to live anymore.
