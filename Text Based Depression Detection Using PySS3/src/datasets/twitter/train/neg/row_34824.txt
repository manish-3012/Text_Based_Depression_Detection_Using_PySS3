I donâ€™t know what to doIve wanted to kill myself off and on for a long time now but i can never find the courage to do so. I often feel alone, and lately my emotions have been more out of whack than theyâ€™ve ever been because i keep messing up and im not sure what to do. Im sitting in my car now wondering if i should crash, OD on these painkillers i have in my cup holder, talk to my girlfriend and ask for help, or buy a gun off of someone and just end it all. I donâ€™t feel like i have anywhere to go anyone to talk to Iâ€™m hurting and i just donâ€™t know what to do
