I hate being alive my life is hellI'm only 17 so you probably will tell me that I'm overreacting or it's just a phase but really iv been felling depressed for almost 4 years now. I've Allways been an introverted guy and when I was younger I never tried to socialize I didn't really cared about that until I was 15 and I realized that i was basically your typical loner with only 2/3 friends max and I didn't even enjoyed their company plus I Allways had a pretty low self confidence so I started to get depressed I told my best friend at the time and he gave me the typical tips of ' just be positive' or 'just go say hi to people' but my anxiety and low self confidence made me incapable of doing so. Some time passed and in the summer of 2017 we had a big argument and he blocked me on all social media and because I was tired of his bullshit I diceded to let go of him and make new friends in my 10th grade. That grade was probably the best in recent times I was strangely optimistic even though I had no friends and although being shy I made some friendships but they were all with strange kinda outcast kids who spended the school days making sex jokes and overall being immature as fuck. So I got tired of them and slowly started to get close to a another group of friends which semmed way coller but to amuse them I tried to act a little diferrent that my normal self be more random and more funny and not be such a pathetic depressed loser and it went well at frist but then I started to feel a bit of an outcasts in that group because all of the guys are long time friends it got better with time and I got more comfortable but still I feel like an outcast there they rarely talk to me outside of school by texting or calling and they as childish as the original group which started to get mad at me for 'betraying their fiendship' (which is a lie because I still talked to them) so 10 grade as getting to a end and I was starting to plan to get a new group on my classroom because I have a friend who is friends whit that group but meanwhile my mom and my dad got divorced and my mental state went downhill from there. The 10 grade ended and in the summer I started to feel the impact of the divorce I met my stepmother and step father both of them have a kids and they are kinda ano annoying, and my parents started to argue about the divorce papers and etc which they still almost 7 months later haven't agreed on. The 11 grade started and my grandes went downhill my friends got even more annoying and now when they invite me for anytinhg which is rare I just say I can't go and all of my social anxiety came back to me so I can't try to be friend of the other group that I had in mind and my previous group separated because they argued about some stupid shit I can't even remember. Other bad things have happened ever since the guy who I considered my best friend (we weren't officially best friends but yeah we here pretty close and I liked him way more that the other group) got a gf and how they are Allways toghter and I rarely can't hang out whit him and my parents situation got even wrost. All in all I fell trapped whit friends I don't like and I fell like no one cares about me there are full days where no one text me and I fell like a loser a fat socialy retarded piece of shit. And as you might imagine I have no motivation to self improve and nowadays life just doesn't mean anything to me everything is pointless so I put the minimal effort in everything. Sorry if this is hard to read in some places but my main lenguage is not English I just wanted to get this off my chest
