I feel like I'm just waiting for the courage to end it allSo I've suffered on and off with depression since I was 14 and I'd decided to end my life when I turned 30. When I was 28 I decided to take a hold of my life and turn things around. Within a year I'd left an abusive relationship I'd been stuck in for 7 years, moved into a cute little house (rented) by myself, adopted a very loving cat, found myself in a wonderful relationship with someone from my past and was having regular therapy appointments so by the time I did turn 30 I was very content and proud with what I had achieved.

That was 2018.

In 10 days I turn 32.

This year is really testing me. In February my cat passed away, he was my best friend and I miss him so much. In March covid hit and so I temporarily moved to my partner's house for our country's lockdown so I could still be with him. In June I moved back home to find the view obscured from my bedroom window with metal fencing due to fly tipping near my house that has now caused rats to appear nearby. In July my partner broke up with me due to his own mental health and since then I've just felt empty.

Due to covid restrictions I've barely seen my family and I don't go out and do anything. I go to work and then I come home. I spend my days off lost in video games just to avoid whatever reality this is or I just stay in bed all day. I feel like I'm waiting for the courage to just end everything. I'm so close to being done.
