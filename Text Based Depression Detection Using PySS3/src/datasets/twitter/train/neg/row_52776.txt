is it normal to have suicidal thoughts and dreams every day at the age of 14?as you may have seen in title whenever my mind goes a little unoccupied (eg bored in lessons) i always think of grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing myself and always daydreaming (not very pleasant) of my mother clutching my corpse with blood all over it. this happens at least once or twice a day and it really isnt helping. i tell my mother(asian) and she said"wow youre so cool arent you"  and dismissed me and tells me to study and no hopes for father at all. for schoolmates no because they would tell my year leader believe hes absolutely retarded. i had a friend who did counselling and she said its worse as you need to recall everything you are trying to forget. any help??
