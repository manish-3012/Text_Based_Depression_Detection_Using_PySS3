It really does get betterAround this time last year I had my head in a noose, only thing stopping me was hurting my family I was sent away for a whole year (where I literally left the house like once every few weeks it was on the country side so couldnâ€™t get to know anyone)for doing horrible things stealing from my family ,hard drugs expelled from school ,never going home all that every bad thing a 14 year old could do when I thought I could never get away from this now a year later Iâ€™m back in school back with old friends made some new ones a girlfriend looking to get a part time job soon. everything I thought Iâ€™d never have again . So basically I was at the lowest sitting in a room all day for a year and 3 weeks wanting to die nearly every day. 


And sorry for the grammar Iâ€™m proper dyslexic was out of school since I was 13 up until last month 
Everyone will look at this post and think Iâ€™m an absolute retard, thought maybe it can give hope to at least someone going through something similar :)
