I Just Don't Know What To Do Anymore.I've never been this sure that I want to die before. I've reached out to no avail. I have an amazing boyfriend who deserves so much better than this. I think he's starting to see that he deserves better than this. My friends are already gone. There's no one I feel close to anymore more. I don't know what happened to my life. It's suppose to get better but it never has. My life is on an up swing. Making extra money ghost writing. Paying off my debt. Looking for a new place to live. All of this is suppose to be exciting but it's not. I had to move back home. I failed. I can't stand myself anymore. I really failed. I miss my boyfriend so bad. I just want physical affection. Just a cuddle. Ugh. I really am not sure how much more I can take.
