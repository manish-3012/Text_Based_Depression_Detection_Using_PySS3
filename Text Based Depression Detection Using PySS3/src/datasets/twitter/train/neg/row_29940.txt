Lost my job and it's really tempting.Only thing stopping me is my 11 month old son.  My wife isnt even a safety factor at this point.  Lost my job for bullshit reasons (did not meet productivity measures).  Never been fired from a job before and it hurts.  Like big time.  I'm taking any little correction from anyone as a huge dig against my own ability to be human I'm really tempted to just take a wall tonight with whatever I can find and find a nice place to just let life go.  Say fuck it to pricks that cant come to my face and tell me what's up, give me false hope and most of all leave those I work with in complete limbo when I have a positive working relationship with each one of them.   You are letting them fucking down but I'm going down as the enemy in their eyes.  I'm going down as the son of a bitch that abandoned them.  Just those thoughts alone kill my heart...I'm a failure to myself and to my family.
