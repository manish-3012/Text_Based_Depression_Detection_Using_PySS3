Nothing that hasn't been said before.That's really my problem. I hate it, and I'm disgusted by the fact that I hate it. My entire being and that which drives it - appalling. Nothing favorable happening in life, and anything that I can see as precious lashing out at me more sickly and terrifying than the last thing I mistakenly shared what I thought was love with. It's the same old story, no matter how many times I attempt to restart it. Each character is the same. I cannot, and will not, stand this. It's really only a matter of time.
