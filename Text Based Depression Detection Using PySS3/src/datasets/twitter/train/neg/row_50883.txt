I'm struggling and I hate myself.Hi, everyone.

I'm struggling with my life. I spend most of my time on social media to keep my head straight. I'm hopeless, I'm nobody to everyone. I have been trying to find a full job but I failed. I wanted to help my family but I failed. I want to help myself, but I failed! I don't know anymore, I lost myself. I'm depressed. I feel so dead inside.

Sometimes, I cried thinking why I'm still alive today when I did nothing in this world except breathing the fresh air. I feel like I should have kill myself.  I wish and wait someone come to me, talk to me, talk about my problem but nobody is coming, or maybe, because I don't have a lot of friends who knows me better. Sometimes, I hurt myself too, I punched the desk, the door and the wall.

I also have an anxiety, when it comes,  I hurt myself because I coudln't handle it. I'm not afraid to kill myself but I feel guilty leaving them behind, leaving someone who cares about me.

My head already hurt thinking about all my problems. I couldn't even sleep at night. ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG.

I'm sorry for my bad english. I just wanted to share what I feel right now.
