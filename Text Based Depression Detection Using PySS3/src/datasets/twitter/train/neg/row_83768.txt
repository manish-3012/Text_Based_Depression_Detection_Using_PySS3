Tonight I found a reason to stay AliveSorry for my English. I'm suffering from crippling Depression and I live with my Mother. I'm the only child and My mother is a single parent and has no relatives where we Live.
An hour ago I had an intense emotional breakdown while laying face down on the couch so Intense I didn't realize I was making agonizing noise crying then Out of nowhere My mother rubs my back and She said 'Pls.Don't leave me alone" I was so shocked she knew I was contemplating suicide.
Tonight I made a Promise to myself I have to outlive my mother no matter how painful my depression is I'm not going to kill my self.
My mother is 65 years old now so So If She lives up to 80 years old. That means I still have 15 years to live. Once my mother passes away. I will follow her immediately. I will spend whatever savings I have to indulge in pleasure One last time. Once I ran out of money. I'm going to hike a mountain and carry a gun. I will watch the sunset for one last time and End it all there. I will die happy knowing I won't have to feel this way ever again.
