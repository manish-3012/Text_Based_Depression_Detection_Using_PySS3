Im never gonna be fucking normal so whatâ€™s the point???
Ever since I remember Iâ€™ve felt like Iâ€™m not good enough that Iâ€™m an outcast that Iâ€™m just no the same as other people. A month and a half ago my ex ended things between us after I freaked her out and was extremely controlling and manipulative, I literally destroyed my relationship with a self fulfilling prophecy of being a controlling freak. I couldnâ€™t just let her be her own person, I always created issues and arguments and said so many things that were wrong, telling her I didnâ€™t want to be with her in heated moments saying I didnt like certain things she did. Telling her how suicidal Iâ€™d felt and depressed, now Iâ€™m realising it was maybe just my way of getting sympathy, make her feel like being with me is more of a chore than anything else. I have so many fucking issues with self esteem and insecurities and depression that it just fucks everything up all the time. Any social environment with her if act out or act weird and make her friends and family question what was wrong with me, if I was moody or angry or whatever. 3 relationships where itâ€™s clear Iâ€™ve been selfish, manipulative and controlling and pushed away the person I was scared of losing. And now Iâ€™m here, alone, dealing with this shit everyday regretting it all. Why couldnâ€™t I just be a normal fucking boyfriend? Why the fuck am I like this? Iâ€™m so self destructive I literally do everything I can to get my own way no matter how much it hurts someone. I fucking hate myself, I just sit in fucking guilt of hurting someone I love and care about again but donâ€™t seem to care enough when it matters to stop this shit. I fucking hate me.
