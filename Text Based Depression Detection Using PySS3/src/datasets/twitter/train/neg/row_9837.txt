How to get suicidal thoughts to go away?Suicidal thoughts are like a monster that follows me around everyday. They bleed into everything I do. Iâ€™ve cried myself to sleep every single night for the past 2 months. 
I donâ€™t want to die. I just want to be happy. But whenever I am suicidal thoughts keep creeping in. I have a suicide note and rope under my bed. 
Iâ€™m only 15, I know I have so much life left to experience but feeling suicidal ALL THE TIME seems so be ruining my life. How can I get the thoughts to go away and be happy again?
