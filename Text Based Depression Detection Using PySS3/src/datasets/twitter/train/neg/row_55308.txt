So tell me, what makes you happy?Hey guys, I'm feeling a little better than usual tonight and I want to share it with everyone. So tell me, what makes you happy even in the worst of times? I'll go first, I love the feeling of laying under the stars on a cold night and counting the shooting stars. It makes everything else seem novel because it makes me happy.
