Am I suicidal?I suffer from hopefully Suicide-OCD.
BUT FUCKING JESUS CHRIST THIS FELT SO FUCKING REAL I AM SO SCARED PLEASE WHAT WAS THIS, CAN ANYONE RELATE?!

Last night I went to sleep and when I closed my eyes I got attacked by these thoughts. The thoughts like 'I want to do it' followed with severe anxiety and knot in the stomach and like a general dark feeling. I tried calming myself by breathing but everytime I did the thought hit again and it became more and more intense. And it felt like i wanted it accompanied by severe anxiety and a feeling of being trapped. This morning when I was half awake this thing continued. 
Now I can tell that I don't didn't want this. it was like 'what if i feel like this forever and like intense feel and urge and imagining today feeling the same way and it waa horrific and I woke up and it repeated but was less severe and lasted for like 5 mins.
Now I can't recall the feeling and if I wanted it for real. Fuck
Was this a panic attack or actual suicidal moment?!?!?!
