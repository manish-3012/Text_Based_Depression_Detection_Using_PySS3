No creative titleJust needed to tell someone else. I hung the noose. Tried it on. Knew it could work. Took it down. Cried on my basement floor. Took a shower. Going to bed. And now I'm scared knowing it would actually work, rather than just wondering if it would work. 

People always talk about suicide as if someone must always be so super hopeless and hating themself to do it. I don't hate myself and I know people love me. But I just dont want to keep living. It's like wanting the movie to be over with. And I don't want to keep living just because other people would be sad if I died.
