I canâ€™t do this anymore!!!This year just keeps getting worse and worse!! I just found out my Aunt died last night from covid. My best friend killed herself last month. I got diagnosed with ms last month and Iâ€™m not really getting better. 

My bother has really bad asthma and if he gets covid he could die too. My dad is a trucker and he always goes way over the speed limit so at any point he could get in a reck. My stepmom has cancer and itâ€™s making her immune system very very weak, so if she gets covid sheâ€™s gone. 

Doctors basically told me if I get chickenpox Iâ€™m going to die, same with the flu. And Iâ€™m assuming same goes for covid. 

Honestly I just want to go back to the mental hospital I went to this summer when I tried to overdose. Iâ€™ve missed it there since I left. It was the only place I felt safe. It was like an escape from reality. I just want to go back. Iâ€™m willing to try to kill myself again to go back, and if I end up dying, even better. 

Iâ€™m tired of this world. I just want to go back to normal. I canâ€™t do this anymore.
