No one cares especially my family.Fuck this life, why am I still here, just to suffer? I am tired of begging for someone to help me about my mental health and their reply will gonna bs "Oh it's all in your head, you're just being so overdramatic." and *"Learn to help yourself." and the one that makes me angry is that I'm doing my best on helping myself like exercising 3x a week, meditating, learning new things, trying to make my mindset more better and being more logical about things and learning a new language (english), bettering my self pretty much, but man people just can't fucking understand that I have clinical depression, OCD, and severe social anxiety, and I've been in out of treatments, because my father thinks it's a waste of his money, they just don't give a fuck especially my father, he is the most ignorant, close minded, thinks he "knows it all" but in reality he doesn't know shit.

 And most of my life people been shitting on me from my ex classmates bullying me, teachers discriminating me and being prejudice because of my skin color, and my father who doesn't give a shit about me and just cares about his money and getting drunk plus my half siblings who hates me for being I think the child of their mom's husband. Fuck this shit man, I am just tired of fighting because life won't give me a fucking break.

It's just so hard to live in a 3rd world country full of ignorant, prejudice people and having a shit family and being 17 having no job and still relying on my parents. Fuck this.
