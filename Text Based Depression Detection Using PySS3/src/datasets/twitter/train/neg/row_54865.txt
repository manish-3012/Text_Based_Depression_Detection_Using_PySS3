Iâ€™m a failureThis feeling of emptiness is killing me and I feel bad for saying emptiness because I have an amazing and beautiful daughter that means everything to me. But I have an extremely hard time financially taking care of her and try and give her everything I can. But the stress and sense of being a failure constantly. When I things start going my way I remember that I fail more than anything. I try to stay positive but that usually last about 10min. All I think about is how much everyone will be better off with out me. This week Iâ€™m all by myself and canâ€™t stop having the thought of suicide leave my head.
