Running out of reasons not to kill myself.I've had (as yet undiagnosed) anxiety issues for a while now. For the first time in *ages* I felt like I could overcome this and have a normal life for once. But last night, I found that my friend posted [this](http://redd.it/upq6j) about me three months ago. On its own, it wouldn't have been that bad, if it'd all been true. (She's twisted things to make them seem a *lot* worse than they are. I'm not sure if that was for attention, or because that's how she sees them.)

Thing is, her boyfriend (well, kind-of fuckbuddy/lover/I-don't-even-know-what) posted on it. Given how little attention the post received, it's pretty much impossible that he found it without her telling him about it first. Also, even if she *didn't* direct him to the post, he easily would've figured out it was me from some of the details there. I mean... this hurts a lot more than the fact she decided to tell reddit. She told her boyfriend, who would have even less of an issue with telling **his** friends, who would have even less of an issue with telling **their** friends... and so on. Eventually, who knows how many people would end up knowing?

There's also the issue of the straight-up lies she told in the post. First off, I'd already asked her if she thought the whole wrestling thing was too creepy/weird and how I should've handled the situation differently. She said she didn't see any problems. (It sounds a lot creepier the way she put it in her post, I admit.) I can't understand why she'd tell me that there were no problems, and then six months later decide that she was  "frozen" and found it appalling. I guess I kind of can: I'm pretty sure she said it to get attention/sympathy from her fuck buddy, who at the time she'd made the post she'd known for about a month. Also, both quotes from me were taken **wildly** out of context. There's no way she could have accidentally misconstrued my point that badly, so I can only guess that **that** was deliberate too. I'll stop rambling about that now; I don't want to sound too defensive. 

The point is, this is just yet another thing that makes me feel like I'm worthless. I was always raised to believe that God was the only reason my life had a purpose. I've shed my belief in God, but I haven't quite managed to shed the idea that I have no purpose. I mean... it was always comforting to think that there was a reason God made me the way I am. Now, I have to accept that it's every bit as hideously unfair as it seems, and pretty much everyone hates me just because of my sexuality.

Also, I think I'm developing some substance abuse problems. I've drunk way more alcohol than normal this week and right now I desperately want to drink more. I don't know if this is just stress from this or if I'm going to end up dependent on it, or on weed. 

And through the whole thing, there's a part of me wondering if I really would be better off dead. I mean... if I was ever publicly outed then I definitely wouldn't want to stick around much longer. As it is, I have no long-term goals and nothing to actively make me want to live, but there isn't anything that makes me want to die yet. I just feel so incredibly worthless and I can't quite put this emptiness into words. 

Normally I'd just go to my friend for advice, but her advice has been shit so far (including gems like, "you're not really a paedophile; I know what you're feeling more than you do,"), and I obviously can't trust her. 

Sorry if this has been a bit ramble-y. I'm not even sure how I feel right now.
