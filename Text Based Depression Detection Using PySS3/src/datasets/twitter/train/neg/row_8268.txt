I tried to commit suicide a few months ago, but didn't succeed. I just needed to tell somebody because I can't tell any of my family or co-workers for obvious reasons.A few months back, I tried to commit suicide for the first time in my life. I swallowed a whole bottle of 40 mg anti anxiety/depressant pills, and then half of another bottle. I took them with alcohol to make extra sure that I would die, but nothing happened. Not even any adverse health effects, which is kind of weird. When that didn't work, I tried to hang myself with the pull string on my window shades, but it hurt so badly that I decided to stop. I had a huge red line around my neck for about a week and a half after that, but nobody questioned it. I'm not going to reveal any personal information about myself or the events that drove me to do this, on the off chance that someone I know in real life might stumble upon this and recognize me, but I will say that my life is in a little bit of a better place now, albeit not by much, even though I still feel completely worthless and miserable constantly. But now I have something else to be miserable about. The fact that I came so close to hurting everybody who cares about me so badly. Not one of them even knows about it, and for the rest of my life I'll have to live with the disgust I have for myself for making such a terrible, selfish decision. I think about it every day. I'm going to sleep right after posting this because I have to be at work for 3pm, so forgive me if I don't respond to any comments right away. I apologize for the sob story, but I just had to get all of this off my chest. It's been bothering me for a while.
