I feel like I'm sinkingI'm 21. My mum died a couple weeks ago, both of my parents have now passed and i have never felt so isolated. Almost like claustrophobic that the walls are closing. No where left to go. A girl i was speaking to that has just said she no longer wants to speak to me. This fucking threw me. I have no right to be this angry or upset about this. But the accumulation of  pains meant i just had to get in the car and drive. I found myself screaming to crying to singing and on the way back closing my eyes on the empty dark road.

I don't even feel i deserve to post here right now.

I have no one and nothing. However selfish that sounds.

I just need to know there are people out there.
