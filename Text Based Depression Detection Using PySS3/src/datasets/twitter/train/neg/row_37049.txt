Feeling Really Down Right NowIâ€™m feeling quite depressed right now and really would appreciate anyone talking to me. Iâ€™d be incredibly thankful. I just feel really sad. I want to cry really bad and I feel so tempted to hurt myself. I wish I was loved romantically and was as good as most men my age. Iâ€™m trying to choke myself and am trying to cut myself right now. It feels so good.
