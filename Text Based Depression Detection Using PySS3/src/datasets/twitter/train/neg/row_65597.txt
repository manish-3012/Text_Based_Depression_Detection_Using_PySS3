I just want to end itI've been cutting myself to help ease the pain, and it did for a while, I thought I was getting better, now it's all crashed. I've done all in can think of, I've talked to people, but the most they ever do is: give a list of things your thankful for. And lazy shit like that. It just makes me wanna kill myself more because I can't even do that.

I ended up laying in the bathroom at work crying "please let me die" 
I don't know, I've got maybe a week at this rate...
