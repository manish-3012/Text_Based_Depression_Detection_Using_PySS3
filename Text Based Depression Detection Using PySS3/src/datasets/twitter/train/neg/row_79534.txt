I canâ€™t take it anymoreI donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting here. Just wanted to see this sub and feel like Iâ€™m not alone. I canâ€™t bear the severe anxiety and depression I have suffered the last couple years. All hidden by a fake smile as I watch others succeed. Iâ€™m only 14 but I already feel like I have failed expectations and there is nothing I can do about it. My impulsiveness has ruined my relationship with my family and I have lost my social life to gaming addiction. I just wish I could start my life over and not make the same mistakes, however since that isnâ€™t a option I feel the only alternative is suicide. As I mentioned earlier, I feel like I have failed and all my peers havenâ€™t. This fills me with jealousy about why I canâ€™t have their lives and why I have mental disorders. I have tried therapy with honest remarks to help my therapists guide me. I have gone through 3 highly rated therapists. I have tried numerous anti depressants and other medicine to help overcome the troubles faced. Nothing has helped. I keep telling myself that in 2 months Iâ€™ll be happy but 10 months pass and then 6 more and I see that isnâ€™t the case. Iâ€™m just flying through my teens depressed and anxious and wasting every day. Iâ€™m a total failure and nobody cares about me. Iâ€™m just one more person in this big world. Just a statistic. Just going to end up working a shit 9-5 job feeling depressed until I die. I canâ€™t take it. I just want it to end already.
