Can someone argue this for me?So, been developing some clarity. Wanted to come ask if anyone can help me think about this.

If someone is damaged or defective enough to never really be happy and always be suicidal, is it better if:  
a) They suicide early on, before family and friends and society invest too much time or effort in them?  
b) They spend decades trying to find a way to be okay with being alive but eventually succumb to the reality that they are basically non-productive burdens on family and friends and society?

Beyond the general 'don't ever suicide', I get the impression that if they had to choose then most would recommend (b). Am I right about this?

Do you all really think it is preferable to keep people who are nothing but a drag on everything around? Are you really happy that they don't kill themselves, enough to be okay with the likelihood that all their lives are nothing more than an attempt to cope and not actually any other kind of benefit to anyone?

If so, can you tell me why? I am trying really hard to understand and develop a perspective that makes sense of all this.
