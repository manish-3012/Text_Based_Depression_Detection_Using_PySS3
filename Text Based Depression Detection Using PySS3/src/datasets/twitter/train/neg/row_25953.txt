Thank youFirst of all, please keep in mind that English isn't my native language, so I still may make mistakes.  


For the past few months (I think since June) I was in a pretty dark place. Broke, off my meds and harrassed by some people. I suffer from depression, general anxiety disorder and borderline disorder, so you can imagine what it was like. Constant moodswings, emotions turned up to 200%, self harm, suicidal thoughts. Being harrassed by some asshats didn't help too. To be honest, I started harming myself because of them. I just wanted to die, to disappear. To stop being a burden.  
But now I'm back on track. I just took first dose of my medications, and I already feel better, doesn't matter if it's placebo or not. It just means I got my shit together. Scars will remain, but everything can be fixed. I wish you all find your path again. I love you all.
