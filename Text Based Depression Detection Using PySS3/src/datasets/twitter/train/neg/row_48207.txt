27 year old virgin with no relationship experience, ready to just end it.Lately this has been weighing on me more as I approach 30. Have no experience with women and every day that passes it becomes less likely I'll ever try to. Have no self esteem, hate my appearance (always been fat), and just keep to myself now. 

Just exhausted from constantly worrying about dying alone, just want it to be over. Thinking I will do it this week.
