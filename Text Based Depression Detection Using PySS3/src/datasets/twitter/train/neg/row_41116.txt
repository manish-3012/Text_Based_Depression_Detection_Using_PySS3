Just got offered a great job, am now more suicidalDespite my efforts to self sabotage, I just got offered a job after traveling for 1.5 years making 95k. I am 26. I have been heavily suicidal for a few months.

I was hoping this would fall through so Iâ€™d have more of a reason to kill myself. The truth is Iâ€™ve only been staying alive the past couple of months for the few people in the family that still like me. I only have one good friend but she will leave me too.

Why canâ€™t I just kill myself and have this torture end 

Why am I staying alive just to make money, i donâ€™t care about money anymore. Iâ€™m already thinking about killing myself
