I'm having really overwhelming suicidal thoughtsI feel like dying, I have no plan to do so but it keeps coming into my head. I feel so depressed, physically sick too. If I go to the hospital what happens? I live in Canada. I'm not going to hurt myself but I can't stop thinking about it and I'm not sure what to do. I have counselling but it doesn't really help. Thanks
