I think I just failed an important exam for the third time. I really wish I was dead.I don't necessarily want to kill myself, I just want to get a brain tumor and die from that where the brain tumor simultaneously explains why I'm so dumb and lazy and awkward, and at the same time it kills me without me having to feel guilty.  Sometimes I am so sad that it just hurts to be, and I want to not be anymore if that makes sense.
