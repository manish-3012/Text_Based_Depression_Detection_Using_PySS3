Last resortWhen youâ€™re at the end of the rope and thereâ€™s just too much pain, how do you go into medical care without them putting you on suicide watch. I donâ€™t want to be in the ward or the waiting room for hours alone going in the ambulance. Iâ€™ve done it too many times. I just need to be around people. How do you tell your family about your current state when they are already dealing with their own things. Theres immense pain. Apart of me is thinking the only thing I can do is crash my car but i DONT want to survive. Some people know this feelings when everyone says â€œyouâ€™ll be okayâ€ and you nearly have one push left before itâ€™s serious trouble. Please anybody out there?
