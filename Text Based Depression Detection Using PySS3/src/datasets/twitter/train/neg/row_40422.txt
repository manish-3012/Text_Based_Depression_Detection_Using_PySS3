Wish it was just over already.I actually do not mind being depressed pr anxious. It is only when the depression is severe and the anxiety is comically awful that I want it all to end. But, Pure O OCD is a nightmare and just threw me a thought that goes in circles. I feel like I need to kill myself. I know it will wreck my family, but I have reached a breaking point last night. I know I will either be in limbo or Hell if I do, but I just want the thoughts to stop. And OCD makes sure that the thoughts you do not want to have are always present. If I actually go through with it, then Mom I love you beyond anything I can even express.
