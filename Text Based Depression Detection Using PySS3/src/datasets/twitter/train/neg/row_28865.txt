Plight of a robinHey guys I just wrote a poem out of my depression  thought you might relate the best

Plight of robin -

Let me fly 

Free me of this cage
I can no longer breathe
I belong to the sky
Let me fly

I was not meant to be caged
Yet here i am ,slaved
I dream of high
Let me fly

Every day grows longer
My coop contracts
I will go in a blink of an eye
See me fly

My throat is aching
With the songs i sing
They all are a lie
Let me fly

When i am gone 
Do not weep 
And Do not cry
For,I am glad to fly

Chains of sorrow 
Brusies my hand 
Help! I wanna die 
I wanna fly

It's over now
I am writing the last lines
Perhaps, I will die
I will fly
I will Fly

               -Jai
