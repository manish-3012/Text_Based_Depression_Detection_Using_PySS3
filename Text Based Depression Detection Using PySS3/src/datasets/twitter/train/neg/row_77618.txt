Why do i always mess upI want to end it all in spite of him. The man I loved turned into something awful. He ended things with me today, and I don't even care that he did. I just feel hurt by all the awful things he's said to me in the past weeks. He called me a coward for wanting to die. I can't help but feel that it's all my fault.
