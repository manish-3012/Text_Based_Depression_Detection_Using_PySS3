Im ScaredIm scared of hurting the people I love,but every time i think on how to improve things it always seems to lead here. My mother thinks Im useless and I think she regrets having me. As long as I can remember ive wanted to die because things get so bad. Im tired of this loop of pain. Can someone give me an easy way to go?
