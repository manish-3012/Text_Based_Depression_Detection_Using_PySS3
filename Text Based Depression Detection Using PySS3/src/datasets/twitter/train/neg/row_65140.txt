I tried last year... and failed. I've been holding on but now my hubby has been talking about ending it himself.I have suffered from crippling social anxiety for at least the past 10 yrs. Feb. 2010 I tried to end it and failed. My husband forced me into therapy and meds. @ least once a month I regret not succeeding the 1st time but I hold on for my fam. Lately my wonderful husband has been really down (uncharacteristically for him, but understandable given the circumstances: he is a teacher in MI, got pinkslipped this year and hired back (due to budget cuts) and given a 2 yr pay freeze. We're from the Northview school district and he knew the 6th grade girl who was killed by her father. He went to her visitation (open casket... the girl, her mother, and the mother's parents were all killed and @ this service.) Not 2 mo. later a teacher he is close with lost her husband very unexpectedly and he went to that service. I try my best to comfort him but I'm not 100% at any point. @ least once/month I think about how I wish I had the courage to try again.... I won't (I don't think) but I wish there was some way to comfort my man. he's been saying that he hopes he dies in his sleep each night and that he wants to die. I'm not the person to talk to... Advice, please...
