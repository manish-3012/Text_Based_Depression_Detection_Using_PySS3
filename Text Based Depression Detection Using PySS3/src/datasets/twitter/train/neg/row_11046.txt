GoodbyeI drove around all night trying to find somewhere to hang from but I failed. 
So I came home and I just took so many pils. My vision is blurry. 
This isn't my first attempt 
I don't know if I'm having second thoughts but i always rethink those second thoughts within a week of an attempt. I need to go. I'm in limbo. This is just going to keep happening until I finally do something that works 
Sorry this post makes no sense I just really want someone to know 
I always try to tell people but I'm shit at expressing myself so nobody usually gets it 
I'm sorry if this is triggering to anybody or anything 
I'm going to go to sleep now
