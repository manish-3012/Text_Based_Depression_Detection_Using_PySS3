Failing A-levels, No hopeToday I had my chemistry unit 4 exam in my final A-level year (UK) and I totally flunked it. I got 3 B's in my first year but this time I messed up big time. Spent all my time playing league of legends and didn't study and now I'm gonna fail. My life's over. I uninstalled the game multiple times but kept on coming back. Now the games uninstalled forever but my future is over and I'm not gonna get into any university. I'm not suicidal but extremely depressed and might suicide. I'm such a worthless good for nothing loser. There's no point in living anymore for a loser like me. Everyone has big expectations on me and everyone seems to get better grades than me and now I'm gonna fail.I hate myself.

Tldr going to fail my a levels super depressed feel like suiciding
