Don't know if this is the right place need helpOkay so i will probably just be told to break up with her and I'll feel better, but i won't. I have a girlfriend. She's normally sweet, loving, and caring. But sometimes... She gets terrible.

It only ever happens at night while we're texting. She gets mad and... She tells me that im worthless. She tells me im stupid. She tells me some lies and some truths to get mte down. The day afterwords, she always realizes how terrible she was being. It's like she's in a different state of mind. She says its because she desperately needs my attention and i always pay more attention to her after this happens. She is was recently  like this. It's worse this time. 

I finally told her we needed to talk to so someone about this because (here comes the relevance) it makes me suicidly depressed everytime she does it. She said no. She said to act like nothing happened. She asked me if i was sad and i lied and said no. She knew i was lying. But if i said yes, she would of gone off on me. I feel like a rape victim.

I don't know what to do. If theres a better subreddit for this question, please direct me there, but this needs to come to a stop. I started tying the noose this time. I will be told to just break up with her but that will only have the same effect.
