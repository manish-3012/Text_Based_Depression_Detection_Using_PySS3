Give me a reason to keep on livingI can't help but feel that all my "friends" just tolerate me because they're too nice to tell me to fuck off, or pity me, or secretly hate me. No girlfriend.

I study CS, and I was planning a project, yet another person makes the same thing in literally like 1/100th of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody would give a fuck if I killed myself except my family maybe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Give me a reason to keep on living. No friends, no girlfriend, awful at what I'm studying, and no clear path.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I going to amount to? Nothing. I'll just be slaving away at some 9-5 job for 40 years, probably addicted to alcohol or drugs simultaneously, with no friends, no wife/girlfriend, and nothing. I'm only 19 but at this point I've been a social outcast my whole life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think all the people who told me I was worthless or talked shit about me, were right. It's obviously saying something about me. It can't be others.

So yeah, give me a reason to live on. Once I gain the courage, whenever that may be, I will end it
