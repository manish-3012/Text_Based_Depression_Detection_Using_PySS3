Always in the back of my head.Is suicide courageous or cowardly?
Running towards the one thing most avoid. 
People dedicate their entire lives to outliving death. Diets, medication, transplants - anything to overcome death.

Am I a coward for taking this step into the unknown or am I courageous. 

I have everything. A family that loves me, money that will set me up for life, and a great flesh cage.

But Iâ€™m not free.

Am I a coward or am I courageous.
