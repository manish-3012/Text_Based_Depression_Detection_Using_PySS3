always come back hereIt's painful to me that I keep returning here even when I've told myself that things have gotten better

I'm such an emotional person. I react to everything so emotionally

I'm a horrible partner to my SO in every single way. They're depressed too but it's so hard for me to support them in the way they need. I just do everything wrong

I haven't been to therapy in 4 years. My therapist would make sexual comments about me and talked about having sex with me. I haven't been able to muster up the want to go to another therapist since then. It fucking sucks when therapy itself becomes one of your traumas. What do you even do then?

Isolation has only made it worse even though I'm thankful for quarantine so the virus doesn't spread as much. A lot of my school friends graduated last semester and now they're moving on to other colleges, it feels like I'm losing a lot of folks out of my life. I'm happy for them but I miss them. 

Everything just feels so unsolvable
