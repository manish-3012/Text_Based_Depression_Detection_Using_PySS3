I think it's time I go.I was born into a flawed family, my mom is bipolar and my dad has always been more of a couch potato than a father. My siblings bullied the hell out of me, and I'm pretty sure that's where my self-esteem issues come from. I think I decided that today's the day I take my neighbors pistol and shoot myself in my own fucking head. It's not like I'm not loved in my life, but I just no longer find meaning in anything. Everything seems more like a bother than what it used to be like. I'm on medications, I'm in therapy, I'm surrounded by a great support system, but it's just not what I needed. I think it all fell down in the eighth grade, I let my grades slip when I broke up with a girl I thought I loved, I had tons of friends and lost them all, and my mother and stepfather kicked me out to live with my dad. I think I've been lying to myself these past few years, I've told myself constantly that I've got everything I could ever want, but I never had a stable relationship with anyone, not my father or mother, not my siblings, not my friends at school, and definitely not any girlfriend. It's all over now. I finally get the peace and quiet I've wanted for years. Even if there isnt anything waiting on the other side, I'm glad I had the chance to live, and I'm glad I had the chance to meet so many great people. 
TLDR: I had an okay life, but everything is just so tedious to do. I'm a lazy person, and thus I'll be glad when everything is over.
