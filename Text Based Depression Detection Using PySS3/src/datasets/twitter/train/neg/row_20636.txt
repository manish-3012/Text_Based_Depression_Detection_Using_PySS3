Does anyone else feel like me?Empty.  Alone.  Putting a face on for the day but in the back of your mind you you know you know that youâ€™re real life is waiting at home.  Maybe a podcast or something to cut the silence.  Every once in a while you kinda sit down and write the note youâ€™ve written several times.  I think about my life. Iâ€™m 26,  paid off my 2016 jeep.  Decent job.   Not rich but enough to save a bit.  Just got my dream watch.  Got out of a terrible relationship.  Incredible web of support. Yet I find myself just a miserable as I was when I was less fortunate in life.  Still I write.  Still the silence of a lonely life somehow filled with people.  I donâ€™t much like feeling like this.  I want to be glad about the life Iâ€™ve made for myself so far.  However I just canâ€™t seem to shake the feeling itâ€™s all pointless.  Anyone?  If so how do you make sense of it?
