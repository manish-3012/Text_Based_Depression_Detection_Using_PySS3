I have nothing to live for and nothing to look forward to.Please reply. It can be anything. I know Iâ€™m blatantly begging for attention but thereâ€™s nobody but the internet for me to vent to and Iâ€™m so tired.

My parents are abusive. Iâ€™m currently kicked out of oneâ€™s house just because she feels done with parenting. The other is less passive aggressive but he gets explosively angry over random bs. I canâ€™t see friends or try to be a normal teenager because of COVID. I canâ€™t escape to school. Either way I went from an ambitious kid to an almost 16-year-old who just wants to be done with existence. 

The field I want to go into and am pretty much lined up for scares me to death. I have some serious trauma about it but I still love most aspects of it. Itâ€™s hard to explain. My family is so screwed up that I never want to become my parents and put some poor girl through all that. Itâ€™s the depression talking but I donâ€™t believe in bringing kids into this awful reality. 

Iâ€™m just so done with everything. The idea that I have 70+ years left in me crushes me when I think about it. I canâ€™t kill myself because I donâ€™t want to put my friends and sane family members through the same pain I am in. I still kind of have a favorite method and fantasize about it a lot. Like, Iâ€™ll chat someone and wonder how they would feel if that was my last conversation with them. Or who would find me.
