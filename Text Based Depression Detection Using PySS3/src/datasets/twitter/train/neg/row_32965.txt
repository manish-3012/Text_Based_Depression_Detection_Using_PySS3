It's a weird feeling.... 

when you laugh about everything in your life but in  the next moment you feel empty and lost again. 

I  feel like i'm THE problem of my life, getting rejected of every  girl, maybe i'm acting to weird for them or they hate the fact that i  love playing video games. Last night i deactivated every social media  acc i had, wanted to stop writing with girls. Maybe it's weird how i act  but i think it's the best way to enjoy life.

I'm  not good with people, i hate going out and meet new people.

Starting to cut myself because it's a relieving pain.
