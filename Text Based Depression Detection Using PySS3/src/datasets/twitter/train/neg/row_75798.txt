I will end my life because it's boringFirst of all sorry for bad typos this is not my native language.

I seriously thinking to quit everyday and I will probably do it. 
I'm just ready and prepared. I'm not afraid to die. I know multiple ways to do it and I attempted before almost died. Bad luck I guess.

  I'm going to college I work out daily in gym I go out with my friends, I spend time with family but nothing makes me happy other than thinking about end my life. I did go to psychiatrist and she said I have to be more positive and I said I can't be positive when I see negative shit fuck that now I just want to leave all these losers alone and go to place where I belong
