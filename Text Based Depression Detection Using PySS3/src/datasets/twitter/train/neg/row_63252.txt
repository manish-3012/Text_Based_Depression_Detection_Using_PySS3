Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m destined to become just another statistic.Just another run of the mill bipolar who fell into substance abuse, messed up their life, couldnâ€™t afford help and eventually, couldnâ€™t handle life anymore. 

Iâ€™ll be just a small piece of the number of ever increasing suicides in this country. And people will talk about us as a collective group and call for change, as they always do, but nothing will ever change. 

No one cares about the mentally ill, the poor, the addicted until itâ€™s too late
