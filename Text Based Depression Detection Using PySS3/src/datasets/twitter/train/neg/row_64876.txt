I'll feel guiltyWhy is it that everytime I want to be done with life, people always say, "if you die ,I'll feel guilty"? I don't care how you'll feel cause I'll be gone. Why is it selfish for me but not for you? I'm seriously done , I find no joy in anything anymore. I don't care about money, people, things. My ex gf replaced me with someone else and all of my friends have stopped talking to me. I'm seriously thinking about doing it, and this time I'll make sure it's done right. It's as if I'm dead already anyways..
