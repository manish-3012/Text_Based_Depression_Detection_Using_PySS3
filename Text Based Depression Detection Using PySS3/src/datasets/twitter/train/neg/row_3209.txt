Feel unstableTrying hard to fight these thoughts in urges. Nothing planned, but the rapidly changing thoughts and impulsive nature of how I am feeling worry me that I am unstable and cannot predict how I could react. Called my psychiatrist's office to try to speak with him, he is out of town so spoke with the nurse who discussed my case with other people in the office. They looked at my chart and decided to lower my dose of Lamictal back to 100mg in case the increase is what is making it worse until he is back on Tuesday. After looking at my chart, the nurse seemed a little flustered on the phone and started to give me crisis resources/tell me to go to the ER if I got worse. I imagine all my notes about wanting to hurt myself and not sure about being able to keep myself safe don't look so good. I feel hopeless of ever getting better, and think I deserve this. I don't really feel completely in control anymore of the situation, and I don't know if I would even be in the right mind to get help if it came to that.
