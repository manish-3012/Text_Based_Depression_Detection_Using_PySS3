I look like my rapist dadEvery time I catch a glimpse of my reflection it' just him. 

Pretty sure my mum walked in on it - so he knew the whole time and kept making me see him growing up because otherwise I was being "rude".

Ostracised/bullied later for being anorexic and a fucking mess. Again, no one in my family noticed either.

kept dropping out of school. On the course I'm on now, my grades went bad and I might even fail the whole thing because I can't stop contemplating death long enough to finish the final pieces in time.

I have no prospects - which depresses me, but even if I did think abut what it would be like to have ambitions, then I remember that I already missed the opportunities.

I can't remember the last time I had a hug (that wasn't of a forced, mechanical nature between family members). I want somebody to *sink* into. But I really don't feel like I even deserve that. And I'm not saying that to gauge sympathy - every time I feel even the slightest connection to anyone around me, I catch myself and think "What the *hell* do you think you're doing? Stay. in. Your. Place. You're a joke, and that' all you'll ever be."

It's completely true that people only "care" when you're dead. 
It's completely untrue that "family cares". If you don't know what I mean, re-read the title.
