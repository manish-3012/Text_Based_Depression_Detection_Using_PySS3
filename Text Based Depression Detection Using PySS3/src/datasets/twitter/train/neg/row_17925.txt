The clichÃ©: I think about suicide because my heart is brokenWe were together for two and a half years, and broke up almost 10 months ago. We were planning to move to a different city to settle down and spend the rest of our lives together. I had bought her an engagement ring. If we hadn't have split, we'd likely have been engaged by now. One thing that made our relationship so wonderful was the honesty of it. We shared everything. She lied about her reasons for wanting to split up. I found out later that she had cheated on me. Five times with four different partners. The first happening just a year into our relationship. 

Now I'm alone and directionless, rapidly running out of money, and I think I've forgotten how to be happy. It started as an overwhelming sorrow, and now it is a muted numbness. Nothing is fun, nothing makes me laugh, I feel disconnected from my friends and family. I'm broken. 

People say it gets better. Does it?
