Can anyone give me a reason why I shouldn't end it?My life's a wreck, every aspect of it sucks. Nobody can fix me but myself and I don't have the energy or motivation to try and fix anything at all. I can barely get out of bed in the morning, so how am I ever supposed to be successful? I have nothing and I'm going nowhere. I understand that I'm a mess and I could fix things if I wanted to, but I guess I'm just a lazy ass loser. 

I have the gun right here and I'm seriously wondering why I'm still here. If anyone could come up with a reason why I should stay then maybe I will, cause I can't come up with any reasons myself. I just feel worthless. That's all, thanks for reading.
