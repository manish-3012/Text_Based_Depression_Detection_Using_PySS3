Please can it be over soon?Iâ€™m nothing. A shell. I loved music, I loved people, I loved old movies, I loved.

But we have regrets. Then the worst is untimely deaths. My man has been dead since June 2016. My fathers dead. I have no children. All of my fathers belongings were thrown away without my knowledge. I am not getting better. Iâ€™ve tried. Also Iâ€™ve had people move on to people I no longer recognize, or people have just had no need for me anymore, despite them knowing I was heartfelt and passionate...

Many friends are dead. So many horrible things wonâ€™t stop happening. I wish I was dead. Plain and simple. Itâ€™s not easy to. What about the damned to hell bit? Or eternity in limbo?

I just wish I could â€œaccidentally dieâ€ tomorrow. Iâ€™d rather it be that way. 

I turn 32 next month and thereâ€™s been a lot in my life I tried to bounce back from. You donâ€™t bounce back from where I am and the darker it becomes. Itâ€™s not up to me. 

I am already dead, just existing.
