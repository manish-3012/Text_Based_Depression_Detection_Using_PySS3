I am a selfish person.This is going to be a lot of rambling, but I need to get it out. I am 32/f and have grown up in a really loving family in the Midwest. What I remember from my childhood was being a brat. Always wanting my way. I have always been spoiled too, that doesnâ€™t help the situation. At 10 I was raped at my babysitterâ€™s house by an older man. I donâ€™t know how old but I remember provoking it, almost wanting to try it because I was curious. Itâ€™s fucked up but, thatâ€™s what I remember. 
In high school I was pregnant at 15 and I remember telling my parents. Being raised Catholic their first word was â€œwe will take care of itâ€. I got an abortion, and life went back to normal. High school life. No one really ever liked me, I had a few friends but I was still always a spoiled brat. I know my parents love me and want whatâ€™s best always, but I donâ€™t know, I feel like I need to learn the hard way.
So then of course i found my way to drugs, drinking. Just marijuana and some painkillers, but I loved how it all made me feel. Like my mind was clear. I was happy when I was messed up. Sleeping around just wanting that sexual attention always.
I saw therapists, doctors. They diagnosed me with depression. I was on and off antidepressants for about 10 years. I havenâ€™t been on them since 2017, just didnâ€™t feel like they worked, but Iâ€™m sure smoking weed everyday doesnâ€™t help.
There are two many drug stories to tell, but at this point in my life I have 2 DUIs and my license is now revoked. I have a good job and I bought a house. Thanks to my parents driving me to work everyday and giving me money for a down payment. 
I just donâ€™t feel like I deserve anything I have... I also have a boyfriend who lives with me and he doesnâ€™t drink, and I donâ€™t really either just because he doesnâ€™t and he thinks it is stupid. Even being sober though I still get really sad and worthless feeling. I feel like no one really likes me and never really has.
I never have anything interesting to say, I always freeze up in conversation and and very awkward. People think I am weird. I donâ€™t know where this is going, but I just feel like I have asked almost wanted every bad horrible situation I have been in. 
I want to get along with people,  but most of the time I just donâ€™t like them. I just donâ€™t really see a purpose for being in this life anymore, I take and I use everyone and I just donâ€™t see how I do any good. 
But them I see my parents loving supporting faces and I know I could never do that to them. 
I donâ€™t know... thanks for letting me spill some truth and honesty.
