mehwhen im alone i feel like shit. i dont know why. i dont like being alone and doing nothing and its making me go fucking crazy. i feel like i have no idea what makes me happy anymore. i don't know how much longer i can go on feeling this way. i don't even know if im analyzing myself correctly to say all this shit. i just wish i didn't exist anymore. i dont remember the last time i went a week without feeling worthless or thinking of suicide. my 2 anti depressants have made it better but i don't know if i can still manage this. i don't know anymore. all i can do is sit here and cry while listening to music for the next 3 hours before i get tired enough to sleep.
