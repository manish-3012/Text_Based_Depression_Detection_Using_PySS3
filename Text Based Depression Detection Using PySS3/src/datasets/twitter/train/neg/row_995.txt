The broken birdWhere do the broken birds go when their wings won't fly anymore.

I look and look for broken birds but I can't find anymore.

Broken birds aren't free, they are trapped on the shore.

Broken birds don't speak, their beaks don't work anymore.

Look at that lazy bird the other birds chirp.
That lazy bird sits on the ground and doesn't even work.

The other birds laugh and the other birds play.

Little do they know, they won't see the broken bird again after today.

But it was I who liked the broken bird so I ask you please say,

Where is the broken bird so I may have a friend today.
