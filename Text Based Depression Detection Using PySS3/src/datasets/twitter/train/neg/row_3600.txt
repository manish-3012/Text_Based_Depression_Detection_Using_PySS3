Sexually confused for past 8 years, I'm starting to give up.I began to realize that I was depressed as a 10 year old, two years after my parent's divorce (I was a pretty insightful child). I have been coping with it since then by myself, and I am going on 20 years old. I have had my ups and downs and only thought of hurting myself or killing myself as a coping mechanism until now. I began to cut myself on my stomach. How did I get to this point? Long story short, I am a hopeless romantic, love-obsessed, lonely girl. I have been questioning my sexuality since I was 12, and still have not found a girl for me. I fall in love with straight women unintentionally and after a specific incident, I had enough and lost it. The closest I have ever gotten to a girl was a few months ago. She got my hopes up and played with my emotions until she completely dumped me. I hit rock bottom. Only razorblades could make me feel alive. I don't know how to get out of this mess. My therapist can't figure me out either. I can't imagine spending another year alone. I'm thinking about ending it more and more each day. What do I do?
