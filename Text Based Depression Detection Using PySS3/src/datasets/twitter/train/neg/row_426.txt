lonelyi feel suicidal and pathetic, i have no friends nor love. im 20 and i do work, going to college and pay for some bills but i feel empty and stupid as life goes on, all i think about is wanting love, how ugly i am, and how my peers have accomplished more in life.

ive always been the one picked on and unloved in school, i barely got any family and was abused as a child. i just hate my life im bored of life honestly im sick of it always being lonely it kills me inside.
