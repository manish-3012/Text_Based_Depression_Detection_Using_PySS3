Have Psychosis NOS (similar to schizophrenia). Almost killed myself during my first breakdown and afraid I'm having another one. I'm terrified of going to the hospital though and am considering killing myself rather than going...
Hey guys,

Around last year I had a mental breakdown, hallucinations, Catatonia, the whole 9 yards. I was extremely suicidal and almost killed myself, but somehow avoided going to the hospital.
Recently though my symptoms have been getting worse and I'm worried I'm having a relapse. I'm afraid it will be even worse than the first one and I'll end up having to go to the hospital. The thing is I'm terrified of going there and have a legitimate panic attack whenever I so much as think about it.

I'm considering offing myself if it gets to the point I have to go to the hospital but I don't know if I can do that to my parents. I also don't know if I should tell my therapist about this plan because I'm afraid she may involuntarily commit me.
