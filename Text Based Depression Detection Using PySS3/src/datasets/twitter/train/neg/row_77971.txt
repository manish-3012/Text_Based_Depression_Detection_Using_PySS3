I would just like to be honest for a moment, both with myself and anyone who reads this.I really want to kill myself. This is difficult for me to admit to most people, including me. I've felt like that since I was 8. I've been pretty functional in spite of that, but it's always there. Just a massive voice in the back of my head, urging me towards self-injury and suicide. I don't know why. It just gets harder and harder to resist. I let the self-injury in through a slightly safer channel, by incorporating cutting/bloodplay with sexual partners who know what they're doing. That way I can be assured that I will be fine whilst also having the pain and blood of open wounds, as I know the people I sleep with will ensure that I'm not injured badly. I half-joke with my friends that I'm going to off myself when I hit 40 (I'm 19 now, about to be a junior in college), because then I'll be done with life, but really, it's because having a set future date for killing myself makes it easier to deal with those thoughts now. If I can tell myself that it's going to happen at some point, it makes it slightly easier to continue living now.

I don't really know why I'm saying this. I guess I just wanted to actually admit to myself and others what's in my head. It feels like walking a tightrope.
