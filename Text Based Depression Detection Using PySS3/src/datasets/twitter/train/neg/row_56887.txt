Might be time to give up, soon.I am deep, deep in debt. I was kicked out of college due to low grades (partially due to depression and partially to my own laziness). I have been searching for a job for months and nothing has come of it. I have little experience, no references, and no skills. I don't qualify for state/government assistance or unemployment. My roommates are in the process of moving out, soon I'll have a big empty apartment with nobody to come home to.

I don't have friends and my family does not keep in contact with me (they consider me a failure due to me being unemployed and being kicked out of school). I see no reason to prolong a life of suffering and failed attempts at improvement. I have dreams and wishes but they are all unattainable, mainly due to the fact that I can see no feasible plan for getting out of debt and staying that way. I just want to give up.
