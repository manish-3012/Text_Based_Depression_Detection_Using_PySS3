I realized somethingNo matter what I do, I'll still have to live being me. No amount of good things happening to me or doing things to try to get better could ever make me not be me. And I just don't think I'm worth it. I dunno, I feel like there's no escaping this. I'll always somehow find a way to ruin everything. I thought I'd at least be able to drag myself along until I'm like 25, but I'm starting to think I might end it sooner....
