I hope god gives me the strength to kill myselfIâ€™m a 21 year old girl. I have 5 older siblings but they all left the house and I live alone with my mom, Iâ€™m currently at school so i cant move out on my own. 

She is so fucking toxic. Sheâ€™s so abusive to me . I try to speak up for myself but everyone silences me. All my siblings tell me that theyâ€™ve seen worse. At least they had eachother. Im just alone. Im so fucking alone and i get abused by her every day. And im always the one thst needs to apologize for upsetting her .

I havenâ€™t cut in so long ive been so good ive been working so hard but today is the final straw
I want to kill myself so bad . I cant see the end of the tunnel i cant see the end of the pain. She always brings me down , my looks my body my brain everything. Shes really insecure because she finished elementary school so whenever she sees me work or try to better myself she reminds me that she owns me 

She told me im her property and that she could do as she pleases and that i just need to take it or im going to hell. She told me if i try to kill myself ill just go to hell

Even hell is better than this
My own blood hates me

I want to die 
Iwant the pain to stop
I want someone to care
I want to fucking die please god let me die
Please god give me the strength to do it
