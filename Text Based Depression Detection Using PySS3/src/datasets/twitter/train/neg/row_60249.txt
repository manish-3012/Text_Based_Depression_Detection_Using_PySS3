How can I keep fighting my dark side, I always feel on the verge of losing the battle...For me suicidality has never been a big part until recently...thing is, I DONT WANT TO DIE. But this dark side of me wants to, but I was able to keep it at bay for a few months now...I was somehow able to observe it in distance. But I fear itll come back soon stronger than ever and I feel it coming back slowly...
