Hostile suicide.(spinoff of passive suicide)

it was once passive, like two days ago and years before then, but something happened on the 18.  it usually isnâ€™t like this, i mean, yeah i think about suicide every second of the day, and yeah i canâ€™t stop ever thinking about being dead, and yeah i relate anything anyone ever says to suicide, but it was different that day. not a good different. it felt amplified (i didnâ€™t know it could be amplified), i didnâ€™t want to move out of my chair to go to my next class. i wanted to scream at anyone who talked to me. i didnâ€™t, so i just kept it inside me, and itâ€™s the worst feeling of depression iâ€™ve ever felt in my life after roughly 5 years.

my thought process:

the only possible way is suicide, thereâ€™s no getting out of this. but i canâ€™t?? why canâ€™t i bring myself to actually commit suicide??? i just want it over. i gotta think of everything thatâ€™s stopping me from from doing it, and change that. 
the people i care about is the only thing stopping me. now all i gotta do is stop caring, or make sure theyâ€™ll benefit from me being dead. sure, theyâ€™ll grieve, but that doesnâ€™t last forever.

i continued to think about how everyone will benefit, and if i couldnâ€™t think of anyway that theyâ€™ll benefit, i put them into a box in my head that read â€œdo not care aboutâ€. and left it at that.

if you watch he vampire diaries, you could say i â€œflipped the switchâ€

and i feel better than ever. i honestly donâ€™t care about literally anything.  this is the best thing iâ€™ve done in a while, and all i can picture is my dead body in the garage. and it makes me happy. i just need to figure out a time and method, already got method down, just 1 part to go. past me was so scared of this. this happened once before in october when i made the decision i would finally commit suicide, but i never got past that, i never chose a method or time, and when i was finally passively suicidal again, i was so damn scared that that would ever happen again.  and it has. but present me is so gleeful and eccentric about it, i donâ€™t remember what i was so afraid of. itâ€™s the best thing that could ever happen to me.

iâ€™m not typing all this to get people to tell me to not do it, because i donâ€™t think anything at this point will make
me change my mind. if iâ€™m being honest here, the best anyone could do is delay it because i havenâ€™t chosen a time yet.
iâ€™m typing this because i know any other part of me would; i type in my notes when i need to vent, rarely here. but when itâ€™s that bad, i usually come here. although i donâ€™t get responses, it helps me cope knowing 9 people saw it and 1 cared enough to say some pity words.  i guess i went to 
r/depression but i donâ€™t know if that makes a difference. oh well, i think this is the correct subreddit for this post.

i hope everyone isnâ€™t as weak as me and doesnâ€™t do what i did! :)

i think i read somewhere that being calm and cool and collected while in the midst of an extremely depressive episode is before you commit suicide, but oh well, thatâ€™s good news to me :)
