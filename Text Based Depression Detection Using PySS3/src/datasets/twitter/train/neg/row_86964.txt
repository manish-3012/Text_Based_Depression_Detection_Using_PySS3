I know there's no simple answer to "I don't know what to do..."Seeing all of the other posts, the crazy number of them just within the last hour on this sub hurts me. They're all so much more legitimate than my stupid, selfish feelings. I've had a fine life, I'm not that ugly, I have a couple friends, and I know enough to get decent grades.

But I hate myself. I constantly feel awful, I've tried dieting, exercising and I can never follow a routine. I try to be ambitious, but I can never keep it up. I've tried dating but they all run away from me before the month is up.

I feel depressed because I should have a normal life, I have just about everything, but *people* reject me, and I mean on a general level as well. I have every prerequisite to lead a happy life, and I can't because everyone around me snuffs out my happiness. My ideas are shot down because I'm me. I'm told my thinking is wrong because it doesn't match my ex's ideas.

I think the worst thing one of them told me was that my thinking was cyclical, but when I asked for help they wouldn't bother to help me break free. I tried killing myself the night before, they decided I had gone too far and dropped the next day. Now they and everyone else I know hates me for being so selfish.

And those are the people who even notice me.

Maybe I'm just blaming all of my problems on other people when it's all intrinsic. I keep telling myself I have  a duty to serve others by making art, but I think I'm just trying to excuse my outbursts. It's all unjustified. But no one notices
