I hate looking at myselfI hate looking at myself in the mirror. I don't wanna see myself. I just feel like I am a piece of crap, a horrible person. I have made the worse mistakes in my life and I will not be forgiven. I am a good mother, a really good mother but I don't want to lose my kids. I don't feel my days, I can't even be happy about my days. I always just looking for the next thing, I cannot be thankful for what I've got. I just feel I need to run away and teach myself. Everyone is trying to tell me how and what to do and I can't do this anymore. I want to go somewhere and get away from everything. I need help...
