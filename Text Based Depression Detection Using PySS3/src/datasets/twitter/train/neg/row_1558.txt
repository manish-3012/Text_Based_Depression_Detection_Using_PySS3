i'm waiting for my parents to die to end my lifei have those "picture perfect" parents who love me unconditionally and would do anything for me- something many don't have. so you would think, then what could possibly be wrong? 

Everything, but them. but sometimes it's not enough. i first tried to kill myself when i was 16 (i'm now 21) and diagnosed with a non curable chronic pain disease. what was the point? we all live with pain but i'm drowning in a sea of pain without any life jacket. i've done the treatments, the meds, the numerous therapies offered- but the only reason i can't follow through to end this pain because of them. i saw the hurt in my parents eyes after waking up in that hospital, that hurt i caused them for just a split second trumps all pain i've ever felt. It hurts me even more that they gave me such an easy perfect life and all i want to do is end it. They would sacrifice their own lives for me to live a pain free one. no matter how much i don't want to get out of bed or no matter how much i just don't want to live this life anymore, i WILL live yours as your daughter till the day you die. 

To my Mother and Father, i'm so sorry for feeling so hopeless when all you do is try to find endless ways to give me hope. You've done everything for me- the least i can do is save you from that suffering.
