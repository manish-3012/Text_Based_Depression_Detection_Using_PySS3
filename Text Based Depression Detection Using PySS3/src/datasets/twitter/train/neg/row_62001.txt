urgent advice needed??? or just your thoughts on this - so appreciatedi went to hospital a few days ago and stayed the night. i was discharged and prescribed antipsychotics. last night my girlfriend was admitted into hospital for suicidal intent and she stayed the night and sheâ€™s staying tonight and probably one more. 
yesterday, before this all happened, i had plans to check myself into hospital again but i couldnâ€™t because it was too much of a coincidence with my girlfriend and they wouldnâ€™t take me seriously. i had plans a few days ago to do that, and also kill myself today. instead tonight, my mum has agreed to take me to hospital again, but itâ€™s the same hospital as my girl. i donâ€™t want to cause a big scene and i already told her i might show up but i donâ€™t want to impact her recovery and i donâ€™t want people to take me less seriously because i already planned this a few days ago but it looks like i conspired to be there at the same time when i really, truly didnâ€™t. i could go to another hospital, but itâ€™s really far away and the facilities arenâ€™t as good. iâ€™m most likely/definitely going to that same hospital tonight. i donâ€™t know what kind of advice iâ€™m asking for, but i honestly donâ€™t want to cause more problems even if it means seeing my girlfriend one last time. i donâ€™t want to ruin her and my chances of recovery but i really do need to go to hospital.
