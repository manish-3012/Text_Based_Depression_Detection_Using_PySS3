I'm worried about my momMy mom has bipolar disorder and has told me she was suicidal when she was younger, and the only reason she's alive is because she had me. I'm 25 now, and I just finished grad school and moved 12 hours away to my dream city. My mom just lost her job, her car, seems to have no friends and be a bit asocial, her love life (or lack thereof) has killed her self esteem, and her social media posts are very worrisome. She posts about how depressed and lonely and miserable she is, and I try to reach out to her but she's is closed off and won't say much. I have no clue how to help her. I'm so afraid that I've made things worse by moving away, but this is something I've wanted for so long and I was also very unhappy in the small city she currently lives in. 

What can I do? What can I say? I've told her I love her. She is coming to visit and I've told her how excited I am to spend time with her. But I'm just afraid it isn't enough. Honestly i can see why she's unhappy, her circumstances are certainly not great. But she also doesn't seem to try to get out of them, I assume because of the mental health issues. I know she is unwilling to see a therapist, because of cost and also because of a difficulty and hatred of opening up. I just... Have no clue how to help her. I deal with depression myself but this is on an entirely different level.
