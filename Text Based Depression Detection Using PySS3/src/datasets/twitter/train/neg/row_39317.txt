Black and whiteGod made me seeing all in black and white
because i was born without eyesight
Itâ€™s only my heart that looks trough me
with feelings so deep as the sea
Thatâ€™s the reason why I wish so often  to go
the river inside like a endless flow 
All the cruelty and all the blessing 
all the stuff that is depressing
I wish I could sleep 
forever and finally deep
but I guess this world needs every light 
so I hope Iâ€™ll stay in pride 
I hope Iâ€™ll be always brave 
and love for all of us
will keep me save 

â€” In cold blood
