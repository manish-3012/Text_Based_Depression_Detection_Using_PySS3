In 3 months....In 3 months 

I will kill myself if I'm not better

Because in 3 months

It will be the second anniversary of my mother's death

It will have been two years since I fell from being a happy, smart, popular college student into a mess.

Things haven't changed. No matter how hard I try and reach where I was before I fail. 

So, in three months I'm not going to fail anymore. Because in three months, I'm going to be with my mom again. 

To whoever reads this, thanks for reading.
