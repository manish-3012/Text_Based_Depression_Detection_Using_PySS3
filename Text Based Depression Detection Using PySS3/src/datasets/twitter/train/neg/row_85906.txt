Burning and crashing. And I'm okay with it...I know my mental state is going to the shitter. My sleep schedule is fucked, drinking like a fish,pessimism,self harm, e.t.c... I know I should get help but I won't because of I keep doing this I know I'm gonna get worse and kill myself but that's what I want... To get worse so I don't chicken out this time... Call me self pitying. Idfc anymore. And even if I do get help, im just gonna get hospitalized and put on shitty meds and None of it helps. I've been going to a shrink since I was 12 , got better in some aspects but got worse in others. I wish I could die and no one would care. I know that's fucked, but I just wanna fade away. I'm tired of fighting. My life's not even that fuckin bad compared to some people and it makes me hate myself more... Fuck my life fam.
