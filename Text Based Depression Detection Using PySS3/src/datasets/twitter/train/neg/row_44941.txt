The dellemmaI want to kill myself right now, more than anything in the world, I haven't got any future, and my suffering will only get worse from here on out. I have a few obstacles though, if I die, whoever finds me will be scarred for life, and I don't really want that to happen. I don't know if anyone would really miss me, I am close with a few people , but the only person who would truly miss me is my mom, because of motherly love. The world *would* be better without me though, even if I am missed. I also might cause more problems for myself, such as brain damage or vegetablization, though my preferred method of hanging minimizes this risk. If I stay living the risk that I hurt more people with my death increases, but if I grow further from everyone and then kill myself, I won't be missed at all. I honestly wish I never existed, "to be or not to be" well the answer for me anyway it is not to be. I wouldn't suffer, I wouldn't cause anyone else to suffer, if I didn't exist the joy to suffering ratio would go up in the world. I wish I could be a martyr, that would really be something, or at least be killed accidentally instead of by myself, that would be a lot better. There's also the fact that I just don't got the balls to let myself die.

I just want to die, more than anything I want to be dead, but I can't do it.
