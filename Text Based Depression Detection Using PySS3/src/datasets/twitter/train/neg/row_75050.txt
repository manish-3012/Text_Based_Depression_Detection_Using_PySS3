Sudden bursts of suicidal thoughtsFor few days i am getting intense suicidal thoughts during day 
Mostly i am alone at home and i enjoy my solitude with anime , tv series or by playing overwatch but now i don't seem to enjoy any of these and  at night its hard to fall asleep cos all the mistakes i made get filled in my head and sometimes i don't sleep for 2 days straight amd sleep on 3rd day of exhaustion, and when i asked my father i want to visit a psychiatrist he said its your bad habits , you sleep fine on third day

I am sick of this if he can't let me go to a doc for sleep problems how can i open up about the thoughts where i want to kill my self and why people are against medications , coa they have side effects , i would gladly have side effects over this mental condition

In my head i keep on hearing this voice of you should die
And i can't keep going on like this

I failed most of my subjects in college and i was not able to get a job , i depend on my father for money

I am going give all of my things to my friends and on my next birthday ( its in August) i am leaving this world
