No driver's licence and unemployed. I don't see a future. I wish someone would kill me. (big rant)TL;DR: I've been unemployed since the day I was born, failed the driver's test a lot and I don't mind dying soon.

I'm attending college right now and things are okay there, but outside of that is a never ending stressful daily life. I'm applying to jobs here and there with a well reviewed resume but always have to deal with employers not giving me a call at all. All I want to do is get experience in any kind of part time job so I can add that to my resume. Isn't it funny that I'm willing to work hard but they don't want me? Plus, my dad has been very upset that I still don't have a job at my age. I've been also practicing driving a lot for about 3 years and failed the driving test 7 times. I talked about all of this several times to my dad but it seems that he doesn't empathize with any of what I say. At this point the thought of being killed isn't scary anymore. Thanks for taking your time and reading all of this. Sorry for my rant.
