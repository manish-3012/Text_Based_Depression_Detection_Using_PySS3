Wrote a note todayI wrote a note today, and I think the time is coming soon. Things do not get better. Sure maybe if youâ€™ve got some motivation and some passion. But the only thing Iâ€™ve got is apathy and that doesnâ€™t do shit in this world. Iâ€™m working on getting a gun for myself (shouldnâ€™t be too hard because this is America). Once Iâ€™ve got that I think Iâ€™ll finally have the balls to finish it. Just one short finger movement and itâ€™ll be done. Itâ€™s the same as just pressing a button and winking out of existence. Life is just a dream, and if youâ€™re having a nightmare, why spend any more time in it than you have to?
