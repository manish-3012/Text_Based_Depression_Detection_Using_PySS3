im donemy teacher has not failed to remind me that iâ€™m a failure and that i will never have a a future. she constantly harasses me, telling me iâ€™ll never do anything with my life, and iâ€™m starting to believe her. when she singled me out today, yelling at me and embarrassing me in front of the whole class, i thought about how everyone would react if one day i suddenly didnâ€™t show up. would she feel bad for pushing me over the edge? would she use me as an example to others as sheâ€™s done before? i guess weâ€™ll never know
