My fiance killed himself after a fight with me. How do I go on? How do I live with the guilt?No one understands what I am going through. They want to make it better by taking out a piece.  They want to say I couldn't have possibly had that impact on him. It's not my fault.  But that just means I wasn't that important to him.  how could I not have been important to him? I was his fiancee.  He said I was the only thing that gave him hope for the future.

Others tried to tell me he didn't kill himself. It was an accident.  But that's not true.  He had said he was going to, and he had the means and education to OD.  He did so in a way that didn't preclude organ donation.

Others said I couldn't have stopped him.  But again that means I wasn't important to him.  Maybe it's true, but there's a lot more I could have done. Could have tried.  But didn't.

I don't know how anyone lives with something like this. I feel responsible for all of the pain everyone in his life felt last weekend at the memorial I had to organize for all the people I had to call and notify.  I am not religious but I felt his presence, and it was not remotely comforting.  I feel am being haunted by an angry ghost. A ghost that is accusing me with every kind word anyone says about him.  One friend said the only person accusing me is me.  

I feel like I can never let anyone love me again because I now know I am not a good person. I am not a good partner. I have nothing to offer anyone.  I am utterly inadequate, and that is not depression or grief talking. That is just a fact.  I am on 2 antidepressants and a mood stabilizer.  It is the truth that I need to protect anyone I love from myself going forward.  It is the only way I can think of to placate this ghost.  The only thing that is keeping me from ending it is knowing that my loved ones don't deserve the kind of pain I have been experiencing.
