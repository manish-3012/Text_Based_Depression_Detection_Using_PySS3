Bad relationships, even worse mental healthSo I met this cute guy, he seemed interested in me, he was hot, and made me feel happy for the first time in awhile. We got to know each other and he told me his "interests". Neurophilia, furry cub porn, and other stuff. He had severe depression and is not in a good place right now. I want to leave him, but I'm scared he may hurt me or worse. These past 3 days have been total hell for me mentally. I've cut so much, too much. Can someone people help
