Some advice or insightHi, first time poster on reddit, I want to express myself openly without the fear of being judged or causing concern within my family, I am finding myself pondering more frequently lately about committing suicide, I can't seem to think of a single thing that I need to accomplish in life or have any satisfaction out of my existence, I certainly want to end it all but I'm to scared about the good possibility I would wake up and have to deal with the shit I have caused in the after math, like gettin fired for missing work or being on suicide watch, strange thoughts I know but I'm really stressing about it all, please don't hate and please offer your thoughts.
