Honestly, fuck me...I can't do anything right it seems, it's like I live from one embarrassing fuck up to the next. I can't speak to people (Including family) without freezing up and looking like a dipshit. I feel so out of touch and fucking boring. My self esteem is in the shitter and has led me to be walked on, and openly disrespected by my own family members. I've never had many friends and my attempts to make new ones are usually shot down being the oddball that I am. It's like they smell my lack of confidence and how weird I come across and run from me like the fucking plague....It sure doesn't aid things now that I'm losing my hair at 17, have acne, am short, and skinny. Social and physical issues aside, graduation is coming up soon and i really don't know what I want to do for a living. I'm under so much pressure and I don't know what the fuck to do.  I should just suck it up and eat a fucking bullet already, no one would care.
