How does one cope with surviving suicide?I really can't bear the circumstances right now. My family say they love me but their words regardless of what they really  mean often hurt me, and I am tired of feeling so powerless. So I tried to kill myself to escape the situation. They caught me and my exit failed. How do I proceed, when I don't want or care to? My mum is telling me that I am driving her mad. It's not my fault that I didn't die. They did not let me. 

How do I survive this hell now that I'm confined in the house with these people who will not try to understand me and constantly creates stressful situations for me? How do I deal with the shit storm that's about to be unleashed because they now discovered that I am actually seriously suicidal? The topic I was able to avoid because they thought I was just an attention whore.
