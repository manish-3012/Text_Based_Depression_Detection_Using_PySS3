I'm probably going to flunk university and I just had my first suicidal thought.First year university student here. I felt rushed into choosing a discipline for university come grade 12 so I ended up deciding I wanted to be an engineer. After hating first semester and doing incredibly poorly, I wanted to try and switch into education. The thing is, finals are coming and I don't think I can recover from last semester meaning I'm probably going to flunk out. Now lately I've been feeling fairly depressed, even having to get sleeping pills to help sleep. I have no clue what I will do with my life or if there will be any worth if I flunk out. I know how disappointed my family will be. I know I will probably never get to see most of my amazing friends I made this year. Now sitting here I thought, just for a second, that I could end it all if I took all of my zopiclone and now I'm sitting at my desk crying because I thought, even for a split second that ending my life was a good choice. I don't know what I want from this subreddit I just know that I feel like absolute shit right now.
