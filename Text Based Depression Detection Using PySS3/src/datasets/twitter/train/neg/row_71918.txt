I should just kill myselfI can't bloody crosspost from r/depression to here so whatever I'll just copy and paste.

I lost my support group. I lost my friends. I lost the only person who I thought actually loved me. I'm fucking up in school, I have my mom breathing down my fucking neck for this.. If I drop out, that's it. My insurance is out the fucking window.. I should just kill myself. I just might. No one gives a shit anyway.
