I have stuff that I canâ€™t complete in my classes and I feel like Iâ€™m gonna fucking kill myself if I canâ€™t get this shit done soonIâ€™ve been sitting here for 5 fucking hours on one assignment and I just canâ€™t fucking figure it out, I have like 11 assignments that I have to get done and I just canâ€™t. Iâ€™m going through such an unbelievable level of stress that I feel the only way to escape this is suicide. I would set myself on fire and die to escape this bullshit. I am stating this right now, if I fail my classes on friday I will fucking kill myself no exceptions. And maybe even if I do pass I will still kill myself because this world is such a miserable fucking place.
