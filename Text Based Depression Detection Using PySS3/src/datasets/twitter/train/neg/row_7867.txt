I want to die but I still want to life, everything is tiringI cried since noon, it's been 4 hours, my head is very hurt. I am isolating myself since 18 days ago, even before my country started locking everyone home. I forced myself to stop being a coward and start attending online lessons but I just got too stressed instead. I want to die right now. But I imagine myself in the future too sometimes.
