I feel like I have been falling down a bottomless pit my entire life.Ever since I was in elementary school, I have always thought that the world would be a better place without me. Every morning is a battle to get myself out of bed and to be able to pretend like everything is okay is slowly driving me insane. I feel as though no matter how hard I try I will never be good enough to do anything for anyone.

Although I wish I have, I have never really talked to any medical professionals about how I feel and less than a handful of people in my life really know what's going on with me. I do not wish to burden those around me as I know everyone has their own issues in life to take care of. Why should I cause them to worry about me just because I'm not feeling well?

Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get this off my mind in case anything happens.

Some days I want to just take a knife and stab it into my chest in order to end it all.
