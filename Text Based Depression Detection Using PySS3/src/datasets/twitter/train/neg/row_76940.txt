I hate myselfI hate myself so much. I'm so tired and exhausted from trying to learn to love myself so I can love my spouse properly. 

I'm exhausted. I feel so alone and broken. My marriage is failing miserably because I'm so afraid of abandonment I accused my spouse of doing everything to betray me and leave me to the point they fell out of love with me. 

I feel like I'm drowning and I'm tired of hurting them and myself. 

I really just want to die.
