can't find a reasonnaturally, a throwaway
I'm a gay 17 year old High School Senior and I can't function. I can't keep my grades up, and I haven't since middle school. It's a wonder I'm going to even graduate. I don't suppose the problem is that I'm stupid or lazy, I've just never cared. My entire life has been soaked in apathy regret and depression. There is no love, no passion, no drive for anything or anyone. my parents can't afford counseling anymore and I'm already up to 80 mg of Prozac a day. I just want the pain to stop. I want to stop lying to myself and to my friends and family.... I can't keep up this shell of myself. I can't go on... I just want to sleep.
