No titleHad a breakdown at the beginning of the year and attempted to kill myself. Since then my sister is constantly telling me to just do it and not fail this time. She keeps telling me that my family and my daughter will be better off without me and constantly tells me that I'm just faking my depression for attention. I don't know what to do anymore and I'm beginning to think shes right.
