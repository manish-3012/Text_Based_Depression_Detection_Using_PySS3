I'm giving myself 6 monthsI did write a long and winding post, but the more I got into it the more I realized how pointless it was. I know what I need to do and believe me, I'm trying. 

In 6 months I'll be 30. I'm doing my best to turn this around but I think passing this milestone will prove to be the catalyst, the push over the edge, for me to finally end it. I've thought about doing this for so long that it's now just matter-of-fact. I used to feel upset at imagining my death under the wheels of a train, now I feel nothing but inevitability.
