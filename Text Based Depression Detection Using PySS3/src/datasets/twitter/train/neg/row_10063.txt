My suicide pact partner killed herself todayShe finally killed herself without me.  Because I was too much of a coward - I kept putting it off, kept saying that today "didn't feel right", that I "wasn't ready".


I saw this coming - we became friends through our suicide pact, after all.  I knew that she would go someday but I had hoped that we would go together.  My heart aches and all I want to do is kill myself.  It feels like the right thing to do.


I'm going to miss our midnight talks of plans that we knew we would never carry out - long roadtrips, star gazing on the countryside, visiting all those Californian landmarks.  If the universe would give me another chance, if she somehow lived, I would find a way.  I would find the money and we would do everything we ever talked about.  God I wish she hadn't had done that.
