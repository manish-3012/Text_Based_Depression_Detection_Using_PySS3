I don't know what to do anymoreThis may be a long one so please read if you have time

ever since I was young I remember being attracted to boys, just couldn't put a label on it for the longest time, only recently did I realize I was gay. Gay, the one word no parent wants to hear from their son, I haven't come out to my dad and it eats away at me how I am going to have a life when I'm older, I have a lot of family issues and have cut my wrists for years now, only recently was I admitted to therapy and after spilling my guts to my therapist she sent me the psych ward and I almost had to stay overnight on suicide watch, since then I was diagnosed with depression and I can't find ways to be happy anymore, I know it will hurt my family if I do it but I just can't see a future for myself, my grades are horrible compared to my straight A national honors society brother, I have an 8% in math and 4 other F's. if I fail my dad will see me as a fuck up and I don't know how much longer that will last. Because of my sexuality, grades, and degrading comments from close family I'm not sure what I'm gonna do and have come very close to suicide only to be talked out of it by friends. I need advice or just a hug anything I'll take. thanks for reading.
