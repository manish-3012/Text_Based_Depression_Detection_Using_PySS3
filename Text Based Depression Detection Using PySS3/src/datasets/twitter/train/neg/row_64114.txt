I'm to the point where living doesn't seem like something I want to do and I'm trying to find the please place to end my life...I have thought about shooting myself in the shower will water running, so there isn't a mess for my family to clean up. 

I've also thought about the backyard where they wouldn't be anything significant to clean up.

Or, driving somewhere, parking, and shooting myself in my car and someone else would be likely to find me and my mother wouldn't have to personally see me.

Please help me. This is going to happen. I'm just trying to do it in the least disturbing way to so my parents don't necessarily have to see or deal with my body.

Where would you do it?
