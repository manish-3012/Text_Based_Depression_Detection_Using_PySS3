I'm in a terrible place and have no clue how to escapeThe place is called my life and ive fucked it up a countless number of times. My parents pay for me a place to live as long as I go to college but I've never been a day in my life. I tried to join the army and got chaptered out shortly after joining. I don't have anyone messaging me on any platforms what so ever besides one text from my family once in a blue moon. I had a girlfriend not too long ago but she left me for someone else and decided not to tell me about it, didn't even bother to call just a text saying bye...on my birthday. My daily routine consists of me going to work, lying to my family, and then playing stupid games online because I havent done anything better with my life. I know i'm probably better off than some people but every has been getting me real low lately, cutting my wrists with avid thoughts of suicide. Any advice would be appreciated, I feel like I've fucked myself for good and there's no hope left.
