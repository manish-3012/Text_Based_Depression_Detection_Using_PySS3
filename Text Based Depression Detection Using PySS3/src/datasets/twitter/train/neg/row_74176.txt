im tapping outmy gf is fucking someone else, after telling me 2 days ago when i said shes gonna find someone else "oh you dont know that". guess I called it didnt I? 

i've been begging her for attention. im less important to her than watching a football game that doesn't even involve the team she roots for.

im 3 months of "dating" we have never met face to face, then within 2 days she has this guy over.

i feel so insignificant. unloveable. unwanted. 

I begged her and pleaded to let us meet. i told her all our problems stem fropm not seeing each other. she agreeed. then still never let me see her. then this.

how  am i supposd to feel?

how woould you feel?
