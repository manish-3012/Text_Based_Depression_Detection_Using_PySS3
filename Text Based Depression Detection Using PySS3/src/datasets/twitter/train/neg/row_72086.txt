New Yearâ€™s EveItâ€™s New Yearâ€™s Eve. My family is out celebrating with friends. I backed out. I donâ€™t want to be around people and I donâ€™t want to celebrate. 

What I want is to die. I know that itâ€™s the depression. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to get me right now, but I know itâ€™s going to at some point. 

I have a wife who loves me more than she should. I have kids who are my everything. None of it makes life worth living. Iâ€™m not sure what would make me feel as though life was worth living. 

Iâ€™m afraid to live and Iâ€™m afraid to die. Iâ€™m not able to do it. Part of me is glad about that and part of me is ashamed about it. 

I make bad choices. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll continue to do that until it finally ends me like I want it to. 

Happy New Years everyone. Happy fucking New Years.
