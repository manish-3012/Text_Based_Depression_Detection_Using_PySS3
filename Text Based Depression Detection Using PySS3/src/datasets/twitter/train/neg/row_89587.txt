It feels like life is a constant stream of losses with rare victories.If it was a game, I would have quit by now.

I desperately want to be happy. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. It just gets worse. I am the problem.

I can't win. Unless an angel appears and rewires my brain to make me a good person, I can't win. There's just no fix to all my problems. Sure, I can take meds to semi-fix problems but that also makes a bunch of new ones.

I've tried everything. I've tried to fix my social anxiety. It just doesn't *fix* itself by my doing. I legitimately made the effort to make friends last quarter. But even when I'm out having fun I still can get hit with a wave of doubt and anxiety. And there's still a billion other problems.

And what do I win if I bare through all my problems? Fucking nothing.
