I just want to claw this out of me.I am a gay guy living with his very conservative and homophobic family. I decided to try dating because I was so lonely. I met this guy and he seemed so perfect. For a short time in my life I was truly happy. A few months into the relationship I come to find out he wasnâ€™t honest with me. He had and std and chose not to tell me about it until after we were intimate. He told me he forgot but I donâ€™t know if I believe him. I now need surgery to help me treat it and I may have to deal with it for the rest of my life. My bf wants me to move in with him but I donâ€™t know if I want him anymore. He makes me so happy but he lied to me. I just keep having visions of me driving somewhere remote and shooting myself in the head. I donâ€™t want to be in this situation anymore and I honesty donâ€™t think my family would want me after they find out. I donâ€™t know what to do.
