I almost killed myself last nightI was broken up with in July and I can't move on. I loved him with all of my heart being back in the area we used to live brought up all of the feelings of unbearable loss. The humiliation, the failure, the loneliness, the emptiness. I haven't enjoyed my life in a long time. I'm coming to terms with the fact that the only thing that I wanted in life, love, will never happen for me. In the face of all of this I wanted to kill myself, planned it all. Spoke to a suicide hotline in a last ditch effort to try and convince myself not to. The only thing that kept me here was falling asleep on the phone with that person. I keep walking around today thinking "I shouldn't be here, I don't want to be here"
