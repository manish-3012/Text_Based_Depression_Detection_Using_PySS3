I don't know what to do.I need help. My mom has been really nice to me and my sister like a typical mom would be. Today was different after she got off the phone with her friend, I did something stupid and I do not want to talk about it. She just exploded and started ranting about everything. I've had this happen to me before with my biological dad ,but I always had somewhere to hide or to cover myself from reality. My step dad is at work and I do not know what to do. My mom is crying and I can't take it anymore. I am guilty of my wrongdoings but for the first time I fell horrible about myself. I am crying. I do not know what to do. I tried contacting my biological dad but he's still at work. I feel like this is all my fault and I need to end it. Reddit help me please.
