most efficient, surefire way (?)i know you arent supposed to suggest things in the comments so dont. but i wonder, what is the best way for me. i am looking for something 

- quick
- efficient
- clean (example, not by train because my body would be blown to bits)

it does not have to be painless. just no way for me to back out during. fast. 

i do not have a gun or it would have been done by now. i might be too nervous to acquire one. 

pills, i have heard, do not really have a high success rate and there is too much time for me to possibly call for help. 

hanging is a possibility but i could only do it in a way that would allow me to save myself. i already tried this and was not successful (obviously). 

carbon monoxide or whatever? put my car in the garage, let it run? would whoever opened the garage next be in danger? i wouldnt want to hurt my friends/family. again, i know i cant get advice here. just rhetorical/asking out loud. 

im tired. im empty. i miss my ex CONSTANTLY. i am an obsessive dumbass. and everyone else would be better off without me. they dont want to admit it but it would be true. no more mess, no more worries, no more waste. just memories. fade away
