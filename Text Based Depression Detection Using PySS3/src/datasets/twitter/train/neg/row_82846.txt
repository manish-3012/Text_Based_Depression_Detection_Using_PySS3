Worst night of my lifeMy mind is racing and I need to put this out somewhere so I guess I will here. Last night, I took 2 ibuprofen around 12 at noon, 2 again at 4:00 pm, 20 assorted painkillers around 8:00 pm, and 10 more 30 mins later. Some of the pills were 500 mg, and I took at least 11 of those. I overdosed, and am still feeling the consequences hours later. It was a fatal dosage, I should have died, but Iâ€™m here, on the bathroom floor numb, and just threw up twice probably going on my third soon. I feel like shit, but not as bad as I did a few hours ago. My head was pounding, everything was blurry, I couldnâ€™t focus, my speech was slurred, I was nauseous, my nose was burning, I was stumbling everywhere I walked and my body lost all of its strength. Iâ€™m still pretty weak now and have a stomach ache and feel nauseous, but the headache and nose thing is gone, which really was the worst out of all of it. I regret it all. I wish I had either not taken anything at all, or done more, so I didnâ€™t have to suffer, just be done. But now Iâ€™m just still here, feeling like Iâ€™m going to pass out. Just threw up again. Donâ€™t know why I did this, if I were to kill myself, my plan was to take a shit ton of painkillers and slit my wrists, not this. This came out of nowhere too, Iâ€™ve been pretty mentally stable for the past couple months. I feel like that all just vanished, I feel like I did a year ago, desperate to just die. I have so much good things going on right now, but I feel like none of that exists anymore. All that exists is my destructive thoughts and death. What is wrong with me.
