Scared to get help Alright,so for most of 2019 ive been feeling very depressed and suicidal. I have many self injury scars all over my arms, legs, thighs, waist, almost everywhere. But i dont now why i feel suicidal. Ive wanted to check in to the ER, but when they ask me why, and I tell them I honestly dont know why i want to kill myself, theyll just send me back home. I dont know what to do :( i self harm almost every day
