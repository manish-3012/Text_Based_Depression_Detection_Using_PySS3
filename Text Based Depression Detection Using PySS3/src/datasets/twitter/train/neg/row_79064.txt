Can i please talk to someone? I kinda need help or advice please.Hi i am 13 F and i have ADHD and Autism and Schizophrenia and i take medication for it.  

My parents only care about my brother. He is 15 and he has nothing wrong with him and he gets good scores in school and he gets rewards and things and he gets lots of hugs and things and i really really try my hardest at school i really promise and i get the highest scores i can and they are still really low and i canâ€™t get better at it. My brother bullys me and he is mean he calles me names and tells me to kill myself sometimes and he calls my psycho because i hear voices and see things and i have a friend who keeps me company when i am lonely sometimes but the voices can be mean and say bad things to me and make me feel sad or hurt myself. I get bullied at school alot and they say the same and they call me names because i am slower in class then most people and i need extra help and someone sits next to me and helps me. I do hurt myself on purpose alot and i just have and i put a bandage on it because it was bleeding bad i think and it hurts. I have taken a lot of my medication tonight and it was almost a full bottle of clozapine and lots of ritalin but i donâ€™t know how much. I think i took almost 50 clozapine and 10 ritalin i think 20 minutes ago and i want to run away from home badly. I might do it now i think whilst my parents and brother are asleep because its late its almost midnight. My tummy is starting to hurt a bit and my arms hurt where i hurt myself. 

This is a new account because i donâ€™t want my brother or my parents to find out that i did this they will get angry.

I am sorry if this was too long to read im sorry. I tried to read it but i canâ€™t focus good i am sorry i really promise.
