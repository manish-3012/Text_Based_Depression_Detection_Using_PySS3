I haven't felt this alone in a long time.My fiance didn't want to talk tonight, not uncommon.  he's more and more distant these days.  one of his friends died so he wanted to be alone.  that's fne.

I just don't have anyone to talk to, made worse by the fact it's almost 2am on a school night.

I feel so soul crushingly alone, trapped in y mind with PTSD flashbacks and held back from csa.\]\]

I just want to get out.  It would be the third suicide attempt this month alone.  I'm starting therapy, but the startup is slow.
