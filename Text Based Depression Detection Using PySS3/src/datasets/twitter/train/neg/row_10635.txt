I was here almost 4 years ago. I'm ready to call it quits.I always hoped that with hard work and doing good things for people that I could be happy. I just end up feeling like no matter what I do I'll always just be weak. I am beginning to lose interest in everything in my life. I barely pay attention to my friends. I barely pay attention at work. I went from someone who truly cared about making a difference to just wanting to die every day. The person I care about the most is starting to distance herself from me. I find myself being alone, and that's the one thing I'm always scared of. I'm afraid of what I'm going to think. I'm afraid that all I'm here for now is to just be good for people, and never myself. I don't deserve to be happy. I just want to die. I haven't been happy for the longest time and I'm always being used. I don't know what a real friend is anymore. Why am I here? Why do I hope that things will get better when my life has been going no where but down. I'm nobody, and that's the way it'll always be. I don't want to hurt myself, but if my life is going to continue this way then I just can't do it anymore. I feel like I'm going to lose my mind very soon, and there's nothing I can do to stop that. I need help. Please.
