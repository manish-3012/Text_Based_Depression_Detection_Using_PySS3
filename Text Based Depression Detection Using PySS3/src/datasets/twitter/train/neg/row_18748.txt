Getting closer each day.Things are getting really bad for me. I have no one. I feel close to nothing for my family. I can't enjoy things anymore.  
  
About three months ago, I lost the most important person of my life. The only person that has succeeded in making my life worthwhile, the first time I've ever been happy. The contrast between then and now is so clear and comes back to haunt me every night no matter how well I escape it during the day. It torments me, keeps me from sleep.  
  
I've been trying really hard to find a person to connect with in posts such as this one:

because I know that's what I need.  
I've come to realise that it's of no use. I'm not interesting or entertaining enough to catch anyone's attention, I just bore or pull people down. Other than that there's just the charity workers, who insist on going into why I feel the way I do, and even though I open up all I get is shit thrown at me, making me feel even more useless.  
  
As of right now I'm completely out of people, and I've given up.  The worse I get, the harder it gets to connect to someone.  
  
The only reason I'm not dead yet is because I'm scared of the pain or a failed attempt, and also to not traumatize my younger siblings. But at this point, I'm getting close to ignoring those things.  
  
I don't know why I'm writing this. I know exactly what outcome it'll have, and it's precisely what I don't want. I guess I just wanted to vent.
