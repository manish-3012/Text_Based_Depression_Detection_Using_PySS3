Im trying something newIm borderline Suicidal. I wont do it, i know its all temporary struggles... but i feel like people don't get it. i have days i just feel defenseless and non progressive. its lonely. i dont need someone to fix me... just need some time to get thru it. 

 i wouldnt be surprised if theres tons of people here who needs someone to understand like me. 

im an incredibly supportive person. i am very empathetic. ive been thru a lot of very bad situations so i can relate. 

So... im hoping that maybe by saying hey, im here if u need someone to talk to... maybe i can be there for someone. In turn i hope that helps me too. im only one person but if anyone needs to just talk to a total stranger who probably has been thru some similar things, im here.
