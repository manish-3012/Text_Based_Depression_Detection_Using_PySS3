How does someone overcome hopelessness?I feel so inadequate, that every decision I make is wrong. No matter what I do, I am unfit to be a part of society. My thinking is corrupt. I am a self-sabotager, I think I secretly want to be miserable. The hopelessness that I talk about is the homeless, living under a bridge, that despite my best efforts I have failed at life. Unless youve been there, you might not understand the level of despair of being at rock bottom. I have no money, no job, I can barely take care of myself. Maybe ending it is a solution. This body of mine, that I've severly damaged from drug abuse. My inability to eat, not because I'm anorexic, its because my anxiety is so bad I cant put food in me. the fallout from this is malnourishment. People tell me, "oh I wish I had  your problem of not having an appetite". I tell them no, you do not want what is the root cause. You do not want the severe depression/anxiety. But HOPE. I live between 2 things, Hope and Fear. Hope that things will get better and fear that I'm too fucked up in the head to do anything with it.
