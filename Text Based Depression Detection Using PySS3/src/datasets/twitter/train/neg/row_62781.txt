I might be gone soonIm a straight 16 year old male. My first kiss and sexual experience was with a man because i was desperate for some sort of sexual contact. It happened about 6 months ago. Within the last month its really taken over my life and the moment haunts and disgusts me. It was disgusting yet i did it. I was dumb and horny. I have nothing against homosexuals but as a straight male i dont know if i can live my life knowing i have participated in a sexual gay experience. I dont know what to do except kill myself. This may sound over exaggerated and some people will just make fun of me and call me gay. I can affirm that im straight but i dont think anyone will respond due to it being a weird situation. Life was all good before it happened but now im in the darkest place possible and i feel so alone. The earth might be without me very soonðŸ˜“ðŸ˜­
