wow i thought i stopped cutting but now i did it again on my arms and its more deeperi woke up from my sleep at 1 am with EXTREME anxitey like i really wanted to vomit
my head hurts so damn much i cant feel anything anymore , like im carrying a heavy thing inside my head
and my stomach really hurts makes me want to vomit , so i got to the bathroom trying to vomit , didnt work
so i pulled my knife out and i started cutting , i actually bleed more than before im really anxious im shaking and crying but after that i feel a bit better
my sick feeling in my stomach and my anxiety got a bit better now
because i destarcted my head from ((feelings of ENDING IT ALL)) and now im a bit relaxed
i was hearing my mom talking shit about me and how bad i am and i got super anxious
whenever someone talk about me i get really worked up
wtf is wrong with me
im just really mentally and physically
exhuasted ....to the point i know i wont be fixed 
no matter what happens in the future 
good or bad
i simply wont wait and wont give A SINGLE FUCK
