To nervous/anxious to talk to people.I want to talk to someone about my problems and such but I am too nervous to do so. Also it isnt just being scared to talk but when ever I think about it I feel weird and awkward about it. Its hard to explain what the feeling is. Thoughts on how to go about  this?
