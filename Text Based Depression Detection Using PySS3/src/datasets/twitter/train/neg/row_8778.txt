Okay idk if Stuttering is a disorder or disability but it fucking sucks ass...Idk how can one navigate this world with disorders/disabilities it really fucking sucks



It controls every sec of my life and has caused me to have social anxiety because I fear if other would judge me or family as well. 

It makes me depressed to the point that I just donâ€™t want to get out of bed and live anymore itâ€™s fucking embarrassing and debilitating. The issue is that nobody is really educated on the topic of Stuttering and only learn it frm cartoons and bullshit movies. And thereâ€™s a lot more to Stuttering than u think 

Joe Biden has a stutter and is some one I can definitely look up too
