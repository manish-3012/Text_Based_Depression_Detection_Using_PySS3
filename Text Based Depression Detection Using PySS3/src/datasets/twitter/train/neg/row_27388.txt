please help...Hi, i posted this on Yahoo Answers as well but i need all the help i can get, so here goes. i am a 17 (very soon 18) year old guy and i am severely depressed. Twice a week i go and see a therapist for my depression, anxiety disorder (wich makes it extremely difficult for me to go out and live a normal life) and ADD but i doesnt seem to help me at all. I have been doing this for almost 2 years now and i dont see anything getting better, in fact its just been getting worse lately. I have a girlfriend and i love her so extremely much, but about this time last year she cheated on me with a guy she had just met. I was so broken...and i still am to this day. I just cant seem to get it out of my head that she would do something like that and i have lost so much sleep over it, you have no idea. I also failed school last year so i didnt get to go to school this year because my grades were too low. (I got a 1.8 and the maximum is 6.0) and i really need someone to help me really really badly. And with all this going on my family has gone to sh*t because my mother is an alcoholic who refuses to get help. So does anyone have any advise? My life has been a living hell the last couple of years and i am planning to take my own life...is there any reason not to? 
I am sorry if i didnt spell everything correct, i have diplopia so its difficult for me to write and read.
