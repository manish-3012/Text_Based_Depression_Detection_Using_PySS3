I've completely lost itI've never had it hit so hard before. With me, I could go a month without any 'bad' feelings, but as soon as they hit they hit hard. I don't know why. I have a grasp at why I feel so, so bad, but honestly I'm not sure.
I don't know if depress can run in the family, but all of my family has had it at one point, even with my sister's attempted suicide.

Now I have no idea why I feel this way, but I do. At it is so terrible. This is the worst feeling I have every had, I've never cried so much before. I don't know what I can do to stop it.

Right now I'm sitting on bed. I was about to go to sleep when, for some reason, I remembered how terrible life was and how awful it all is. As soon as I have these feelings, I have to tell you or else I'm scared I'll do something regrettable. Please don't let me do anything stupid. I promise, when I snap out of this fit I'll do my best to help others with his terrible feeling. Just talk me out of whatever I try to do.

I am literally trying to scream, but I can't make a sound aside from a gurgle of sobs. I hate this so much.
