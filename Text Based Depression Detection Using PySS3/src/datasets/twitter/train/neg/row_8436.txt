Hopeless.Itâ€™s just pointless. I donâ€™t see a happy future for myself. Iâ€™ve told my mom that I have suicidal thoughts and have wanted to kill myself. And she brushes me off and says things like, â€œYou donâ€™t mean thatâ€ and â€œYou just have to think more positively.â€ Iâ€™m 19 and have a car now, itâ€™s not like when I wanted to kill myself in highschool and didnâ€™t have a means to. There is a bridge 5 minutes away from the house. And I can drive there and jump off and no one would be able to stop me before it was too late. By the time they realized I was gone, I would already be gone. Iâ€™ve thought about it every night for a couple of months now. And have had some nights where I am so certain that thatâ€™s what I want to do that I just tell myself to go to sleep and make it just one more day. I love my dog please help :(
