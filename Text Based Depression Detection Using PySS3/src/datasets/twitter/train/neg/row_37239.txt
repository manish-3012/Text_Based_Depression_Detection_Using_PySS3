Itâ€™s supposed to be my cake day tomorrowBut I just want to hide all day. I donâ€™t deserve anything, not even my familyâ€™s time. I believe Iâ€™m a selfish, manipulative, and unreliable person.  I wake up everyday to the wish that I died in my sleep.

My mom and some of the people who still talk to me keep asking me what I want to do tomorrow. They donâ€™t understand why I donâ€™t want to celebrate, but I canâ€™t articulate how much I hate myself into words that wonâ€™t hurt their feelings.

How am I supposed to celebrate 23 years of wasted space?
