I can't take it anymore.It's 7 a.m. in my country and I have spent the last 4 hours crying non stop because I hate my life so much. I'm 20 and already feel like I'm missing so much in life. I can't pick the carreer I want to do and already dropped out of two because I can't seem to find any reasons or motivation to even go out of my room half of the day. I feel like my family knows I'm a failure and just don't expect anything from me; they are most of the time good to me and always tried to be comprehensive, but I can't help to think that I'm such a burden to them. I fantasize about dying everyday but I can't break my family's heart in that way, I love them so much. While I cried I thought of escaping from my city and hope for my family to forget me so I can die somewhere. I'll sleep on it if I can and decide later if I really want to go somewhere else and leave my family behind. I don't know, I just feel more and more hopeless everyday and it feels like it will never stop. 

I'm sorry, I needed to vent. I hope everyone is having a not so bad day.
