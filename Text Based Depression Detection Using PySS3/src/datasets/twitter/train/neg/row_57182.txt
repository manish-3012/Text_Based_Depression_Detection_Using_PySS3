I can't go back homeMy dad doesn't love me, even though he says he does. I am scared to go home. He doesn't respect me. Everytime I try to explain it to him he brushes it off as being lazy. He doesn't respect me, he doesn't use the right pronouns and name on purpose. Everything he does is to establish dominance, to put me in my place. My room isn't clean, he's been taking away shit from me to try to convince me to do it, and he won't hear "any of that depression crap". He tells me if I clean my room I won't be depressed anymore. He's taken the things that make me happy. I'm scared he's gonna take away my medication. I'm 18, I'm not in a financial position to move out. There is no place I can go.. I deserve respect and I'm not given it. He won't listen to me, he's the reason I have depression. I wanna fucking kill myself so that way he will realize how he didn't do shit to help. I hate him.
