Iâ€™m so tired...Iâ€™m so tired. Of everything. Iâ€™m tired of feeling this way. Iâ€™m tired of being the burden. I think about just ending it, every day. Spend my free time looking up what in my medicine cabinet will get it done quicker. 
And then I look at my dog. Who wouldnâ€™t understand why I didnâ€™t wake up. And I think about my friends, who will never have their 4th party member on our games, and would forever have to deal with a rando. I think about my dad, who would have to come home to an empty drive way, a quiet home. I think about how my best friend promised me he wouldnâ€™t attend my funeral if I killed myself. All of that should be enough to snap me out of it, bring me back to reality, if even just for a moment. But itâ€™s not. 

I try to look at myself in this different light. Try to improve myself. I go to the gym constantly, trying to reshape everything. Just to get disgusted and impatient. I try to look at the brighter side of things, smile more often, but I fucking canâ€™t. I write, a lot. I write all sorts of shit. Poetry, mostly. For a minute it was helping, made a video and everything, submitted to a contest. But after a while, it just started to feel like a chore. 

And I get this all just seems like the ramblings of some sad fuckin dude, but I donâ€™t know what else to do. I canâ€™t go back to the hospital, no matter how much I want to. I canâ€™t talk to anyone about it because I know I already make them uncomfortable, so I donâ€™t want to bring up suicide over morning coffee. 

Iâ€™m terrified to get close to someone, try to be in a relationship. Iâ€™m terrified to have kids on the chance of passing along my fucking genes. Iâ€™m at the end of my rope, and as edgy as this is going to be to say, that rope is slowly starting to materialize. I donâ€™t want it to. 
I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even posting this. 

Iâ€™m tired of crying every night before bed. Tired of crying when I wake up. Tired of crying in the fucking shower. Tired of putting on the mask that Iâ€™m okay when I get to work. Iâ€™m just...fucking tired. 

And Iâ€™m sorry.
