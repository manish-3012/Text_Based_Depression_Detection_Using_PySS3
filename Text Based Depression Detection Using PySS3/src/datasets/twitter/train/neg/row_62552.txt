I hope you all find peace.Look, I don't know much of anything. I'm stupid as fuck. I can't fully relate to anyone on here. We all have different lives and circumstances. Things we've done or things we've endured. I just see all of you posting and hope you all find peace. Whether we decide to check out or keep going, we do what we have to. I don't see weakness in any of you. Life is so complicated. So much pain, confusion, anger, sorrow... It's designed to be against us. So many are just numb. We're frail. Most of us just want love. To feel something positive. To stop the agony. People (not all) on here really care. Even if they don't know what to say, they care. In the end, just know that I want you all to find peace.
