I can't handle it anymore; I just want to die.I'm an extremely poor trans man with medical issues. I'm also extremely ugly and that makes things even harder. I have a wonderful partner that loves me, but I have no idea how he manages or how long he can possibly tolerate it. I can't do customer/food service type work because of my medical issues, and that's why I'm just a full time student. I'm constantly working to try to keep my GPA between 3.5 and 4.0 to maintain grant funds for rent, bills, etc. 

We've been starving for over a week because my partner's bank info was stolen, and the bank said they could refund it, but that it would take half a month or so. We don't receive any grants until the 12th, so we're just wasting away. Yes I have tried the food bank in our area, and they think a small bag of already rotting fruit and a loaf of stale bread would be enough for us for a week. 

I can't even seek good emotional or mental help; I've tried calling hotlines and they either keep me on hold until the call drops or they never even answer. I've tried seeing an "emotional counselor" (that's what my insurance will pay for) but she's extremely dismissive of my feelings and wants to rush me out the door so that she can see the next person early. I'm on antianxiety/antidepressants medication, but they literally have me on the smallest starting dose and she refuses to consider that I might need it increased. 

I'm afraid of someone finding out how emotionally fragile I am right now and having me sent somewhere, because I would be dropped from all my classes and lose my apartment bc I'd be unable to pay rent. The facilities in my area are also infamous for poor sanitation, inhumane treatment of patients and so on.
