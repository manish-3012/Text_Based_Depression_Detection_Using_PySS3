Trail OffItâ€™s funny how your whole life was lived for someone, and even to your death you are still worried about them. Iâ€™m done hurting. I just want to finally take a rest. To go someplace where all I have to worry about is myself- and in death I shall find it. 

Itâ€™s funny how your mind goes. Curating scenarios long after your death. If I could leave enough money to handle my grave and all the services needed, I would, so I guess the golds are going there. At least thatâ€™s one less burden and worry theyâ€™ve got to carry. 

To my friends, please donâ€™t hate me. I removed myself hoping youâ€™d slowly forget me, and because I cannot be there for you anymore. I could not even be there for myself anymore. 

To my brothers, please forgive me, but most importantly forgive them. I have no more energy to smile and pretend I can carry it all, but it is of no oneâ€™s fault but mine. 

To my ex, please forgive me. Your forgiveness means more because I know I have hurt you the most. I have loved you, but in doing so I have dealt you insufferable pain. I do not deserve to be in your life. Go on and be the greatest man you can be, and Iâ€™ll be cheering for you in eternity. 

To my baby brother, you mean everything. I wonâ€™t do it for a while because I canâ€™t afford to break your heart this young. Youâ€™re the reason Iâ€™m holding out for so long. But when I finally do, stay as sweet as you are now, and always remember that everyone has goodness in them. I just burnt mine out. 

Please donâ€™t hate each other. Please donâ€™t hate me.
