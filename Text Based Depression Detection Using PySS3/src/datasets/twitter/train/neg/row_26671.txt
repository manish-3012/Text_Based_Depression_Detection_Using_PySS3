Can someone talk to me for a little? I want to die but can't bring myself to do it.I've been thinking a lot about how I want to die, I have someone I love (as a family member type way). I don't think I'm suicidal yet have the constant thought in my head that I'd be better off dead, is this normal? I've tried before and it was the worst mistake I made, calling someone to save me that is, I've known her for around 3 months, maybe less, maybe more. She's kind and don't quite understand her when she says she loves me, I don't know how to express that back (in a family way), I'll say I love her back, but in a way it feels fake? I'm so confused and sad, I can't tell what I'm feeling anymore and just want someone to take my mind off of it for the time being.
