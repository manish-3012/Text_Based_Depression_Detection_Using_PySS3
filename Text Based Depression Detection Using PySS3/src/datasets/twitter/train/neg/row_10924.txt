I just don't want to be judged.I am suicidal, I know that. I struggle to express myself with words. It drives me insane, it has also driven away the only person I've have loved and loved me back. I apologize but the next few paragraphs will read like they were written by a mad man (because they were).

The breakdown of my relationship is going to ruin me. It's all my fault that she hates me. I treated her badly, by being the way that I am. I promised so much but didn't deliver. It makes me so angry at myself that I wasted her time. She is a wonderful person who deserves better than me. I was emotionally abusive, confiding in her about how I saw myself. Then putting myself on the line when she couldn't handle it, just to make her stay. I'm sorry I did this to you. I still love you, but I know it wasn't enough.

Even writing this down to a bunch of strangers on the internet feels embarrassing. None of you know me or will ever find out who I am, but I still have that feeling of being judged, which I will take very personally. Even from internet strangers.

This isn't a plea for attention, or even a plea for help. I don't really know what this is. Maybe it is my last entry into the internet. Who knows?

I don't feel like committing suicide now. But the urged are getting so much more intense, they are becoming more real. Ive sought help in the past, but it wasn't for me. I struggle to be honest with myself, I know these facts about myself, that I do have very real issues. But I ignore them, I refuse to confront myself, I prefer to take the route of hiding and distracting myself till the feelings go away. Telling myself I'm making this up for attention.

I'm caught in a loop, I know there are resources out there for me. But I don't want anyone to know that I am the way I am.

For anyone who read this I apologize for dragging you into my mess. I really felt like I needed to write this, even it if doesn't make any sense.
