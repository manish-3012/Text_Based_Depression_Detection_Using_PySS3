Pros and cons.Life - pros: I get to sleep, I get to shower, I get to brush my teeth. These feel nice.

Life - cons: I have to see other people, I am told my suicidal ideation is unnatural and wrong, I have to dress presentably, I have to eat, I have to talk to others, I have to look others in the eye, I have to lie about suicidal thoughts that plague my mind every second so I don't get tossed into a shitty treatment facility.

Death - pros: the "life cons" list ceases to exist, I'll no longer think, I'll no longer feel guilt.

Death - cons: I'll immediately be labeled as weak and selfish ( though, admittedly, this doesn't matter much because I won't feel guilty about it)


Let's face it, everyone dies. I think I'm gonna buy a firearm after work today after destroying most traces of my life. I've been hospitalized before, and I don't know how background checks work, so I hope I can obtain one. I'll be burning my journals and anything else I've ever written. Research indicates a shotgun to the skull is the most effective method of suicide, with the lowest chance of failure. I want to do it right the first time. I think a simple shotgun runs around 200-300. I can afford that (seeing as I won't have to worry about debt). Things are looking up as death approaches. I'll probably keep posting on this subreddit just for kicks while this plays out.

I apologize for my thoughts jumping around. I may not be the easiest to understand. If you have questions or concerns, I may get to them, I may not. I'm gonna take a shower now and put on a big fake smile for work today. Planning this out actually made me feel a little better.
