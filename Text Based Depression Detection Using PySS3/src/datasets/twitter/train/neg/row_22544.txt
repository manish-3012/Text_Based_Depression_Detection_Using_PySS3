Thank youIf it weren't for this community I would be dead. A few years back I was struggling with a litany of problems. I had been dealing with a violent break-up, struggling with depression and medication and I was at the height of my alcoholism. All I wanted to do was die. But somehow I wandered in here, and I told people what I was feeling, and how scared and defeated I felt and what I wanted to do. 

I expected what we all expect from the internet. I expected hundreds to tell me to do it, or worse, only one. Instead, something beautiful happened to me. People I didn't know chose to care about me. They told me stories and offered support and resources that were more useful to me than any that had been offered by hospitals or government that I'd previously forced to interact with. 

Since that time my family has let me come home, I've found and held a stable job and used it to pay for half (so far) of a Bachelors in secondary education which would allow me to pursue my dream of teaching writing to teenagers (watched dead poets society too many times). As well as countless other advantages and leaps that all started from well-meaning people on the internet. 

My life was shit. I was homeless, helpless and hopelessly addicted and I had given up a long time ago. But this place, this place where people care unconditionally because they know exactly what you're talking about, is most definitely the thing that saved my life and allowed me to make it into what it is today. 

Listen to the people here. They love you. I love you. This will turn around and no one should have to die from it. I thought I had to and for the last five years I've never been happier to be wrong.
