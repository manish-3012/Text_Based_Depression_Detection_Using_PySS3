It seems like it is riding a bike. You fall, and fall, until you make it right.So, I have been trying to kill myself for a while now. I have an important rule: no pain. Period. So, I tried pills. Three times. Unfortunately I am strong as a fucking bull. I have been asleep for three days straight just to wake up in the third day. Bummer. 
Tried cutting my wrist. But since I hate physical pain I couldn't go deep enough. 
A few moments ago I tried tying a hose to the exhaust pipe on my car, but I used a stupid hose that melted and didnt work. 
So, tomorrow i will be buying a decent pipe.
