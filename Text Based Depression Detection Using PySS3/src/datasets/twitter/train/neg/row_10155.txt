Back again.Maybe if I could do something constructive I'd feel better about myself. I can't even call myself a "writer" anymore because I never write. I never do anything but work and sit and think about all the things I'm doing wrong.

My friends are done with me. If I didn't have a job I probably wouldn't even get out of bed. And I can only type this because it's anonymous. Imagine how mocked I'd be if I actually said any of this to someone's face. I can't even tell my psychiatrist because I'm too fucking embarrassed to be this way.

Time for another eight hours of moping and listening to music and being a stupid disagreeable fuck. Then I'll get over it, go to bed, and start the whole thing over tomorrow morning. What a way to live.
