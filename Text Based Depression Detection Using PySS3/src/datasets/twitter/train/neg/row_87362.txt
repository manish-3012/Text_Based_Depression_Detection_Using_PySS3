So tired of being depressedA few times a week I get so tired of being depressed that I just want to kill myself. This is one of those moments. I hate seeing people happy, especially couples. All of my relationships have ended terribly, with me cowing in fear at my abusive Ex after I finally couldn't take any more and broke up with them.

I know I'm not supposed to derive my happiness from another person but I feel so lost. I was miserable with my Ex and I'm miserable without her. I hate her actually. I've been miserable this entire year. I'm still relatively young but I'm wasting whatever youth I have left. 

I have a few friends, but I feel like I will just bring them down if I spend time with them. I want to go out and do more social things but I feel crippled by anxiety. I can't afford a therapist. I live in a foreign country, and if I returned to the USA I'd have to live with my parents.

This feeling will pass and come back later. I just want to die right now.
