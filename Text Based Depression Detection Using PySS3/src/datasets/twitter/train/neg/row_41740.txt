Is this wise?Earlier today, for the first time in my life I tried to kill myself. It didn't work, obviously and I'm in the process of getting help but i missed a full day of work and a few other obligations. My question to you is, should I make it public that I tried to kill myself? On one hand it would explain my absence and there is a lot of freedom to be found in the truth. On the other hand it might make some people (specifically my coworkers) uncomfortable. It might put them in an awful situation. What should I do? Has anyone here done what I'm considering? how did it work out?
