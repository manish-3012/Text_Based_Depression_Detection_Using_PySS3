FacebookOh man, I just reminded myself why I don't even bother going on Facebook anymore.

Here I am, 41 living back at home with my elderly parents after losing my career because of my ocd and abusive ex wife, with no job and debilitating ocd and anxiety. Then I happen to check Facebook and there's my old high school friends Jane and Greg, happily married with kids and well off. It's hard to swallow when neither of them was half as smart, hard working or principled as me back then.

Now I'd be too humiliated with myself to even meet them for a drink I'm such a loser.
