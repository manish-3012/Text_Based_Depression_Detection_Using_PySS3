Is it even worth trying anymore?I honestly don't know what to do anymore.  I feel like such a burden and I can't make a decision on anything I do.  I've been faking my happiness for so long that my best friend didn't even notice how depressed I've been, and now I feel so lonely.  I have no true friends, my grades in school suck.  I've tried so hard recently to bring my grades up, but it seems that i can never get them to where I want.  I told myself I'd never let my depression get in the way of school, but here it is.  I've asked my mom for help three times now, each resulting in nothing, and for the last time she told me that a massage would help it.  I'm a sophomore now, and I don't want to live past junior year.  I have no true interests.  Although I am in a lot of things (Club sports, school sports, and school band/orchestra), I can't see myself having a future in anything at all.  I don't know what to do, and I have breakdowns almost daily, if not more.  I just want to give up and stop living
