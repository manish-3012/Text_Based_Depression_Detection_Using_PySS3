One last postI've posted here 4 or 5 times I lost track. I haven't got better. My mother is still a narcissist. My dads still barley ever around and even when he is he has anger issues. My friends would still be so much better off without me. Still nobody loves me. I'm still a horrible person.I'm still lonely. I'm still sad. I still have anxiety. I'm still a ugly waste of space. It's still my fault I was molested. Most of all I'm still so tired of this. Sunday 2:00AM. I'm going to take a gun and put a bullet in my skull. The week is for goodbyes and storing any wisdom I might have on my friends and making wills and suicide notes. Unless someone can talk me out in that week I'm done
