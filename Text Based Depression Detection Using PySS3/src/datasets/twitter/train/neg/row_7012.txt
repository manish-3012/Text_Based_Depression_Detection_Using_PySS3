Iâ€™m scared to live and Iâ€™m scared to diei... donâ€™t know where to start but iâ€™m Basically my family's servant. They expect me to do things no one else in the family does, on top of performing extreme emotional labor and pseudo marriage counseling on a daily basis.

 I get told Iâ€™m not allowed to cry and Iâ€™ve been beat or belittled for showing any emotions, but I have to listen to my parentâ€™s suicidal ideation and try to coax them out of it. When I am my mom told me to go ahead and do it. In fact when I was three I kept telling my mom â€œI Love you!!!â€ Over and over bc i thought it was fun and she told me I was being annoying haha.... she beat me every day until i was big enough to hit her back around age 14....

Theyâ€™ve never shown interest in me or what I like. They expect me to be grateful for food and shelter, and I am but.... I wish once in my life I would get a hug and an I love you. I know thatâ€™s sad coming from a 19-soon-to-be-20 year old but theyâ€™ve never shown me affection and it really hurts. Its not like I can get it elsewhere, theyâ€™ve kept me socially isolated my entire life. I have a 6th grade education. And before that I taught myself for 3rd and fourth.

 Iâ€™ve never really had friends, online or off. I know its kind of sick but I fantasize about being more well off stable and a successful writer, artist and musician and my favorite musicians and writers and artists being friends with me because it helps numb the pain to pretend thereâ€™s someone there even if they arenâ€™t really.... because being alone is literally the worst feeling in the world... [also i know this is a run off sentence and Iâ€™m sorry most of these are I donâ€™t Want to keep going over this post.... my writing is way better than this sorry Iâ€™m just really upset]

 My parents were/are drug addicts and I had to sell all my gaming systems and expensive electronics. I donâ€™t know how to escape any of this without going to a shelter and Iâ€™d rather take all my dadâ€™s blood pressure pills and go into a stroke. I just want to be happy for once. No one has ever loved me, and I mean that. My extended family tells me how much of a burden I am too. I'm numb now to everything. 

All i do everyday is listen to sad songs and watch anime buzzfeed unsolved or speedpaints. I draw but Iâ€™m nowhere near where i want to be. I call myself a writer but i never write...I want to learn music but i cant even afford a used guitar....

 I just want this to be over but I still have a sliver of hope that someone will save me, or I can find some way to save myself. The worst part is Iâ€™m trans and gnc and in the closet and my mom tells me every day how trans people and ESPECIALLY GNC people are the cause of the worlds problems and weâ€™re a sign of end times. I donâ€™t want to be. I just want to be loved. Not even in a clingy way, I just want someone to take an interest in me and be happy i;m alive... it hurts a lot to keep breathing and i want the pain to stop but mostly i just want to be ok
Like i said the void scares me but so does never getting out......
Sorry for this and sorry in general. I feel like Iâ€™m manipulating everyone....haha....
