I've figured it out{possible trigger}I've finally figured out what I'm going to do. 
See, I'm going to revolutionizing the treatment of mental illness(Cause this shit fucking sucks{also I'm already working on it}). And then, when I am awarded(For changing the world) I shall do what Budd Dwyer did, and read my suicide note to the world, and then, I'm gonna shoot myself on (hopefully) live television. Ironic, huh? That's the point. I am determined to wait until then(And who knows, maybe by that time I won't be so sad)

I've also figured out what I'm going to do if I can't wait that long, but that'd be a huge trigger for some people (but a fantastic idea if I do say so myself) so I won't write that.
