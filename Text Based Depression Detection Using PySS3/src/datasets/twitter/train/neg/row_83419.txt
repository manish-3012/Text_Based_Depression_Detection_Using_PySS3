I want to kill myself, for a second time, this time over a fucking Kit-Kat.#This NOT a shitpost.

I've explained this previously on a deleted account, but basically I was in a pit of extreme remorse for the bad things I've done in the past, and I was extremely paranoid that it's going to come back later and ruin my life, and I suffer from persecutory delusions. I felt so bad that I posted on here twice about it. My first post was about a month and a few weeks ago.

Only recently have I started to forgive myself. But all the progress I made has been wiped away, and what's worse is I actually got a taste of my nightmare. What happened? I ate a fun-size Kit Kat bar without breaking it. No, this is not a shitpost. I won't bother defending my reason, but I didn't realize until afterward that that's a cardinal sin. So, I posted to r/confession (deleted now), and, all I got was hate. All the horrible feelings came back.
