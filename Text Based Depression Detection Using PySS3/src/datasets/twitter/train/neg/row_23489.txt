I want to disappearI have health anxiety.... every week i think i have something new... Not something that would kill me, because that would be good and my anxiety knows it, but somehing that will have consequences. I'm so tired i wanna sleep. But i don't wanna go to bed because i'll be alone with my already overwhelming thoughts so i'll stay in the living room with the tv on so i can sleep..
