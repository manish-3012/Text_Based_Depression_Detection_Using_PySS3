Going to commit suicide one day.Seriously concerned I'm going to commit suicide one day. I've tried multiple medications, ssri's, snri's, maois, nothing works for me. If I didn't have family I would'e done it by now, but i'm too pusssy, my rents are still breathing. There's literally no reason I shouldn't hang myself right now. Even if i discovered the cure for cancer there's not reason I should keep living. It doesn't matter, or make a difference in the grande scheme of things... I've had this mindset since roughly 10 years old and im almost 21 now... Shit gets better, but not for all....
