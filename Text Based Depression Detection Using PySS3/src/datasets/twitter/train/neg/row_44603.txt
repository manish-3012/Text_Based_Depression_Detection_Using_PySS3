Finally timeIâ€™m 33 years old, Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was probably 7 or 8

I used to put all my pillows and blankets over my head at night and weigh them down with whatever I possibly could, hoping that I wouldnâ€™t wake up in the morning. 
Obviously, I would get restless in my sleep and escape my half assed suicide fort. 

I donâ€™t think I really knew what it meant to be â€œdeadâ€, I just always knew Iâ€™d rather not be alive. 

That feeling has never left and I think every decision I have made throughout my life has only been pushing me further toward this ultimate decision. 

Without getting too much into it, I have some childhood trauma that keeps me from fully forming relationships with the opposite sex. Iâ€™ve tried therapy and it does help to some degree but thereâ€™s truly nothing that can stop these feelings. 

Iâ€™ve ruined two amazing relationships because of this. Two incredible humans with nothing but potential have had a lot of their lives destroyed because I came into their world and left only pain and hurt in my wake. 

The only thing that has kept me from taking the plunge is knowing that I will upset my loved ones; I know this is a common theme around these parts, but I donâ€™t care anymore. 

I have friends that I love, but theyâ€™ll get over it. Most of my family just thinks Iâ€™m the weird one anyway, and theyâ€™ve seen this coming, they wonâ€™t be shocked or saddened, theyâ€™ll just have more to gossip about. 

I know Iâ€™m rambling at this point, I just want to get it all off my chest. I have literally no reason to be alive any longer. 
My ex wonâ€™t let me see our pets, and thatâ€™s my fault, I own up to that. I donâ€™t care much for my family, nor they for me. I love my friends tremendously but they, unfortunately, canâ€™t keep me happy enough to stay, and itâ€™s not their job to do so anyway. 

I really donâ€™t know anymore. Iâ€™ve been taken with the idea of drinking a dangerous amount &amp; sleeping in the snow. Another month and itâ€™ll be cold enough to go quickly.
