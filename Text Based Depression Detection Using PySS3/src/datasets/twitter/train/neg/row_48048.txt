Iâ€™m going to the train station. I hope I have the bravery to do it this time around.I had one person left. I ruined it. Now heâ€™s getting a new girlfriend while I sleep in the bed next to him. Alone again. Heâ€™s not even the reason I wanna go, but heâ€™s no longer the reason for me staying. I stayed alive for him and thatâ€™s not fair. Now Iâ€™ll die for me.
