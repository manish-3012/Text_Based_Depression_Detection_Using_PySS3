My chest hurtsI'm in physical pain from how much I hate myself. If I could drop dead here and now it would be better for everyone. Meds and therapy and meditation just to feel like I'm collapsing in on myself. It's not worth it. None of this is worth it. I don't want to do any of this but instead I have to put on a smile and work another 9 hours. I just can't do this anymore. Maybe I'll finally jump today.
