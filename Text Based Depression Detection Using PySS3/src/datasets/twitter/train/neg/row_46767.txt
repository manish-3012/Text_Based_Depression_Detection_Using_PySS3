I think Iâ€™m finally gonna do itAfter 21 long years, I think Iâ€™m gonna get the guts to end it. I canâ€™t take it anymore. The loneliness, the emptiness, the many failures that haunt my past. I canâ€™t take it anymore.

I think I was destined to be this way I guess. No friends, nobody to talk to. I have family sure, but they donâ€™t really understand me. All the praise I get from them doesnâ€™t count because theyâ€™re fucking related to me, theyâ€™re supposed to say that.

Aside from casual small talk, I never interacted with a girl in anyway. Any goal I wanted to live a happy life got blinded by the idea that making money was whatâ€™s important, all woven into my head by my dad. Now Iâ€™m treated like shit in a job I hate. 

I never asked for much in this life. I doubt there is a god but if there is, please let me do this right. I have a note written up and everything. Whenever I do it, just let me go one thing right.
