I stay alive for my little sister.My mom isnâ€™t abusive, but sheâ€™s not the best parent. Sometimes she puts me in situations I canâ€™t mentally handle, but if I say anything sheâ€™ll get upset. Sheâ€™s constantly victimizes herself, and as a result, I always question if I made the right decision in everything I do. 

She treats my five-year-old sister like sheâ€™s my age. Whenever she whines or does something a kid would do, mom gets wildly impatient and says stuff she canâ€™t understand or process. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is so I can be the support I never got while growing up. Sheâ€™s gone through way too much already. I need to be the emotionally stable one in the family, despite me not understanding anything about my own emotions.

I donâ€™t stay alive for my momâ€™s â€œthe parent shouldnâ€™t bury their kidâ€ rule. I donâ€™t stay alive to see my future and possibilities. I donâ€™t stay alive to make people less sad. Iâ€™m only still here so she has someone to talk to.
