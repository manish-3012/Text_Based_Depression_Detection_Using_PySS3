Can you say something nice to me?I am just so hopeless. My pain is growing to the point that I am thinking killing myself is the logical option. But there is at least two people who would care about me if they find out that I died. So some part of me does not want me to die, but mostly I am pretty suicidal and hopeless... Can you say something nice to me so that I can feel better? Thank you.
