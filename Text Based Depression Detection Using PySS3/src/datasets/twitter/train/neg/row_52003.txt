happy birthday to methereâ€™s nothing left for me here. iâ€™m alone and afraid and I donâ€™t want to be anymore. Any attempt to escape this always fails. I cant tell if itâ€™s me bringing myself down or the constant reminders of the fact that I am nothing and will amount to nothing. The fact itâ€™s my birthday tomorrow makes it worse. Iâ€™m supposed to be happy and show appreciation for those that care about me except thereâ€™s nothing. Thereâ€™s no one. And if there is someone, Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry I promised Iâ€™d keep going. Iâ€™m trying, I really am. Even if itâ€™s temporary this pain has felt eternal and I donâ€™t want to spend the rest of my life trying to fix it.
