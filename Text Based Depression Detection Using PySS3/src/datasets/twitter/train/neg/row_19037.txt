Last night was the closes I came to killing myselfIm 21 but Iâ€™ve already done a lot to mess up my background and Iâ€™m not sure if I can get a job in the career I want. Iâ€™m tired of trying to better myself and end up getting in trouble for something so minuet, setting myself farther back then where I started. I got tired of people I was interested in playing with my emotions and destroying myself confidence and making excuses that itâ€™s okay to do because â€œitâ€™s all part of the game. Because of people doing things to make me lose self-confidence I got to a point where I was no longer sexually active for 2 years, last week I tried getting back into it and just got ripped up for kissing â€œlike a first timerâ€, it was so embarrassing I hate myself. I feel like I have a complete opposite mindset than everybody else that I canâ€™t relate to anybody. Last night I almost killed myself but couldnâ€™t because the pain it would cause my parents. Once they pass Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I more than likely canâ€™t get the job I want, Iâ€™ve stayed so long out of the dating scene I donâ€™t have the skills to keep a future partner sexually happy. I have no one to relate to or talk to.  I wish things were different, but they arenâ€™t, Iâ€™m not depressed, I just donâ€™t have a point of living anymore. I canâ€™t wait to die.
