The hotlines all say the same god damn things."It will get better" or "Yeah, I was suicidal once too...", I hear this shit all the damn time when I call one of those suicide hotlines and it's never helpful. I want to know why the fuck I shouldn't put a bullet in my head already, and "your family will miss you" is a shitty attempt at guilt tripping me into not doing it. I'll do it. Don't care what my shithead family thinks.
