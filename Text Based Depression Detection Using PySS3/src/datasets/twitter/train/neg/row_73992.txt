Waiting...I hate myself and i hate my life. I can't sleep, can't eat, my grades are low and i can't feel joy. I'm only 15 and i already know i will die alone and without a job. I want to end it all since life is pointless and all i can feel is pain and sorrow. My depression and anxiety kills my soul slowly every day. I am only waiting for the day i live alone so i can light some charcoal and commit suicide in the bathroom.

I want to die. Im a worthless, selfish, coward, ugly, dumb, useless, sad loser who makes their friends depressed. I feel like my friends hate and nobody wants me by their meside. I can't do anything right and all i think about is the day ill commit suicide. Every single day is the same numb scene were i cry and ask to the universe to end my suffering. There is no reason for tomorrow. I will kill myself to feel the void once i get the chance to. I'm dead inside.

I'm the worst person ever and i know i only deserve nothing but dying. I wish to die of disease since i have no way of killing myself. My life is the same quest for death since i was 11. Guess i'll just wait until i live alone and can die alone.
