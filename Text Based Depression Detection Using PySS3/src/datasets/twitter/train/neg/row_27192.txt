My life is worthless.I'm 31 years old and have never had a full time job. I just got out of a debilitating 6 year relationship, the guy had as many problems as me but somehow I managed to pay for both of us. But at least he really, really loved me and was always there for me. I'm at least slightly attractive but I am fat, I can feel my teeth rotting in my skull. I'm bipolar and I really crave human attention but I seem to be really excellent at being super attractive to people at first then throwing off so many red flags that they ghost pretty fast. I'm addicted to opiates, only stopped shooting heroin when I broke up with the ex. I got such bad anxiety I couldn't go to work anymore. I basically now just sit at (my mother's) home, rarely shower or leave, take suboxone, and try to watch Netflix or chat with people online to keep myself busy, but this feeling of complete despair and dread keeps filling my head. I've been at least attempting to diet to lose weight and feel better about myself, but I usually end up drinking too much or having a late night binge and destroying all my progress. I know I need to try to accomplish something in life, and I have made numerous attempts to start something but every single time it all comes crashing down around me. I have known about 20 acquaintances that died of heroin recently. I really have no energy to chase the high anymore, although that was one of the few things that numbed me enough of my pain and failure. Just thought maybe I'd get high one more time. My mother and my asshole ex are the only ones who would care. I can imagine the rest of my friends being sad for a day or two and moving on.
