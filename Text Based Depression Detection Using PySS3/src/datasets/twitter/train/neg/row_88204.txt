idk whats wrong with me.I've never officially been diagnosed with depression or anxiety or anything (never actually been tested tho), i've  never really had much bad shit happen in my life, and yet there are days where i just feel hopeless and empty and just wanting that fucking razor back. (TW Oops) I still dont even know myself why im like this, and i know deep down there are some people (not many but some) who care about me and yet some nights it just feels like there's noone, and that ive hurt or upset everyone ive ever known. As i type this i've got the stuff right here and everything just feels fucking down and heavy. i dont even know what to do. I still dont even know whats fuckin wrong with me.

also worth noting, when talking to friends about it, ive always made up things to kinda give myself a reason for why im always so fuckin suicidal and depressed, but when i die i dont want my parents getting in shit for stuff that never happened. what the fuck do i do.
