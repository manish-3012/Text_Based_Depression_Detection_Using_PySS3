Iâ€™m gonna end it soon.Have you ever felt not good enough? Like everything you do someone is there to do it better, like everything everyone has expected for you you just canâ€™t do it. Thatâ€™s me. Neglect and abuse from the day I was born. A father that doesnâ€™t care for me, moved away to live with his new girlfriend, all my friends leave me over nothing. My mum is highly disappointed in me for everything I do man. This post wonâ€™t make a lot of sense but thatâ€™s because my brain is so muddled up and confused idk how to say everything thatâ€™s on my brain, except for what Iâ€™m thinking at the time so just bear with me. All I want is to be able to die, like living is complete bullshit, only music and sleep keeps me somewhat sane to be fair. I wake up and I feel pain and it doesnâ€™t ever go away. I feel like Iâ€™ve lost my mind and I need help but I canâ€™t find help from anyone. I feel like I make no difference on this earth and in my pointless life. I remember being happy a long time ago but I feel like Iâ€™ve genuinely died on the inside. I feel so worthless like no one would even be at my funeral tbh. Every day is wasted in my life because there is no reason for me to be here, I do nothing right but Iâ€™m gonna do this shit right, Iâ€™m gonna finish it tonight.
