Don't know what to do with myselfI feel like I'm approaching the end of my rope. I don't want to keep waking up everyday.i hate having to confront my emotions. I feel like everything in my life is falling to pieces, and it's gotten to the point that I have no desire to pick them back up. I just want this all to end so fucking badly
