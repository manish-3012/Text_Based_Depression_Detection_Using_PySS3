I hate my life, I hate being a burden and I hate that I am so weird.I found out that I have MS last year and since then, it's been a downhill battle. I can no longer drive, I can't work and I don't have the strength I once had, even walking can be a struggle. Not only that but, Women run away as fast as they meet me, and I am way too weird, I just don't know how to turn it off. I have no social life anymore and was forced to move in with my mother. I don't go on dates anymore because I feel like I'm Catfishing. The reason I say that is because, when I go on a date, at the end of the date women will ask where I parked and I end up telling them the truth, that I can't drive and my Mom dropped me off. 10% of the women I date seem cool with it, the other 90% say, thanks for dinner, give me a hug and I never hear from them again. I hate living like this, I hate feeling so alone, I hate being unable to do the things someone my age would do, and I hate waking up knowing that nothing is going to change. I'm 30 years old and I have no future, I have no income, and I know there isn't a women in this world that would want me. I honestly feel like Ron in Harry Potter in this scene https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDd4UNPIb0o except for what Hermione says about Ron is what the truth is for me. There isn't a women in the world who would want to deal with someone like me, and that okay because I don't want to hurt anyone, or become a burden to anyone else and that seems like all I can do these days. The only reason I haven't killed myself as of yet is for my family, but taking away the burden that is me would help them more than it hurts them.
