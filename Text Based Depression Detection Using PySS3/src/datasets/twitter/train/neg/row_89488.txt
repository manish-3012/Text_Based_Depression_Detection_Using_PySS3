give me an actual reason to not end my life. iâ€™ve tried once and my parents caught me. that was two years ago and i still suffer with severe depressiongive me an actual reason to stay alive, and donâ€™t say youâ€™ll miss me. you donâ€™t know who i am, which is a good thing. iâ€™m a dipshit, everything i do is wrong. i genuinely donâ€™t see a future, i donâ€™t see myself being an adult, it seems nearly impossible. give me a real reason.
