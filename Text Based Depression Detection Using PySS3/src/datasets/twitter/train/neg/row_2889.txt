Finally found on a good method.I cant seem to bring myself out of this misery. Yesterday, i felt great, but I'm sure its just artificial happiness from the zoloft. Today i have decided when i return home to NZ, I'm going to work hard, pay back all the money i owe. Get all my stuff, and throw it away or give it to charity. So there will be nothing to sort through when i am dead. No mess, no fuss. Quick and painless for all involved.

 I dont deserve this life, and i want to give it back. I am a fuck up that is beyond help. Even these stupid tablets are not helping me at all now. I have no family to talk to because they all despise me, my friends have all forgotten about me. My ex and i still talk, but i can tell since he broke up with me, hes happier and getting on with his life. I dont want to hold anyone back anymore. 

EDIT: had to take out my prefered method due to rules. All i can say is i am looking forward to it.
