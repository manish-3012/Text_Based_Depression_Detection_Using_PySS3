Donâ€™t do what I did. How do I not feel guilty?I ran in front of a moving car and survived. I now suffer from a severe traumatic brain injury. So many things that I canâ€™t do and Iâ€™m in constant pain.
I did this to myself.
I set myself back YEARS.
I feel guilty every damn day.
My boyfriend hates me for what I did...
So does my family..
And so do I.
