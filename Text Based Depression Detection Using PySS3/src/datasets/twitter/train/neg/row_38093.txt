Life is not fun.I don't have a good job, an education, friends, hobbies or meaningful life pursuits. I have an unhappy relationship. And a gambling addiction.

I do not want this. I want an actual real life where I can respect myself and have fun and be happy.

But I don't see a path to that. I'm a high school dropout with nothing. I had a bad childhood and I'm starting up a bad adulthood, working shit jobs for shit pay to end up gambling it all. I've sought help, but help didn't want to help. Every goal I've set for myself I've fallen short of.

I'm fucking done here. I want to end it. If life isn't fun - like it is for so many people who had decent parents and weren't beaten black and blue every other day and had friends and fucking opportunities and yes I'm bitter as fuck - then I don't want it. I have much the same rationale as people who break up so they won't be broken up with: at least this way I'll have some pride. I'll cut it short myself and not waste away for 50 years being a drain on everything and everyone while still achieving no happiness or joy. At least this way I can have a choice about something.


or then I'll back out again like so many times before and continue this miserable shitshow
