not an impulse anymore..iâ€™m borderline and bipolar so it isnâ€™t that rare that i have suicidal thoughts. but these past two weeks, iâ€™m less and less bothered by the idea and very inclined to do it, whenever i feel like the right time is. life is getting harder and harder already after an immense amount of pain. i really just canâ€™t handle the hurt in my chest and gut..
