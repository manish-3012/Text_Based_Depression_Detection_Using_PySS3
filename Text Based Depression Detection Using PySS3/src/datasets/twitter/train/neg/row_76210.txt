Someone Talk to meHere's my story: I've been wanting to suicide ever since my dad's death last November. He had benn everyhing to me; my inspiration, my best friend and the person I love the most in this world. No matter how hard I try I can't cope with his death. I wanted to take a break from school but my mom is strongly against that because she hated my dad and thinks it's worthless to waste my time thinking about him. My friends around me all have harmonious and supportive family so none of them understand a single bit of what I'm going through. I don'thave anyone to talk to and no one is willing to listen and take me seriously. I live far from my friends so I don't hang out with them much. It's gradually getting harder and harder for me to open up to people. I'm very swallowed in my own pain and ego. I don't get along with my mom at all and I don't have any siblings. My parents divorced when I was 6. I always felt very lonely because there were hardly anyone to talk to, everyone was busy with their lives. I've been wanting to suicide for 3 years and my dad's death help settled my mind on it. I lost my best friend right after my dad's death and this guy I dated for a few months dumped me to go back to his ex. I don't see any reasons to live in this world where everything is taken away from me. And no I don't want to keep living because someone will be sad if I died. I don't care about others at this point.
