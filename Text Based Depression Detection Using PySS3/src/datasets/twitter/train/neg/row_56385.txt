How to kill myself without leaving my family with the bill?Hey y'all, been researching suicide lately (not a big deal, just that my life has been kinda 'worst case scenario' for a while and some family financial issues have pushed it well past that) and the most troubling thing for me is worrying about funerary/clean-up costs that my family would be stuck with on my departure. If I have to head out I'd rather my choice be a net financial gain for my family so I'd really appreciate some tips on what kind of funerary arrangements to specify (knowing to what extent a suicide note is legally binding as a will would also be wonderful!) and any info on how to dodge a postmortem cleaning bill. Obvious choice would be to drive out to the woods or throw myself off a bridge or something but I can't drive and I'm stuck in the burbs so any choice is gonna be a bit of a hassle, unfortunately.

Sorry if this isn't the right place for this, and thanks in advance!
