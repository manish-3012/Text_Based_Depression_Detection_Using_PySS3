Morbid thoughtsI'm not sure if this a form of suicidal ideation, but I'm obsessed with my own death to an unhealthy point. I have constant thoughts of mutilating and disfiguring myself, seeing my organs outside of my body, and just leaving as much blood and gore as possible before the blood loss gets to me. I think about it all the time. I don't purposefully think about it, it's just reoccurring thoughts due to my depression. I'm not even bothered by it at this point, but I'm aware of how fucked up it sounds to others.
