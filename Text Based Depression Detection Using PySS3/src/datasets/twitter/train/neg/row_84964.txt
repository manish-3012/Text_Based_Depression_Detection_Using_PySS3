What does motivation feel likeI don't know if I've ever felt real emotion. I've never been attracted to anybody, I barely have friends and the ones I do have are distancing themselves from me because i beg them for drugs, I don't even know what gets me out of bed in the morning. I eventually make it to class, but not until 2-3 hours into the day. I have almost anything material a high schooler would want, but I don't feel anything inside.

I don't have plans specifically on how and when I'm gonna go. In all honesty I'm just a mix of sad and bored. Nothing excites me or gets me going, and watching my family and friends fall apart trying to help me is depressing as fuck. Even picturing myself with Jeff bezos levels of money and a loving happy family wouldn't make me feel any different. I don't know what to do.
