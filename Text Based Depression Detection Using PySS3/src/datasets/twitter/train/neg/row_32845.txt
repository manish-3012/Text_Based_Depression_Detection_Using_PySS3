Im away to phone a ambulance for mental health, i need advice urgently pleasei need help fast, i live in the UK, im 16 and im going to call an ambulance, but im slightly drunk, and trust me, it isnt the alcohol, i made an entire essay on my problems to the subreddit but i accidently deleted it, my question is, will they still offer me help? like being sent to a psychiatrist at least. I even had to make a new account to make this post because of people recognizing me. It is also about 10 to 2 in the morning but trust me again, its urgent. if i can just get my words out to them im sure they will offer me great help.
