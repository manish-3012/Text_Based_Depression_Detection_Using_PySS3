A date to kill yourself should things not improve.I have dealt with depression and suicidal ideation since I was thirteen. 
I am now twenty-five, birthday in December. 
I made an attempt at fifteen. 
Another at eighteen. 
Elected to go to therapy, which my parents just stopped taking me to. 
I can't afford it, and all the online options reject my applications. 
Now its back in full swing, and I spend more time shopping around for a quality shotgun and researching the best type of ammunition for suicide than anything else online. 
I deleted all forms of social media, save reddit, mainly because I'm barely on here(had to log in just for this post). 
I'm now actively putting distance between the people that care about me, if only to maybe soften the news. 
As for the title, a friend has a date set in the future for "reevaluation". If life doesn't improve, he's gone. 
The wisdom of it struck me last night, and I guess I'm seeing if anyone else has such a contingency? 
I am not looking to discuss my life or anything, just to see if anyone else is in the same boat. 
Solidarity on the same sinking vessel, if you will.
