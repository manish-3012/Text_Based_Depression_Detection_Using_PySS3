Thinking...About leaving work early today. Driving and just taking pills and ending it all. Iâ€™m so tired. Tired of waiting for my php to get back to me, tired of waiting for medication to work, tired of the exhaustion to stop, tired of everyone panicking when I mention an inkling of wanting to end it. Iâ€™m just. So. Tired.
