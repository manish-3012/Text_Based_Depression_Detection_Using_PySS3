I just want peaceI dont know whats wrong with me. But i just want it to end. My head hurts constantly. It feels like my brain wont stop. It hurts so bad. I just want it to end. Its been so long since i have "relaxed" which for me is basically just actually having energy. My thoughts are always so overwhelming and i feel exhausted constantly due to never getting to relax because of my brain. I cant handle it anymore. I just want some peace.
