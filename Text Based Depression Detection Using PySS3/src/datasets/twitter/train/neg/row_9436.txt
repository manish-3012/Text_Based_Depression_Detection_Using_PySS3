Subconscious urges?Hello SW. I was unsure of whether to post this on /r/anxiety or here because my situation has a lot of anxiety, but I figured the urges of suicide are a bit more urgent so I'll try here.

I'm a relatively new university student who has had moderate depression and severe GAD since about 7th grade. Over the years I've gotten better and better at dealing with my demons, particularly the suicidal tendencies. In the past week or so, though, the game has changed a bit. A while back if I was having thoughts of suicide there would be concrete reasons in my mind (say, a recently-failed relationship, my grandma dying, something), but now I've been having panic attacks related to my anxiety disorder and, directly after, very very strong urges of suicide. I wish I knew how to explain this to you guys without sounding crazy or like I'm lying, but after these panic attacks I have a hard time being self-aware. All I know is that I want to kill myself. There's no reasons in my mind as to why, but it's just my mind constantly tugging at my body to just *go through with it already.* The best way I can describe it is when you really have to use the bathroom, you don't really think about it, you just go unless you're unable to. Fortunately I have nothing in my dorm to kill myself with. By about an hour after my anxiety attacks the suicide thoughts are usually gone, and every time I ask myself why I wanted to do it so badly, I can't think of a solid reason. It's almost like I'm a different person entirely for that period of time.

Sorry to make this such a wall of word vomit; it's hard to describe all of this in a few sentences. Does anyone else ever have urges like these ones? Do they usually follow your anxiety/panic attacks (if you have them)?

I look forward to your help
