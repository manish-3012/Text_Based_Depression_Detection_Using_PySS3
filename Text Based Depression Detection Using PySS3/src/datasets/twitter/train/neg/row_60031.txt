I really shouldn't drinkTonight/last night I found myself telling a friend "If you find my body in the morning just know that I love you guys and I wish things were better".  I haven't felt this low on a longtime. I think I only feel this low when drunk. I don't have much to say besides the above. I didn't do it (obv) but I don't know that I won't when drunk enough to send a text like that. 

Does anyone ever find themselves lower when drinking instead of the happy drunk they often are? I'm normally happy drunk guy but last/tonight it was different.
