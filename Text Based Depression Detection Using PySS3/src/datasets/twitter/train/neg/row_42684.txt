Why do I want to kill myself?I am fortunate, but I am not a good person. I have no mental illness, no abusive family, and yet I want to get my life over with. I get angry thinking about the fact that if anybody was asked who they want to be with the most, it wouldn't be me. I'm not good enough for myself or for anybody. I feel like im constantly about to throw up. I feel like I'm not supposed to be here. I'm out of place even when I'm alone. I'm stuck with no plausible way to kill myself.
