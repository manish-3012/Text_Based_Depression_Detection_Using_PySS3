I now know why people avoid meWherever I go, people go out of their way to avoid me and they hold on to their bags, lock their cars and whisper things under their breath.

It's because I dress like a thug.

Whenever there is a crime in my hometown the criminal is always wearing unbranded clothing that is most likely second hand.

My whole identity is based on secondhand clothing without logos and 99% of the clothes in secondhand stores are from cheap supermarkets no decent person would want to enter (except people like me).

I saw this interview with the most friendly, humble woman in the world and she is clearly middle class based on her classy Gucci belt paired with the most middle class of accents I have ever heard.  If I had an average IQ I would be able to get a decent paying job like her and dress like a friendly woman and not a thug who wants to murder the middle class.

I live with my parents and don't yet have a job but if I am going to spend the rest of my life in disgusting clothing with the most hated accent in the UK, I will kill myself.
