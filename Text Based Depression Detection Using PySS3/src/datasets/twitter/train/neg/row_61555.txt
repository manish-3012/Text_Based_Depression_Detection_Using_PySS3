Iâ€™m doing it.Iâ€™m 26 and Iâ€™ve been suicidal for over a decade. The last 5 years have broken me completely. No one Iâ€™ve tried talking to takes me seriously, and Iâ€™m tired of crying for help...

The man I love, who I left my entire life for, doesnâ€™t love me anymore and is leaving in less than a week. Iâ€™ve tried talking to him about my suicidal thoughts, he just assumes Iâ€™m trying to make him stay... Iâ€™m going to hang myself the day he leaves.
