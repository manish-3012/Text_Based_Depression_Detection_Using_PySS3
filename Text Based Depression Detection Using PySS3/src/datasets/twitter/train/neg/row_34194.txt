My cat just saved my lifeToday has been a bunch of small really bad events that just added up on top of all the other pressures I'm dealing with.

After a few hours of thinking about my life and crying, I decided to write a note and figure out how I was going to do it. While thinking I started walking around the house. I guess walking around was pretty loud so my big fat cat woke up. I'd been in such a tunnel vision state thinking about myself that I hadn't even thought about him. He started rubbing my legs and purring and the moment I noticed him I broke down. He and his sister are the only things I have left. Who's going to feed them? Who's going to play with them? Who are they going to rub and lick? I love him and his sister so much, maybe more than anything.

So I guess I'm still here. I'm gonna take a shower, maybe eat something, then try to go to bed. I'm so exhausted I don't think I can make a decision. Tommorow is a new day.
