It's Getting WorseI finally got help after many years of struggle, went to a doctor and then a psychologist to be diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Also on meds.

But I feel nothing, not getting better and I've started lying. I can't get out of bed in the morning and I make up excuses why I can't make it to some event I'm committed to. 

At this point, I've lied to my workplace, my closest friends, my family, and every possible group I had some responsibility to. I didn't even have this habit before, but now I do, and I don't know why.

Why is it getting worse, why do I have so much trouble getting out of bed in the morning when I didn't have this problem before. And I don't think its the meds because I've been on them for over a month now.

My suicidal thoughts are popping up more now, but I don't know. I want to live, but I don't know how. I also want to die, but I don't know how. I know nothing. I'm empty.
