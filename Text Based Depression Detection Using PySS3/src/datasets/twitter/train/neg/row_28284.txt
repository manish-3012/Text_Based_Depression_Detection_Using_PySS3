I got better. Now I'm relapsing.I wrote out a longer version of this several times, but I gave up on it. I just don't know what to say.

Long story short, I've always been a social shut in. I had untreated depression and anxiety disorder in high school that kept me from making and friends and led to at least a couple serious considerations of suicide. Although there was that, I found it easier to make friends over the internet. It wasn't easy, but after somehow getting to know some good people, some therapy, and taking medication for my disorders, I managed to pull myself out of the gutter. I've been in college now for three years, and I've managed to produce a handful of good friends in person here and I had the support of some lovely people online.

Now, the first part of that last sentence. There's a reason for the had. My most recent social circle came about two years ago. I became close friends with a man by chance who liked the same game I did, and we became close. Then we just started making more mutual friends. By the end of it, I want to say there was 20 of us. Things were good for those two years. I loved everyone in that server, and I was grateful to have people like that I could trust. I wouldn't have traded it for the world. And then I fucked up.

To put it simply, I wronged a number of members of the group without realizing it. A mix of inappropriate behavior, one of the biggest being that I spoke to them them so much and failed to pick up on any hints that this was undesired behavior. I just enjoyed the company of these people so much that I failed to think of how they felt. Everyone went their own way with me. Many of them just blocked me, including my best friend. A couple of them said they wanted a break, and I never heard from them again. A handful gave me the benefit of the doubt, and still talk to me but keep it on the down low so as not to suffer retribution from the others. And one I have absolutely no idea what they want, and it's driving me insane.

Anyone else could just chalk it up to a learning experience and move on. But it's been 3 months and I think about it every day. Losing so many people you care about in one go like that with no chance to say anything for yourself would absolutely demolish a man like me. Since then I've been trying to claw back the friendships I can with little success. My best friend is gone. Plenty of people I would've trusted with my life are now too. Anyone who is still willing to associate with me is scared of what might happen if anyone else finds out. And I'm paranoid this is going to hang over my head for anyone else I try to get to know, in case someone from the group badmouths my stupid ass.

I've seriously thought about ending it several times since. There's several large bridges over the ocean in my city, and a month and a half back I seriously thought of driving off it. The only thing that stopped me was realizing the concrete barrier there would just leave my father with a broken car and myself sectioned. I may not have gone through with it, but the thoughts are common and remain. The only reason I think I haven't been more proactive about killing myself is because I'm also terrified of what comes after death. I know that's the only thing that's saved me a few times in the past. But I don't know how much longer that's gonna hold. There's a war raging in my brain, and my side is losing.

If you read all that, thank you. I'm sorry if this post is an utter mess. My name is Seb, and you've done more for me than some of the people I still think of as 'friends'.
