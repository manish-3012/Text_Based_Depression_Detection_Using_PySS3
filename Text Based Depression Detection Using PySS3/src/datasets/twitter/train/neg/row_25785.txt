Does anyone else find comfort in writing suicide notes/letters/etc?When I am in an extreme state of vehement sadness, I enjoy writing documents surrounding a potential suicide if such a time is ever to come. Other than music, this has been the only thing that has allowed me to cope in an efficient manner.
