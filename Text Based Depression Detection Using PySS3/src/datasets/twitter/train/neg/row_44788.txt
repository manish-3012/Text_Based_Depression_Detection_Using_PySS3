I came here 6 months ago and nothings changed.I'm so unhappy. My life is a grey stream of nothing. 

I don't want to wake up tomorrow. 

I don't want to even make it to the end of this post. 

I feel so alone. Nothing has improved since when I drunkely posted here 6 months ago.

Is there anybody out there?
