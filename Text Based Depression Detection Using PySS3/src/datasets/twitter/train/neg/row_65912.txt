Need something to live for; depressionI am 24 M. I have no job. I live alone somewhere (Not in America or western countries). I had a girlfriend with whom I had to break up 2 years ago. I tried my best to get into a good college but I couldn't. All my teenage years and until recently, I just lived for getting into a great college and then a great job but I unfortunately could not. It is not like I am dumb or something (Or maybe I am - that's open for debate I guess); situations and poor decisions from me and my parents earlier after my high school played a significant role in that. Anyway, now I have given up that dream (I should have given that up a few years ago. I know that. I am not looking to go to college now, I have left that thought). Now, I find myself without any purpose, without any hope to live for. I've been in depression. I really need something to live for, really soon, and I am unable to do that task. So, I ask everyone here or anywhere (you can ask someone in your connections as well) to advise me, to suggest me what I should do everyday for the rest of my life. It can be anything really. I can work hard and really focus on something (I have studied for 16-18 hours a day a lot of times). I seriously do not want to end myself, so I need to do something. 
Further, I am asexual and I am not an emotional person at all. So, please don't suggest me to live for my family or others. But I can live for a task, work or something similar. I hope you understand me. I am not a native speaker of English and have studied English only for a couple of years, so if any part of this text is ambiguous, please ask me for clarification.
