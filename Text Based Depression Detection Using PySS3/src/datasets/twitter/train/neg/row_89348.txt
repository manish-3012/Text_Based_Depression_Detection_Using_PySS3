HeyI'd like to make friends that understand what it's like to wake up and be sad that your not sleeping anymore. I need friends that are going to get mad at me even though I am this "suicidal/ticking bomb"person. But will know to make me realise that it's because they love me. Parents suck at doing their jobs. Relatives suck for enabling it.  

I suck for not standing up for myself and people suck for seeing the sadness in me and still deciding to talk about me where I could hear them.

I wish I couldve done it as a child when I had the guts to. When I felt like I hadn't met enough people to actually leave a meaningful mark behind.

My demons need to go back to hell. They are a part of me. So I need to go too. THIS SUICID VOICE IS A HELLA SMART. but I am smarter. I just. I'm tired
