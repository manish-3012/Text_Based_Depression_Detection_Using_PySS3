A friend of mine really needs help and I'm out of ideas.TLDR: A friend of mine is going through some real hard times, lots of trouble with her parents and with recent horrible things that happened to her.

I've been close to her for about one year, and we've rarely seen each other, but she trusts me and I'm trying my best to help her.

She already attempted to commit suicide, but it didn't work, and since then she's been a little better.

But today she texted me saying that after what happened last weekend ruined her (this guy that she thought was her friend only wanted sex and now she's blocked), plus she honestly thinks her mother hates her. In her words, it has come to a point where she has no reason to live anymore.

I've tried and tried but she does not listen to me and keeps saying that she'll do it.

Any ideas on how to convice her otherwise?
