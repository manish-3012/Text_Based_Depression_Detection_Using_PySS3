Don't think people don't care.Hi all , someone I had recently started seeing recently took their life. I'm absolutely torn and feel responsible as the last message I sent was asking what they were up to and they messaged back saying I could come over but I didn't respond back to that message for 8 days! They killed theirself 7 days after the message. I didn't reply not because I didnt care, I don't know why really I just didn't (because I'm scatty and had a lot on etc) and when I did it was too late. I can't help but think that this was my fault. I could have been the one to save them or they could have thought "fuck it she hasn't replied for a week so she dosnt care " they spent time with other people that week but what if me not messaging back triggered the suicide.  it's on my mind 24 7 but I can't fix it and bring him back to life. I feel sick with guilt and I don't know how I'm going to get over it. I also really liked him and miss him loads. Point is , please don't think people don't care. People get busy in their lifes and we are selfish, we have to be sometimes I guess but if I knew he was suicidal I would have messaged all the time because I really did care, he was a beautiful human and I wish I could bring him back . I've been single for 6 years and I genuinally thought he could be my next partner. Please reach out to loved ones who you feel don't care. You are not a burden to them, you have a life ahead of you that no matter what you have been through, I'm sure there are many people who love you enough to help get you through this , you might just need to reach out bluntly to them. Tell them you are feeling suicidal straight up because people are stupid eg: This guy asked me how I would commit suicide and told me how he would but I still didn't think he was suicidal.   More people are there for you than you know. your life is just as important as any one else's and with support you can't beat this depression I'm sure!
