I can't do it anymore.I just ended a six year relationship. Entirely long distance, they refused to meet me even as I poured myself into it more and more. They refuse to take responsibility for their actions that lead to constant hospitalization, leaving me in the dark and torturing me with loneliness. I know that's a tad hypocritical considering I want to die. I don't really care.  
I have reason to believe they have attempted suicide, making this the second time since August. The first time they were determined to make me listen to them die. I'm traumatized enough. I watched my mom slowly die but couldn't fucking be there for her when she actually did, I watched my home go up in flames. I don't need any more of this.  
They are in another country and I have no idea what their exact location or cell phone number is and have no way of contacting police to make sure they're OK and get medical attention.  
I can't handle this anymore. This is too much for me, and I want out. I can only take so much anguish and emotional torture. They have stolen my youth, they took time away from me that I could have spent with my dying mother and I know I will otherwise be alone forever because my personality is completely repulsive.
