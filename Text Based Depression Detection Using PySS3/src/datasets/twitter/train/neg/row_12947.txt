Iâ€™ve decided.Today is June 23rd, 2019.

Iâ€™ve been depressed since middle school. I turned 22 five days ago. Iâ€™ve never had the guts to self-harm. Iâ€™ve gone to therapy and been on medication but I havenâ€™t been on anything in a while, nor have I talked to anyone. I havenâ€™t been hospitalized but Iâ€™ve had many thoughts of it this past year just so I can be further isolated from everyone and everything. Everyday, I want to be more and more alone. Even when I have nothing to be sad about, I have no energy. No positivity. No light. I sleep all day for the most part. I have no interest in hanging out with any friends. Iâ€™ve been wanting to die/not exist, but Iâ€™ve never considered killing myself because I know I could never do it.

Right now, itâ€™s summer. Iâ€™m in school but Iâ€™m not taking any classes. I just work. I donâ€™t want to hang out with anyone on my off days other than my family because they at least bring some light to my life, along with my cat.

The majority of my motivation for living is taking care of my parents. Both of them have some major medical issues and my main concern is making sure theyâ€™re comfortable every day. One day, however, when they are no longer around, I plan to die. I donâ€™t want them living in a world without me. But once I no longer have a reason to live, I wonâ€™t anymore. I donâ€™t know how or when. But Iâ€™ve decided on the circumstances.
