I don't belong here.Iâ€™m not sure what I to say or how I to say it. Iâ€™m not sure why I am even writing this because I donâ€™t want to hear what people have to say. I guess I just want this out there somehow. Even if I did want advice, no anyone can say anything that will help. I highly doubt anyone will even really care. Sometimes people think they care but how much of that is because they actually care, and how much is because theyâ€™ve been conditioned to believe they should.


Have you ever had the feeling of being at a party or event surrounded by people but still feeling alone? I feel like that all the time. One time in college I decided to get a minor in math. I tried to make friends in that department (as well as my own department), but I always felt like an outsider. I felt like I was looking into a fish tank. While I liked seeing them and while I felt like I could understand them and their behavior; I simply could not exist in their environment. I feel like I donâ€™t belong on earth.


My dad had some anger management issues when I was young. I never really thought anything of it. I just figured thatâ€™s how things were and it was no big deal. Now that Iâ€™ve been seeing a psychiatrist she explained to me that even though consciously I donâ€™t see it as a big deal, subconsciously it has left me â€œdamagedâ€ somehow (she didnâ€™t actually say damaged). As I got older I found out my dad was suspected (by a psychiatrist) of being bipolar (he never went through the full range of tests to prove it). I donâ€™t blame him because he canâ€™t control being or not being bipolar. I wonder if I will end up with it as well or if itâ€™s true that all his anger has affected me. Iâ€™ve read other stories of people who were abused and therapist type people say that can lead to them being easy targets for others to abuse them later.


When I was about 11, I was molested by a neighbor who was just a few years older than me. Iâ€™m curious if one of the reasons why I was molested was because of what I said in the previous paragraph. I remember a therapist once told me I might have a fear of intimacy, Iâ€™m not sure if that could have been caused by the molestation. It only happened once so Iâ€™m not sure why I canâ€™t just get over it. 


Iâ€™ve tried finding a girlfriend in real life and on dating websites but I get nowhere. Iâ€™ve been able to meet some women but as soon as I get too close to them I start to get nervous and anxious. Iâ€™ve had sex but I never really enjoyed it. I think mostly because I wasnâ€™t really into them but I kind of just went along with it. Iâ€™m not really sure why. Iâ€™ve also had a lot of what I call â€œpseudo-girlfriendsâ€; women who Iâ€™m just friends with but we hangout a lot and sometimes even cuddle. I know youâ€™re probably thinking, â€œwhy not ask one of them to take our friendship to the next level.â€ Well I have and thatâ€™s never worked out for me and I just end up losing friend.


The more I go on, I feel less and less connected to the world. I know eventually I am going to end my life one day; maybe not soon, but one day.
