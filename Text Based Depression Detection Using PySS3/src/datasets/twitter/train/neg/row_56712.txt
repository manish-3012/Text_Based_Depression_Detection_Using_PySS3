Does anyone feel empty?I feel so empty. Over the last month or so Iâ€™ve been trying to fill the hole with food and itâ€™s not working at all. I donâ€™t feel anything and I canâ€™t stop eating. Really I donâ€™t even want to be happy anymore I just want everything to end. Maybe Iâ€™ll be able to finally end my life soon. 

How do you fix this? I donâ€™t feel sad anymore I guess, but I donâ€™t feel anything else either.  My hands are shaky and I feel a certain something in my heart, but ultimately itâ€™s nothing.
