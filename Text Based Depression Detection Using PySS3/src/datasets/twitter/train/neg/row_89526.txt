Depression"You have know clue how much I wish I were dead. All the words people say behind my back. No-ones seen the scars under my sleeves. When ever I'm not at school they always enjoy them selves. When I come back people give me a look of disgust hatred. The words they say are to painful to even bare. They say freak, look at his face that's gross... So I cut myself and slowly by slowly I try to kill myself. By getting sharper and sharper things to hurt myself with. When I'm dead tell people I didn't even exist. No one probably even cares that I'm saying this. I need friends people to talk to. But the odds of that are very low. The worst thing I've ever heard what one of my best friends say go kill yourself. Because we got into a small fight then.... I tried I did an overdose and I'm still here. So I'll most likely be looking at my account. Maybe, I made this for no reason cause no-ones gonna look at this. I'm just gonna slowly fade... That's all I'm gonna say."-Doogalash
