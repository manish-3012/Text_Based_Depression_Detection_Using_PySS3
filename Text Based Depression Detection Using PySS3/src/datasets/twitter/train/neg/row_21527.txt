Thinking about killing myself later tonightI've been thinking about killing myself all day (and most of last night).
I suffer from chronic pain (scoliosis and Spina bifida), doctor refuses to prescribe anything for the pain.
My boyfriend won't return my calls.
I'm unemployed and in debt.
I just don't see things working out for me.
