I need AdviceSo, I'm at a horrible decision making position. All my family members (at least the girls from my moms side) are all going against me, saying that I'm disrespectful towards her(despite that that she starts 99% of the arguments we end up getting into). Idk what to do any more, i feel like im going crazy. The people who are supposed to be my "family" are all supporting someone who's narcisstic, and constantly beating me down with hurtful words. What can I do? I feel so lost.
