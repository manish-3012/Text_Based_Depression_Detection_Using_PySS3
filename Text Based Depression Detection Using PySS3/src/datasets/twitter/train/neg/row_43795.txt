I don't want to exist anymoreI'm tired of existing. I'm tired of continuing this shit parade called a life. For as long as I can remember, I've never been happy or satisfied. Society told me that kids are stupid and it gets better when you get older. I'm 22 now, life is still bleak and disappointing.

I almost flunked out of high school and community college because I could barely get up in the morning. Everyone is always pointing out how I'm not good enough. My friends and family always make fun of me, even though they know I'm insecure. Why don't you have a girlfriend yet? Why do you work your shitty minimum wage job? Do they want me to just come out and say it? I am emotionally vulnerable, mutt ugly, short, poor, socially anxious, and stupid.

My friends and family are so happy and full of purpose. They live such rewarding lives. They have careers, lovers, goals, and I'm just sitting here trying to find a reason to continue holding on. Life has taught me one thing so far: It doesn't get better. My family doesn't deserve the pain, but dying seems like the only way out of this mess. I just don't know how to go about ending this final chapter of my life.
