Help me
I need help. Due to the virus I canâ€™t go to a hospital, or anywhere to seek help. I canâ€™t even talk about it through the telephone therapy because I donâ€™t live alone.

I canâ€™t deal with this anymore. 
I keep having vivid thoughts of dying in a way that would basically be a bloodbath. (Only involving myself, not others)
I keep having these violent Impulses to just do things. Like, I could end myself so easily. I could. It would be fairly quick.
I canâ€™t be trusted around myself.
What am I supposed to do?

Mentally, Iâ€™m shutting down. I canâ€™t even begin to process it anymore. Iâ€™ve become increasingly aware of the fact that I canâ€™t maintain even basic information at this point, thereâ€™s just nothing there.

Iâ€™m so sick and tired of my treatments failing. Iâ€™ve given up on myself. I havenâ€™t done anything in about three weeks beyond eating, being on my phone, and sleeping. I donâ€™t want this. 

Iâ€™m terrified. Itâ€™s a last resort to go online and ask what to do. Iâ€™m not asking for a diagnosis. I just want this to stop.

Iâ€™m out of options. I feel terrible for being so selfish during these times, and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve avoided talking about it. If I could somehow get help, Iâ€™d be taking resources from others. I would be responsible if something happened to them.

I think itâ€™s going to happen soon. I canâ€™t keep doing this. I canâ€™t imagine going on like this any longer. Itâ€™s a sick cycle of getting treated, feeling hopeful for a bit, and then having the treatments fail. Itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m not trying. Iâ€™ve been wanting to get better for so long. Nothingâ€™s come of it no matter what I do.

At this point, I know this is the only way out.

Iâ€™m sorry to everyone. Iâ€™m trying my best. Iâ€™m trying so, so hard to stay around. But I donâ€™t know how long itâ€™ll last. Iâ€™m sorry.

Iâ€™m at the end of my rope. Itâ€™s been a battle for years, even as a child. I donâ€™t know what security feels like in this way. Iâ€™m tired. So tired. I just want some peace.
