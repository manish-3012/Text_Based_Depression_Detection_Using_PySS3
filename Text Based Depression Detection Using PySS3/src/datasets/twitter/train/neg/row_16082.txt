I don't necessarily want to die, I just want to go back and reset it allI can't go on forwards.       
It's a dead end for me.            
I want to go back, I don't want to stay here and beyond, this isn't where I belong.       
I feel stressed and depressed, any moment now I feel like I should end myself, but deep in my thoughts I really don't want to do that either. I just, I'm not compatible for adulthood. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to do this anymore.
