17, going to be an adult soon, low aspirationsI'm a 17 year old musician in a shitty highschool garage band. I have no desire to go to college because I really don't like school, it makes me want to die. I don't want to be stuck in poverty forever because I have no big aspirations and/or stuck living with my parents any longer than I absolutely have to because I can't afford to get my own place. What can I even do? am I going to be stuck in minimum wage for the rest of my life, treated like a failure and hoping I can make enough to keep myself alive and happy? All I want to do is play music but I don't know that I'll be able to realistically make a living doing the only thing I enjoy in life. I'd rather die than be stuck living with my parents because I can't afford an apartment.
