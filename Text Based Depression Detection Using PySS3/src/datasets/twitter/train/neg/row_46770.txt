My Ex Committed SuicideSo, this wonâ€™t be a short post, and serious comments only. My ex died three months ago, well two weeks away from being four. Our relationship was complex, at best. We had each otherâ€™s names tattooed on ourselves. We were insanely close. And, he was probably the only person Iâ€™ve ever fully let into my life. I miss him. 
Iâ€™m alone in my grieving because Iâ€™m his ex. People tell me the worst things, for example â€œit wasnâ€™t your fault.â€ â€œBe glad it happened when he was with someone else. Imagine how you would have dealt.â€ â€œYou are better off.â€ I think those things only add to the anger and hurt. My ex was an addict (alas, I am too, though Iâ€™m sober). He was in trouble a bit sometimes, but he was a GOOD person, and someone I loved quite dearly. I think people feel justified in saying those things to me because of his past, and what led up to his suicide.

Iâ€™m here to say, it absolutely doesnâ€™t justify what they say or think towards me. I also know I played my own role, we hadnâ€™t been broken up really, and truly, but seven months. In those seven months, he relapsed, got with a girl who he let walk on him, and beat him down, and as all addicts go - was living a life of hell. I understand why he did what he did. I donâ€™t have questions, I knew him as well as he knew me.

Iâ€™m not given the privilege of being able to openly speak of him. I hurt, and I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll stop grieving. A song comes on and I ball my eyes out. I pull out letters and my soul burns. Of course, Iâ€™m recently married too, and my husband, though a good man, canâ€™t relate. It was and has been the worst experience of my life.

Thatâ€™s coming from a woman whoâ€™s been beaten, abused drugs because she hated herself, survived my own suicidal tendencies, been raped, had seven wrecks, and lost her mother at the age of 3. Not to have a pity party but Iâ€™ve had my own sufferings. I know pain, but I canâ€™t seem to deal with his death. Iâ€™m just alive. 

Thereâ€™s the good and the bad days. It just comes in waves. I realized a lot of things. How poorly I treated him in 6 years. How I was too afraid to actually love him and stay - so I left. I always thought there was better. So I found my husband, and my ex, well he let me go. He always did give me the freedom to express who I was and to be free. He always said I wouldnâ€™t settle for less. He was right and I wonâ€™t downplay my love for my husband either. Heâ€™s wonderful. He really is, and Iâ€™m thankful for him. 

I think it stems down to the closeness I shared with my ex. His life was similar to mine. Our worlds mixed in eerie ways. The last time I saw him he hugged me, said he loved me always, and if my now husband messed up he would beat his ass. 

It hurts all over. I think about his mom telling me that â€œI mustnâ€™t of wanted a piece of shit like himâ€ after we broke up and how upset he was. How he planned to marry me. I think of our good times, our laughs, our talks, and I know Iâ€™ve aged 10 years in these 3 months.

Has anyone experienced anything similar?
