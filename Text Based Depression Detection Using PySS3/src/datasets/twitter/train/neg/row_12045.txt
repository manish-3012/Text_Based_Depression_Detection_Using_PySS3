I'm conflicted by my mind might be clearingRecently I was manipulated into taking a break from my relationship, Iâ€™m beginning to realize she doesnâ€™t deserve the love I give her. I fucking deserve better. I deserve a girl who will respect me and that cares about my needs more. I deserve a girl that dosent need breaks from me, like what the fucking is she going to do if we get married? Fucking sleep on a couch and not talk to me whenever she gets mad? Iâ€™m honestly thinking that she thought that this break would cause me to love me her, or want her more. The only thing Iâ€™ve realized is she really does not deserve me. Yet deep down I know that without her love I will ache for her. This girl is going to kill me, I let her get too close and now everything is letting me down. She's the girls of my dreams and yet she adores tearing me asunder. What do I even do.
