I think I need to go to a hospital.I dunno, Iâ€™m a danger to myself and possibly others. The hallucinations havenâ€™t been happening as often but theyâ€™re still happening. I think im losing my grip on my sanity. Nothing feels real. Iâ€™m 14 and i dunno how exactly ill tell my parents. They know of my anxiety and depression and Iâ€™ve been on meds but i dunno how theyâ€™d react if i requested going to a hospital for a bit. My parents are really nice but sometimes they dont realize how bad a sutuation actually is.
