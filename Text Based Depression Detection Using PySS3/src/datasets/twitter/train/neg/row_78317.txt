I tried to hang myselfI gave up, obviously. My neck is red, but I manage to undo the knot before I passed out (or whatever happens when you hang). I just really, really wanna die. I have no energy or desire to keep going, but I'm a coward that never follows through with my suicide plans. I just wish I could die on my sleep or on an accident. I feel kind bad imagining my parents finding my body.

The first time I had suicide thoughts I was 5. I just turned 24. I have been depressed for almost two fucking decades. My mom says that people that commit suicide are just born broken, I think that is my case. I've never been truly happy.
