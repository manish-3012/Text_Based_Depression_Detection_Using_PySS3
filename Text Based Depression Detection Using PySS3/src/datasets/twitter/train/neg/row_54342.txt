Iâ€™m doneIâ€™m done with life. Everythingâ€™s gotten worse even though I didnâ€™t think things could get worse. One of these days before the new year Iâ€™m gonna kill my self. Iâ€™ve already made up my mind. All Iâ€™m doing now is trying to figure out a way to do it. Currently Iâ€™m thinking of getting some pills and drinking myself to death. Does anyone know any other ways I could do it without it being too painful and without making a mess ?
