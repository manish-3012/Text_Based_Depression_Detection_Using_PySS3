Iâ€™m scaredIâ€™m at my worst iâ€™ve ever been right now, iâ€™m planning on killing myself the 30th of august  because i think thatâ€™s the perfect timing i just wished i didnâ€™t have a family so i couldâ€™ve done it a while ago. As i said before thereâ€™s no future for me but iâ€™m unable to do anything so i have difficulty showering, brushing my teeth, taking care of anything, studying for school or getting up in the morning. Because whatâ€™s the point? But to be honest i would like to just have a nice last year but i donâ€™t know how itâ€™s impossible for me to get rid of this feeling :/ I just hope i survive these last 9 months thatâ€™s it
