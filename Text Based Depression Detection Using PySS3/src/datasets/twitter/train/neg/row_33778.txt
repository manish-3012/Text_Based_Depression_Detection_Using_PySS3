Tonight I finally end it, but before I go I want to have a conversation.A real one, without the mask I wear to appear socially acceptable to society. I want to speak my mind without fear of rejection and without worrying about whether or not I might offend someone just by existing. I get it - I'm not what people expect. But other than being "different" I haven't done anything wrong. 

Tonight I end it but before I go, please talk with me. It can be about anything. I just want to have a conversation where I don't have to lie at least once before I die.
