I'll never amount to anything. Nobody will remember me for long.I look at all these famous people who have done such incredible things and then I look back at myself. I'm ugly, stupid, incompetent....unable to come even close to them. I'll never do anything worth remembering. So what's the point in living? When you die all that's left is the things you did, so if you never did anything important then what's the fucking point. Might as well die now since I know for a fact I'll never do anything important.
