Just realised i got scammed 20â‚¬ for calling a suicide hotlineHere de go again, noone available to talk on free voicelines so you end up calling another one charging you .80â‚¬ a minute.
No advices given at all, Guy didnt give Ã  fuck and time went by, 30 minutes in and im talking to noone, no more answers. 
Seriously whats so wrong with thÃ¨se hotlines? They definitely should be forbidden.
