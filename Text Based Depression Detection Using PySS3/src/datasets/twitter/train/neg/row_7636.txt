Tired of LivingI want to overdose on sleeping pills, but Iâ€™m not even sure what kind or how much to take for a 120lb f. It seems like the only way out.
I live in BC, Canada and all the suicide hotlines / chats only go until 1am.. which is pretty messed up in my opinion.. 
I know I probably donâ€™t even want to go through with it since I canâ€™t imagine my closest friends finding out..
But I literally just donâ€™t want to be here anymore, this may just transition into me ranting but I have a broken nose that my parents refuse to fix and it REALLY fucks up my image/confidence, I really canâ€™t stress enough how much my broken nose has fucked me up.
 I have a learning disability, itâ€™s called auditory processing disorder so itâ€™s not visible at all so every teacher in high school thought I was lazy and put no effort in, when in reality My brain was just SO SLOW and I canâ€™t make up ideas on my own (like starting to write a new sentence.. shit takes ages for me) I had to drop 4 courses to barely just get through senior year and Iâ€™ve done 2 summer courses.
I havenâ€™t gone to university for 2 years I personally feel like a fucking failure &amp; disappointment to my family. 
My dad is a computer software engineer &amp; my mom is a physiotherapist, they donâ€™t understand how hard it is in modern day world to get into university or get a job..
Iâ€™m clinically depressed and have social anxiety.
My family is completely dysfunctional, Iâ€™m very sure I was only born because my mom is pro life, my parents were supposed to divorce over a decade ago. My dad is a consistent alcoholic and all I do is argue with my crazy Irish mom constantly. 
I canâ€™t move out either because I live in fucking Vancouver where a tiny 1 bedroom apartment is 2 million dollars. My job is shit, Iâ€™m getting totally taken advantage of, they donâ€™t give me tips, they cut me off 2 hours into shifts &amp; Iâ€™m getting $55 paycheques. 
Iâ€™m going nowhere in life. Iâ€™m literally only still here because I like 3 of my friends, music &amp; my cat.
