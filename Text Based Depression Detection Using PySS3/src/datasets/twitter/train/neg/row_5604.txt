I want to off myself, but I'm not quite ready to die yetI was planning on hanging myself this week, but I'm having second thoughts. I've never been happy, and whenever I plan to kill myself, I never go though with it. I don't know why. It's not like my depression will go away. I guess I just keep hoping that I'll find a reason to keep going. I know that in either a few weeks or months I'll be planning suicide again. It's an endless cycle.
