Iâ€™m so lostHello, my name is Adam (16) and Iâ€™ve been struggling for years and Iâ€™m afraid. Through these past years thoughts of suicide, fear, anxiety Iâ€™m so close to my limit . Iâ€™ve been quiet for so long and Iâ€™m too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things Iâ€™ve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little Iâ€™ve experienced in life? Only time Iâ€™ve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging. All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because Iâ€™m still so afraid. During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression, social anxiety, and a eating disorder.
I was later transferred to a fucken group therapy for some reason which made me feel more anxious. Eventually before my last session with a 1 on 1 therapy she showed me my results from a daily check up on my feelings(which was a 2 - step survey for me and my mom/dad )
Come to find out as Iâ€™ve been putting feeling horrible and afraid/anxious everyday , my mom has been doing Iâ€™ve been doing absolutely amazing with me described as â€œhappiest sheâ€™s ever seen me, therapy has helped himâ€ 
I eventually was put on Sertaline (anti anxiety or anti depression Iâ€™m sorry I forgot) but I never finished my first prescription nor ever found the right type of anti depressant because my mom thought I only wanted the drugs so she took me off my recommended pill schedule after ~3 week and stopped me from taking them. All this time Iâ€™ve been feeling worse afraid of the damage/ worry Iâ€™ve caused them even more. 
Now here with everything going on, Iâ€™m as afraid as Iâ€™ve ever been . Iâ€™ve relapsed on cutting and have developed severe insomnia . Day after day feeling more hopeless, worthless questioning why am I still here? Whatâ€™s my motivation to move out of bed and keep going? I ask these to myself nearly every night almost having a break down everytime. 
Please Please Please someone.. anyone help me.
Iâ€™m so scared I might do something drastic, Iâ€™ve been shaped by fear and anxiety. Idk what to do anymore
