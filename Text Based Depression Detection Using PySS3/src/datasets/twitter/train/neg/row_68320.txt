donâ€™t want pity, just advice ðŸ–¤iâ€™m a 17 year old girl from illinois and iâ€™ve been struggling for a while now. thereâ€™s not a ton in my life to cause this; my job is super stressful but i enjoy it, i have a mentally/verbally abusive stepfather and my mother is hyper-emotional which takes a toll but isnâ€™t it. i have good friends, a longterm boyfriend whoâ€™s good to me (until recently but iâ€™ll get into it), i have things in life that keep me interested enough, but no matter what i just wanna end my life. 

iâ€™ve tried everything i know to, iâ€™ve been through therapy but my mom had me stop going and iâ€™m too busy to start again now (but iâ€™m too scared to tell anyone because the full extent of how i feel because i donâ€™t wanna be hospitalized or put on meds) 

the only person iâ€™ve told is my boyfriend, and i only told him because he noticed me taking things out on him and being upset all the time and i felt bad. he freaked out and now we fight about everything all the time because he said itâ€™s â€œnot fairâ€ to him. i know itâ€™s a lot to put on someone, but i promise iâ€™m not holding him back.

iâ€™m not planning on doing anything, but i canâ€™t get the thoughts out of my head and every reason to stay iâ€™ve exhausted. yes iâ€™m young and have life to live but who cares? havenâ€™t pet every dog? whatever. my parents would be sad? my mom just had another baby anyway, and my dadâ€™s so busy with good things in his life so iâ€™m sure theyâ€™d move on.

i just canâ€™t find any reason to stay anymore, and iâ€™m so tired of trying to fix myself. itâ€™s been almost a year, iâ€™ve tried everything i can think of, what can i do?
