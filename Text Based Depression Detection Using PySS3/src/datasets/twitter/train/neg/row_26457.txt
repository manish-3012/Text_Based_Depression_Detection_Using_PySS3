I am so damn ugly, I feel like taking a knife and peeling my own face( No face is better, than ugly face).Ugliness is one of the reasons I struggle with suicidal ideation. I hate the way I look and hate my ancestors even more. You can say anything about looks being subjective or positive thing, I won't buy it. 

People need to face the facts, not live in fantasy. Looks are looks. Beautiful is beautiful and ugly is ugly.

Positive and negative 
Good and bad
Beautiful and ugly

No amount of positive propoganda, few motivational quotes or examples of many ugly people would change it

I was watching Gotham today and there was a scene where Joker's face is stolen by his face.


No face was still better, than my ugly face.
