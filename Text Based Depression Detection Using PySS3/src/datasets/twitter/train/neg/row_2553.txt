To whom it may concern, my sweetest friends.As i stay here, these four walls are mine

only thing to change is the date and the time,

not sure if i'll ever find mend, close all the curtains, ignore calls from friends, 

why am i like this full of self loathe, I wonder if i'll ever be whole

the closer they get the more i retract, why am i selfish this way i react

sleep through the day, wake up at night

get a shower, get dressed then break down and cry

when will it end,  the pain divide, is this just me or a factor of life.
