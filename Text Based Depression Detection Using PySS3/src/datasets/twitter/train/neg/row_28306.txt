Can't take it anymoreMy mom who was my best friend killed her self 2 1/2 years ago out of no where. I am sitting in my bathroom with my belt across my lap wanting so bad to end it like she did. Nothing is the same since that happened. I am so bad in debt and my life is a constant downward spiral. I fear every day that my dad, brother or sister will end their life any day now because of what we went through. I just can't take it anymore and want to be with my mom. No one understands. It's so fucking hard to keep living like this
