I think I fucked up trying to help my suicidal friend.This is a thread that's about my friend, not actually me. 
He's been depressed for a long time, and I think what I did is never gonna be fixed.

I have been trying to help him, but today he said "good for you" when I said I've been trying to help him.

I snapped.

I cursed at him. 

I gave him what I guess you'd call tough love. 

I told him stuff like "Good for me? Good for fucking you!!! I've helped you so much! I've been helping you for you, not me." or something like that. I don't exactly remember everything, it's a blur.

And while lately I've felt almost angry because of how I've been trying to help him lately and I don't feel like I'm helping, I think I fucked up big time there. I hope things can be fixed.

Is there still stuff I can say to him after that? 

Thanks in advance. Sorry if I did anything wrong making this thread, It's kind of rushed and I've never posted here before.
