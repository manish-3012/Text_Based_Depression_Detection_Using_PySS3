I Feel Split in HalfI am on the verge of killing myself. I told a friend how I feel and he just told me to jog. I just want everything to end. I am tired. I am waiting for a chat from the Suicide Hotline, as talking on the phone is a huge anxiety trigger for me. I just want my head to be silent. I don't want to be here anymore. This nightly routine of wanting to die. i want it to end. i want to go home.
