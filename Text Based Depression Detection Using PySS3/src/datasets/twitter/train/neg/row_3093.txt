I don't actually have the energy to talk about itI just want to stop feeling so awful.  Can I just stop suffering.  I know there's nothing anyone can say to help, least of all *here*.  Best anyone can do is ask prodding questions that I don't want to answer honestly or don't know how to answer honestly and that just makes me more frustrated.  

"So why do you feel this way?" "Did something happen?" "What have you tried?" "Have you tried this?" "Do you have any hobbies?" "Have you talked to so and so?" "This is what it's like for me."  "Where do these thoughts come from?" "A therapist can help you."  I don't want to reflect on these things anymore. I'm either not good at it or it just adds to my exhaustion.   

I don't know maybe I wouldn't be here if I had truly abandoned hope but it's been too long with nothing to show for it and I just don't care enough to keep the flame alive and can I just extinguish myself.  There's nothing for you to say!  If I were reading this I would have nothing to say except "well, you seem kind of down, and I don't know how to help you", which is just the reality of things.
