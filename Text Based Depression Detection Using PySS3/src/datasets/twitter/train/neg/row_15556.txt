Life is just ouchI really donâ€™t think I have the capacity to hurt myself in any big scarring ways, but it just really hurts living everyday with this deep sadness.

The sudden realization of how people really are hit me like a brick wall. Iâ€™m still able to feel happy and have a good time, but overall itâ€™s just a momentary distraction from the overall sadness.

I want to know what helps other people get out of their funk and away from the ouch of life. Iâ€™ve stayed away from all drugs and alcohol, and will continue to do so
