I failed.I was thinking about my cats Arya, Max and Mia. I named them from my favorite Movies and TV shows now I'm thinking of what will happen to them when I'm gone. I was thinking of rehoming them on a shelter because I don't want them to be adopted separately. I want them to be together even when I'm finally gone. They don't deserve this but. I fail at life and if they ever understand me, I am really sorry and I love them very much.
