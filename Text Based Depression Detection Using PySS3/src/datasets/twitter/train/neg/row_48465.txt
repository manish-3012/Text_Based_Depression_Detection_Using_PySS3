I am so close to saying goodbye to everyoneFuck I am so done with life. I don't want to die but something's just weren't meant to be. I am basically about to have a negative bank account. What kind of father does that and can support their family with a negative account. Ok I can slave away 80 hours for two weeks of work to make barely 900$ . I am past the point of no return. I hope my wife can find someone who can make her happy. I can't. She deserves to be treated like a queen. I hope my daughter can find some happiness in the upcoming dark world. I'm not saying good bye yet but it's a matter of time shortly soon.
