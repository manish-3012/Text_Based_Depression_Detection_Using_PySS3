Suicide is NOT coward. Suicide IS a way to get out of this fucking horrible worldThe reason I'm post this is because people in my school don't understand my condition. I **did** have suicidal thoughts, but the people (at my school) just told me suicide is BAD, don't do it, how about other people, etc... Really? I consider suicide because there is no way out. It's NOT bad
