Where to seek help? How to overcome depression?Where do you normally go to "refill" your emotional hp (lack of better term sry)? I feel like i'm drowning this past few weeks, i normally have this outgoing personality as a mask and im scared of taking it off. Nobody believes me that im going through something rough (all i hear from them is git gud). 

i want to feel better than this, i really do but i dont know where to start. i dont have reliable friends, my only emotional support left me, i cant even talk to my parents about this. its like no matter what i do it will lead to a dead end.
