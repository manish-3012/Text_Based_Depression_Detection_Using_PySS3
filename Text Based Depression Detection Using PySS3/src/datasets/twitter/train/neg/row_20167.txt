I hate the word patheticI hate the word pathetic. I hate it when people call other people pathetic. It really pisses me off. I used to not really like a different word and when people called other people that but nowadays it's the word pathetic that I really hate. I just wanted to say that. Calling other people pathetic. Who are you to judge.
