I don't know if I can make it through a month of isolationI've been suicidal many times in my life. This is the first time I have a very tangible fear that I will not make it through. I feel too scared to call a hotline, I hate talking on the phone and will likely just hang up. I've been trying every online chat I can find and none of them are responding. I'm ready to die, but I'm so afraid of hurting my loved ones in an already scary, awful time.
