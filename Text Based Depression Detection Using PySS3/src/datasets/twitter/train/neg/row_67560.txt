Why does shit have to change so often???This year I started off good it seemed like it'd be a good year, duas were nice stuff was good had a great birthday and then 

BOOM yeah that's right fuck you, no happiness for you *how dare you have happiness* I'm changing your life for the worse

Then I started adapting like a normal human would about a week or too off fully adapting

Uh uh uh what do you think your doing? Having a good life? No way! Let's go!

I denied the change was happening until it did then I denied it and became a negative asshole to everyone, attempted suicide 6 times nearly succeeded once but sadly, did not.

Now I'm about a quarter of the way to adapting and then this guy says 

New year New change! Time to adapt again you good for nothing loser!

I have 3 weeks and I'm kind of rolling up into a ball and denying life is a thing

When I nearly succeeded suicide it was bliss that 30 minute period where my brain was being a piece of shit and recovering but I was unconscious (?) was bliss, I don't really remember it but when I woke up I did punch a massive hole in my wall that I was still here.

The only reason I'm not prepping yet is because I can't put that burden on my mum, she herself would kill herself if I was gone I know that.
