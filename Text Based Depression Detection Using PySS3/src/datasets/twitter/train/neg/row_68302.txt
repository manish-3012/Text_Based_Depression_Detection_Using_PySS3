I've been unemployed over a year and am running out of options. If I don't get anything in the next few months, I've made the decision to kill myself.I know that often times when there's a message posted like this in any sort of public forum, there's an assumption that the person on the other side is not thinking straight or is mentally unwell.  

That's not the case here.  I've actually put a lot of thought into this, considered it thoroughly, and have concluded that there's only one logical outcome.

I have been unemployed for over a year now.  I have networked, applied, considered other cities, everything.  I have done everything that is expected of me and then some.

I also have no resources left.  I've begun to live off of the charity of others, and I know that has its limits.

The constant rejection from potential employers and my inability to provide anything to those offering me support is telling me one thing plainly: I have no value whatsoever to this world.  

That in mind, there's only one solution.  I'm going to kill myself.  I'm going to give myself a little more time to see if anything happens.  And if it doesn't, I'm spending what money I have left to take one last vacation to enjoy life fully before I end it.

There's really just no other option.  It all makes sense, and if anything the realization and decision has made me more at peace than ever.
