This is a poem I wrote regarding my last attempt on May 23rd. I know it's not the best but it means a lot to me since I wrote it as a way to distract myself from jumping from a bridge and be done with it.She really thought that she was ready
_x000D_
she downed some pills, her hands not steady
_x000D_
Gulp and done, no, just some more.
_x000D_
She shuts the door. She's faint already.


_x000D_
_x000D_
Stars and skies upon your eyes
_x000D_
lies and lies and laughs and cries.
_x000D_
You're shutting down, realize it's done.
_x000D_
You'll soon be gone, was this the prize?


_x000D_
_x000D_
I see the light, my thoughts are dry.
_x000D_
Just black. I thought I would have cried.
_x000D_
Too late, it's time. So take my hand
_x000D_
this is the end. This is goodbye.
