Stuck living, in a perpetual hell.I've posted here so many countless times on various different accounts claiming I am going to kill myself. Please know that it was never ever deliberate lies. I always intended to kill myself every single time. This time I won't promise anything. I will change tactic, I will tell you guys the how and why, which I have not done before.

&amp;#x200B;

I was born to a mother who was a prostitute, she never cared for me, and I am unaware who my father is (probably a punter). I am the oldest of 8 kids. My mom never knew birth control apparently. I never knew my father, neither do my siblings. I'm 34, and have actively wanted to die since I was 12. I never had a serious girlfriend because I have a skewed view view of sexual relations (thanks to what my mothers profession was). I am quite dunk too, so my apologies if I mistake stuff or repeat things.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make it known I have absolutely no violent or ill will feelings towards anyone else. Just myself exclusively, I want to hurt and kill myself quite badly. I cannot say that about my siblings, and I do worry about them. All I can truly tell is that I want to remove myself from life's painful bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

Through it all though, I always had feelings. Always felt stuff. That kept me somewhat "normal", but everyone outside of my family that I ever met has thought I was a freak (I guess due to my unusual upbringing, and thus  always act unusually eventually). I never had a serious friend outside of my family, and lovers have been one night stands for the most part. I cannot make meaningful relationships (I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder) .

I refuse to promise anyone I will kill myself anymore, because I know now that is an attention seeking behaviour, but I know I want to, more than anything. Being here on this earth is hell for me, and there is no other way out.

If you read this far, thank you so much.
