Tonight's the nightI'm a worthless 24 (almost 25 year old) girl that nobody will ever love or support. I'm severely mentally ill and physically ill as well and can't keep down a job. I still live my parents. Supposedly I'm cute, but whoever tells you that gets you ahead is a goddamn liar. Looks barely matter. 

I've started the process. About 7 mg of klonopin in so far, along with half a tagamet and 50 mg of benadryl. Plan to take another 7 mg of klonopin and 75 mg of benadryl soon, along with whatever alcohol I can find in the house. Goodnight everyone. 

Fuck the USA and everything else. Eternal sleep is going to be amazing.
