Wtf why am I panickingIâ€™m so restless, I just had a breakdown why canâ€™t it be over? Normally I feel tired and a bit relieved after crying but not today. I want to die so bad, I just want to throw myself out of the window. The urge to just punch myself is so strong I fucking donâ€™t want to feel like this. Just let it be over just let it be over goddammit
