I don't really know anymoreI think my mom was the only person that I felt strong enough connection to 'stay alive for.' We've been getting into a lot of arguments because she keeps trying to drag me to church and say religious things and I tell her it would be meaningless and even sacrilegious if I were to just say shit to make her feel good inside, not to mention financial problems.

I think I'm emotionally detached from her enough to no longer feel like I should stay for her. And no, I don't want friends or shit like that to keep me thinking I want to stay alive. No, I'm not going to 'live for myself' because if I could do that, I would have offed myself a long time ago because ending everything is better than living through a shit life with uncertain potential of some good moments. After all, it's not like death is 'bad,' it just makes everything irrelevant to me.

I just wish there was a quick, painless way to go while leaving my body intact because I want to go with at least some dignity, although that too probably doesn't matter if I die.
