Obligatory life sentenceI feel like Iâ€™m forced to exist. Iâ€™m forced to have constant anxiety and depression that medication doesnâ€™t fix all because my parents couldnâ€™t wear a fucking condom. I just a broken person and in societies eyes if I end my suffering, Iâ€™m selfish. Itâ€™s just not fair. I didnâ€™t ask to be born broken, and Iâ€™m just trapped inside of my fucked up brain because if I end it, my parents will be sad.
