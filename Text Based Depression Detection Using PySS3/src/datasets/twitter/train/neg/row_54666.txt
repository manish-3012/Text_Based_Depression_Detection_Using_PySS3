Living is worse than dying.I have struggled with depression and anxiety ever since I remember. Bad childhood. Constant nerve pain from always being tense. I always want to cry. My wife of ten years moved out yesterday. Worst day of my life. I started researching efficient ways to kill myself. I decided I'm worthless and a bad person. Death is too good for me. I started researching the most strange and painful ways to die. I want the way with the most suffering. I figured more time = more suffering. I came to the realization that I will die anyway. Living is the most painful way to die. I research how to die of sadness. I realized my condition has ruined my life. I am angry at who I am. I have decided on a forward escape. I must become a different person. A different type of suicide. I think what I want to do and do the opposite. It hurts. Good. Life is pain. I deserve this. I will go get meds and will go to the gym. I'm on the edge every moment. I'm hanging on by a thread. I always have been. I have nobody to talk to. I am ashamed and embarrassed. When I'm alone I shed the mask and cry. I am trapped by my own mind. I see shadows out of the corner of my eye that dart across the room. They move like something alive. I hear people talking that aren't there. Paranoia. I'm trying to stay here. I feel like I'm in a lucid nightmare. I'm so tired. My senses are too sharp. Reality is too jagged. I need to think differently. I must go on. I'm an artist, so the plan is to paint every free moment. Maybe I can lose myself in obsession. My inspiration has been gone for years, other than a few moments of light. I'm trying. I feel like I'm dying.
