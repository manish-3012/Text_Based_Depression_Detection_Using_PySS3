I'm 16 years old and have been contiplating suicide for over 3 years now, i need to know how to keep motivation to liveI'm 16 like i said and i'm too overwhelmed about life and confused about this world, i have hardly any friends i don't know who i truly am, i would hate to leave everyone that cares and loves about me behind but i feel i just need to rest and die, to lift this burden of life off my shoulders. I feel like i will never get anywhere in life, no girlfriend, no friends, no job nothing, i never felt like i fit into this world and i just want to rest, i never tried to kill myself before but the feelings are getting worse. i never confronted anyone about this but i am very socially awkward even to my own family and feel they wouldn't think of me the same anymore if i did confront them about this. i need motivation and reason to keep living.
