i'm doneI can't do it anymore. I'm tired of dealing with everything. I'm jealous of the people who don't care about things as much as I do, who don't worry about their futures the way I used to do mine. I can't keep trying this hard in school, spending eight hours a day working just so I'll get accepted into an in-state college because I can't afford to go out of state. What is it even all for? I obsess over taking the hardest classes, sacrificing every other aspect of my miserable life. I haven't even been to a school dance or a football game. I haven't experienced life to it's fullest potential, and yet I don't want to. I don't want to keep living. There's no reason, after all, we will all die and our names forgotten once this world is gone. It's been like this for four years, a fourth of my life. I've been solely living off of temporary sources of happiness like video games but now that school is picking up again, I have nothing that fuels me further. I have no motivation left in me, nothing that pushes me on. I'm sorry to those that I know who may find this later on the line, but I need this right now. It's selfish, I know, but when was the last time I did anything for myself? All my life I've been forced to do things by others and having my own path carved out for me. I don't even have my own personality, or sense of identity. I'm sorry to those who are spending their own time reading this, but I just needed to put this somewhere in the likelihood that I go through with it. Thank you for letting me use this space.
