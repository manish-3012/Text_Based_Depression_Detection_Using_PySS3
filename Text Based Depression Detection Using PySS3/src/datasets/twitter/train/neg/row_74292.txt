Don't want to live life as a brain-damaged person anymoreTwenty years ago, I received a letter in the mail: I had the opportunity to leave my neighborhood gifted school for the chance to attend a slightly better gifted school. Not knowing any better, I said yes. One day at the new school, someone came up from behind me and slammed my head against the ground, causing me to lose consciousness and get a concussion.

I pretended that everything would be ok and that I would recover fully, but I'm now reading that concussions cause permanent brain damage, like dead brain cells, broken connections, and slower information processing times (studies suggest that these slower processing times are permanent). I'm thinking about the brain cells that might have been killed; it seems like a part of me is missing; it seems like a part of me has been stolen from me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done some research, and due to the statue of limitations, the perpetrator will never face any consequences.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also thinking about all of the mental health issues I've had in the past 20 years (depression, anxiety, OCD, Aspergers) and how they might have been related to this incident. My OCD and Aspergers make it hard to make friends or find a job; I'm currently unemployed and have been unemployed for 75% of my post-college life.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in counseling for 15 years and have tried medication, but I still suffer.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing about the permanent damage caused by concussions and the fact that I didn't have to be at that school has increased my depression by 300%. Nothing seems enjoyable anymore. Food tastes bland. Movies seem boring. Video games seem like a chore. What's the point of living if I can't feel any pleasure?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel responsible for what happened to me. If I wasn't at that school, none of this would have happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to live as a brain-damaged person anymore. I want to end everything. The only thing stopping me is the fact that there isn't a quick, easy, and reliable means of suicide. I've read that 90% of suicides fail, so I'd likely end up disabled and disfigured. But I want to end this pain so bad and feel that I'll eventually try.
