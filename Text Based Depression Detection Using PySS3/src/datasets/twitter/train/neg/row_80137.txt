Lonely beyond beliefI am very depressed. I haven't had a real relationship in years. I get to dating a girl and most often it's over in a month or less. (The last one lasted two weeks, half the time of which she had the flu.) My personality is a great form of birth control.

I think about killing myself a lot because of the loneliness. I just don't have any hope for future happiness. People tell me not to put so much weight on having a relationship, but without one I feel like an outcast. The longest relationship I've had in 20 years is 2 years and the second longest is 10 months and then everything else is under 3 months. I go years and years alone. I'm 51 and I can't do this much longer.
