Can you ever stop being a terrible unlikeable person or are you doomed to repel people over and over again?If everyone youâ€™ve ever known eventually wants nothing to do with you Should you even bother trying?

Im broken and I just canâ€™t see a way out of my predicament. I just want to make it all stop.
