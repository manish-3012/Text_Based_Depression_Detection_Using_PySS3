Please, just let me be done.I have a seizure disorder that has put me out of work and I can't drive so I'm stuck in the house each day all day. I am now experiencing agoraphobia-like symptoms because of this. I have no friends or family in the area. My husband leaves the country for work sometimes and I'm left for an entire week, at home, no interaction with others.

I am so depressed and such a burden on my husband. I'm fat due to the depression, and now that's made me more depressed and now paranoid that everyone is constantly judging me. My husband says that we'll get through this, everything will be ok and that he will support me in anyway he can. He promises he won't leave me but sometimes I wish he would to spare himself from all of this.

Just spent the last hour screaming/crying in bed for life to just cut me some slack for once. I finally got out of a traumatic/abusive home life, and now that I'm free I'm coming to terms with everything and it's really fucking with my psyche. I feel like I'm never going to escape these feeling of hopelessness, anxiety, paranoia, dred, slef hatred and overall crazy. 



Please just let me be done.
