Any older people (&gt;50 yo) on this subreddit who are considering suicide?I keep reading about young people in this group who are considering suicide but see few my age who like me. In general I think the case for suicide is much stronger for people my age or older. My options for overcoming my issues are much more limited because of the time I have left. Also I have lived a fairly decent life already so I won't be missing out on as many potential opportunities as someone who is younger. I know this doesn't apply to every younger person but I just know that when I look back on my life I can point to many good times and accomplishments that make my early exit easier to deal with. Things are going south for me now mostly financially and I just want to leave my family enough money from my insurance policies to help them overcome the mess I am leaving behind. Comments?
