I just want it to end.My mum recently died of cancer on the 6th of march and I watched her die i'm only 12 years old in high school and I haven't been going to school for about a week now I hate everyone at my school, everyone asks questions or makes fun of me i'm sick of it I want to start over or just end my life so i don't need to worry about anything the only thing thats keeping me distracted is video games and i'm probably going to get a shitty job when i'm older I just can't handle it anymore.
