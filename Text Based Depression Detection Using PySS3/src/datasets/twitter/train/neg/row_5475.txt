Iâ€™m going to end it but Iâ€™m scared toHello so Iâ€™m a 14 year old and Iâ€™m a freshmen, ever sense 6th grade Iâ€™ve wanted to die I had an attempt with bleach when I was 12 but I was rushed to a hospital and I ended living. Now in high school these thoughts are stronger and Iâ€™ve told my friends that Iâ€™m never happy and that Iâ€™m probably just gonna end up being dead and most of them just turn me being suicidal into a joke. One of them tries really hard, Heâ€™s really sweet to me but sometimes I feel like he gives up because I just never seem to get better and the worse thing to me about him is that I have gained feelings for him, feelings that Iâ€™ve never had for anyone else (Iâ€™m gay btw) but he is straight so he would never feel the same way Iâ€™ve accepted that but Iâ€™m not accepting the fact that even he is giving up and I think they wonâ€™t even be impacted by my death. I think the main reason Iâ€™m like this is because my mom, she has verbally abused me for years now telling me Iâ€™m useless stupid never gonna be anything and that Iâ€™m just a waste, and now that some of my friends joke about it  and/or giving up I donâ€™t think anyone would even care if I died there is no reason for me, my mom is right though I canâ€™t even manage to do good in school, whenever I do try I still fail she also forces me to do activities I donâ€™t want to do. Anyway I just wanted to get this off my chest. This is all Iâ€™ve wanted to say tonight bye.
