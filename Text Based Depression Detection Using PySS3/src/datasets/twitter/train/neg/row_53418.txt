Dreamt about suicide again.It's a recurring dream, it's very different from my real life because I'm discovered before I actually die and then I'm in the hospital and the object of worry. In the dreams I sometimes die, sometimes pull through. 

I can't decide if this is my brain's way of getting used to the idea of death or just a reminder that what I actually need is so far out of reach I can literally only dream of it. 

I wonder how much more I will have to go through before I will be allowed to sleep.
