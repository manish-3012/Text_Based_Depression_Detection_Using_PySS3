I'm not sure why I haven't killed myselfAt some point, I did think that the people in my life would be better if I wasn't around. When my girlfriend of six years broke up with me, I figured I might as well follow through with killing myself, since one of the most important people in my life decided that she was okay without having me in her life, that she would even be better without me involved.

I can't tell you why I didn't do it.

I still don't know if not killing myself was the right choice or not.
