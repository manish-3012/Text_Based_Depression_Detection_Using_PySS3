I feel brokenI thought I needed a break from all the stress to feel better but honestly spring break came around and I was depressed all through it. I feel sorry for all the people in my life who have to put with a shitty attitude and a depressed sack of shit. I dont understand how they deal with me. I've  become numb to it all I'm no longer scared of harming myself which isnt good probably, but what is there to do. I really have nothing left right now
