TrafficI'm not doing well. This morning it was beyond tempting to step out into traffic on my way to work. Same goes for getting real up close and personal with the train. I had a fight with my boyfriend this morning. I'm really good at being mean when I feel cornered. I said a lot of thins I can't take back. I'm afraid I am going to lose him. At this point I am almost certain I will. He's all I've got going for me. Not to mention all of these feelings of dejectedness and inadequacy came rushing back to me. I'm a manic depressive. I'm a manic depressive who's broke and hungry and my grandfather just died this past week and I've got a sinus infection I can't treat because I have no coverage and no money for antibiotics. These are just contributing factors. I can't stop clenching my teeth and I see no light at the end of the tunnel. Once again it is a very dark and very long path and I am scared I am going to have to traverse it alone all over again. I just got used to NOT being alone every damn day. Now it's just around the corner and I am so scared
