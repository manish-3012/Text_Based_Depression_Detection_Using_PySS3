I just don't want to bother other people with my existence anymoreWhenever people say good things about me, it's just because they don't know me well enough yet. Once the real me comes out, they run. Or at least, the smart ones do.

Part of me is hoping I might have the courage to do it today. I have a bath and razor blades. Let's get it over with. Let's go.
