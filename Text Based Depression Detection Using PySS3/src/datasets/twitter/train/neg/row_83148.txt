I even failed at giving up.I was moments away from ending it last night, and I couldn't. Literally all I had to do was move one finger and it would have finally been over.

Been fighting depression for 15 years. Lost the best job I've ever had yesterday, and the chances of me finding a job I can actually hold with my issues are slim to none. Medications and treatments have all been only partially effective. I'm 28 and I've wasted my whole life on just trying to stay alive and functional, and I'm so tired. I just want to be done. I want this to be over.

When I was young, I promised myself that I wouldn't be one of those people slogging through life in a job they hate. I promised that I would do something that I love.

I think if I knew then how much of a failure I'd be now, I just would've saved myself the pain and ended it then.
