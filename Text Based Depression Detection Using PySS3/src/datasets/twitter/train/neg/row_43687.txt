Feeling just like I shouldn't be anymore.Don't really know why I'm posting this. Not going to kill myself right now but the thought keeps creeping in. 

I had such a strong will to live before that I never thought I'd even consider it. Now I just think that I'm such a bad person and go through so much shit I could just be at peace for once. 

The only time I'm at peace is when I'm sleeping and now I can barely do that. I just don't understand the point if it all. It's all just suffering and pain even when I'm trying to make others happy. I can't make myself happy for more than a few hours. Even that is hard. I just want it all to stop and now I don't really know what matters anymore.
