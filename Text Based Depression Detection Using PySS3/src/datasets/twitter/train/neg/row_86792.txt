I dont know what to doIt started in 2019 when I told my therapist about my rape in second grade by another second grader. after that I told my parents and they seemed supportive. So I told my bestfriend( who is friends with my rapist) and she said nothing. She is still friends with him and I think it's because she don't belive me og she dosen't care.  Today I started thinking that maybe people that I have told might think that since it happened to me at such a young age by another 8-year old that I might have given consent. Which I didn't. At that age I did not grasp the consept about sex but I knew I didn't want a boy touching me down there. Since there was a third guy there who saw it he spread it. Everyone knew and I would get asked about it until 8th grade. I regret telling it and now I'm afraid of how my parents and the friend that I told are viewing me. It's 5 am and I'm crying cause I wanna take it back, but I can't. And the only way for me not to think about it anymore is too kill myself.
