Hurt, but tell myself itâ€™s fineI grew up in a very abusive home, my dad - the only person that had my back, passed away when I was 16. My mother, during an argument, let it slip that she wished she had aborted me. I knew she grew up with much more abuse than I did, being angry meant it was okay to hurt someone. My ex is also physically and sexually abusive, extremely possessive and Iâ€™m in constant worry that someday I wonâ€™t be able to hide from him. 

I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a single day where I donâ€™t think about suicide. 

In person I am very happy, friendly, optimistic.
I play the extrovert card very well and constantly fight to make sure people only see me as a positive person. I take everything thrown at me and turn it into a smile if I know anyone is looking. Iâ€™ve gone to work bruised and sleepless, Iâ€™ve given and given even if it leaves nothing for myself - i.e. money, physical things, my home, but Iâ€™ll avoid going in too much detail there, I am currently living at home and no longer in my car. Iâ€™ve been expected to give, even if I subconsciously donâ€™t want to.

I thought to myself that by pretending I was happy, it would ultimately make me happy. 
In that, people I care about began to expect me to be the way I always try to be. 

At work I canâ€™t let myself slip for half a second without my coworkers demanding whatâ€™s wrong, I canâ€™t say no without them wondering if they did something wrong. It hurts that I refuse to leave my mother, sheâ€™s getting old and tired - but despite the constant emotional turmoil, I wonâ€™t leave. It hurts ; That I donâ€™t call the cops on my ex for fear of ruining his life for having him arrested. That I donâ€™t look for help for myself and self debilitating habits, that I let my bank account fall negative too many times while trying to help anyone that asks.
This turned into more of a vent than anything, I canâ€™t even pinpoint what I meant to say originally.

My birthday is on saturday

I donâ€™t want to make it to then. All I remember is every year that went wrong, every year that I was raped, beat, forced to play it up for family members that were always condescending toward me. This year Iâ€™ll be alone, my mom is getting medical treatment and staying with my brother. There is nobody but me. I pushed away all the friends I had so that they couldnâ€™t see whatâ€™s been going on my entire life. My last friend is moving out of state in a month.

I know whatever statistics say that people that say theyâ€™re going to kill themselves donâ€™t typically go through with it, I canâ€™t predict the future. 
I just wanted to give myself a chance at, not so much being heard, but knowing that I said my peace somewhere. 

Please, stay kind.
