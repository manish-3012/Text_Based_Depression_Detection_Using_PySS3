Figured I should post this somewhereHey Reddit, dunno if anyone will care about this, but I figured I should put this somewhere in case I muster up the courage to do something tonight. Y'all are one of the few places I feel like would understand. Anyway, I guess this counts as my note:


Everyone talks about life likes its some great honor to exist, that it's a blessing instead of this insufferable curse that does nothing but spit on you and kick you until you're down. 

I used to believe that I had purpose, like some sort of idealistic fool. What a wonderful lie, that Pandora's box, that hope might be considered a positive emotion instead of the worst of them all. What other feeling can possess someone so fully that they seem willing to continue in the face of such overwhelming odds. 

Dunno what could exactly is pushing me to write this, as though it'll matter to someone somewhere out there. I must be one of the worst narcissists to ever be shit out of this disgusting rock. Figure I should provide some context as to my thought process, maybe psychiatrists will debate over if they could have done something to prevent it, as though this cancer in mind is something that can be changed, that I can be saved. 

Despite all this, I find myself filled with remorse, that I was foolish enough to create attachments, that I hoped they would provide me with the purpose that I so desperately sought. Who knows, maybe God does exist, that they thought it amusing to put me in their lives, knowing full well that I'm a time bomb just waiting to explode, ruining everything in my path, tearing them up as I sever the bonds to my anchors that have struggled to keep me here. 

I'm happy with this prospect, that my death in all ways is the thing that keeps me moving forward. I guess it's fair for me to be selfish, I've done this for 21 years for others, may as well try doing this for me. So long and goodbye, wish that I could say that it's been good, but I'm tired of lying to everyone.
