First time ever telling anyone in real life that I am suicidal: I broke down crying, but they understoodI am 23 years old and I have had suicidal thoughts ever since I was around 8. However, these past few months have been the worst in my whole life: never before had I felt so terribly bad in every way at the same time, I am emotionally and psychologically obliterated.

So, I visited the psychologist. I never do, and I have only payed 3 visits to an specialist in my life, this one makes the 4th. I told her about my case, and cried quite a bit when I got to the suicide part.

She understood, and warned me about how horrible it would be if I actually did kill myself. My parents would be destroyed and would never recover: as soon as she mentioned that, I broke down crying. It is very true.

**Conclusion:**

I never thought my life would get to this point. I always told myself there would come a day where I would start doing things right, and I would prove myself worthy to the world, and I would finally be proud of what I am and I would finally have achieved happiness.

Not only have I not reached that, I have actually gotten LOWER and lower throughout the years. My life has never been as miserable as it is today. This is the worst period I have ever lived.

Up until now, **suicide seemed only an idea, despite the fact I was truly considering it, because I had never told anyone about it**. The fact that I actually said it in real life, in a real conversation with another person, was horrifying. It made the topic seem so much more real, even though it the possibility had been in my head for so many years.

I never expected to see myself in a psychologist's room telling them about me considering suicide. I never thought this day would come, but here we are.

Stay safe and strong, everyone. You all can get better.
