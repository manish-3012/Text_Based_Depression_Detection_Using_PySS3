Do I deserve to live..Im a horrible person. I keep making mistakes. I keep making the wrong choices and it makes me a horrible person. I want to be good but I end up upsetting people but it's the opposite of what I want. I have no bad intentions and Im too scared to explain myself so I just proove that I'm a bad person.
I don't deserve to live. Not with all the bad choices I've made..
