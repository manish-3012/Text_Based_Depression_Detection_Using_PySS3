I took 14 pills of Tylenol and 4 pills of ReactineI've honestly been dealing with a lot of crap and the person that I genuinely loved was the one that finally tipped over the pile of stress that I have. Imagine someone tell you, that they don't know what changed and what made them stop feeling their love for you. As I took the pills yesterday night, he only told me to tell my parents. Tried calling me once, but that's it. When I got discharged from the hospital around 8:30, I tried calling him but he won't answer. I let him be for a little bit but I spammed his phone with calls and texts as soon as I woke up. Called him on discord, snapchat, instagram, and his own phone. No answer. I just want to hear his voice so that all the thoughts in my head will be gone.
