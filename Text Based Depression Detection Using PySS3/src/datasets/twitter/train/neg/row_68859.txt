stuck in an impossible situationI should start off by saying I was hospitalized in November due to my boyfriend cheating on me. He had texted another girl for a day, and sexted and flirted. I was hospitalized because I was so physically anxious that I couldnâ€™t calm down. I was told Iâ€™m borderline and depressed, and they put me on Cymbalta. Made me worse. They put me on Wellbutrin and lamictal, I see no difference because I feel like the depression and suicidal thoughts are due to this situation. I had to drop out of college thatâ€™s an hour away from my home (Iâ€™m 19) and had to move home. Iâ€™m back with my boyfriend after talking things over, but my mom is giving me strict rules. I canâ€™t go see him, if I do I get kicked out. Iâ€™m not allowed to go out, I canâ€™t go back to school until I pay off my debt (11k) so I canâ€™t go back for a while. Sheâ€™s emotionally abusive I think, sheâ€™s not as bad as when I was a child, but itâ€™s bad. I feel so much more suicidal and depressed living at home, and I know sheâ€™s going to find out Iâ€™m back with my boyfriend soon and kick me out. Iâ€™m stuck at a minimum wage job and I feel like a failure. How am I supposed to work on my health when I feel like Iâ€™m a burden to everyone at my house, and get treated as such. I feel like the only way out of this situation is to kill myself. Iâ€™m never going to get better and Iâ€™m so tired of being alive. I donâ€™t know what else to do other than die to escape my pain and my living situation.
