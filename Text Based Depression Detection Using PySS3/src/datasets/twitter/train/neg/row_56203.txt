Hello everyoneIâ€™m 26 M and i have severe anxiety and depression. I was supposed to commit suicide next month but it has shortened to this week due to toxic people around me . I have been suicidal since 10 but video games has cope with it until last week but i donâ€™t play any games anymore and now i am experiencing it again.  Video games made me happy all these years and i have pIayed a lot of games such as cod, single player games, and tekken. I have told my friends about this and they donâ€™t know how to help me but tell me to seek professional help. I really need them to talk to me to make this feel better. My best friend dog recently died and my relationship with my former girlfriend got ended. I never feel loved by anyone. My inner voice always tell my to kill myself because i am worthless, no future, and many more. My family isnâ€™t open to deep talks and theyâ€™re toxic. They pulled me into working out, i did and i showed iâ€™m fine with everything because it would be pointless to talk to them. I have planned 13 ways to kill myself in case this one failed. I have chosen to shoot my head or heart with my gun because it is the fastest to do. In case you guys havenâ€™t heard from me again(update or any activity here) i wish you guys have a good life instead
