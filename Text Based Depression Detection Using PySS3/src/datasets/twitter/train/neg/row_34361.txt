I just canâ€™t be arsed anymoreI cannot be fucking BOTHERED with it anymore. There is just no escape from feeling like utter fucking shite. I have no motivation to do ANYTHING but sometimes go to therapy which doesnâ€™t even help. I have plans on what I want to do with my life but I canâ€™t be fucking arsed to get on with it because whatâ€™s the point? And what if I fail! I couldnâ€™t be arsed getting older, watching my parents die, sticking around to see if it all gets better? I just couldnâ€™t give a single fuck about any of it. I donâ€™t want to deal with anything anymore. Iâ€™ve fucking had enough I just want it all to stop but Iâ€™m too much of a lil bitch to do something about it. I donâ€™t want to chicken out last minute. I donâ€™t want to die in pain and I donâ€™t live anywhere where guns are readily available (even with that itâ€™s messy af and I donâ€™t want to traumatise anyone) I just wish there was a big button I could press and magically drop dead.
