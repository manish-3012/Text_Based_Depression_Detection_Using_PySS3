Going crazy here..So me and my boyfriend fight sometimes, but I'm getting close to drowning myself because of it, and this quarantine is driving me insane and I'm stuck with the same 4 people every day and it's going to make me kill myself before long if I'm not allowed to see some1 other than my family, I'm going fucking crazy I can't do this much longer....
