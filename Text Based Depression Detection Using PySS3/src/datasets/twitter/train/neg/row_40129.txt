Seriously considering suicide19M I donâ€™t have any financial problems and my life is stable but I just truly donâ€™t feel like life is worth continuing. I have no aspirations, nor any relationship; and I only have a small handful of somewhat close friends. I feel so incredibly alone and isolated and I donâ€™t see any end in sight. I used to really want a relationship but at this point I really donâ€™t care anymore, and I donâ€™t want to burden someone else. My job requires I have a loaded weapon on me at all times so itâ€™d be really easy. Is there anything really worth living for? Itâ€™s just work until weâ€™re old and then wait until we die.
