Nobody cares about meIâ€™m so fucking lonely. I feel like Iâ€™m slowly going insane. Itâ€™s so obvious that I self harm and that want I want to kill myself so badly. I fantasize about my death almost everyday and imagine how everyone would react. So what if I hurt people, if they cared about me they would listen to me. Everyone just thinks Iâ€™m joking about my suicide or they donâ€™t take me seriously, not even my own mom takes me seriously. Iâ€™m honestly so done, Iâ€™m so worthless and I deserve to die. Sadly I havenâ€™t been successful in killing myself, Iâ€™ve only been able to cut my wrists but they never go deep enough to actually kill me. Iâ€™m so fucking lonely, nobody knows Iâ€™m suicidal and Iâ€™ve kept it to myself for several years. I just want my life to end already and the fact that people donâ€™t take me seriously just makes me want to die even more. I feel so much better after saying this, even if it means other strangers know about my suicide thoughts. Iâ€™m just so fucking angry, people say if youâ€™re depressed you should always tell someone you trusts but everyone I told could fucking care less. Until I find a way to end my life I guess Iâ€™ll just have to suffer until then.
