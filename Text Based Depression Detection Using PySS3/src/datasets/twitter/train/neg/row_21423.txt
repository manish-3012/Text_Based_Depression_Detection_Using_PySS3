Have 60 - 1mg Xanax. Thinking about taking them all. Don't know why I'm even postingIt's all too much. It hurts everyday. My sleep is only when I have peace. I just want that forever. I guess I just need to talk with before slipping away.

I have no job. Lost a 6-figure salary. 

No insurance.

No family except for my wife and pets. They're the only reason I haven't done it sooner. 

No friends  

Nothing.
