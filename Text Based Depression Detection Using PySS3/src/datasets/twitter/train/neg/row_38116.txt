I didn't think I'd be hereI've been on antidepressants for a while. I thought everything was okay, but then drama between a group of my friends happened. I feel like everyone got hurt, but I feel like I only ended up hurting my friends more and I feel like I only cause others pain.

The only reason I'm still alive is because I know other people care about me, even if I don't understand it. I wish they didn't. I wish nobody cared about me, so I could kill myself without regret. Every time I think I'm going to be happy I somehow fuck it up. 

I wish I could do something, but I can't. I'm stuck here hurting. I hate it. I hate this. I hate myself. Fuck, I wish I could just kill myself.
