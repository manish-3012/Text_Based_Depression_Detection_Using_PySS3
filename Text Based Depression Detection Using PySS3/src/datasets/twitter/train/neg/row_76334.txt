I want to commit suicide.I have attempted many overdoses. thought many times about leaving the house to go jump off a bridge. I hate my life. My girlfriend just told me she's not allowed to date me anymore because of her dad and that just brought back the suicidal thoughts. I started taking venlafaxine not too long ago for major depressive disorder, and so far it hasn't done jack shit. I really am tired of life and everything going opposite of the way I wanted it to go. I just want to end it all, but I'm afraid of hurting anyone else as a result.
