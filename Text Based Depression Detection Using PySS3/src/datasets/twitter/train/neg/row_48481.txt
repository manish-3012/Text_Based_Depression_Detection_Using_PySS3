Suicide Hotline is a Joke Pt. 2I decided to give it another shot because my therapist and I talked about taking steps to prevent my death. I promised to give suicide hotline another chance. I have a literal video of myself trying to click and type in the white chat box and it wonâ€™t work. It is something out of nightmares. I feel fucking trapped. How am I supposed to have anyone help me out of these thoughts when no one is here? Suicide hotline SUCKS FUCK THEM they need to fix the online chat feature. Never giving them a shot ever again. So what are my options now?
