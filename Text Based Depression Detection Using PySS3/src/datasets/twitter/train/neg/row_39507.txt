Please help meMy mum had me at 16, my dad beat her constantly and my nan put her into care. Sheâ€™s a beautiful person but Iâ€™ve treated her like shit because she took drugs because of the mental issues she developed and I had resentment. After going through all of that she has an evil child. Iâ€™ve made her life hell. Iâ€™ve ruined it. But if I kill myself Iâ€™ll ruin it even more because all of that shit she went through would have been for nothing. Every relationship Iâ€™ve been in Iâ€™ve been cheated on and emotional abused. I was bullied in school. No one wants me. Iâ€™ve ruined so many lives. I just want to die. What do I do? I have such bad anxiety that I donâ€™t have a job and my life will amount to nothing.
