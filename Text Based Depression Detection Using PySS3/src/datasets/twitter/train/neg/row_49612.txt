Worried about son with depressionHello this is a throwaway account.

I'm pretty certain that my son has depression but he won't admit it to us. He sits in his room all day and never comes down often anymore. I came into his room earlier today and he told me that he recently reset all of his electronics including his ipad, phone, computer and xbox. After I asked why, he struggled to come up with an excuse. Is this a red flag for suicide? I know people usually give away their belongings beforehand and maybe this is related to that.
