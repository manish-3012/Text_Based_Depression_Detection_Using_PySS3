The fear and pain are overwhelming I'm pysically and mentally falling apart.  I've always been extremely weak and sensitive.  I'm in my 30's and haven't accomplished anything in my life.  I have severe panic disorder and have been agoraphobic for years.  I refuse to drive more than a mile from my house.  I've never gotten the help I need to get better.  Yes I know I should see a psychiatrist but I CANNOT get to the doctor's office.  I saw a regular MD that berated me for being a drain on the people in my life. My family gave up on trying to help me.  My boyfriend is giving up as well.

I allow people to walk all over me because I am severely afraid of confrontation.  I've been fighting this for over 18 years.  I said back then that I would kill myself but first I would see how long I could make it.  Well, I think I found out how long.  Now.  It scares me how simple it is to end it all.  I am literally a few steps away from my firearm at all times.  It's right there staring me in the face.  It gives me some comfort to know its there.  I honestly don't want to end it all but I just can't stand the pain and constant fear.
