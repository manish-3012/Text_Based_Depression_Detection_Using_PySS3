Iâ€™m mentally unwell and nobody cares
I posted 2 rants on 2 communities asking for help and support and Iâ€™ve gotten nothing. I feel like if I screamed at the top of my lungs no one would hear me. If I shot myself in the head in a crowded area no one would bat an eye. Why should I care if Iâ€™m gone.
