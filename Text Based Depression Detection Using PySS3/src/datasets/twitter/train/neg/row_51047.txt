I just wish I wasnâ€™t hereI want to die but Ik I canâ€™t kms bc people actually care about me not only that but Iâ€™m a chicken and couldnâ€™t follow through if I wanted to. The pain would end for me but it would burden those I care about. Ik itâ€™s just a voice in my head telling me all the wrong things but over time it went from just a meaningless thought once in a blue moon to something I think about often. My life is fine I have friends and family who love me, I do ok in college and have a seasonal job. I feel bad for feeling this bad when nothings really WRONG. Still I canâ€™t shake this feeling that my family only loves me bc theyâ€™re obligated to bc I am blood. ( I was an unplanned pregnancy to a teen mom) I often been referred to as the â€œblack sheepâ€ and â€œgifted kidâ€ in my family and I feel like that set me back bc I now lack that resilience and ambition to strive for something when the going gets tough. Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s their fault tho bc Ik that if I want to blame anyone for my shortcomings itâ€™s myself. Iâ€™ve tried and tried and tried to better myself to think positively, and eat better, be more active, healthier sleeping habits, setting attainable goals for myself but I lack that follow through. Throughout my life Iâ€™ve often been treated like my feelings werenâ€™t valid or unreasonable at the time. At first I could care less about all these things but overtime they have slowly chipped away at my resolve and indifference and I feel like Iâ€™m breaking. I donâ€™t really want to die, Iâ€™m scared to die. But I canâ€™t help but feel a little happy when I think about dying on accident like a car wreck or gas leak, so I donâ€™t have to do it myself. I just wish I wasnâ€™t here. I just wish I never existed at all.
