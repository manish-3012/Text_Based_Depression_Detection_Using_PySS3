Going on 40It is not better yet just more isolated and feeling more pathetic.. I make a decent living as I can pay my bills. All the hard work doing things right pulling bootstraps is BS it is still the same worse health better finances and ready to  say fuck it.Starting to think cancer diagnoses in mid life is a relief more than a burden at least for us without families. Why am I  here why do I wake up wishing I didn't or toss and turn all night not knowing where I screwed up so bad to get me here. Younger crowds make mistakes have regrets do things wrong because my life of doing things right is horrible just a empty nothing.At worse you end up where I am now a pathetic lonely loser with much regret. Can't get much worse.
