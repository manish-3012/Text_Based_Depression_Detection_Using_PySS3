I just feel depressedI haven't talked to a doctor or a therapist about my depression and how I feel because I'm scared that no one will believe me. I just kinda feel depressed and worthless for no apparent reason and have suicidal thoughts pretty much daily even though I have a lot of friends that genuinely care about me, loving parents and pretty ok grades. Some people may think it's just a phase because I'm in my teens now but I have felt this way since I was about 8 or 9 and had a few suicidal thoughts in kindergarten. I find no reason in waking up every day to do the same shit every single day of my life and don't eat in the mornings and that makes me much thinner than my friends. I don't really know what's going on.
