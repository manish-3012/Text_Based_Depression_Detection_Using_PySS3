Here I am againFuck it. Too fuckin tired to even talk about it. 
Just want to let you guys know how well you've supported me. Thank you. I would have been long gone if it wasn't for you.

I probably won't do it. Too much responsibilities have been bestowed to me. 
I'll live for now, but this life is not mine. A life lived for others.
