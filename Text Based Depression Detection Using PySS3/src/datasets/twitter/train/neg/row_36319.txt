I just want it to stop.I'm a 28 year old gay guy with no job. The only thing that keeps me here is my family and my online gaming friends. I wish I was straight and that I was someone else. I feel like I dont fit in and that everyone in my life would be better off without me. I just feel so lonely and depressed. I have no active plans to end it, but I just want it to stop. I wish I was never born in the first place
