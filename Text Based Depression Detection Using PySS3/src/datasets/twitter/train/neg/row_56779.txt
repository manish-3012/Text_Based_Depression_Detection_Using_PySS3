I am totally free to do whatever I want, and it makes taking that final leap look *really* attractive.(preface: been a wildly depressed shit since I was 12, late 20s now)

When I was a teenager, I had a period of almost complete freedom while at the height of my depression and self harm tendencies. This means I got a few halfhearted attempts in pretty frequently. Nothing to keep me in check, or accountable.

Then as an adult, I got in a relationship with a really harmful abusive man. It was awful. But, he kept me "in line". It was the worst thing ever, but it kept me alive. My struggles with suicidal ideation were shamed, I was made to feel guilty. I was kept under literal lock and key if he was gone too long, with frequent check-ins to ensure I wasn't attempting anything. I was told to lie to doctors to avoid being admitted. But I was alive, despite all this.

Then a few years ago, I escaped that hell. And now I'm free. And it's amazing. But it also means there's nothing stopping me. No friends, no family, no legacy I'd be abandoning. I'd be a mild inconvenience to my landlords, and distant relatives might peek at my facebook and wonder where I went. 

And in a sick, horrible way, I miss feeling trapped and controlled. At least I had someone who made a concerted effort to keep me alive, even if it was just to be used. 

It's all fucking gross and I want it to be fucking over
