My parents are royal cunts, and I'm their servant.My parents force me to do tasks that I have no option choice or reasonable ability to do so. The other night for example, I threw up after not feeling good for several days. My father came to me, at 3 am, and all he said was clean it up before he wakes up in the morning. They cut off my internet access early in the night, meaning with schoolwork on top I maybe get 30 minutes to communicate with friends outside of school, 30 minutes where I'm free from my parents. Life has been very depressing since I was young, maybe 9 years old, and I've thought about suicide before, buy never had the balls to do it. My younger sister on the other hand, is also a royal cunt. She got most of the gifts at Christmas, and all I got were some clothes and some iTunes cards which my parents would probably end up getting, since I am an android/windows user. I am on the edge right now, feeling so alone, and I am clueless on where to go or what to do.
