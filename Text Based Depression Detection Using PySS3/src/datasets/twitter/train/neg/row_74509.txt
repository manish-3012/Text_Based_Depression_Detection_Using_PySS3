scaredI've been spiraling for the past couple of weeks due to verbal and mental abuse I had experienced from my mother in december/january.
It's hard to wake up and go to school. it's hard to get up. depression and anxiety runs in my family so this comes w no surprise to me, my anxiety has gotten worse and am most definitely depressed. 
I dont think i would ever act out on it but the thought of hurting myself and leaving everyones lives would be for the best, its been heavy on my mind for the past couple of days. I've gone to a few friends about it and they reassure me with love and positivity but it still isnt enough. 
My boyfriend hasnt been due to clashing schedules, i went to him with this and he reassured me too, but i cant help but feel that im a nuisance and he would be better off if i wasnt there. 
this is the first time ive come to this point and i dont know what to do. my thoughts scare the hell out of me.
