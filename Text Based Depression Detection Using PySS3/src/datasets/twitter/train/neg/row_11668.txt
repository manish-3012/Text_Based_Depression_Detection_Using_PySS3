Im probably gonna head out before the end of this weekend.I'm extremely jealous of people who are capable of being happy. I wish I could be too. I want so badly to get better and enjoy life. Unfortunately it isn't an option for me and I'm suffering constantly and every day gets worse. I really wish I had a gun or a shit ton of vicodin but unfortunately we're gonna have to do this the messy way. If I get caught and attempted to be "saved" I'll just have to attack the cops and pray they kill me. I cannot fail, I can't afford to go to a hospital and things will get worse for me while everyone tells me how happy they are I survived, not caring that surviving will make everything infinitely worse.
