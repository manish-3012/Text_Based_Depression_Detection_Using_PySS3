Im something im notEver since i entered middle school my personality has almost faded. Now in just a shell of person. I just put a mask on and tell everyone that im this bright person with lots of energy. some im silent teen. To my parents im a monster. I feel lost. I dont care to live like this. I have debated over and over "do i really matter"? My will to live is strong but i dont know if i can follow that will.

All the fights. All the mental trauma. All the scars physical and mental have made me into this. My parents have seen them. I dont really care but they seemed to care. But the thing is i dont care about them...

I have become this stoic person without feelings. Some people have told me "are you depressed or something" i just respond "no". 

I dont care if somebody has opinion on me. I dont care for anything. Someone dies? "Cool". I get a gift "why?". Someone cares about me"you will just get hurt". 

Truly im a horrible person. 

Truly i should die.
