When is a good day?Iâ€™ve boiled it down to that. What day is a good day to die? Iâ€™ve been sitting in the bookstore for hours, looking at self help books, classic literature, and trashy romances. Nothing seems to be moving this dark cloud. 

I called a suicide hotline, like some kind of after school special of my 1980s childhood and was left feeling worse than when I started. Itâ€™s so fucking embarrassing to have these horrible thoughts. Iâ€™m around hundreds of people who have no idea the only thing from killing myself is the coffee in my hand and the current dislike of rural locations in the dark. 

Maybe Iâ€™ll go home tonight. Maybe I wonâ€™t. I have no desire to explain myself to another person whoâ€™s going to tell me to cheer up and look at all I have to live for. Honestly, it isnâ€™t about not having something to live for. Itâ€™s about not being able to tackle my demons. I feel them inside me. I feel shame. I see men around town who had sex with me when I was barely a teenager and wonder if they feel bad about it. Maybe they donâ€™t even remember me.
