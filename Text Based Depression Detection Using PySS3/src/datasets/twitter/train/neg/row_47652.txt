Tired of being an NPC in my own life.I'm tired of being called "Excuse me", I tried of having to sell my life to a company that treats me like the package in a game of pass the parcel, that no-one wants to end up with. I am worth nothing and I will never be anything more than a waste of resources. I don't think I can last another week like this, the useless burden with no agency in my own life. No friends, no hope, no choices, no point. I've stocked up on pain killers for this moment. I guess I just wanted someone to know and this is the only way.
