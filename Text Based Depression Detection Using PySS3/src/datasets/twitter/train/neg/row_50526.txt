self harming againive started to self harm on a daily basis again, and to be honest its the only thing keeping me from ending it all. self harm is the only coping mechanism ive found that actually works. ive told my parents, and they said to stop but wont send me anywhere because the cuts arent super deep. they wont set up another appointment with my therapist because ive told them i dont like her, so theyre working on finding a new one. they dont realize that i need someone to talk to in the mean time. a professional. i just want to go to inpatient, maybe even residential. things are too hard right now. i need a BREAK.
