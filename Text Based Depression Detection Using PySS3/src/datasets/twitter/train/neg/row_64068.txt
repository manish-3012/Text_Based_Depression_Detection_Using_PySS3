What would you consider suicidal thoughts?For about the past few months Iâ€™ve been having these thoughts but Iâ€™m not too sure if theyâ€™re actually suicidal. Iâ€™ve been taught that suicidal thoughts are when you want to commit suicide and all. My thoughts are more of what Iâ€™d do if I decided to do it. I have a plan but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll use it any time soon. I constantly think of how things could turn out. Who would find me, how people would react, what would happen if I lived, How my relationships with other people would turn out due to that etc.. 
Are these still suicidal thoughts?
