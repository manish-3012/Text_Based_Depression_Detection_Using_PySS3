[25/F] Struggling and ScaredHi. I'm not entirely sure how to put everything into words.. I just, don't have anyone. My partner of 3 years left me, 10 days ago. Just "didn't want to do it anymore." He was my entire future, we had planned half a wedding, chosen kids names etc. He told me he loved when I went to work that day and then as I stepped foot in the house that night he said he couldn't do it anymore. We have to live together for another 10 months (separate rooms at least) 

I'm just really struggling because I don't see a point in anything anymore. The pain I feel so strongly and physically, it makes me sick. I can't eat properly, I can't sleep properly. I have a promotion at work and it is meaningless to me now. I have time off soon as well and what do I do with all that time now? I tried to talk to him about how I was feeling and struggling (he's doing really well, he's happy now) but he just gets mad at me. I write pro and cons lists every single day of why I should end it and the pros always win. Today would be the perfect day. He's out, he's drunk with all his friends. Our other housemate is with him. No one can get to me. No one would be home for days. The pain scares me... but it scares me more to keep going.
