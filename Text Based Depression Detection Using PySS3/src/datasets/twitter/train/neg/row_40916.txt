What is normal ?When it comes to being suicidal and depressed, i tend to argue with my thoughts and have to rationalize with them, like i tell myself to hold on longer incase it gets better. do i have more problems than i thought or is this 'normal' when youre depressed, its rather scary when it happens (to me at least) because i have some kind of split personality ??
