What is life?Is there a point to life?  Seriously ask yourself why.  Why are we here? Something that every single person has in common is that we will all die. Everything you worked for, all the money you had will not matter. The people you left behind will be dead sometime too. Eventually the earth will die and not be able to sustain life of any kind. A giant ball of black nothingness. That will be the earth in the future whether you like it or not. At this point nothing that we could ever do will ever matter unless we can make ourselves mortal which is impossible. What is the point of anything? Nothing matters and nobody can do anything about it.
