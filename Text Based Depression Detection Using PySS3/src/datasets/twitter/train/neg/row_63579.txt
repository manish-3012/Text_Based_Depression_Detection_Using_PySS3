Plastic Surgery is killing meI had Liposuction with Fat Transfer last year - a so called Brazilian Butt Lift. Unfortunately, what was meant to be the start of a new happy life, drove me into the worst depression ever. The results of the surgery are devastating. I was really healthy before going into the OP room, never smoked, never drank alcohol. The surgeon messed me up completely and I am left with ugly dents, scars and discolorations all over my legs, thighs and butt. I have been crying nonstop for the past 15 months. I lost my BF at that time, lost my job, my apartment. I have not gone out since the surgery, not even for a coffee or a drink. The psychological effects have lead to loss of hair and now 5 teeth in one year. I had to be taken to ER multiple times due to heart racing, high blood pressure and panic attacks. I don't take any meds, this is all coming from my depression. I feel like I am slowly dying because of it. Is that even possible? At only 30 years old? 

No one ever talks about the severe consequences, when plastic surgery actually goes wrong. I just can't get over how I look now, I burst in tears every time I look in the mirror. I can never go on vacation again or be intimate with anyone again. 

I wish I would just find the strength to finally end my life, because it's not a life anymore.
