Lost a friend to suicide years ago - keep feeling more and more overwhelmed by deathHi 

I lost a friend 3 years ago and as time as gone on I would have expected to get better but lately I feel like I just keep on feeling worse. 

I've been having suicidal thoughts for the past few years but it has been every day for the past few months. I'm far away from those I know well and love so I guess that isn't helpful but also because of the distance I have this horrible feeling that I'm gonna come back to someone being dead or someone killing themselves because I didn't ask them how they are. 

It's also not been helpful that the guy I was seeing back at home has decided he wants to take time for himself and has also stopped messaging me. As he has depression I am extremely concerned that something is up and again have these intrusive thoughts that I must check up on everyone and everyone is on the brink of killing themselves and that it's my fault but also I have to respect his boundaries and I can't explain this without putting a lot of pressure on him.

I'm also paranoid that my dying grandmother is dead and no one is telling me. I keep asking for info on how she's doing and get very little back which just makes me paint a picture that she's gone.

I've been holding myself together but it's getting all a bit much. I know nothing has happened and it all seems ridiculous and blown out of proportion but I doubt I'd still be here if it weren't for the fact that I know how it feels to have lost someone.
