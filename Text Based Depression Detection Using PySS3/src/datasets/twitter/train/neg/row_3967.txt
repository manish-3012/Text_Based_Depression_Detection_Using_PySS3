I know my life is worth living but it's so hardSometimes I feel like my experiences aren't unique, but I've been told by mental health professionals that what I've gone through is out of their scope. They gave me information for clinicians who deal with severe long term childhood trauma but I didn't pursue it. There are a lot of things I don't want to talk about. I am too tired to talk about it. I don't want to die. I want my mum. 

I know my life is worth living, but I want someone else to live it. I am too tired, I want a break. I wish that someone else could take over. I want the bad to go away. My resume is very impressive. I am doing a PhD. I have students and colleagues that depend on me. I have high commendations from all my superiors. But I feel like I'm holding on by my fingertips. I know my life is special, and I know that if I die there'll be terrible damage to those who know me. 

But it hurts. It really really hurts. My heart hurts a lot. I am in physical pain. I have a headache. I am so tired but I can't sleep. It hurts a lot. I can't sleep. I don't know what to do. I don't want anyone to worry. I am so sorry to everyone. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I want my mum. I really want my mum. I hope everything will be ok. I am sorry.
