I don't want to self harm againIm sad, I'm alone the only thing keeping me awake is releasing my anger but discreetly.

 I can't release it by shouting at the world because It's already branded a mad person with addict like behaviour, I can't subdue it because what I'd use to entertain myself with (ps3) has been put out of bounds, I cant confront it because then i would be seen asif i have anger issues.


So tell me with nothing but sinister thoughts and paranoia guarding me from waking up to a brighter day. How much longer can I endure this night
