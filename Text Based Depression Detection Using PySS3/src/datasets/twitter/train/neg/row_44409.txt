Calmed my stormI am in a low place and always have been, I deal with extreme highs and lows and never anything in the middle. I lost my sister when I was eight years old, she was murdered by her fiancÃ©. Iâ€™ve always had a void I could not fill, I still do. I dive into anything just to tie me down to connections here in this world so that I feel I cannot leave. I am functionally broken, I have coped with drugs and anything I can use to feel â€œbetterâ€. Honestly I was feeling really bad and stumbled upon this subreddit cause I typed in suicide. It does not make me happy to know others feels the same way but it does make me feel like I am not alone. Thank you for the posts and for being so honest in a world where everyone hides their pain. Reading the posts i did calmed the storm. Maybe I have enough to go on and maybe you do too. I donâ€™t know you but if you feel this way I love you because i know. Ty
