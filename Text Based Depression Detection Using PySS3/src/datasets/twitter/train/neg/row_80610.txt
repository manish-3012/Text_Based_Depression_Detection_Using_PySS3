I'm 18yo boy and I feel hopeless.I can't find a job, my family is in debt they both work too but they don't earn much either.

I can't buy my own clothes I just wear my cousins old ones.

Even if I have a job I don't want to work 15 years just to own a fucking house.

I want to have hobies but I can't becouse I live in a 3rd world country and the currency of the country is very low in value. I just wanted to have a guitar.

I can't speak with girls and never dated ever, I'm afraid of being rejected. I want to be loved too. 

I have very few friends and now we can't hang out much too thanks to covid. 

I hate my own country,  politicians just fight for their own interests. They don't think what's people doing. The rich get richer the poor get poorer.

I hate my own people, they do nothing but criticize you, most of them are idiots just thinking nothing but religion.

I feel like I'm wasting my life. I wake up late and do nothing but play computer, I feel hopeless, I just watch videos of people who live in a decent country and I envy them. Sometimes I just want to be a soldier and have friends who care about me and I care about them, shoot whats in front of me without thinking.  Maybe I would have a purpose like that.

I don't know what to do, I just know I don't want to die yet but part of myself says kill yourself to me. Please give some advice to me.
