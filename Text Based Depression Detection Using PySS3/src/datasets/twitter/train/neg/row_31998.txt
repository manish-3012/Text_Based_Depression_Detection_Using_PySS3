I want to kill myself but..Let me just start by saying that I have never been treated by professionals before. Never had the resources.. 

I have struggled with childhood trauma, depression and suicidal thoughts for several years now. I have such a severe case of social anxiety to the point I have been staying inside for six years straight. I have been home since I dropped out of high school. Iâ€™m 25 now and havenâ€™t achieved anything. This year things are worse. Iâ€™m at the lowest point of my life. I dream of hanging myself everyday. I hate life. I donâ€™t find anything meaningful about it. I gave up a long time ago. Everyday I wake up and cry because Iâ€™m tired. I want out. But the pain Iâ€™d be leaving behind also haunts me. Idk what to do. Someone help me.
