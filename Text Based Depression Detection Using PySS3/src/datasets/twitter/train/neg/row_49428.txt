Is anybody else here not scared off dying from the corona virus?Honestly I'm so sick of life and all the stress of this isolation and school pressuring me about online classes, I rather just kill myself because I cant handle all this stress and pain. I don't want others around me to suffer, but I wouldn't mind getting the virus and dying, I just don't see the point of continuing if every day is filled with pain and stress. I haven't had a single minute today were I could just lay down and relax. I'm so sick of this shit!
