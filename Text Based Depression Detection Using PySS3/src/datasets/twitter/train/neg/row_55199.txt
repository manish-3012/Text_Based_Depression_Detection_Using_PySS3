The thoughts of it are back againSo itâ€™s been a while. And I was happy for a bit. But it came back. The Iâ€™ll content and fighting with my ex. The life I have lived is full of regrets. People tell me itâ€™s all about wanting something enough. What if my wanting something is to not be here any longer. To be gone without pain. I donâ€™t really care if I physically suffer but itâ€™s what I would put my mother through and my dog. 

I know deep down it will happen one of these days.i have never gone and talked with some one cause I know I could be locked up. 

Iâ€™ve done and seen a lot of bad shit if it happens it will be next year. I just needed to say this.
