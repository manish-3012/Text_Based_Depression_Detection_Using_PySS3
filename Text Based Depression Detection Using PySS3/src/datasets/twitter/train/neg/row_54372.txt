Iâ€™m so tired of being the lonely. You canâ€™t live life on your own. Iâ€™m just gonna end this shit, tired of it.Iâ€™ve been single for 4 years now. In those 4 years Iâ€™ve only talked/hung out with 2 different girls. One of them only went on a date with me for a nice free meal. She didnâ€™t talk to me again after. The second girl lead me on but then found out she was only using me for sex and had no intentions of actually being with me. 

Since then, literally every other girl just ignores me if I try to talk to them. Iâ€™ve tried going to bars to meet new girls but all of them are there with other guys. I feel like such a loser. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m unattractive or have a shitty personality, but I guess girls see me differently. This has made me really insecure and took away all my confidence in myself. I just donâ€™t get whatâ€™s so wrong with me.
