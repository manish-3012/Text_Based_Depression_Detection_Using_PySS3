I don't even have the energy to hurt myself anymoreI've taken the medicine, I've done the therapy. I've tried everything to not be so empty inside and it seems like any relief I've had from my constant misery is fleeting and temporary. At what point can I accept that maybe it just doesn't get any better? I'm so fucking tired of hearing this cliche whenever I open up to someone, there's 7 fucking billion people on this Earth, is it really so unreasonable to assume that it doesn't always get better, or that some people really aren't longed for this world? My whole life I've felt like I'm not supposed to be here, and it eventually got to the point where if I wasn't slashing my thighs open or putting cigarettes out on myself daily then I'd be overwhelmed by the emptiness inside me. These days I honestly don't even have the energy to hurt myself and it honestly feels like I've reached the end. I'm a drain on all my loved ones, I've got no discernable skills and I really just don't even want to live to see the end of the year.  I've honestly tried to fix myself so I don't feel this way but at this point I genuinely believe I am just a fundamentally broken person
