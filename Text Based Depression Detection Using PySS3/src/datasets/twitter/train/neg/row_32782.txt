How do I help a friend who's feeling suicidal?I don't know whether this is the right sub for it, but I have a friend who's extremely depressed and has deep-seated family issues. When I offer to help him, he thinks I'm just toying with his feelings and would leave him like everyone else: that's how much he doubts himself and everyone. The other day, he tried to kill himself after the Chester[singer from his favorite band I think - Linkin Park] suicide but luckily didn't go through with it. What's the best thing I can do in this situation? He doesn't seem to trust me or anyone else.
