Should I leave a suicide note?Would anyone even bother reading it? Nothing I say would change anyone's perspective. My family and me are just stubborn people. They don't take blame, apologise and think their opinion is always right

This is pretty weird but I've been waiting for some massive argument that will leave me so negative and frustrated to muster the courage to suicide. I failed my driver's knowledge license on the first go whereas my siblings all passed. I got into an argument with my mother. But just moments before that she was telling me how much she loved me then next thing you know I'm ugly, worthless and stupid. Nothing surprising. She also talked about how her childhood was so miserable and other kids are better. Which isn't false btw she did live in poverty in vietnam. Then proceeded to talk about my personal things to my relatives.

But the difference is I don't want a life even if it's good by society's standards. I have bad social anxiety being near other people disgust me. I never hold eye contact, physically touch others or speak. But according to everyone I'm blessed with a normal body so they ask what's wrong with me, why am I such an ungrateful brat? I can't just go out there and voila I'm extroverted and happy

Pretty sure if I write a suicide note it'd be full of bitterness. It wouldn't leave anyone feeling guilt, my family doesn't like me and take others sides. So....would anybody want to try to attempt to give me half\-hearted reasons on why life is worth living?

This world is a mess why can't it just blowup already?
