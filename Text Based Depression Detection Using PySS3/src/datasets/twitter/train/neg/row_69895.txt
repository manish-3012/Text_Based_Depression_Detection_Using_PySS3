this post contains graphic depictions of ideations of self-harm. downvote if you want for that, but you've been warned.originally from my tumblr, no one talked to me about it there. i feel so alone, so i figured i'd come here.

self-harm trigger warning

i have never actually committed acts of self-harm, unless you include my cigarette smoking into oblivion, all my marijuana use and my ever-growing fondness for klonopin, all helping hustle me towards a relatively young demise.

sometimes i dig my nails into my skin. hard. just to feel the sharp pain of my own body working against itself. i have pinched the insides of my thumbs to callouses. nervous habit.

but lately, i suppose, as i sink deeper into this smothering despair, iâ€™ve begun having daydreams, what ifs and ideations with more frequency.

on friday, after i had taken my second klonopin, i stared bemusedly at the bottle, wondering what the harm would be in taking another. and another.

just now, before i began composing this, i had the morbidly satisfying image of myself offering a visual example of my emotional pain. wrists dashed open (with what i have yet to decide), a crazed look in my eye and my arms dripping blood onto my clothes i would shriek. â€œlook at me! look at me! this is depression. this is loneliness. you will never understand the levels of my sadness. you will never understand my pain.â€

and then i would be promptly committed. which is part of the reason that stops me. the other part is that i am very slow to heal, and the enduring trauma is not yet worth the momentary release.

tell me youâ€™re worried about me, if you want. thatâ€™s okay. iâ€™m worried about me too.
