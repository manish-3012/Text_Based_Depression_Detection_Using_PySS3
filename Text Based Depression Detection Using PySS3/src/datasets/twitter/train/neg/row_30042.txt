damaged the wall with a knife. I really think I can do it.And it's freeing. The current plan is January after BoJack Horseman ends. But I have had many plans before so I'm just a whiner probably. Still, I'm incredibly lonely even with friends and therapy. And I feel like a monster. I'm 30 and a virgin, never had a relationship. But I guess that doesn't matter as long as you're happy with yourself, right? Well I'm not. There is that constant black hole inside of me. And no one can truly understand and connect with me. And even if they do, there's no one to stick around in my life. And even if they were like my mother, they're inevitably toxic. Had a conversation with her afer which I jammed a knife in the wall, and think I realized I do have it in me after all. Still haven't cut myself but this'll do as proof as well. There is definitely darkness inside of me. Schizotypal. BPD. depression. my mind. And there is light, like my moral side which wins most of the time. But I am so tired. I just want to fall and never climb up. But I have light. And so I'll keep going till I won't.
