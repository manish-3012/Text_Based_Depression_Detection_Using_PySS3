Giving up.I don't have much to offer this world. I'm tired of being left in all areas of relationships. I don't make my family proud. All the effort I put forth at work doesn't amount to anything. I don't have many accomplishments for someone my(28/f) age. I have only a couple 1000 dollars to my name. No licence. No friends at all. One 13 year relationship that ended badly. I literally have no will to carry on anymore. 

I want to die. I don't want to see if it gets any better because it never has in all the years I've been dealing with this heavy darkness in my heart. 

I want to die. The desire to live hasn't been there for years. No therapy helps. Being alone all the time makes it so much harder. 

I'm just tired of it all. I hate that my death would destroy my family and that makes me hate myself even more. I'm so fed up it's not even funny. I want to leave this ugly world and never come back.
