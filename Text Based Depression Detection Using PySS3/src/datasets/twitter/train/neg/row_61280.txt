I just can't take life anymore.I've been struggling for so long with OCD, PTSD, Panic Disorder, Depression and eating disorders that I can't take it anymore. My girlfriend has to deal with my problems and it's not fair to her. Plus she kind of emotionally manipulates me because she knows I'm too mentally ill to ever leave her so I just have to deal with it. I very much appreciate everything she does for me and she does look after me. But she manipulates me and i feel terrible. She is always telling me when I ask about the future she always says things like "we may not even be together in the future" and that makes me feel so horrible. 

I'm so afraid of being alone. So I don't want to leave her. I'd prefer to kill myself than break up. Then all this Christchurch attack today I have been a wreck, I'm Australian but have many NZ friends and I hate bad stuff happening to people, especially to a country I care so much about so I am just devastated and don't want to live anymore. 

My post history is cancerous because I vent my anger at the world online because I don't have a family or friends. Just a girlfriend who is in a constant state of emotional manipulation. 

Anyway. Sorry for the rant. I just wish I could develop the courage to kill myself.
