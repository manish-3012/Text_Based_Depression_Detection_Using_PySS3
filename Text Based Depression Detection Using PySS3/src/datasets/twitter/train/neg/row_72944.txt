Suicide is the only answer for meI'm always wrong. Even when I give proof and other people don't, I'm wrong. Even when the burden of proof isn't in me, yet I'm the only one who gives evidence, I'm wrong. Cannot be right. It is literally impossible! I can give 1000000000 links proving something I say, and I'm still wrong! Everyone thinks I'm just pulling stuff out of my ass when I refuse to prove things even though literally every single proof I gave was dismissed. When I say every single one, I mean 100%. Literally everything I say is dismissed whether I can prove it or not, so suicide is the only answer.
