"Sleeping on it" didn't workI had a rough day yesterday at work, too much to explain here, and came home, collapsed sobbing on the floor, and stared at the kitchen knives for a while, thinking about slitting my wrists, then took out my phone and started googling what OTC meds are easiest to overdose on. 

I eventually found my way to bed and fell asleep crying. In the past, going to bed was the best thing to do for myself at times when I was truly considering suicide. But I just woke up this morning with the thought still in my head that I should kill myself.

I'm trying to think of the things that would usually make me realize I can't - my pets, my nephews, how upset my family would be...but it's not helping. I won't actually do it, because of those things, but I still really, really want to.

I'm so lonely and I can't take it. I'm sad and miserable all the time. I just want this to be over. Every little bad thing that happens sends me into this tailspin of "it's all your fault, you worthless piece of shit, nothing will ever get better for you, no one will ever care about you, your life will never get better."
