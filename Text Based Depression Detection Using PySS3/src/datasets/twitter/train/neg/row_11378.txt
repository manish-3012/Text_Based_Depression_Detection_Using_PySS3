I donâ€™t find enjoyment in life anymore.It seems like every day I just get in a cycle of doing nothing all day because I have no motivation and feel like Iâ€™m unable to go have fun and talk to people. I wanna do exciting things and have life experiences but I donâ€™t know what to do or if I will ever muster the motivation to do it. Yes, there are times where I feel like everything is going to be alright and I think Iâ€™ll be able to find enjoyment in my daily life, but the feeling quickly fades and Iâ€™m back to the depressed kid sitting in bed all day feeling sad about idek what half the time. I feel like such a dull and uninteresting person. Lately I feel like I might be going too hard on the drugs and this is whatâ€™s doing it to me. More than anything I wanna talk to someone about this but I donâ€™t have anyone in my life who Iâ€™m close enough to feel comfortable talking about it to. And anytime I think I might be able to open up my mind goes blank and I canâ€™t even formulate my thoughts. I really think these drugs might be fucking me up but idk cause I get fairly regularly depressed regardless. I donâ€™t have any immediate plans for suicide, but I think about it very often. My biggest fear is that Iâ€™m going to be the cause of my own death. 

I just want to get enjoyment out of living, every day.
