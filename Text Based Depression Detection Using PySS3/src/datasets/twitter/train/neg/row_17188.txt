I dont know if anything around me is real.Are the people around me real? Do they see the same colors as me? Do they feel the same pain as I do? Will they react like I expect if I push them? Probably, but I need to make sure. If I put my hand in the pot, will it burn? I've learned that it will burn and it will very likely scar me but I've never experienced it. Does that really happen? Just because it happens to other people and people tell me that will happen, will it actually happen?

I'm probably going to feel really dumb reading this again, but right now I dont know what im doing. Im typing this out because spending time on this sub is the only thing that has given me solace. It's almost instinctual for me to come here and write everything down. 

Are the replies im getting from real people. Ive never met any of you. All the people trying to reach out to me. Are they real?
