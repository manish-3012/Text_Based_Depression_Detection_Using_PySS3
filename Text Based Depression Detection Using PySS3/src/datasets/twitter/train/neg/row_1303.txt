I want to attempt suicideI want to try. I want to give my life a chance. But I need help. I need therapy. I've approached my parents but they thought it was a phase and believe exercise solves everything. I have to go a school which I dont want to and I cant stand the thought of it. But I dont want to upset my parents. I feel like the only way they'll take me seriously is if I do something drastic.
