I want to dieIm suffering, both mentally and physically. My doctor doesnâ€™t take my IBS seriously, which has made my life for the past two years a living hell. I have even developed mental illnesses due to it, because the pain has made me very hopeless. Iâ€™m very antisocial now, no friends or a job either. Suffering every day because my doctor doesnâ€™t wanna believe that my IBS is severe. He tells to drink water and that my ibs isnâ€™t that severe. I bet he would not say so had he felt my pain. I think Iâ€™ve developed ME too due to the IBS, so now Iâ€™m constantly physically and mentally tired. Getting out of bed is essentially a chore. I canâ€™t even go on walks without feeling like Iâ€™ve run 10 miles. And to make matters worse, I donâ€™t have any form of education, because the IBS hit me when I was about to go to college. However now Iâ€™m neither motivated nor have the intelligence to study. So job opportunities and my dream job are long gone. Life feels so empty and useless right now. Iâ€™m constantly in pain with no one around me. Killing myself feels like the right thing to do. Because even if I donâ€™t give up on life, Iâ€™m not really ready to fix my life, Iâ€™m too tired and so down that suicide feels 100% better than my current situation
