A ticking time and a set date; the story of my own murder.August 31st, year 2020


1. A room, preferably owned by myself
2. Half a bucket of dry wood
3. Metal bucket
4. Gasoline
5. Half a bucket of coal
6. Lighter
7. Duct tape
8. Sleeping pill/weed/ heroine will do too
9. Ceiling foam to cover air flowing areas

My 3rd attempt, this better be last. I apologize to the little sister that will grow up with an older brother who killed himself, and I also apologize to my younger brother for failing to be the idol he deserved to have. I apologize to whoever sees this for being a waste of O2 hoarder. I do not know if this is a call for help, I do know that if I continue this way I will end my life.
