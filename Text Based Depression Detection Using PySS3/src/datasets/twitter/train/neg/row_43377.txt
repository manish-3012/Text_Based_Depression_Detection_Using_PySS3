Living with anxiety/depressionI've been on all of the anti anxiety/anti depressants and some have helped but I can't remain on any due to to debilitating side effects. I also can't cope with anxiety/depression with therapy alone. I also don't want to live my life with this condition untreated. I honestly don't see a reason to keep moving forward. Why keep going if you're miserable everyday with no end in sight?
