Why do people lash out on me for things I say or don't say? I'm quiet and I don't do much. Help?At home, public, work people lash out at me and criticize me (not constructive.)

My family been lashing out at me for no reason. I rarely saw them because of work and when I saw them for a hot minute they start yelling at me.

I'm quiet and keep to myself. I try to be polite and come across aloof.
