The doom thoughtsThe hardest part is not being able to concentrate when the doom thoughts come in. Iâ€™m an â€œessential workerâ€ and Iâ€™m supposed to be leaving my house to visit clients, but I canâ€™t even move. My life is in complete shambles. Financially, Iâ€™m  completely wrecked, my mother lost her job and canâ€™t see her granddaughter,  and seeing her in pain causes me to feel rage at this world.  Death is taking over daily conversation with no end in sight. I feel like Iâ€™ve been thrown into a war zone that Iâ€™ve had zero preparation for, Iâ€™m drowning and Iâ€™m losing my fight. I canâ€™t stop thinking about one r/natureismetal video where some hyenas are eating a deer alive, and the deer just looks around blinking and calmly looking around while the hyenas devour it. Every day I wake up with a new hope and every day that hope is slammed to the ground. I couldnâ€™t protect myself from the dangers of the world because I try to live positively, and through living positively, my price was not seeing the truth. This life has been a perpetual cycle of beatings. My soul is getting eaten alive.
