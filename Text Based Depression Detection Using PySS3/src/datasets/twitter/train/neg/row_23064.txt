I could have been her.A girl from a school near by recently killed herself, she's my age.
It hurts. I never knew her. But from the stories I can tell that we had a few things in common. 

I have had suicidal thoughts, I act it all out.. in my head. I went through all of the different outcomes etc. I want to die but I know I'm not going do it. However I don't exactly trust myself as I can't even be productive, even when I  want to.

But knowing that another girl went through with it saddens me. 
I don't want anyone else to feel this way. I wish life was nicer. I wish there wasn't so must shit in this world. 

After her death I saw my scenario and outcomes  play out. I saw everyone grieve and hurt, including myself. I wish there was an option that would just fix our lives easily. I don't want to do what this girl did. I hate that it took someone else's death for me to realise this.


I've posted here many times but even nice advice doesn't help. I'm sorry.
