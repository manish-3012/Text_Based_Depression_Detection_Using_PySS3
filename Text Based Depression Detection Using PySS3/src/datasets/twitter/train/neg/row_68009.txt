About to be unemployed due to depression testA couple of weeks ago they announced that they are closing the plant I work at. Got an interview with another job that I passed with flying colors, then they sent me a Chally test. Almost 1/3 of that test were questions asking if you have symptoms of depression. "Do you ever feel tired for no reason" "Have you ever not wanted to get out of bed" It is just infuriating because they advertised they were an equal opportunity employer and then give me a test that very obviously was designed to weed out people with a protected handicap. That just set off a chain of thoughts about how I will never be "normal" or fit into society. In a couple of weeks I'm going to be out of medication. Have a psych appointment Monday, but insurance has already denied the medication I was on and the doctor refused to switch me to something cheaper when I asked. Because the medication was so expensive I tried taking a half dose to stretch it out and that caused me to spiral into the worst depression I've had in years. Back on a full dose, but don't know what to do when I run out.
