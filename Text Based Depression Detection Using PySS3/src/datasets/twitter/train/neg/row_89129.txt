I canâ€™t handle being locked up Iâ€™m really gonna do it this timeIâ€™m losing my fucking mind I canâ€™t survive this corona virus quarantine. The news says this is gonna go on for weeks or even months. I need to work out in the gym itâ€™s like crack for me I need it. Itâ€™s saved my life in so many ways unless I physically tire myself I have an absolute unbearable feeling of energy all over my body and I canâ€™t sit still. This makes me not able to sleep either and insomnia really triggers my suicidal thoughts. I canâ€™t handle this Iâ€™m losing my mind. I live in a fucking city so itâ€™s not like I have some huge acre of land that I live on I can walk around. Iâ€™m goi crazy I feel like a prisoner Iâ€™m not allowed to leave help I canâ€™t be shut up with my horrible parents for weeks theyâ€™re already making me lose my mind. Sorry if none of this makes sense bc no grammar Iâ€™m really going crazy Iâ€™m about to do something stupid I canâ€™t handle this
