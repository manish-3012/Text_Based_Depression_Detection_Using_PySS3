I'm breakingI don't know what to do. I don't know what to write. Tomorrow is my 18th bday and rather than be happy about it, I'm seriously considering killing myself. I don't have any reason to live a life i have. None would be sad about it in a long run. I'm nothing but hatred towards others. I have never felt more alone than today. I've lost every piece of my character. I''m not smiling as I used to, I'm not trying to be goofy with my friends, I literally can't trust even my closest friend. I hate myself about every single thing i have ever done in my life. I'm tired of all this misery and mental pain. I'm going to sleep, maybe I will feel a little bit better tomorrow.
