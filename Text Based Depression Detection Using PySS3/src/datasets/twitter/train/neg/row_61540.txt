I'm so done. I don't care anymore, I'm ending it soon.I hate myself. I hate this world. I hate how life is supposed to be. I've been suicidal since I was young, at the least 5th grade. I always thought things would get better but they don't. Not for everyone. Everyone doesn't get a happy ending. Life is just shit show after shit show with brief moments of happiness in between and I can't seem to find what makes it all worth it. I can't wait until old age or some freak accident to be free from this pain. I want out now. 

You want to know what has hurt me the most? I'm so fucking alone. Never been special to anyone. Never had friends, or lovers. Not even family. The closest person I ever had in my life just straight up told me tonight I never meant shit to him. It hurts so much. I just want to be loved. But I'll never be enough. Something is very wrong with me. I'm not cut out for life. But I'll be at peace soon, I know that. And for the first time ever I'm crying tears of happiness. It'll be over soon. I won't have to feel this way anymore.
