I didn't kill myself this week but I did quit one of my jobs and quit all my social activities as well as my birthdayI need someone to talk to, i tried to call my mom for 4 hours straight and explain to her the scariness of these feelings but was just met with "get over it you need to seriously get over this" so i started calling her a dumb bitch cause she makes no effort to get me and she said she DOES i'm "twisting her words" but she isn't listening and i get so frustrated. my roommate overheard me yelling at her and called me "such a freak and a brat" as if she even knew the context of the conversation was that I was frantically calling my mom with suicidal thoughts because i cant see a therapist till tomorrow and if i go to the hospital they'll commit me
