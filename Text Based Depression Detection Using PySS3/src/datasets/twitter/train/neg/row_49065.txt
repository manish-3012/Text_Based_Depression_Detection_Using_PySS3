What determines if were worthy of living?Thinking about death again, and the usual shit. I was wondering what everyone on both sides of this site thinks. I personally am 27, i have done nothing with my life. Ive been handed so much, and I have hurt more people then I have helped. I am overall a nobody whos done nothing but hurt more people, and like if i died, i got rid of basically everyone close to me over the last 5 years, it doesnt negativly impact more than 3 people serverly. Then all my shit can be sold and split up between the few left and thatd be more help to the ones in debt then the others but still, i feel like at this poibt in my life i have been worthless, i am worthless, so i shouldnt be worthy of living, and that killing myself i could provide more good than the bad over my whole life in that one moment. So i think i am not worty of living because i am just a poison personified. What about you guys?
