I just find existing to be incredibly disturbingI don't want to participate in it, being alive and putting effort into a career and relationships and finding meaning in all this is just so foreign. Existence is too surreal, I can't help but feel like an observer, participating in it just seem unusual, like it's beneath me somehow, yet I have to include myself in it or face the consequences of depression/isolation/hopelessness. I don't know what I have or what I need to hear to make this all make sense.
