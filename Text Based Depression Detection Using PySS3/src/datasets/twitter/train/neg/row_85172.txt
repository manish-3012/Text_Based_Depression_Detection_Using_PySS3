My own worst enemyI can look back at the last 2 years and all my mental breakdowns, failed relationship with the love of my life, family growing tired of my mental state, is all my own doing. 

When I'm stable, I'm inevitably do something to mess it up which sends me into months long depressive episodes. I'm done living like this.
