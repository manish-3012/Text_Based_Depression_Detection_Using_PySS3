Iâ€™m done.I feel so done with life. I donâ€™t think that I want to live to see another year of life. The thought that I probably have at least another sixty years (Iâ€™ll be almost seventy-six) left in my life makes me sad.  I donâ€™t think that I want to live to see 2019. My dadâ€™s friend just died and I feel so awful and guilty because part of me wants to die. I donâ€™t enjoy life anymore. Iâ€™m always on my phone so that I can ignore reality and block everything out. I donmt know how to do anything. My mom has to have surgery to remove her uterus and the fibroids in it in February of 2019, and I have no fucking idea how the fuck Iâ€™m going to take care of the three dogs that we have that day. Also, today is my dadâ€™s birthday. He was being such a condescending prick that I had to go to my room so I wouldnâ€™t scream at him at the top of my fucking lungs. Heâ€™s a nice person but heâ€™s so condescending that he makes me not even want to be around him. Heâ€™s so condescending and annoying that itâ€™s hard for me to even bring myself to feel sympathy for him. My dad said earlier today (referencing his friendâ€™s death) that life is short. Sometimes I feel like life isnâ€™t short enough and it canâ€™t end fast enough. I hate life. I was only happy for the first six years of my life. Everything was down hill from there. In about three weeks, Iâ€™ll turn sixteen, and itâ€™ll have been a little more than nine years since I was happy. I donâ€™t want to have another birthday. My questions are:
â€¢ Should I continue my life or end it?
â€¢ If I decide to end it, what should I spend the days or weeks leading up to it doing?
â€¢ What are some things that I should do before I do it?
â€¢ If I decide to continue my life, how do I make it better? I donâ€™t think that I want to continue it.
