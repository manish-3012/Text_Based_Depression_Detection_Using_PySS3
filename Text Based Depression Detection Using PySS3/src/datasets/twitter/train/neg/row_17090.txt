Like listening to the rainDeath just seems so peaceful. 


I don't want to sleep, I'm scared of waking up. My kidney stones hurt. My RLS hurts. My heart hurts (literally, I overdosed on oxycodone yesterday) My fucking ridiculous fat ragdoll cat is sleeping on my bed with me, and he could not care less if I dropped off the face of the planet; but the idea of missing out on all the hugs I could have make me sad. My dad wants to take me stargazing for some event in June and my mum wants to see a movie this weekend. So many reasons to keep holding on.


Yet giving up is all I can think about. Being done once and for all. No more. Just, no more.
