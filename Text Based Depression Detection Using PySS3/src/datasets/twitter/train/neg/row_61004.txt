Why do we try to stop people from killing themselves...?Ive been suffering from depression for my entire life. No joke. Iâ€™ve always been told â€œitâ€™ll get betterâ€ but it hasnâ€™t. I tried to kill myself last night. it didnâ€™t work (obviously), but it made me think...why are we forcing people like me to suffer for the rest of their lives? I will always have to rely on medication for my depression, since itâ€™s a permanent chemical imbalance in my head. Iâ€™m no longer â€œlivingâ€. Iâ€™m just here. Forced to live out my days until I die naturally. Why? Just...why?
