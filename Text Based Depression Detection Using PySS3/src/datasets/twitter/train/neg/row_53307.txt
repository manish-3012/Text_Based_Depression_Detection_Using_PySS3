Trapped Between Life and DeathI nearly took my own life a few days ago, but stepped away from the edge at the last moment. I've been doing everything in my power to stay alive since then (e.g. hotlines, therapy, self-improvement, etc.), but the feeling of absolute devastation grows heavier on my shoulders and I'm not sure how long I can hold on for. The only thing that's keeping me alive right now is dissociation (autopilot).

I don't know what to do. With everything that has happened to me this year it's like the universe doesn't want me to be alive, you know? Life just keeps sending me wave after wave of terrible news, life-threatening accidents, toxic people, and other grievous circumstances; it is relentless. I've never felt this defeated before in my life.

I don't want to be a statistic, especially as a trans person. I don't want to feel this way; I want to get better. But, it's been so hard to find a reason to live.
