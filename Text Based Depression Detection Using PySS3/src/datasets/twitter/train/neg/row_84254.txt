My Doctor Told Me I was Seeking AttentionOn my last leg last week, I was hyper suicidal, I was crying on my floor I had everything I needed, notes written and all, and I built up enough care to make one last reach for help, my primary care. 

Now this may seem like a weird last ditch effort rather than my family or 911. But it made perfect sense to me. 911 will â€œ301â€ me code for mandatory mental help, not voluntary. I wanted someone close to me to provide me with help or I was going to do it. If no one answers Iâ€™m gonna do it, Iâ€™m only calling once

She picks up as she was the on call doctors. Sheâ€™s my new primary car and I donâ€™t generally like her very much but Iâ€™m nothing but respectful, my suicidal thoughts and anxiety cause severe exhaustion so I never argue with anyone or make a fuss.

I tell her Iâ€™m about to do it and Iâ€™m crying and not making a lot of sense tbh. She immediately starts getting angry at me, raising her voice saying â€œDONT SAY THAT, THATS ATTENTION SEEKING. YOU DONT MEAN THAT OR YOU WOULDNT HAVE CALLEDâ€

I unloaded on her as much as I could and dropped all respectfulness and maturity I had left and gave her my mind as much as I could. Why canâ€™t people be serious and seek help? I could have easily donâ€™t it to prove her wrong. Like wtf. Obviously I didnâ€™t because I rang my gf after and she snapped me out of it
