Life is meaningless, so why "fight"?I've been reading "suicide note" by Mitchell Heisman as well as Better Never To Have Been by David Benatar, as well as other books throughout my life.

Life is meaningless, I guess everybody knows that. But how do the rest of humans continue struggling. I see my family, they love me, but I don't feel connected to them. How can you continue to fight if there is another fight tomorrow? 

If nothing matters, how can anything you do matter? Why should I wake up tomorrow and do whatever I have to do? not even considering death, why should one fight? Some people do it for their children, others for their S.O, gratification, greed, etc. But all of that just leads to more suffering. Like Sisyphus, eternally going from goal to goal, only to suffer with "different" things. Always a deadline, the void in the back of your mind. How can you give your life meaning if everything is the same level of worthlessness. Like watching cliches, what is the point. The hero is going to win, get the girl, etc etc. If the pain or experience is that common, how can you "enjoy" rewatching it? How can you continue to fight? 

"I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind."

Anyways, I will end it all tonight, I just hope I don't fuck it up and end with lasting damage.
