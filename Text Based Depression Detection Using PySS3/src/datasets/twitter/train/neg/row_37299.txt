Closest ive ever felt to following through25/m
My life is a big forever alone blackhole of nothing. Besides my roomate i have no one to interact with on a daily basis and nothing to do with my time but go on social media and netflix. I guess it doesnt really sound that bad but at this point i just literally have nothing to live for and conditions are unlikely to improve in the forseeable future. 

Ive been suicidally depressed since early childhood so this is not just some whim. Ive been battling depression for longer than i can remember and i have no fight left in me. Its a struggle to keep myself adequately fed at this point. Behaviors that contribute positively to my life have long since fallen by the wayside.

Goikg back to school, getting a job, moving into a new apartment are all things that just feel beyond my reach. I dont even have the energy to eat and bathe regularly

I just want it to be over, soon.
