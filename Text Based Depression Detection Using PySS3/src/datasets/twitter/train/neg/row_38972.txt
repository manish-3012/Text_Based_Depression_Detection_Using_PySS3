I want to jump off a cliff. And Iâ€™m afraid of heightsI (22 M) feel like Iâ€™ve been cheated in life. Despite some good things happening to me, I still wish I was dead. Iâ€™m so lonely and I have nobody. The people who talk to me are hundreds of miles away, so I canâ€™t really see them, let alone hug them or anything. Iâ€™m sick of being a virgin, sick of being unlovable, sick of being undesirable. No one wants me. I have Aspergerâ€™s with TRD and GAD. Everything sucks.
