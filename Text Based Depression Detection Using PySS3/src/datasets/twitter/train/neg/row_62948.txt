I have so much I want to do but im just tired.I'm a 32 f thats tired of life. I'm broke in massive debt living at home with a mentally abusive father with no getting out in sight. I have no children and never been in a relationship or felt love. My mother abandoned me when i was 9 and we are not on speaking terms now because every convo we have is her judging my weight and me being childless. She bases my self worth on my appearance and that i have no kids. I dont see a point in my existence or a future. I have so much I want to do and be but see absolutely no way of it happening. I have and own nothing but a small amount of clothes and my cats. Im terrified to actually go thru with ending it. I got into a fight with my brother 2 years ago and he told me to kill myself. When my mom heard about it, she stuck up for him and said its ok that he said that since I had threatened to do it before. This sounds so stupid typing out.
