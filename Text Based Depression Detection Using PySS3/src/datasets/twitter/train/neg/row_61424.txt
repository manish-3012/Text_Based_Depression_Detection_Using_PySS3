I realize this life wasnt meant for me. I should have died at birthI should have died during birth. I stopped breathing just moments before my mother went into labor forcing an emergency C-Section. I should have died. That was my first heed that this life wasnâ€™t for me. Iâ€™m not supposed to be here. I canâ€™t explain the feeling but Iâ€™m sure many others know the feeling that I have had since a small child. The feeling of no attachment to the world. As if life has no purpose to me. No fear of death only avoidance 

I donâ€™t suffer from depression or any mental disorder. I just realize life wasnâ€™t meant me for. Life isnâ€™t meant for everyone I see now. When you know itâ€™s time you just know. Nothing is going particularly wrong in my life at this moment. Itâ€™s not that I feel I have no other choice except to do this but I feel this is the right time to end my life. I have came to terms with the fact that this life wasnâ€™t meant for me and I am at peace with it. Iâ€™m not sad, I cry because I am at peace within myself. Everything is so clear now. I donâ€™t know exactly when I will end my life, I am not planning it ahead of time but I know when that time does come I will be at total peace within myself
