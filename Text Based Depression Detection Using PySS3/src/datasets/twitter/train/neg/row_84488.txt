I hate every second that Iâ€™m myselfI canâ€™t stand the way Iâ€™ve turned out and am living purely not to ruin my family by blowing my head off. The thought of it scares me, but being me is too much pain. Itâ€™s hilarious to think about what I expected of life as a child and to compare that to the me of today. Itâ€™s so funny.
