Tired of my garbage lifeWhere do I start? Iâ€™m an ugly motherfucker with very few redeeming qualities. Iâ€™m ugly and fat as hell. Balding too, and Iâ€™m only 24. I graduated from university after taking 6 years to graduate, due to getting poor grades and not knowing what I wanted to study. I graduated in may with a degree that I hate and is terrible for the job market today. My parents scream at me non stop because they are extremely verbally abusive and they hate each other. I have one friend, but thatâ€™s it. All I had to do was not fuck up college and I could have escaped my awful life. But it wasnâ€™t meant to be I guess. Iâ€™m close to roping these days but I look forward to new video games and movies and thatâ€™s the only thing that I keep breathing for. Life is garbage. No one cares for me and I just want everything to end. I never had a girlfriend at all and I know itâ€™s because Iâ€™m ugly and fat as hell. Iâ€™m so tired of my stupid fucking life, I canâ€™t believe I fucked it up so much.
