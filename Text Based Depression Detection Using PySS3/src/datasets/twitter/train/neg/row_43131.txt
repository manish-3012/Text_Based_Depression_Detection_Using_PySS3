At a lossI dont really know what to type here. I'm a 20 year old dude who just cant seem to find direction. I work as a dishie in a boring bar, I dropped out of uni, I'm on antipsychotics. I feel numb all the time and spend most of my nights trying to fall asleep to the thoughts of ending it. I feel tired of just walking around. I feel like I'm falling behind all my peers and I cant really blame it on anything but myself. I day dream a lot about the past and how things used to be, and how happy I realistically was. I've been putting a lot of effort into how I want to leave. Either overdose myself, or just ram my car into a telephone pole at a high speed and pray I dont make it. I know some people will be sad, but honestly, the pain is just unsuspecting anymore. Idk why I posted here, I've never been on this sub, but maybe it's just because I wanted to clear my mind before I went through with it. I dont know if i could say goodbye to anyone since it would make it too hard.
