I may kill myself before the virus kills me.I live in California.
My life has been going downhill since August.

Experienced many deaths in my family, had a suicide attempt, got in a car accident, and now this goddamn Coronavirus wonâ€™t allow me to take care of myself.

SIP has extended until the end May. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I get that itâ€™s important. But what I hate so much is that other people call each other â€œselfishâ€ for wanting to go back to their lives again.

Iâ€™m an aspiring occupational therapist and I was looking forward to helping people. I got â€œhiredâ€ in my ideal fieldwork placement and was supposed to start in June, but now it may be cancelled. How can I help others now?

You see, this situation has been affecting my mental health and my anxiety has flared up more. I wish they understood that those with mental health issues and depression wonâ€™t die from the virus, but from the isolation and restrictions they have placed. Weâ€™re REALLY struggling right now and I feel like they donâ€™t care about us.

I canâ€™t vent to anyone without them saying, â€œIt can be worse.â€ â€œYouâ€™re being selfish for wanting to go out, especially that people are dying from this disease.â€ If I die from the disease then so be it. I would rather die from Coronavirus than die from my own hands.

Last night I was having suicide thoughts, despite â€œfaking itâ€ in front of people. I pretend to show that Iâ€™m fine when Iâ€™m truly not. My optimism and me â€œcounting my blessingsâ€ can only go so long. Whereâ€™s the light at the tunnel again? My life has gone shit since last year and I donâ€™t see it get any better because of the situations of this virus. I want my life back, where physical contact can happen. But if thatâ€™s not the case and if thereâ€™s no light at the end of the tunnel, where is the point of living now?
