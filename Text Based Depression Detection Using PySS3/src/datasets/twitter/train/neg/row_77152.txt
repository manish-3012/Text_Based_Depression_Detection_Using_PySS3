It's more than just her, but losing her has convinced me.I don't make anyone happy anymore. I lost the girl I was going to marry. She hates me and has cut all contact with me. But it's more than that. I'm the reason my parents had to get married. I was an accident. An unwanted accident. All I've ever done in school and sports is disappoint my family. My friends won't miss me. I'm just hoping that my cat will be happy with my parents. I hope my siblings will forgive me. I'm not meant for anyone.

I lost her, I lost everything with her. I really just want to sleep.
