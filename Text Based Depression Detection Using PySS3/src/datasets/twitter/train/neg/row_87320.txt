Tomorrow is my last day. Help me find a way to change itI must start by thanking you all for hearing me out before, helping me  and giving me an outlet to talk through this sub. Youâ€™re all great people. So basically, I gave myself a month to find a reason to live and live life at its best. Tomorrow my time is up. I havenâ€™t found a reason to continue yet and this month has been disappointing despite my efforts to make it the most memorable one before I go. Whatever life offers it never seems enough to satisfy me and give me a reason to continue suffering for those fleeting moments of happiness. Now, other than many other reasons which have been  tormenting me for years, the now crucial reason for my departure is... uni. I failed once more to graduate and I would now be theoretically a year late to my graduation (4y instead of 3). I was also accepted for a top 50 Uni for my master, but the condition for my acceptance was my graduation in July, so I fucked that up as well. Moreover I HATE economics and finance but I chose it to help my family out. Just... I dread the future which this entails. I donâ€™t know how to cope, how to face my parents and mend the situation and I feel tired, a failure... I can no longer remember a time where I did something I actually enjoyed, other than working at the suicide hotline as a volunteer. But even then, I fucking failed and a girl I was trying to help still killed herself. Tomorrow I plan on spending my last day in Rome alone, shoot a few videos for my family, friends, my ex and my doggo and alas, jump and get hit by the train.  This is my last ditch cry for help, I NEED a solution and Objective answer, please help me our fine people of reddit and thank you for listening to me.


TL:DR; gave myself a month to find a reason to live, didnâ€™t find it so tomorrow I will kill myself as I failed Uni once more and donâ€™t know how to cope with my life.
