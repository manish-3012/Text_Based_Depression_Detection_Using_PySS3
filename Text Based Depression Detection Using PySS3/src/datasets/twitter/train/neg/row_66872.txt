I want to dieI want to die but im scared of it hurting my parents. I married someone who was a bad decision and i dont know how to get out of this other than death. I loved him so deeply, he was the only man i ever loved but i found out he had lots of emotional affairs. I cant leave him there is no possibility of me leaving him no matter what but i dont see him the same &amp; i feel embarrassed to be seen with him infront of the people who saw him cheat. He promised me last time it wouldnt happen again but it did and now hes promising me again it wont happen again that he will change &amp; this time if he doesnt i can leave him. I dont know what to do other than kill myself. Should i believe he will change? Should i forgive him or kill myself? I just dont want to hurt my family they will be devasted but i dont want to live anymore
