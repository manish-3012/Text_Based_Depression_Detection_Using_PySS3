suicide hotline was kind of useless but i don't what i expectedin the back of my head there's that thought that suicide hotlines are kind of useless. but i got on an online today because i felt extra shitty. 

i wasn't about to kill myself i guess...i'll always talk myself out of it. but it was the first day i actually did hang up a belt on the curtain rod, but couldn't let slip of the chair beneath me. didn't mention that in case they tracked my address. 

so i suppose for a person who is about to kill themselves, it serves its function as a distraction. but for a person that is just severely contemplating the idea day in and day out, i guess i'll just wait for the day where my emotions all culminiate into the necessity of a blank distraction such that i don't take my life. 

i was just on, and it was just a bunch of questions on how i plan on conducting myself after a shitty altercations...like, i don't know man i thought you'd help me with that honestly. 

'how do you usually calm yourself down? film, movies? how do you ground yourself? ok. ok. ok" 

responses seemed quite quick. i sent the dude a paragraph of why i came online to a suicide chat, and a few seconds later he replies 'okay, i understand you're feeling upset at the moment.' not to say there's anything wrong with it, but i thought you'd want more of a clearer image of the situation. the conversation was essentially me telling him how i treat myself after these heavy doubts of depression. i was asked this essentially twice, and both times no real answer. i just let it consume me and eventually the sadness just bleeds into the rest of me. 

this post was probably incoherent as shit, but ugh. i don't hold ill will against the dude in the suicide hotline, i just think there kind of redundant. maybe that was just a bad experience
