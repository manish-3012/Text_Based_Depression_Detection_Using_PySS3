I have to, todayToday is the day. Been waiting for this exact day for two weeks now. It's perfect. My wife isn't home. She wont be home for many hours, so I can sit and suffer here all alone before she comes home. The army has destroyed my life. They put me on so many pills after coming home. I have asked multiple times to go to therapy and get turned down. I schedule appointments to help myself and the people above me cancel them for force me to cancel them. Monday I'm supposed to go to prison because of all the medication they put me on. I caused a wreck while driving, I completely blacked out and have over 5 charges against me. I am the only one who was even envovled in the wreck. My life is destroyed. I am doomed
