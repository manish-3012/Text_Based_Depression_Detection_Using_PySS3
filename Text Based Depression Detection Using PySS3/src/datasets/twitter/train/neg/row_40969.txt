I actually want to live...Last year I wanted to die. I had terrible anxiety, depression and OCD. Then I had a mental breakdown. I even searched for how to commit suicide in the most painless way. Or at least prayed i died in my sleep. Existing was torment.

Less than a year later, I feel 10x better. Actually better than before I had my mental breakdown. 

Am I saying this to torment you? Not at all. Iâ€™m telling you this because even if it makes NO sense right now, it can get better. It will jf you donâ€™t give up. Now I am here to help others (pay it forward if you will). Oh and what makes me so special that I deserve it and you dont? Youâ€™re right... NOTHING! Except that i dared to believe i deserved it. If someone else can be happy, why not me? Why not you?

Iâ€™m not perfectly happy i still have rough days but it gets better as i keep fighting.

Iâ€™m fighting for you....
