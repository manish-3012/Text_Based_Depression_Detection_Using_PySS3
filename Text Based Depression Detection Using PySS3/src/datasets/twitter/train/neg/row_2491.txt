It doesnâ€™t seem to make any sense anymoreI wasted my life. Iâ€™m 28 and since 8 years Iâ€™m living like I already gave up. My family sees me as a failure, they never reach out to me. Only my father who has not a lot of empathy and probably feels guilty after he didnâ€™t care for my life, my feelings my whole life. 
My mother was extremely unhappy and probably depressed as well. She emotionally neglected me and I lost the love and the trust to her I had. She died 9 years ago. 
My life consisted of the avoidance circle of weed, internet, games, isolation and porn. No luck with women. Only girlfriend cheated on me, because I couldnâ€™t get it up and was lost. Canâ€™t blame her. This was at age 25 btw, after some years of suffering. I didnâ€™t manage to do a lot of exams and lied to my father. Will only write one on Monday, but even this is too much and thinking of it extremely stressful. If i fail it Im done at my college. Completely useless. I managed to stay away from weed since 8 weeks and from tobacco since 4 weeks, I did NoFap for 4 months without relapse. Nothing seems to help. Still no libido and pointless to even hope for a relationship. Medication what also fuck my libido and every chance to not being alone.
The worst thing is that I have no clue how I could ever be loved, either by a woman or by myself. My dreams of becoming a husband and a father bursted like a bubble. Itâ€™s devastating. 
At the weekend I might end it. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone, but I donâ€™t think anything knows how pointless my life feels and how much I hate myself. More or less I lived in this state for 8 years. Unable to socialize with new people to not embarrass myself. There was a time when I saw myself as smart and decent looking. But that time is long gone :â€™(
