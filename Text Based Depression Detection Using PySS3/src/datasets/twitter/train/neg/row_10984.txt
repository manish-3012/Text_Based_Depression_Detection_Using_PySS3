Story time. Yay...Hereâ€™s a fucked up story that happened on the bus. 

People: R ( friend ) N ( also friend and crush ), Me ( suicidal bitch ) K ( also friend, but not really in the actual story )

So we were talking for a bit ( Note: this is going to be shorter than what I usually write, but who fucking cares anyways ) on the bus after school. And well, I told a story. Hereâ€™s how it went down.

Me: So one of my friends over ROBLOX, K, N you remember me talking about her. 

N ( on the chat ) : Life will get better as you get older 

Me ( also in the chat ): I donâ€™t plan to get as old as that. Maybe not even past this year. 

I told that story ( in more detail of course, but Iâ€™m not writing so much at such a "late" time of night. ) to them. 

N: **goes off and tells us about a meme.**

R is just sitting there, and I look over to see a slight discomfort in her face. I took that, being my optimistic tendencies, as her caring about what I had said and N not understanding what that really meant. 

A little bit of background just to show my whole mood that day: Nobody even noticed me until second hour where they had to talk to me otherwise our grades could lower. That hurt. A lot. Nobody fucking noticed me. I might make a whole other post since Iâ€™m going off topic, yeah, I might do that. 

Anyways, remember that people are always there for you, and somebody is just waiting to help someone like you. Know that you can talk to almost anybody and youâ€™ll probably get help. Who gives a fuck about the people who hate you. I know you donâ€™t. And thatâ€™s all that matters.
