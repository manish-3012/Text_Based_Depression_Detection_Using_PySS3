Ive waste my lifeI'm 23 living at home have my whole life, have no job no prospect of a job, not studying didn't even finish high schoo.l I somehow have a gf who I treat like shit (not her fault all mine I tell her multiple times a week to find a better guy and that I'm not worth the effort). my life is going no where slowly its just sad compared to anyone else I see around me. I have nothing every day I tell myself to just do it already and I never can I'm not even man enough to end my pathetic life.
