I wish telepathy was realI wish I could just share my thoughts and the way every thing feels in my head without having to speak. Every issue makes so much sense in my head but when I try and speak it all gets jumbled. I wish I could just momentarily grant someone access to my mind so they could understand the way Iâ€™m feeling
