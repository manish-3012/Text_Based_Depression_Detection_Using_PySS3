The hardest thing is wanting to be dead but choosing to live for the people that make you feel worthless and the want to be dead in the first place.I suffer everyday of my life wanting to be dead but choosing the opposite for my family because I know they will never be at peace with my death. 

It highlights the fact that I will live for everyone but myself.

And thatâ€™s hard to accept for someone that doesnâ€™t want to live their life in the 1st place.
