I just want to end it allIm a male 14 and just want everything gone just want to be gone

I've tried to stay positive and only got happiness out of makeing people laugh and hearing it and I just want people to be happy and that is the main force keeping me from ending it all

One day I covered my mouth with my hood and my mom flipped out ripped off my hoodie and proceeded to call me retarded multiple time saying she wish she ran away and wishing she aborted me and my brothers and I was heart broken and what hurt the most it was days before my birthday. When I'm over at her house I'm in constant fear she will be in a bad mood and just start yelling at us. She physically abused my older brother to the point he doesn't really feel pain and even choked him against the wall and threw him across the house. She has also threatened us with hammers saying she will kill herself. And I she doesn't have cigarettes weed or coffee (if one is missing) she will just go bat shit crazy and one day she was driving us to school and she spead down the road without a seat belt saying she wants to die.

My mom would say that she would move to Indiana (we live in Michigan) and move away from my dad (Which he is awesome and I couldn't wish for a better one) who helped me but he doesn't know I feel like this and I don't want to tell him in fear of hurting him.

After a couple months I went to cutting myself started on my shoulder and didn't even draw blood but then it went to my inner arms and at one point I counted over 50 cuts after I stopped for a few months and one day I started again and today it got bad as I just went at it cutting 5 times in 1 second 

I just want to die just get to peace but I don't want people to hurt.
