Be yourself ...You are beautiful as you are no matter how idiots say you are crazy or you are too strange ...
In the end of the day we only have ourselves  , we shouldn't force ourselves to become someone else .  I don't have to be someone else  iam myself . I think life is too short to become something i don't like ...
Long story short original is more worth than a copy ,  if nobody likes me screw them iam a lonewolf . The lion might be king of jungle but the wolf never performs in a circus . Your dreams are important protect them in case nobody told you .
I think that was all we needed .
