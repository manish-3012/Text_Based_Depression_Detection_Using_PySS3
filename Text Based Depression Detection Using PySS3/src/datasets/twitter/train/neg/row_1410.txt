Need help. Getting depressed about thinking about the pastMy wife and I met in high school our sophomore year. It was great until senior year. I broke it up with her senior year because I wanted to hang out with my friends more and I felt like she was too clingy. We started talking again a little after high school. But we were in the friend's stage. She would go out with some guys just to make me jealous (she told me this later). And we got back together before she could get in a committed relationship. So fast forward seven years to the present we been married and we just talking about old times and talking about high school and she tells me that she indeed slept with a friend of mine while we were broken up. To me I'm shocked and now I just can't stop picturing it in my mind of the image of those two having sex. Since we dated so young I never had really never had sex with anyone else except her( very embarrassing to say but I want you to get where I'm coming from. So to me sex is something that is special) and now everyday I just picture what they could have done like all the positions and stuff and all the stuff before sex. She says it didn't mean anything and she was trying to make me jealous at the time but felt bad after so thats why she never told me. I know she didn't do anything wrong because we were broken up but now when I see her or at work thats all I can imagine. Am I insane and making too much of it? she hates talking about it so it's hard just to tell her how I feel but I just picture them so vividly. It been getting me depressed and been seeing a doctor about it but still that doesn't help. So i don't know what else to do. How do i stop picturing it? I actually been contemplating  suicide
