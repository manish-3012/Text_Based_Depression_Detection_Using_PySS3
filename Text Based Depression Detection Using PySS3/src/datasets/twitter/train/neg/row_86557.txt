[Suicidal Ideation] The urge to die is stronger than the urge to liveI keep thinking that if the only things I like are phantoms and ghosts - fictional characters, old poems - why not go ahead. The world will be glad to be rid of me, and the feeling's mutual. I keep thinking about... certain methods of suicide, and *I know logically* that I won't be able to do it if I front up and try it. I don't even have a place in mind, though I suppose there's no shortage. That's a good sign.

Ugh. I want to *want to die*, but I guess no one really ever wants to, do they?
