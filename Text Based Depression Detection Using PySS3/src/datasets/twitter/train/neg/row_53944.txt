Making it look like an accidentI want to die, but I dont want to hurt my family and friends. I know it will hurt them regardless, but suicide is much more painful to deal with. Makes people think of what they could have done differently, makes them feel self loathing for something negative they said or did in the past. The guilt eats away at people. Thats the last thing I want to put on peoples consciences.

I thought about writing a note and just telling everyone it isnt their fault, that it's just how things ended up. I dont blame anyone for my severe hearing loss, which is the root of my depression and inability to connect with others. Its just the cards I was dealt, and I'm laying them down.

But no matter what I put in that note, people will still feel that guilt. That gnawing feeling of blame, no matter how little it may be. No note. No suicide.. at least that they will know about.

I thought maybe a car crash of some sort. Thats the best "accident" I can think of. Maybe I fall asleep at the wheel on the highway. But there is no guarantee I die then. And I dont want to hurt anyone else (I know, I know, I will inflict pain in other ways by doing this). There's gotta be some way though.
