I want to live, but not like thisI'm 18 and have been dealing with some sort of chronic intestinal disease that has yet to be officially diagnosed, but my doctor says it's likely Crohn's disease. I have spent the last few months in constant pain, tethered to a bathroom and unable to do anything but lay in bed and grovel. My mother has had to cook my meals for me because I can't stand at the stove long enough to do it myself.

I've dealt with suicidal thoughts and depression in the past, and just a few months ago I felt like I had finally moved past that time in my life. But I don't want to spend my life like this. Last night I was searching online for some ways to alleviate the pain but I just found story after story of horrible surgeries and health conditions that people with Crohn's have to deal with. I don't know how they do it. I'm worried that the moment it's confirmed that I'll be dealing with this for the rest of my life, I'm going to lose any reason to keep living.

I'm scared because I want to live, but if this continues I don't see any reason not to kill myself.
