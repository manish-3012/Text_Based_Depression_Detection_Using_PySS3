I'm too conflicted to do anything. I don't even know if I can commit suicide. :/part of me wants everything to stop. part of me doesn't know. pretty much all of me feels guilty about it. so i'm stuck in this place where i sort of want things to stop but im too conflicted to do anything.  part of me just wants everything to be over but i cant make it be :/ I've been planning my suicide for almost a year or more, and all of a sudden because of some things that happened last week, I've lost whatever nerve I had...I'm so upset I'm basically crying right now, because even this thing that gave me an escape, this thing I've planned for a year, I can't seem to do. And I don't think this is something where I survive, and get magically better. I don't even want to get better....or at least, part of me doesn't. maybe part of me does....but i kind of just want it all to be over......   :'[ I'm so sad I'm crying.
