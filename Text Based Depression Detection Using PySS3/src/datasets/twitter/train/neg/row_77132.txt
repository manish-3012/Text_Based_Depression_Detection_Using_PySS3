I planned to kill myself when my best friend went to Europe. She arrived there yesterdayMy best friend is on holiday in Europe. Several months ago I told myself this is when I would do it. Towards the end of her holiday. When she canâ€™t feel like she could have stopped me, and my boyfriend would be at work. Now she is gone I am scared. I feel so lost and unachieved. My medicine isnâ€™t helping and I feel like a lost cause. I feel like Iâ€™ve tried all I can. But now the time has come and I canâ€™t even do that. Iâ€™m afraid. I need help I know I do, but Iâ€™ve tried so many things and nothing is good. Iâ€™m not good enough to be here
