i can't wait to go hell...Im fuckin done. Im a loner who just observes everything, my grades are bad, Like all my parents fuckin care about is me gettin education, i get the fact that its for my future and shit but like i tell them im tired of this shit, i wanna commit suicide but they just laugh it off like im jokin, my parents fight with each other all the time, my siblings dont really give a fuck about anyone, and im just there sitting in the middle of it all, everyday it feels like a fuckin battlefield.
