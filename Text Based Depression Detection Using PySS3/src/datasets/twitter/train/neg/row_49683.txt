I talked my Mom out of committing suicide last night. I need help dealing with my emotionsLast night my mom texted me that she loved me and that she couldn't take the pain any more. I immediately called 911 and her and talked her out of it over the phone. She felt like she had failed me and my sister as a mother, I managed to convince her otherwise. I layed in bed with her talking about stuff, like how well we turned out, and how great a mom she was. When I left she seemed genuinely convinced not to do it, and was very regretful for putting me through that. She has always had depression but this is the first time she has threatened suicide. She is going to see a therapist tomorrow. 

So on to how I feel, at the same time I'm feeling incredibly numb and incredibly sad and just a lot of emotions in general. I'm glad she called me. I'm proud of convincing her not to do it. I'm guilty that I haven't cried yet. I'm mad that she put me through that. I'm mad at myself for feeling that way. I'm mad at my sister who lives with my mom for the way she responded to the whole ordeal with skepticism and being self centered. I'm mad at my sister for being the trigger for this. My sister has anxiety and often finds it difficult to go to school, she was doing well last year but she has already missed 6 days of school, and school has only been in session two weeks. My mom struggles every morning trying to motivate and force her to go. I want my sister to spend a week with my dad to give my mom time off from her. I don't know how to feel about being faced with  the prospect of not having my mother around, and realizing that she is one half of my whole world, I regret not being visiting more often
