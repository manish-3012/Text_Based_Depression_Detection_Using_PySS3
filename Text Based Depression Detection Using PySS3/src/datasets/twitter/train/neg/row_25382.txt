I feel awful all the timeI feel sick all the damn time. I don't think there's anything physically that can be fixed. My anxiety won't allow me to go more than a few days without a panic attack. And my depression prevents me from taking proper care of my self. Recently I've begun isolating myself from my friends and family. It's gotten to the point where walking around during lunch with my friends is too physical draining. I mostly just spend my time in the library and such. I feel like such an outsider when im around any of them. I figured that if I killed myself it would be easier if I stopped hanging out with them. Me disappearing on a regular basis wouldn't seem suspicious you know? But it's gotten to the point where getting up in the morning and leaving the house is such a pain that I've started making preparations for when the day arrives. It just feels so awful to be alive that nothing is worth living for.
