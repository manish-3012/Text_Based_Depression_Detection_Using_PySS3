Death, violence, tragedyMy mind is on it everyday, like a drug i am high on tragedy, I visualize violence on anything i see, mutilation and such.

The violence, i see it everywhere. I donâ€™t need to be told or to see it. I simply imagine other peopleâ€™s mutilation. 

Of which, I along with that,dream of removing all things I dislike around me in a blaze of violence followed with my own self induced death.

Even now I can imagine my insignificant mutilation on the floor.
