I'm so close to killing myself rn.I have a bottle of tylenol I'm about to down. I don't want to die, I just want all of the stress and anger and sadness to end. I'm lonely, one semi close friend, and my mom is emotionally abusive. I am always being criticized for every little thing, and I feel like I can't even fucking breathe. I am so fucking stressed in school right now, im taking an honors math class and I'm failing the fuck out if it, and it will follow me through high school (I'm in 8th grade). I can't concentrate anymore, and I'm always exhausted. I fall asleep in every class without fail every day. So many fucking end of year projects are driving me insane, and I just want to rip my hair out. I'm crying right now because I have just lost the will to live. I hate all of the stress and the Loneliness. I never have any room to breathe, it's like I'm crammed into a tiny box, and there's only one tiny hole for me to breathe through. I'm anxious as fuck over anything school related, just the thought of school makes my chest tighten. I have no clue how to handle this, it's just too much for me to handle. Maybe I'm just weak but I hate feeling this way. What other option do I have? Ugh.
