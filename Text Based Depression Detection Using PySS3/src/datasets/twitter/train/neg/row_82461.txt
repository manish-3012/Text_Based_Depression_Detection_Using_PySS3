I don't want to kill myself or die, I just want to disappear and be forgotten.I really don't know anymore, this past few months have been really toying with my emotions. Life is hard, I don't want to just end it but I have this fantasy where I just stop. I disappear. Nobody remembers me. I know if I ended my life, that would cause stress in my family and friend's lives. I don't want anyone to be sad. I just want to be gone.
