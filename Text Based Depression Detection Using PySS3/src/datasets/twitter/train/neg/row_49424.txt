Whatâ€™s my purpose?Whatâ€™s my purpose in life when all I do is fuck up. Iâ€™m drifting away from my friends. Iâ€™m struggling in school. Iâ€™m lonely as fuck, I canâ€™t get a girlfriend or just someone to cuddle with. 

So I ask again. Whatâ€™s my purpose when all Iâ€™ve known is failure time and time again?
