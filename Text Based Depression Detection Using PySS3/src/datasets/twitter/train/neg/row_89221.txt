Going to get help was a fucking jokeIâ€™ve been here 20 days.  I still wanna fucking die.  Iâ€™ve been transferred to multiple units and when I finally accepted that the new unit I got moved to despite the growing pains (it just opened up) the doctor here said itâ€™s not a good fit for me and is discharging me tomorrow.  Except they didnâ€™t do anything and I still wanna fucking die.  Thereâ€™s a slot in program MAYBE in two weeks and in the mean time I can go fuck myself apparently (the same two weeks that my out-patient psychiatrist is on vacation.  I posted here before about how hopeless this hospital admission felt hopeless.  I deleted it because I had come around to accepting it might actually help and that was a fucking joke.  Coming here took so much emotional bandwidth and it was all a waste.  Fuck this place but most of all, fuck me for thinking I had a chance.
