I tried to kill myselfI tried to kill myself by oding on paracetamol. I took 12 pills (1g each). Once I took them I played some music and tried to fall asleep. My head was spinning and I couldn't fall asleep for a pretty long time. Eventually I did, and now I'm here. I feel nothing, mentally and pyshically. I just feel numb. My stomach aches a little, I have a dry mouth and theres this weird chemical smell but I don't know where it's coming from. That's it. To be honest, a part of me expected this, but I was just hoping that it would work. I'm too scared to kill myself in any other way, the thought of going to sleep and never waking up again is wonderfull. Now I just feel like I did it for attention, or some kind of way of self harm instead of an actual suicide attempt. The whole thing was pretty impulsive, I had thought about doing this before, but I never followed through. This evening I was confronted by reality again and I just started thinking about how I wouldn't have to suffer anymore once I kill myself. I waited for my parents to go to bed so I could get the pills, while I was waiting I wrote a letter and made sure I was cool with all my friends and sibling just so that no one would feel guilty or anything like that. I did it, and I'm not even phased now. I don't know, I feel strange. I don't know what to do now, it's 4am now and I took the pills around 2.30am. I know that the effects can get worse and a part of me hopes they do, don't know why tho.
