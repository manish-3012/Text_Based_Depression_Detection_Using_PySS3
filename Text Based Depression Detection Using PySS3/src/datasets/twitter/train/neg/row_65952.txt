Waiting For The DayUm so hi people of reddit this is my first time posting and I just feel like I have no use to anybody or anything in this world.

So my school life is complete shit I have anxiety adhd combined and depression ofc and I always have the constant fact of wanting to end myself I don't know how I would do it its almost every time something bad happens or I fail I would just think about dieing and honestly the only thing holding me back from it all is the girl of my life my everything and we have been dating for 5 months and guess what her parents don't allow her to date and they just figured it out and ah ha im fucked and I just feel that if she leaves me because of her stupid overprotective parents that I'm legit going to end myself and I don't know what else I'm going to be living for because honestly I hate myself my body and my life I just want to die and I just cant change my mind I just wish that I could be with her and I have tried talking to people about it and I just cant and I'm done I cant take this shit world anymore and I just cant think about killing myself I feel that it would take too long to set everything up and then I would over think it and I just don't know what to do
