What the fuck is the point?I don't get it. I don't know why anyone would want to live. All of these stresses going on around me and I can't find a solution. Well, except a very grim one.

What makes it worse is that thes stresses are insignificant: hating my job, fearing rejection, being overweight, lacking confidence in any form, etc. Other people have far more troubling lives and I'm over here wanting to cut myself. 

Putting up with work and not being able to do anything I like for a living would be fine if there was a reason to do it, but it doesn't feel like there is. Anything I try, I'm bad at. Any time I put myself out there, I'm hung out to dry. But then I'm jerk for saying that my loving friends, family, and my dogs aren't rewarding. That's not fair to them, as they're beautiful people/animals that have helped me through a lot while listening to my whining. Not feeling joy over having them in my lives compounds my self hatred.

I'm a selfish piece of shit. Killing myself would fuck up the people around me, yet I yearn for the opportunity to end it. Death just sounds so much more peaceful. I wouldn't be inside my own head because I won't be alive, and that sounds beautiful. I can't imagine having more freedom.

Thanks for reading the rant. Don't fret, as I seriously doubt I'll ever go through with it, despite my romanticism towards it.
