I donâ€™t have anymore reasons to liveIf I could choose a date to die, Iâ€™d choose July 3, 2020. But because I canâ€™t go back before Everything That Happened, Iâ€™m at a loss.

I broke up with my boyfriend of 7 years, accidentally became involved in an emotional cheating situation with two of my closest friends and lost them both, and then needed to quit my job.

I wouldâ€™ve rather died without breaking someoneâ€™s heart or feeling that I donâ€™t know how to love anyone properly and donâ€™t deserve anyoneâ€™s love. I wouldâ€™ve rather died before spiraling out of control until I couldnâ€™t recognize reality anymore and having my friends lose faith in me. I wouldâ€™ve rather died thinking that I â€œmade itâ€ in my career field before my biggest supporter essentially pressured me to resign.

I feel stupid for believing that I deserved more. I feel stupid for trusting people that I shouldnâ€™t have. I feel stupid for thinking that someone like me could actually be worth something when only people who actually try and actually care deserve fulfillment.

I donâ€™t have anymore reasons to live. I think Iâ€™ve experienced enough excitement in my life to die now without thinking I missed out on anything. I feel guilty about wanting to escape my pitiful life without even trying to repent or service people who actually matter.

If I canâ€™t die for a cause, I wish something would just put me out of my misery so that I donâ€™t need to feel conflicted about wanting to die.
