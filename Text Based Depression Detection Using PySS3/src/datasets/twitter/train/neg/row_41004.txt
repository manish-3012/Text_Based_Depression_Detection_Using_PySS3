Does anyone else look back on their lives and realize there wasn't any way that you weren't going end up here?When you look back at how your parents treated you...how you got bullied in high school...how everything was just another step on a journey that was always going to end at suicide.  Like it was a predetermined narrative that you never had the option of escaping.

People ask why you are depressed and suicidal, and you think how can I not be?
