I can't fucking do this anymore the negative and suicidal thoughts get stronger. I feel like giving up on everything.I've been procrastinating instead studying for GED and Ive lost motivation, I'm fucking lazy I know.



I keep thinking about the fact that ill never have normal childhood memories (cause homeschooled) i hate people with a happy and normal childhood, its not fair that I got fucked like this. I feel like giving up on not just the GED but also life. 


Imagine being 15 studying for the GED while other kids are studying normally, all cause my fucking parents had to homeschool me. I feel like I'll die alone cause I don't have social skills, I can talk to people but I don't know how to have a relationship with people.

I keep saying ill commit suicide but I'm too cowardly.
