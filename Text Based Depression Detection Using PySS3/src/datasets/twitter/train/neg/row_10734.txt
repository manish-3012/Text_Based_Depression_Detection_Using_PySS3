I lost faith and since then I live in constant fear and depressionwell, i used to be a christian, and at that time i was kinda chill about life, since when i had any problems i just prayed and kinda delegated them to god. but recently i had just a massive snowball of problems that completely destroyed any reasons for me to believe in a loving god. it's like, the worst things that i always was afraid of and specifically prayed to god to deliver me from suddenly came to life. like, my parents divorced and basically became strangers to me and each other (i'm in my 30s but it's still hits like a ton of bricks), my best friend just randomly instantly died due to heart failure, my cat died and another one got very ill, my health started to fail me myself, and a ton of other shit.

as a result i very clearly realised that there is no god and never was. the problem, however, is that i used to rely on god on everything and now i know that i'm all on my own and that all kinds of imaginable bad shit is actually possible. so now i have all this fears building up and snowballing into severe depression, to the point that i can't have a normal sleep due to constant panic attacks. walk around like a fucking zombie. the only way for fear to stop is for me just to existing. but suicide itself is fucking scary, so i just got stuck in this shit state. stuck in this trap called life.

anyways, i just needed to share, not even sure why
