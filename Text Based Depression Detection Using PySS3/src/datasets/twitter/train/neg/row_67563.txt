DisassociatingI'm not doing well today in the least. I've been disassociating and having trouble fighting the depression. I obsessively research my method always looking for ways to improve it and I found one. My best friend would likely still know it was a suicide but for all intents and purposes it'd look like an accident. It also means I have something that's always available, low pain and low effort.  

I'm hurting so much lately that I'm starting to withdraw again. It became an essential defense mechanism for me in my youth to even as far as I have.  

I keep thinking about the last time I hung out with my bestie and if that was something she can cherish. On the way home was thinking that this could be the last everything, driving a car drinking a cold gatorade, leaving work and that I could be alright with that.

Is anyone out here a survivor of childhood rape by family? Wrestle with self hatred especially because you were born wrong... transgender? How can you keep going at all...  Please, I just don't want to hurt.
