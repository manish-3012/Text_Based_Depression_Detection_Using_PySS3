Still Looking for Hope I GuessI... honestly don't know why I'm doing this. I'm not really one to feel comfortable telling random strangers on the internet about my problems. I guess I just found this community just now looking for someone who will actually talk me out of killing myself, since I want to feel like I still have a reason to live. I'm and 18 year old trans guy who lived with an abusive dad for most of his life. Around 16 i stopped visiting him and now live permanently with my mom, but my whole life I've struggled with chronic mental health issues as a result of what I went through. Now covid has been going on for nearly a year now and I've had all of my college applications denied, my fafsa isn't being accepted, I can't get a job (my mom won't let me leave the house) and my two partners who I adore are thinking of breaking up with me because of the effects of constantly having a distanced relationship on their own mental health. I feel like I'm hurting everyone I love and turning into my dad, the exact person I didn't want to become. Even after years of therapy nothing seems to get better. For the past few weeks I've been tempted to just go in the shower and slit my wrists to bleed out, but I guess I'm still holding on for something. What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to get better? I'm honestly reaching my limit. Even writing this I feel like I'm being overdramatic and I should stop looking for help and just do it already. What do I do?
