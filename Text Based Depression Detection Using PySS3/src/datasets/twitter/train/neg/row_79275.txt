The days are harder.First time being here. I wouldnâ€™t say that Iâ€™m on the verge of ending it all right here and now, but the ideation has been more and more present lately. Started this past semester at school, with a lack of motivation or feelings of success or purpose. Then Covid sent me home early, forcing me to try and adapt to online and having lackluster grades at the end of the semester. Troubles at home, on top of the every downward spiraling news that happens daily. Iâ€™m beginning to wonder if itâ€™s worth sticking around to see. I donâ€™t see any hope for anything right now. Not sure where to go from here.
