I'm not even sure at this point.Somewhere along in life I learned to conceal my emotions..
Everyone does this to a certain degree but I don't feel anything emotionally. I haven't had a simple glimpse of contentment / peace of mind / sadness but the kind you feel alive while being sad / euphoria. The fact of the matter is, I haven't felt much of anything for the past 5 years.  Just the usual self hatred / anxiety. The thing is, I know people have a few months where they get down. But I haven't seen any hope or really felt anything in 5 years... I know I may not be alone in it sure, but at the end of the day when my head hits the pillow it's only me and my thoughts. I feel cursed in a way, like I'm just destined to only feel anxiety and self hatred for the rest of my days. I want to break down and lock myself up and cry all my problems away but not a single tear comes out. I know people can be broken, but this is just cruel.
