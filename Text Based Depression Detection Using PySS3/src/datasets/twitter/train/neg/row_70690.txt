I dont know anymoreRecently I really think about killing myself. For the last 6 years the thought has been wandering through my head, but I never had the balls to do it. I tried to talk with so many people but it doesn't change shit. I'm just tired. I really hope that I would die in an accident. I don't want my family to be sad. I had a lot to do with suicide and death. I know how it feels when a friend or family member kills himself. But I just can't take it no more. My parents think, how I feel, is a fucking joke. I feel like I'm slipping further out of really everyday. I know that y'all are strangers but if I do it I just want to be sure that some one out there knew, even if its for 1 minute, how I felt.
