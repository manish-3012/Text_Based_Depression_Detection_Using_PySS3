I think I wanted to spend my life with a ugly depressed loser...My biggest fantasy is love... I'm not a romantic woman, I never watch stupid romance movies, only into horror, drama. I like gaming etc etc.. but I don't know how the fuck why.. I've always been overly obsessed by finding a soulmate... I think thats the only hope that kept me alive... 

Now in my mid 30's in a toxic relationship, I'm totally disillusioned. All I do is listening to music loud all day raging about the fact that I'll never find what I wanted, so I want out.

I think I needed a very meh looking guy, a gamer, a loner... but caring and romantic. We would've been 2 against the world. Nobody else understands whats it is to totally not care about money, job, power, looks... I just hate society and always thought that only thing worth living for was love. Why am I so pathetic? Hahahaha
