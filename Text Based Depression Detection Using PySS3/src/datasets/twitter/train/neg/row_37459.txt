I've been thinking of amassing as much wealth as I can, living it up for as long as it will allow me, and then killing myself when it's over.I've been selling things non-stop for the past week and a half.  I'm going to keep selling until there's nothing left and then I'm going to hit the road.  I'm going to drive to a state with legal marijuana (probably Washington), smoke a bunch of pot, take a long, hot shower in a motel, and go out to enjoy a really nice meal.  I'm going to get into all the adventures I wish I would have gotten into when I was younger, and when the money runs out, I'm going to kill myself.  I have some (admittedly minor) health problems, and I've been in therapy for a few years.  I'm tired and bored of life.  I don't want to live anymore.
