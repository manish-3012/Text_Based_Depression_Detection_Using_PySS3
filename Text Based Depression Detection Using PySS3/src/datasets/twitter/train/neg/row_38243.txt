I'm going to end it all. Life's too muchI'm 19 years old. I have achieved exactly nothing in life, and when I say nothing, I mean literally nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I have severe mental health issues that make every moment of my life a living hell. I have severe depression, anxiety, paranoia and have high-functioning autism. I have no confidence in myself and can't even leave the house without having a panic attack. I'm completely fucked up.

&amp;#x200B;

I have precisely 0 friends. Not a single person who cares about me the slightest. Not a single person I could hang out with, share my thoughts and life with, or just be there for me. I have severe social anxiety, and everyone I try and be friends with instantly comes up with some excuse for not wanting to hang out, and then they ghost me out and don't even reply if I ever get as far as adding them on social media. I'm so lonely, and spend every single day alone and miserable.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had a relationship. No woman would ever be attracted to me. Ever. I'm decent looking, but I'm 5ft 9in and have barely any muscle. I have badly chapped lips that never seem to heal. My teeth are in bad condition because I'm so depressed I rarely bother to brush them. I'm almost thoroughly unattractive. I'll never have anyone to love me, cuddle with me, or accept me for being myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no job, no money. No hope for a career either. I've been trying to get into college, but I didn't get accepted. Even if I could go to college, I would hate it because I wouldn't be able to make any friends and I would feel even more lonely. I would just fail my studies as I can never concentrate, because I'm mentally incapable of doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no hope of ever being independent. I will never have my own place or car. I don't even have a driver's licence. There are 16 year old kids who are driving their dream car, and I barely have enough money for a month's worth of rent. I live off of welfare, which isn't a lot of money, and most of the money I receive goes to my room and board. I'm stuck living with a roommate who treats me like shit, because my parents didn't want me living with them. I would avoid my roommate completely, but I'm forced to shop for groceries with him because I don't have a vehicle. He is extremely rude and condescending, and makes an already bad shop session even worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I sincerely doubt that anything will ever get better. In fact, I don't think it's even possible that things could turn around. I have lost all hope at this point. I am overwhelmed by so many severe problems that are not fixable in my case at least. I'm seriously planning on killing myself. No one would care that I'm gone. I might as well do it. No one cares anyway. I'll give an update when I'm going to do it.
