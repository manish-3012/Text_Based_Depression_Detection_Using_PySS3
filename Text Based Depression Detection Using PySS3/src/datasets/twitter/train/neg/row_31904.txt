I think i'm losing the fightI'm depressed, anxious and alone. I'm fighting this fight for about 10 years now. I was so confident as a kid, but my parents destroyed me. For every mistake, no matter how small, i would get beaten. Didn't brush my teeth, here comes the belt. It fucked me up. Today the thought of making a mistake makes me wanna crawl into bed. Didn't pass an exam? I feel worthless and anxious. Also i'm ashamed of my self. As a teen, the beatings got replaced by psychological torture. My parents would tell me i'm lazy, worthless and that i never would achieve anything. At some point i turned to food and barely left my room. I gained a lot of weight which i still carry around. Now not only my parents fucked me up, but there also was bullying in school. The once confident kid turned into a stuttering teen. I don't know, i could continue to ramble on, but i guess you got the point.

Fast forward to now. Additional to all mentioned problems i now also have trust issues and fear of being abandoned by my friends. I feel like i mean nothing to them. I'm all alone. Daily life alone is hard enough. But right now it's nearly unbearable. I have to move cities because of uni. And the housing market seems to be just like a dating market nowadays. I'm trying to find a commune, so i can live with 2-3 other students together. Currently i'm living alone and it's not good for me. I wrote to several people who offered a commune in the new city. Usually you have to write something about yourself and send them a pic. Well i didn't get a single answer yet and its killing me. I feel like i'm worthless to other people. Who wants to live with a fat dude. No one. Not even my friend who got accepted to the same uni. We were planning to get a flat together, but she started searching by herself without telling me and now she already found something. I honestly don't know if i want to continue fighting. I can't do it anymore. I'm 23 and i feel like shit. I just want to disappear.
