I donâ€™t have a friend.Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s going on with me but  Iâ€™m depressed, anxious, and Iâ€™m feeling really disconnected from the world right now. One of my problems that have developed is that (I believe because of rejection) I have begun putting an act on. Itâ€™s hard to describe but I feel like I canâ€™t stop performing this act. It feels like I canâ€™t speak in my own voice and I act in the way that I think in my own head is most generic so people will leave me alone. I donâ€™t know why but Iâ€™m incapable of stopping the act. Iâ€™ve just kind of adopted the voice. I think my voice but express my thoughts in a different voice. Iâ€™ve had a very hard time socially for the past year and a half. I feel like I canâ€™t really communicate anymore because of what Iâ€™ve just described and Iâ€™m feeling really lonely at this point. 

I think my â€œfriendsâ€ only donâ€™t reject me because we have been real friends in the past. The just kind of let me hang with them so that they arenâ€™t ditching the old Ben they used to know. I feel like a shitty person for making them spend time with me when they donâ€™t want to so I havenâ€™t really reached out to anyone over quarantine. This has been eye opening because Iâ€™ve realized how false our relationships have really been. I havenâ€™t really even wanted to be social for the past year and a half but I wanted â€œfriendsâ€ so that I would look normal and hopefully stay normal amidst my mental problems.

Itâ€™s sad to say that I havenâ€™t received one text from a â€œfriendâ€ from high school. I knew my relationships were false but for some reason I hoped that at least someone would remember me and at least ask how Iâ€™m doing. I think some people saw that I was having a shitty time when school was still going or maybe they just think Iâ€™ve completely changed as a person. I have no friends anymore and itâ€™s really sad becaUse I donâ€™t think I can make any. The only healthy relationship I have left is with my mom. The only reason this relationship is alive is because how much she loves me. I push her away every day but she just tries harder and harder to understand. I was in the IB program at my school (sort of like AP but for every class). I told her today that I think that I want to drop out and she was so understanding. She told me that if thatâ€™s what I have to do she wonâ€™t be mad.

My mom tries to encourage me to leave bed every day or stop playing Xbox because it will only make my problems worse. I usually end up fighting with her or crying. She always tells me things will get better but i feel like they wonâ€™t. Iâ€™ve fought everyday for the past year and a half and nothing has changed. I feel like I donâ€™t have normal depression anxiety or dpdr I feel like Iâ€™m not going to be okay but she tells me this every time. She believes it but I really really donâ€™t. At least I still have one person even if I push them away.
