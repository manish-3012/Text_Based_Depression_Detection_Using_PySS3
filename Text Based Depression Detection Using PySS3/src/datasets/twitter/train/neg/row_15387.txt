Time limitI decided to give myself a time limit. I'm going to try to make this year better for myself but if I'm still depressed then I give up. Right now I see no future for myself at all. I'm just trying to get by not really living. I'm turning 25 this year and I feel like a failure.  I'm gonna try to better myself by focusing on my physical health and mental health. As for mental health I'm trying to stay off social media. I'm trying to find my self worth. Physical is hard for me, I have no motivation. My anxiety keeps me from driving, I don't have a driver's license (scared to drive)  dropped out of school cause of anxiety and stress. I feel like everyone has there shit together but me. Let's see how 2020 goes.
