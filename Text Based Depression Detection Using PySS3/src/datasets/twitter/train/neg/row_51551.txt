I wish I had the gutsI grew up on every anti-depressant and increasing dosage until I thought I was over it and quit taking them. Like they were something I could just use as a stepping stone to get out of a hole. I had friends, I had a life, I was happy. Things fall apart I'm back in this hole again, no friends, no social life, no happiness. I'm back to feigning a smile everyday of my life like its something I have to practice in front of my mirror for to please everyone else.
I've almost been this close to following through before, not with something so easy though. I'll sit sometimes for hours with a loaded gun to my head until my arm hurts and I can't keep it there anymore. I'm held back by the thought of my family seeing the aftermath. I know I'm a burden, I'll never be anybody, I'll never find love. it's a cruel game to kid myself any longer, to trudge by another day through this life that seems like a jail cell window that I'm doomed to look out of and see happy people. I've tried treatments, prescriptions, and therapists, more than anyone knows. I know I can't fix myself now, so I'd rather just take myself out of the equation entirely.
