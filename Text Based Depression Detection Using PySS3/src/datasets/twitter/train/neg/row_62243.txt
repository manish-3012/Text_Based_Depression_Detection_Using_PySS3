I am killing myself tonight. I'm sorry.I'm sorry mom I wanted to be strong for you but I can't anymore. Today I just lost everything, someone I looked up to, my friends, the person that I loved. Everyone just left. WHY DIDN'T YOU FUCKING DO IT SOONER, WHY DID YOU KEEP LOOKING FOR SOMETHING BRIGHT, THERE IS NOTHING FOR YOU HERE, JUST FUCKING DIE ALREADY.
