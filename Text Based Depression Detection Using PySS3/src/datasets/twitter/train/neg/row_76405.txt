I don't know what to say.I decided today that I'm going to die on the 5th August. 

I was going to fight it. I went to the doctor today. I got meds. They are sat unopened on my floor. 

2 days ago my life ended, but I was willing to suffer through it, not for my own sake but for someone else's.

I had that taken away today. My life is over, my future if I stay is going to be painful, and may be ended for me.

I feel calm. The tears have stopped. 

I was never very religious, but I'm wondering what the other side is like.

I guess that's all I've got to say.
