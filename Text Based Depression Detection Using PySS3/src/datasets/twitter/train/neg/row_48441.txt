I'm an unimportant nobody and always will be. Why not kill myself?I'm not famous or important in any way. I have never done nor will do anything of note or improve society in any way (and don't bother trying to convince me otherwise). I will only ever be important to 2 people out of billions. How is that not reason enough to kill oneself? If you have something that's useless, you get rid of it. You don't keep it for no reason unless you're a crazy hoarder. To stay alive for no reason in such a limited, worthless existence just seems silly. 

Yes, I know there are other reasons to stay alive (family, hedonism, fear of death), but they seem pretty weak compared to the above reason to off myself.  Convince me otherwise.
