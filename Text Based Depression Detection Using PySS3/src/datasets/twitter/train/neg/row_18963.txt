I really think I may do it soonI don't know what I really am doing. Day before New Years Eve my now ex girlfriend dumped me after I fessed up to a self harm relapsed. I've been torn about since then, had to move back to my abuse home with my mom and brother who sexually abused me, and now I feel so lost. Only thing I have going for me is the job I just got, but other than that I feel lost. My abandonment issues alongside other issues are just going wild and anything I do just feels useless. I feel useless and that everyone will eventually leave me. Everything just feels fucked. I'm tired, scared, and it feels like everything I try to do to better myself comes back to get me later. I want to give up, I want to throw in the towel, but everyone keeps telling me not to and I am just conflicted. I don't want to hurt others, but I don't want to be in pain anymore either. I'm tired of dealing with PTSD and my other special snowflake labels. I just wish I wasn't this weird complicated mess people realize is too much to deal with and just leave. I'm in therapy currently and take medication but it doesn't feel like it's working. I've been to a psych ward, but those places are awful and I never want to go again. Just, help I don't know how much longer I can really take it
