There seems to be no coverage of this method.For a long while and for many reasons, whether they be not wanting to upset my parents religious ideals that I will end up in Hell, or the grief and guilt that it would put upon my friends and family. This was and often still is a method that I think about and have tried and yet whenever I look up if anyone else has thought of the same thing or has these same feelings I always find nothing. In order to make suicide look like an accident many turn to the â€˜suicide by copâ€™ or stepping out in front of a vehicle. But in a society (at least where I live) where there is a lot of violence at street level there are people who are willing to kill you over a phone. Itâ€™s like some sort of painful euthanasia. So, whether Iâ€™ve got all my valuables on me, coming back from the gym with a bag full of sweaty clothes or on my way to the chicken shop with nothing but some coins, every time Iâ€™ve been accosted or attacked in some sort of attempted mugging or whatnot Iâ€™ve never handed anything over or backed down-To many on the outside this has seemed like some sort of bravado or ego related ordeal but in fact it was the best way I thought I could die without anyone thinking that I was going through anything. To this day (and thankfully, I guess) no one has fully gone through with it but I still think about this method at least once a day, and rather than steering clear of dangerous looking groups, locations and situations where there are people known to want to harm me I will travel through them on purpose- to the others a sign of bravery and boldness but to me Iâ€™m just really hoping someone else can take me out because I know I canâ€™t.
