I have parasitesFor about two years. Tapeworms. All throughout my body, and I could deal with that and try to kill them... but they have been in my brain for about half the time I was infected. I work and go to school and I'm older, settling down age. Beyond it maybe. I don't know which is deteriorating faster, my mental or physical health. I am dismissed by every doctor that I see; they're all arrogant and rude and cold. I am black with public health insurance so why would they care about me anyway. No one in my personal life believes my struggle. I am always "too young for that" when I talk about my medical issues and symptoms. Doctors say the same and don't test for what they need to because it's "not likely". My brain right now feels so swollen like it will pop out of my skull. My scalp is permanently numb in some areas, parts of my face, my forehead, and the upper row of my teeth. I know that cysts are putting pressure on nerves and that's why. My stomach feels raw and is the most painful it's ever gotten. I went on a parasite cleanse a month ago and thought I was good after that except there's nothing I can do for the brain worms. I can't spell anymore or retain information or understand directions. I feel senile sometimes. I already had a hard life. No one is helping me. I have no protective factors. This is the first time I was sure that I have no choice but to die. Thanks for reading if you got this far, it makes me feel less invisible. I hope that God forgives me. God, please help me...
