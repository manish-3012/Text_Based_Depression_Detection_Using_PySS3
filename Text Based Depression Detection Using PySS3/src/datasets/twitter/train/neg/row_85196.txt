i wish everything would stopat age 15 in foster care i never thought life could get worse but i was so wrong. the system put me back into a worse life than i could ever imagine. i moved back in with my mom and was happy until she started seeing my dad again behind my caseworker and therapists back. i spoke up too late, too. they couldnt help me at that point because i just turned 18 by the time i said she was talking to him. now im 20, down to my last $2 with no job, and im constantly arguing with these terrible excuses for parents. i have always felt suicidal since i was 12 and each time life hits me back i feel more and more compelled to hurt myself. i cant do it anymore is all im saying. i never got a headstart in life, and all the help given to me as a kid was for nothing at all, because as an "adult" i SHOULD have my life together. a friend committed suicide last year, and maybe ill just do the same, so i can at least have some peace.
