I think today is my final dayMy dad said to me that I should go ahead and pull the fucking trigger already and if I do then all the money Iâ€™ve given him for rent will go towards my sons college fund as long as I do it before Christmas, thereâ€™s so many years of abuse and hurt and pain, I canâ€™t do it anymore I just canâ€™t, I want the pain to end finally and sleep forever. Iâ€™m sitting in my room crying, Iâ€™ve lost 2 friends the past few weeks and Iâ€™m a very introverted person and only have one left. Iâ€™m about to start writing letters to those who where important in my life. I canâ€™t do it anymore
