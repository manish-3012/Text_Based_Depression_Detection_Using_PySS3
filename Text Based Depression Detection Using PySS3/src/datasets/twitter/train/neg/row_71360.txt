the thought of my death honestly fills me with so much peaceat least then I won't be around to cause any more pain, I make people regret getting close to me every time and always in newer, more creative ways, I'm just not worth the effort it takes to maintain any kind of relationship with me so I might as well save everyone the trouble and just end it already
