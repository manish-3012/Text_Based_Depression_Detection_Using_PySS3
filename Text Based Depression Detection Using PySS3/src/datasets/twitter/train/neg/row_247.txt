i wish i could get hit by a busmy life is just awful. i have virtually no friends and i don't even think they care about me. the one true friend i had blocked me on everything because i hurt her because some of my ex friends set me up while drunk. my family never pick up on signs i give to them  and seem to not care about me either. it feels like if i killed myself tomorrow no one would even cry. I have been feeling like this for a long time the only thing which kept me doing it was the arrangement i had with a friend that if one of us died the other one would killed them self now that i am not friends with her any more  so no one would miss me i just don't see the point in living anymore its to painful
