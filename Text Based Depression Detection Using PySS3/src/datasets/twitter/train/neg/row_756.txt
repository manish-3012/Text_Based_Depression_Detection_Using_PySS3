I feel like there's literally nothing going for meI have created this account exclusively to post this.

I am a 16 year old student that is constantly bullied and have bad grades. I don't really think I'm worthy to be suicidal, but I constantly feel like ending my life, because it feels like I will never have to face problems again. The solution I have come across multiple times is to ask for help. I told my parents, and they told me I was being over-dramatic and attention-seeking. I told my friend, and he just laughed at me. I don't feel like anyone cares. Plus the way my grades are, i'm going to be a failure in life and be living with my parents forever, so, who cares if I'm not here?
