My top five "don't kill yourself" songsSo I think I've figured out my top five songs to keep me around. These songs make me feel less shitty about my shitty life and my constant suicidal thoughts and acts of self-harm. They help remind me to try and keep living, because the future might be great.

- Cut the Cord by Shinedown
- Life Must Go On by Alter Bridge
- The Best of Times by Styx
- Addict With a Pen by twenty one pilots
- The Final Cut by Pink Floyd

What songs have stopped you from suicide, or help you deal with the thoughts?
