if you said no i was going to kill myselfi will never tell you this because thatd be manipulative as fuck. but i had it planned out. you said i was pushing you away when i asked you if you wanted to stay. you said u didnt want to leave and i told you thats not the same thing. if you said you didnt want to stay, i wouldve set you free. you wouldnt be leaving, i would. i wouldve gotten up, walked over to the pill cabinet, and taken every one. The virus is so bad in my county that I couldnt be treated in time. But you said yes, you do want to stay. so i will too. and youll never know the other option. youll never know that in that moment between my question and your answer, i was schrodingers cat.
