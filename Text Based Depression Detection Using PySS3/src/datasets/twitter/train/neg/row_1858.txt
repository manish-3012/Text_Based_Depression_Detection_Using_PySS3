RationalizingI'm a loser. I'm a grown adult (21) and I can't even leave bed most of the day. Even my nine year old sister has been telling me that I need to get a job. I'm definately going to be dead within the next few months, though, so why bother?

Honestly, I think the main reason I need to die is that I'm disgusted with myself. I am not straight and I am not cis. I wish I was both of these things so badly... I don't think I would need to die if I was. But I am so it would be better for my family if I were to die. It would be better for me, too, because then I won't have to face their ridicule or worry about being homeless.

I think the worst part is how close I had come to breaking free. I had finally accepted myself... I got the go-ahead to start transitioning and everything. But it ended up not working out so now my only options are living like this forever (and making my family hate me and the community hate my family) or death. I think it's an obvious choice, really... But it doesn't make it any easier.
