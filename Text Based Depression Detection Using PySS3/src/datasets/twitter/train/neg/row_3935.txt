idk...I dont think Iâ€™m suicidal. I mean I would never be able to actually do it but I also donâ€™t want to be here anymore obviously. Often, Iâ€™ve found myself trailing back here and reading others suicide stories and experience. I have a friend who considers it and we literally joke about it. But I only joke about it because I canâ€™t handle it. And things I canâ€™t handle I just laugh off. I have considered so many options but none of them seem so great or in my favor. If I snitch on her, she either goes to rehab and gets better or falls deeper in the hole sheâ€™s in and both will be my fault. Or I could keep it to myself and she ends up dead and I will still feel guilty. What left is there to say when they are dead? Sheâ€™s always joking abt it with me and itâ€™s actually making me really worried and concerned but I could never tell her because then she wouldnâ€™t trust in telling me anymore. She said something today abt being mentally checked out and I changed the subject because I donâ€™t know how to deal with it anymore. Obviously I donâ€™t want to make it about me because my problems arenâ€™t no where near as bad. But I canâ€™t stand talking about it knowing soon sheâ€™ll be gone. And knowing she takes it so lightly as if itâ€™s so normal. Idk y but Iâ€™m not afraid of death and could care less if it was me. But if itâ€™s her or anyone else I just get worried or feel this sense of guilt. I donâ€™t expect anyone to see this. I just needed somewhere other than my email drafts to write this. .x.
