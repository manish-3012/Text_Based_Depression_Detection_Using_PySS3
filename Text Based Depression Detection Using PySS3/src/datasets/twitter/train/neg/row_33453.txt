Why even keep on living like thisThis is just me venting, be free to ignore it. 
I'm 22 years old with no hopes of future and an absolutely fucked up mental health. I'm unable to work and I cut myself. I act like a fucking shield even though I shouldn't. Right now I'm drunk in the morning and didn't eat in 2 days. I didn't masturbate in a while which was one of my last coping mechanisms I had in life. Situation is fucking bleak, no reason to continue and no hope for improvement. I'm so sick of living like this. I don't do any housework and even ignore my hygiene, don't brush my teeth or shower at all. I hope so bad that one day I'll be able to do it. Until then I'm just going to suffer more of this horrible loop that is called life.
