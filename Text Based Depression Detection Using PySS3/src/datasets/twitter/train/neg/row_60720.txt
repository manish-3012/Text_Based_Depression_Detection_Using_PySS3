Iâ€™m actually considering it.Iâ€™ve been off my medication for about two weeks  (due to financial issues) and itâ€™s really starting to fuck with me. I canâ€™t get out of bed, Iâ€™ve been overeating considerably, I canâ€™t force myself to shower anymore, and Iâ€™ve been thinking of killing myself. Iâ€™m also incredibly unattractive and Iâ€™m embarrassing and should just shoot my brains out. I also miss my father so much, every time I talk about my problems even a little bit people visibly get annoyed with me. I think Iâ€™m going to do it.
