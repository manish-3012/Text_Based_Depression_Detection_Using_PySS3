The moment I turn 21, I am buying a gunI'm nearly 20 and I can't wait. It's the most excited I have been in a very long time! It will be the greatest birthday present ever. I live in an area where gun laws aren't even that strict. I have an abusive girlfriend, narcissistic stepmother and college is a useless debt builder. I am going to end it, I just wish it could get here faster
