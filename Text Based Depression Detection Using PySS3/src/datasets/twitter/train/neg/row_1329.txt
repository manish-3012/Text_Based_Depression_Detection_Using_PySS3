Whatâ€™s the alternative to death.Really, I feel like everything Iâ€™ve done for the past year has been with the thought of Iâ€™ll be dead by then but Iâ€™m still here. Now though, all the consequences seem to be catching up and I really donâ€™t feel thereâ€™s an alternative than to do it. Iâ€™m scarred of it but Iâ€™m just as terrified of not doing it. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m trapped.
