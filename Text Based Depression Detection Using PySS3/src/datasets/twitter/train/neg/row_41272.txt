Been hoping to die for a long time now. Now thinking of the best way to kill myself.My life is a mess after 20 years of constant failure.  
  
* Failing out of college with a ton of debt.  
* No skills or job experience whatsoever.  
* No way to even get around town.  
* Not sure I can live with family knowing about my failure.  
* No friends at all and I've never actually had any.  
* No money, can't even afford to fix the glasses I broke this weekend so I'm also incapable of seeing more than 10ft in front of me.  
* Too much social anxiety to talk to anyone about my issues.  
* Not in good physical shape.  
* Failed at every single thing I've ever put my heart into.  
  
I don't really know what to do anymore.  
With my family, I was supposed to be the smart one.  The one who finally did better than my parents and got us out of poverty.  And I failed it just like everything else in my life.  
  
Not only did I fail, but me and my family are actually far worse off than we were before I even made the attempt.  
  
And I can't blame anyone but myself.  
  
Lately the only thing I've thought about is whether or not I'll be able to kill myself in a way where my family won't find the body.
