Every time I feel optimistic, every time I think I'll put effort into my life... it ends with me imagining a rope around my neck.All I want is to be a normal person who can just *do* the things they need to. Instead, it's an immense struggle just to motivate myself, convince myself my life isn't worthless, for even half an hour. And no matter what I do â€” whether I try to use that motivation to better myself, learn things, exercise, or I just sit around and do nothing, it always ends the same way. Wondering why I ever felt optimistic. Everything is such an effort. Sometimes breathing is too much of an effort. 

How can people not only come up with something that makes them happy to be alive, but *work* towards those things? What's so wrong with me that while normal humans are achieving their dreams, or at least being content with what they have, I sit here unable to even use my abundance of free time to take one small step towards a better future?
