I want to end it all, but I still am not sure, any help is welcomeI came into a point in which my dreams seem completely unreachable and I'm struggling a lot with life and everything seems so painful to continue. I would like to live a few more months to experience some things for the last time.

Anyone that wants some more detailed info, PM me, I don't feel like sharing it in public.
