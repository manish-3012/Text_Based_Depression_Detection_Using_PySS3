My only regretMy head is completely messed up. It's become harder and harder for me to see the point in doing anything anymore, and i think people are starting to notice it. 
I've become so used to putting up a facade around other people, but i don't even know what I'm trying to hide because the true version of me has never really had the chance to exist. All the things that used to bring me just a little bit of joy, is starting to feel like a chore that i have to do to keep up the persona that i have created for myself.
I would consider this past year to be both the best and the worst year of my life. I would consider it to be the best because I've been able to push all my emotions away for long periods of time and I've become more social, but everything of course comes with a consequence. Because of this my life has become so dull and whenever i lack the ability to push my feelings away anymore, they come back at me like a big wave and it becomes bigger and harder to escape that wave every time. And every time i think im about to reach the surface of the water i get pushed down again. 
Even though i have many absolutely amazing friends,  i can never really tell them how i truly feel, because i don't wamt to burden them and they'll never fully understand it. 

3 weeks ago, life became too much for me and i decided to try and take my own life. 
I took 17 1000mg painkillers, and then i went to sleep. I had hoped i was going to die in my sleep, but i woke up 4 hours later and felt extremely dizzy and nauseous. I proceeded to go to the bathroom and throw up for 30 minutes, before i finally decided to yell for my mother. If i had just waited for 10 more minutes i would have been dead. 
My only regret in life was to call for help. I should've died that day. I wanted to die that day, but i guess something in me felt like i hadn't said goodbye properly.
