I hate the it gets better and Iâ€™ve said it myself before..Iâ€™ve have two suicide attempts before one in  July and November 2019.. after my one year in July I was like â€œif gets better donâ€™t give up.â€ And Iâ€™ve been super suicidal since October and Iâ€™ve thought about suicide multiple times after that.. Iâ€™m planning on killing myself Iâ€™m just debating on doing it before or after Christmas.. I ruin everything I touch and Iâ€™m just tired.. anyway I hate the saying â€œit gets betterâ€ because it doesnâ€™t :(
