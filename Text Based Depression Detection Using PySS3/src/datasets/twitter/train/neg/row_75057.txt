OverwhelmedIâ€™m starting college in a few weeks and Iâ€™m scared about it and a part of me wants to run away from it. Family issues are getting hard itâ€™s like each half is against the other and Iâ€™m the bridge in between. Thereâ€™s just so much in my head that needs sorting and big things coming up and itâ€™s driving me crazy I canâ€™t cope. Every time I close my eyes to sleep or have some quiet time to myself all I think about is what needs to be done or whatâ€™s coming up and I know I shouldnâ€™t say it but I just wanna give up I have no desire to go to college anymore and I just want everything to stop and not have to worry about anything anymore plus I feel like shit all the time so why not just go. I know thereâ€™s probably easier ways to cope and I should be excited for college and on some days I am but lately itâ€™s getting too overwhelming.
