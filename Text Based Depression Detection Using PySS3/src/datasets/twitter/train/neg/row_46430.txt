I botched it. Life.Iâ€™ve been depressed my whole life. Flashback to 3 years ago, me being 17. I fall in love, and get the girl pregnant at 18. No big deal, I marry her. Baby is born when Iâ€™m 19. Iâ€™m happy. We are living with my parents, trying to be the best parents we can while still being teenagers. Itâ€™s so stressful for me, and depression and anxiety slip back in. I cope with it well(or so I thought), but every now and then Iâ€™ll let it burden my then wife. Eventually I fucked up the relationship for good, and sheâ€™s refusing to try marriage counseling. Sheâ€™s been gone for a few months now, wonâ€™t even talk to me. I fucked up way too big and Iâ€™m only 20 years old. All I want is to live in a happy family with my daughter and the love of my life. But I ruined it. Sheâ€™s great, it actually was me that fucked it all up. In just one year, I fucked up my dream family and lost it for good. For someone whoâ€™s already struggled with depression, this is the nail in the coffin, of what will be a closed casket cuz Iâ€™m buying a shotgun. I pray that my family forgives me. I pray that my ex wife knows itâ€™s not her fault. I pray that my daughter finds happiness without me. I pray that God forgives me and allows me peace in heaven.
