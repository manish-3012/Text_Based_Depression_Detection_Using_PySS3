Shit - I'm really down, this could be itSo I've just been feeling so down since Friday , it's a huge accumulation of stuff though and man.... I'm really sad that I'm just out of control. 

Christ , I can't even explain it. It's just hurts.

I need to rest but I can't. I need to relax but I have too much in my mind. I keep getting worse every year and I just really do want to end it all.

I fantasize of getting a gun and just like that stopping this struggle of feeling so insecure and powerless, of being be belittled, patronized and taken advantage of. 

My kids , parents and wife would suffer though and that keeps me trapped in this loop of suffering. I really want to end it.

In the past I've gotten like this and then a month later I'm glad I didn't do anything about it but in the moment right now, there's nothing more satisfying then jumping in front of a train.

Thousands of people do it every day.
