I'm going to do it, no words will stop me now..Not my first throwaway on this sub, I've read the replies people gave me which helped and let me hold on for a little bit longer, but today I reached a tipping point.

I haven't cried this much since grade school when my favorite teacher died in a car crash.

On my way to the second week of my shitty minimum wage job an hour away on public transit bagging groceries for snooty rich white people, I missed one of my buses by a few seconds, and the next bus was in an hour. Out of frustration I threw my phone into the grass (assuming maybe it wouldn't break) but nope won't even power on.

So I couldn't call in late (which would be my second tardy in about a week)
And I don't even have any friends who would notice that my phone is broken, or that I am dead, since I have none..

i'm sure I'll be fired. My bank account is at 51 cents right now, and I feel like offing myself.

My future doesn't look too bright either, after 1 year of uni my GPA is complete shit, and I'm in a highly competitive major. 

The easiest and most sensible way out would be to kill myself, and there are plenty of tall buildings and train tracks all around.
