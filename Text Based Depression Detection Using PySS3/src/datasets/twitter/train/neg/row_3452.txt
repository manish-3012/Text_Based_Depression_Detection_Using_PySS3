My best friend since childhood failed suicide last night. How should I handle the subject when he leaves the hospital.As said my best friend has always struggled with depression and last night tried to kill himself. Any general advice on how you wish your loved ones reacted next time they saw you and how you wish it was handled? 

Right now he doesn't know I know as his parents forbade telling anyone but his little brother went rogue and told me. He's still in the hospital and will be fpr several days. He doesn't have his phone so I really wont have contact with him for a little while. 

I sent him a text asking him if he santed to hang out tomorrow for his birthday even though I know he wont see it for two more days just because I'm not supposed to tell anyone I know he's in the hospital and I thought it'd help him when he gets out.

I really don't know how to handle this. How would you want your friends to react to all this?
