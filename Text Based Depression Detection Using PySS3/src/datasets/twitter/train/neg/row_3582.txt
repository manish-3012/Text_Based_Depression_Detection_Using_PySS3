I feel bad about being suicidal because itâ€™s selfish but I canâ€™t help it.Whenever I think about killing my self I picture starving children, or families in poverty. I have everything. Iâ€™m such a selfish piece of shit. I donâ€™t even have a reason to be depressed. Yea my parents are fucking assholes and I never leave my house so Iâ€™m really lonely, but that isnâ€™t a good reason to be depressed. Other people on this sub write stories that will bring me to tears because I just feel so bad for them and I truly hope it gets better for them but I just have no reason to feel this way and itâ€™s a huge inconvenience. I fucking hate feeling depressed because then I feel selfish then I get angry and then I cut myself as a punishment.
