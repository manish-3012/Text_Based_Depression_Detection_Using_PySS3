Advice?I honestly never thought I'd post to something like this, but I guess I'm getting desperate. I live life how I'm supposed to, I work, I'm completing a masters degree, I try to be a good friend and relative. But, I'm just so unhappy. Or, not even unhappy just emotionless. Not numb though. I just don't really feel anymore. I've been on sertraline (now 150mg) for more than half a year and it helped at first but death consumes my mind every day. I know I can't kill myself because of the pain I'd inflict on those around me but I sure as well don't want to live. I don't even know what I'm expecting from writing this...
