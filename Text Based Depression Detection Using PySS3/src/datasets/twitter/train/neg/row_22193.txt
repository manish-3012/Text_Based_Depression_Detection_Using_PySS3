Yup, I finally lost.17 year old male deciding to spill his heart to strangers on the internet because he has nobody. Cool, huh? I've been depressed for such a long time, I've battled myself for such a long time. I'm 17 years old and I'm goddamn terrified of myself. I'm too young to be feeling like this. I've smiled so much to people nobody truly knows what I'm hiding. I've been around suicide, lost people I've known to suicide. So happy one day, and then gone the next. I want to pull a Cobain, but deep down I can't because I secretly hope to find a way where there is a chance I live. I want out, but in the cleanest way possible. I'm done tonight, so unbelievably hurt and alone. Thank god my dad is a boater. It's a shame my last words are on some internet site.
