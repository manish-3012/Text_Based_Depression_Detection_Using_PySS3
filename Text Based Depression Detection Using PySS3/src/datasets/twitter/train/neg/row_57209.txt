I think Iâ€™m readyIn the past month (hard to believe itâ€™s only been a month) Iâ€™ve gone from having two jobs and just living life the best I could with my multiple mental disorders) to homeless and crashing on my baby mamas couch, to moved back to the hellhole I left purely because my family still owns the house even though no one lived there. I have my daughter with me, so itâ€™s not like I would just do it, I would send her to my dads first. But like. I still havenâ€™t found a new job, I have no more savings, the girl Iâ€™m in love with told me she doesnâ€™t actually feel any emotions towards me like that, and I just canâ€™t get a break. I canâ€™t afford my medicine, because I have no insurance. 

It would be difficult to actually do it in my own house. The only thing I can really do is drink a shit ton of cleaning agents. Luckily, the state I live in has a ton of places that are relatively high up, and itâ€™s remote enough that no one would ever find me.
