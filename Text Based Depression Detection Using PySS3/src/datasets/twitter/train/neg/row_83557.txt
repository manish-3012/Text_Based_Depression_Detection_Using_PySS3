Being a burden.I was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2009 and it has ruined my life. I could never have my dream career in the military. I had to drop out of school in 2015 because my seizures are stressed induced and I had one the week of finals that killed me. I lost a month of memories, which included studying for said finals and seeing my family. 
I was in the hotel industry for ten years until recently I became an embarrassment to my company (my Hr manager said that) after I had a seizure while Hilton was on my property. Since then I have been blackballed in the city I live in. I can only do curtain jobs due to safety reasons so a lot of jobs I want I canâ€™t do. 
I lost my license because of them. 
I have weird emotional changes that can happen in a second and my family doesnâ€™t want to deal with it anymore. My moms birthday is tomorrow and they had a little family get together today that I wasnâ€™t invited to. I just happened to find out about. 
I havenâ€™t slept well in years and have ptsd from dying in my sleep and I am afraid to fall asleep. 
The last few months my mental health has gone down hill very quickly. A side of me says Iâ€™m fine and the other says swallow a bunch of sleeping pills and end the burden you place on your family and friends.  
Im just so lost and the fight in my head Iâ€™m slowly loosing!
