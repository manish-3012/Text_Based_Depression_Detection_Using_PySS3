i want a changei just want to move. to get away from everything thatâ€™s happening. i want a new beginning. i want to be in a place where iâ€™m not known as the person who never talks. 

i want to be able to stare out into my backyard and think about the squirrels and the trees. to feed feral cats and walk around the neighborhood and say hi to people. i want to stare at a sunset and fall asleep and not cry.

every year gets harder and harder. 

i donâ€™t know how much more i can handle.
