im sick of myselfim so sick of living with the stupid amoujnt of thoughts i have everyday, i dont understand where they come from and they don't stop, they're endless. what does it mean, why am i such a dfective, ugly human being? i've had enough, i know it, i know God allowed for this too happen and im fucking done, if i wasnt so fucked in the head id be more sane and have better relationships with everyone ive ever met. im being driven up the wall by my own self, i dont have any apparent reason to die as im blessed with alot of shit but what if its just me? beign me in my own shell? its so hard to talk, should i even reach out or talk when i feel this way? i dont know. i dpnt fucking know anymore, i just need to find a bridge and end the disease i am to everyone and mylsef.
