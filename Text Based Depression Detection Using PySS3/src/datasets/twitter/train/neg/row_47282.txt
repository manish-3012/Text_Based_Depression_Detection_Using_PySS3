I am in a lot of painHello.

Iâ€™m almost 23. Seems like a good age to have fun and already have some achievements such as having some sort of degrees but I donâ€™t. Iâ€™m an A student and working towards nursing school but I donâ€™t see that day coming anymore.

My mental health has gone downhill quickly over the past few months. I had seek help maybe 2 years ago and I was on antidepressants and anxiety drugs for a few weeks but it cost so much more than what I can afford right now (broke college student) so I stopped. I went to counseling center at school, lady there seemed nice but I really donâ€™t think I was taken seriously from her smirking.

I have been thinking about some painful ways that I can end my life with everyday. 

I have been having nightmare every night to the point that I hate sleeping. I also donâ€™t like being awake because the thoughts just wont stop. I also think Iâ€™m gonna go crazy soon.

I might be too sensitive to emotions and I blame myself so much every time somebody gets upset over something Iâ€™ve said to them whether I was being reasonable or not. 

I only get along with 2 people and they are my best friend and boyfriend. I love these people dearly and I donâ€™t want my death changing their life so that is the only reason why I havenâ€™t done it. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m living in misery everyday and it doesnâ€™t seem like it is ever going to end. I really want help but I canâ€™t afford it and that honestly fucking suck ass. I guess if anybody has any suggestion for that, I would very gladly appreciate it. I live in the US, not a citizen.
