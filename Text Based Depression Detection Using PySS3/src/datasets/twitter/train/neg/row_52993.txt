Would distancing and neglecting close ones for a while before ending it ease the pain for them?I've had suicidal tendencies for a few months now. First occurring while I was going out with my girlfriend, and deepening ever since. Since then, I've been dumped for being "too good" and felt alone inside ever since. After a chain of events, I realised that killing myself would be the best course of action; which I would have done earlier, but I kept thinking what kind of effect it would have on the people close to me. My ex-girlfriend told me about how horrible she felt when a friend of hers killed himself, and I honestly dont want to inflict that pain onto anyone else. I confessed to my ex how I want to do things I do, and she blamed it on herself for putting me in that position, her having attempted before, it was a very sensitive time. Since then, I have stopped using social media the way I used to, giving close ones blunt replies and delayed responses to anger them and stray them away from me. While rejecting all invite to go out as it will only deepen my connection with people. My ex, who cares greatly for me still, I have been neglecting via text and call etc. Making her think Ive become a dick so she feels less when I do end it. My dad I havent talked to in about 4 years and my mother I rarely even converse with. Maybe when I kill myself, hopefully, no one will feel anything.
