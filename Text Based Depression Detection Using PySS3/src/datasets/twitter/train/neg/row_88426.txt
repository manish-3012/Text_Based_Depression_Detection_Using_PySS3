I know I need help but im too scared to reach outHello 
I have recently had a major life change event(not a good one obviously) and it has sent me into heavy depression with suicidal ideation. The life I had prior to this event was good and felt like I was making progress as my darker struggles and issues were barely ever arising. I have now lost the life I was building and was comfortable with because I have lost someone I loved deeply and I attribute my ability to challenge and overcome my struggles because of them and how they were helping me. Now  even after a week I feel so alone and the thoughts and struggles are louder than ever before and I no longer know how to cope. I try to occupy myself and distract but there are times every day I am left alone with my thoughts and they have been going to dark edges that I can't seem to quiet.
Deep down I know something is wrong and I know I need help but I am so scared to reach out to family as they have judged a member that committed suicide in the past in a very negative light. I am scared to reach out to friends for fear of how they will react and judge me and what they may do. I can't be alone anymore but I don't know what to do.
