I ruined everythingIm so selfish. I ignored the one friend i had and i did it like it was nothing, im so dumb i didnt even realize how lonely she was. So she forced herself to be someone else to fit in. I broke her. and i cant change it, now i feel like i should just vanish from her life so maybe she can be happy, and doesnt have to fake being my friend anymore. I just want to go back and fix it. i want my friend back. without her i feel like im nothing, she was the only person who was there for me. and my birthday is coming up and i dont want to have to ask her to go somewhere with me, it will be awkward and i will have to act happy and i cant handle it, im tired and i just want to fix things but i dont know how and im tired of trying im tired of this pain i just want someone to care for me but no one does no one does anymore because i hurt everyone around me. I lie and i act like im the victim and i dont know why. what is wrong with me, i convince myself i deserve happiness but i dont. Im just one of the millions of people in this world who will never do anything meaningful or anything to improve this planet or the people living in it, all i am is a burden getting in the way of people who might make difference in this world. What would even happen if im gone, a few people will shed a few tears, and people at school will pretend they were my friend and that they loved me when no one did, and no one even knew who i was. i mean who am i really hurting if i leave this world.
