Iâ€™ve been doing research on what medication kills you the fastest and least painfully for the past two hours.The kicker is that I donâ€™t really want to die.

Iâ€™ve struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts on and off since I was in middle school, but the past few days have been really hard because of family issues.

I left on Thanksgiving due to a really big fight with my family (they (mostly my sibling) treats me like shit and I finally had it) and now theyâ€™re both NC with me. Leaving was probably an over-the-top reaction, but I literally could not be in the house anymore. My s/o happened to be leaving that night, so I left with him. I feel really guilty about it, too.

And the fact that my s/o loves me so much and my love for him keeps me from committing suicide, honestly. I canâ€™t do that to him. But thereâ€™s still that awful little voice in the back of my head thatâ€™s just like â€œwell if you look up what med will do the trick youâ€™ll have that knowledge for laterâ€

Itâ€™s just like, fuck off. fuck off. My family might hate me, but I have him.

I still just feel awful and horrible for having these thoughts and impulses to begin with, and its like these thoughts are a fallback, like a â€œwelcome back assholeâ€ because i donâ€™t know how to function like a normal human being i just want to go to BED
