Having nothing and no oneHaving 4 children I can't take care of, no financial stability whatsoever, a mother who hates me and a father and brother who don't exist.  Having relationships that are of no sustenance.  Having lost the will to fight and live.  Having no sense of who I am.  

I am nothing.  I give up.
