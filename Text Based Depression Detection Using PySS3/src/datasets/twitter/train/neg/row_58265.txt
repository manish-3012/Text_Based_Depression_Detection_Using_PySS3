I hope I die in my sleep tonight.These past couple of months have been the worst for me. Bad things I've done in the past come to my mind. My Mom and I have been arguing a lot about my college applications and her boyfriend. Luckily he didn't move into our house yet. I'm tired of seeing everyone else, including my friends having a boyfriend. 

I think I'm pretty, but not worthy enough to have someone love me. I wish my life could end while I'm sleeping. I will never find someone who loves me. I wish I could stop thinking about all of the bad things I've done. I want to restart my life. I screwed up a lot and I'm not even in the real world yet.
