Not feeling like living anymoreI don't feel like living anymore .Never worked in my life,no degree, 28 year old living with my parents and there money .No respect from anyone even from my family.No friends cuz i don't trust people .Only thing i do is go to gym most days and workout which keep my depression on bay and a recent death of a close young family member makes me think about death everyday.I think it's better to be dead than living this miserable life .
