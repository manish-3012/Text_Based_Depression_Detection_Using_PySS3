I need to do itIm scared...but I have to do it,I can't continue anymore.And I think today is the day.

Everyday is more worse then the last one.
I'm lonely,and is all my fault,I pushed everyone away cuz i felt that deep down I really don't care about anyone not even myself.
I don't really care about anything...i don't want anything,I dont want to achieve anything.
I would like to be normal but I don't even know what that means.
