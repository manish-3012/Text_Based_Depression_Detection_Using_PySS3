I wish something would kill me so people wouldn't have to remember me as the one who killed themselvesDon't worry, I won't actually kill myself apparently or I'd have done it already. I just want to share this ridiculous frustration with how I WOULD be perceived after death, isn't that silly? If I'm dead why would it matter to me... but you KNOW there's a difference in how people view the... resulting dead from the tragic accident of being hit by a car crossing the street vs the horror of being murdered vs the struggle of a terminal illness vs the... shame? of killing yourself like damn dont you wish you could control that one thing
