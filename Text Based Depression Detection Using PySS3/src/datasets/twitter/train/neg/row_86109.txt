It does get better even after it seems like it has no possibility to.I just want to throw some encouraging words to everyone posting

Sometimes life will get to be the worst itâ€™s ever been for you but donâ€™t give up because after it gets to itâ€™s lowest it will take a sharp curve and get better

Biggest things to remember 

-Some things (people time animals careers etc) in our lives are not meant to be there or are only there for a short lesson in life and if they leave let them they werenâ€™t meant to be there.

-Pushing forward and going through the hard patches are worth making it through

-If itâ€™s hard to see whatâ€™s good in life try and see the little things like how pretty the sky can be or the trees let that be your start

-Never give up on yourself love you for who you are and do it for you. You might be alone but itâ€™s because life wants to find the best people possible for you so donâ€™t settle for just anyone

-Everything that makes you feel like your not worth it let it leave. Because you are worth it and more.

I hope this posts and i hope it helps anyone in need.
Iâ€™m sending love to everyone

~~~Sincerely also someone trying to make it through the rough times. &lt;3
