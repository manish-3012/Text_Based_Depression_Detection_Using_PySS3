I need to kill myselfI'm done here, no one values me. All I am is a huge colossal failure, the constant rejection and abandonment from friends in real life, pressures from home and lack of acceptance from most has driven me to the conclusion that the world would be better off without me. I don't even know why I am posting this but I'm tired of being hurt and it seems like the only way I can end the pain.
