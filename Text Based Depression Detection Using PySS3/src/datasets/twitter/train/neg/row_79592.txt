Why do you guys hang around here?I mean, I imagine reading about how people want to kill themselves and all of their circumstances as pretty stressing, the odds of saving someone prepared to kill themselves over the internet as rather slim, and in the end, it's not like a single reply from a stranger can magically lift all the reasons that person had for contemplating suicide, and preventing someone from attempting once doesn't equate to preventing all future attempts.

I don't really mean to attack anyone or anything, just that this seems kinda futile.
