I'm being stupidI came home from work and immediately went about disposing of my old broken dresser. My room makes me feel so claustrophobic and panicked I wanted to just get rid of it and put in a newish one that's been in our house for a while.

There were a few items in it that I really wanted my mom to look at so I could just be done with it. She kept saying no and for some reason I kept persisting and persisting to the point where she blew up at me, understandably.i don't know why this of all things is making me want to pelt myself off a bridge or gouge my fucking arm. I'm just being a selfish prick and I'm so fucking angry at myself.  I don't know why I can't just leave shit be.

I'm now sitting in a grass field by my house in the middle of the night and my dad is texting to ask if I want company but I don't know how to tell him I just want to be alone and that I don't deserve to be listened to.
