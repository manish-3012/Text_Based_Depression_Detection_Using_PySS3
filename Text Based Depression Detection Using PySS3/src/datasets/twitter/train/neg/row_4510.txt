Am i a dick if i kill myself after a break up? (not asking for help with suicide issues but moral ones instead)I just recently had a messy break up with my girlfriend and a lot of other stuff has recently been going wrong in my life right now. I've wanted to commit suicide for years now and I feel this is just the final thing you know. I guess the main thing that is holding me back right now is that I don't want her to feel any guilt even though she isn't accountable in any way. I know this is a really difficult topic to determine but I just want to know if you'd all consider me an asshole for it.

I'm looking for people to answer my question rather than try to convince me out of doing it. Thanks in advance.
