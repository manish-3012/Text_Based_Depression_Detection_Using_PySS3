What difference does it really make in the long scheme of things?I simply don't wanna live anymore. I didn't ask to be brought to this world and I sure as hell ain't waiting to be taken out of this world. The more I think about it the more you motherfuckers seem selfish. 

You don't even fucking know who I am. If you say you give a shit, you're only saying this because you're suppose to.
