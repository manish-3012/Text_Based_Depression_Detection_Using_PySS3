I want to die but I'm afraid of what my family will think.I feel that I have nothing left to live for, my family knows there is something really wrong but the way they have been treating me is making me feel even worse. They want me to get better but I feel like I can't and I'm afraid if I kill myself, they will go their whole lives blaming themselves... What do I do?
