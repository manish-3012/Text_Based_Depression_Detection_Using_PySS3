I thought I was okay lately, but this night, I just feel like ending it all.Nah, I'm not really do it. But if I could just die I really wouldn't mind. Like, I wouldn't kill myself, But If a plane wanted to crash down right here, I would be happy

I thought I had beaten my social anxiety, but man, it's the women. It's the fucking women. I'm still extremely awkward around women. I swear, women and socially apt guys just would never understand. But women can drive a man crazy. I just wanna kill myself and don't have to deal with having to approach women any time in my life

Fuck everything

Fuck all

Fuck all of you

Ughhh

I don't know, I'm drunk, but this is how I really feel right now

I just wanna have a girl, and love her, and she loving me, and cuddle together

Is that really hard to ask?

 The girls I have been in love with, just ended up beign completely horrible human beigns to me. And I hate them for that, even though I logically know that they are not bad people really. But I hate them for how they damaged my heart

I have never had a girl that I feel they really liked me. I feel like I'm privileged that I even had sex. I was probably horrible at it, since even THOSE women hated me

Man, I just hate myself. That's probably why women don't like me

But fuck it

I hate myself

I hate the world

I hate teverthyng
 
Fuck all of you

I don't even care about anything

I hope I feel happy when I'm sober. And sorry if I've disturbed you

But really, I just feel like this right now. Don't take it too literally. But it's my stream of conscsiouness thoughts

FUck all of you

And fuck my "friend"
