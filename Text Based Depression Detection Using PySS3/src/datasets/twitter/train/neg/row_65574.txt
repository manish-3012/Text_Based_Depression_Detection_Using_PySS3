GoodbyeIâ€™m gonna take my own life tonight. I shouldâ€™ve a long time ago and I tried before. How does one survive a multi flip 95mph crash with only a broken hand. I wanted to die I shoulda died. Life is bullshit Iâ€™d just be alone forever anyway. Iâ€™m ugly as fuck and insecure as fuck and will always be depressed as fuck. One day I hope my family will understand I donâ€™t want forgiveness as I feel Iâ€™m doing both wrong I just want them to understand. Bye reddit thanks for making my life a little less tragic I guess. Itâ€™s a pleasure to know I donâ€™t have to wake up tomorrow
