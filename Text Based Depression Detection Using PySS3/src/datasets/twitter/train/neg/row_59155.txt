I wish I could just enjoy life.I finally found an online train tracker that monitors train routes, so I went to the bridge near mine where I attempted suicide a few months ago to check if it's accurate and it is. I don't really know where this leaves me. I don't have an active desire to die anymore, more just a strong feeling of not really wanting to go through this day-to-day drudgery of feeling useless and unable to properly change, but I know that killing myself would destroy my Mum and make her last couple of decades or whatever here miserable. I just feel stuck despite having had 3 different jobs this year, and I'll probably lose my current one because I can't properly motivate myself to see through a day at the office. I really can't see any future for myself but I know I just have to keep going despite wanting to do anything but that. I hate this. I wish I could be happy and just go into work and lead a normal life but I don't feel like I can.
