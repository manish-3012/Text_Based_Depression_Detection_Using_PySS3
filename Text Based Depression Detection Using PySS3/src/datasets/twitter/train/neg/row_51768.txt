Almost the 4th year of depressionIt seems to never end and always getting worse, a lot of things happened these years i got some happy moments but its like a roller coaster where you go up and down but the fall is always harder

Im still researching the best way to do it and i have some good ideas but its hard to decide. I'd like to finish this summer i still have a couple of weeks without school.
