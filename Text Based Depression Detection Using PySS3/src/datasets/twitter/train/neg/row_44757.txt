Need helpHi so I am in the middle of a depression and I started getting on medication for it today and I usually have a therapist but Iâ€™m in a crisis now and all the suicide hotline I called didnâ€™t answer in my country I think I might hold on a little longer and a friend helped me by talking a lot to me

i did something neglectful tthat is going to lead to both my catâ€™s death and I just realised it and I can.t deal with the guilt, sorry if it sounds dumb
So I kept my parent.s cat for the holiday and he was exposed to a kitten with FIP 2 years ago , he wasnt sick but I exposed him tk ly cats who are quite weak and now they both show symptoms  of FIP
I love my cats as if they were my children
Also. i.m failing at work since a few weeks (thatâ€™s why I got back to medication) 
The guilt I feel now is unbearable, Because of my neglect my cats are going to die and Iseriously wish the vet could kill me as well
Sorry if that siunds weirdk I don t know what to eo I wish i could just stop existing , please dont Orry to much I won t act and I m nit totally alone i just need help with guilt this is all my fault
