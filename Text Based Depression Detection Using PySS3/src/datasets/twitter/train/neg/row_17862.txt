I think my best friend killed himself.My (F16) best friend (M17) has been depressed since we met in the 4th grade and has recently been diagnosed with DID. Heâ€™s going to therapy and taking meds for his disorders. While heâ€™s been depressed, itâ€™s been manageable and hasnâ€™t caused me to worry too much. But lately heâ€™s been scaring me to the point Iâ€™ve been having panic attacks.

His depression has gotten worse and about 2 weeks ago he told me he was going to kill himself but didnâ€™t because I was practically begging him not to. He didnâ€™t bring up anything suicide or self harm related until yesterday. Actually yesterday was a pretty good day. He asked me on a date for saturday and I could tell he was happy. But report cards came home and he didnâ€™t do to well. His parents yelled at him and took his phone so we couldnâ€™t talk for the rest of the night. This morning at school he told me he felt like heâ€™s been letting everyone down lately and that he almost committed last night. He punched himself and got a black eye and almost cut himself (which he hasnâ€™t done in years. You canâ€™t even see the scars anymore).

At 12:47 pm he cancelled our date plans which I hope was related to him feeling sad and not him planning on committing. Then at 6:47 pm he texted me saying he wasnâ€™t dead. We usually text throughout the day so I was relieved after hearing from him again. I responded like 10 minutes later but I havenâ€™t gotten a text back. Itâ€™a been almost 3 hours. Heâ€™s a really fast texter so this is out of character for him.

I cant get the thought out of my mind that he might be dead right now. I literally do not know what I will do without him in my life. For the past 6 years, heâ€™s been my rock. Heâ€™s my favorite person and I love him so much. I wouldnâ€™t know how to function without him. Can someone please convince me that he isnâ€™t or hasnâ€™t killed himself?
