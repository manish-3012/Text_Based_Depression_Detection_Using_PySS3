I'm only 14 I'm supposed to be too younge for this right..?!I just cant take it anymore... I call the suicide prevention hotline they put me on hold.... I try to ask my parents for help they pin it back to me like it's my fault I'm like this. My dog was the only thing keeping me from killing myself.... now that she's gone I've  been trying to stay away from knives or guns but I can't I want to do it so badly but then I'm.... scared to die...
