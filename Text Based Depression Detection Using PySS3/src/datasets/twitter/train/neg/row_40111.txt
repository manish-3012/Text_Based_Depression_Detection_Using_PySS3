The only reason I don't kill myself is my animals. Though I want to show everyone I have the guts to do it.I don't want to cause any other deaths from my suicide. And my animals, birds, fish mammals and reptiles would starve without my care. I love them and they're the only thing I have to live for. But I still don't want to live. I'm an annoyance to everyone around me. Every day I bother everyone around me and I just don't understand why. I try to imitate the people that make them happy but they still have a strong hatred for me. Even my friends are infuriated by me for a reason I don't understand. I want to show everyone at my school I can do it. That I have the guts to kill myself in front of them. I don't have anyone that really cares about me except my animals. I just want all of the people around me to go away. So I can just isolate forever. But the second best method for never being bothered by people is suicide. I just want to shoot myself in my school bathroom. Not at home. I can't explain why but I don't want to do it at home. I was hospitalized for three weeks and thought I had a new lease on life. But I resumed school and I immediately felt empty and hopeless. Like nothing goes anywhere.
