Ex gf ruined me what do I do?I resigned from 3 semesters of classes(wasted 1.5yrs and $20,000) because I didn't have the guts to leave a toxic relationship.  My college transcript looks horrible with 15 classes resigned. It's all because she threatens to fuck other guys if I don't talk to her for 8-12 hours a day and buy her gifts. This drove me insane to the point I wanted to drop out entirely. She was my first gf ever back when I was 20 years old. I am extremely depressed at all the TIME and MONEY she costed me. Along with a fucked up looking transcript now. I feel like killing myself everyday. Will people even hire me if they look at my transcript? I feel like I don't even have a future anymore. I just wanna end it all.
