"I'm sorry. I wish I could help you."My therapist told that to me today.  


I saw it coming, she had started to become just as hopeless about me as I myself am. Not meds, not going fucking thrice a week, nothing works. I've tried every professional help I had access to over many years, but nothing works.  


My therapist never said that suicide is a solution, and honestly I feel like I dragged her down with me. I fucking hate this life, and she's right; she cant help me. No one and nothing can.  


Death is my only way out of the misery.
