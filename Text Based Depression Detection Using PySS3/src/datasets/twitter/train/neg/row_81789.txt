Feeling like I'm somehow faking my depression and suicidal ideationI've had a numb sort of depression for years, but it's gotten a lot worse recently. I've had some serious suicidal thoughts recently, though most of the time I'm not actively suicidal, just wishing death would come to me in one form or another.

Anyways; on my "better days", where my depression isn't as crippling and I just feel numb rather than pained, a common thought is: "what if I'm not actually just depressed, just imagining or faking it? What if I'm just seeking attention?" I mean, it should be easy to just "not be depressed", but I can't seem to get out of it. Even then, I still wonder if I'm just depressed because I know the symptoms logically and I'm just making myself think I feel that way. Honestly, this confusion's just making the desire for it all to end stronger, but the moment I think that this doubt starts surfacing again; what if I'm just making myself think I want to die?

Maybe even the feeling I perceive as numbness is just "normal", and I'm making a mountain out of a molehill. I just don't know.

It's paradoxical, really, and I can't seem to make any sense of it.
