itâ€™s all going to endmy mortality is crushing me. itâ€™s like this existential anguish that is constantly building and crippling me. as soon as i have any emotional awareness all i feel is the panic of the knowledge that iâ€™m going to die. it doesnâ€™t matter what good things happen because i wonâ€™t get to keep any of them. i wonâ€™t remember any of them. my whole life and everything will cease to exist the second i die, so why should i go on living? there is no solution to this problem, only ignorance of it â€” when i die at least i will no longer worry about death. i want so badly to be offered some solution but i know that there isnâ€™t one. i wish there was an afterlife or some promise of something after death but i know that there isnâ€™t one. thereâ€™s nothing anyone can do and i donâ€™t understand how other people can function with this knowledge. i canâ€™t just put it off or not think about it because i know that when it happens, it will be in the present. at least if itâ€™s suicide i will be in control until those final moments. i hate reality.
