Getting more desperate day by day.....Why won't any of my family and friends do more to help?   I am sober and sane relatively speaking not that depressed and try not to be a burden when I stay with people.  I have 6 figure earning potential.  Everyone swears there is no covert government or other harassment keeping them from helping me.   I won't stay in a shelter ever again.  Bad things happen in shelters.  Anyway I have a Computer Science Degree and I am homeless.  I left a major Bank in IT 9 months ago and can't get a job in my profession.  I am taking things hour by hour because I have almost no resources.
