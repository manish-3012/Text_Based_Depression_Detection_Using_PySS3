How do I make sure my ex doesn't think it's his fault?Two attempts and then we got together, I couldn't self harm anymore because he would see my body. He left me at a time when I was only just coping with almost no explanation. I'm not coping at all anymore, I've cut myself and it's not enough. I want out.
