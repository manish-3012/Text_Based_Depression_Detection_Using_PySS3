Hello, I'm new hereI just wanted to say that, being a formal suicidal who still struggles through things, I want to be a part of this community. I see not everyone gets the help and advice they deserve and I want to change this. I just made this account separate from my regular reddit account so my replies don't get lost. Thanks for having me!
