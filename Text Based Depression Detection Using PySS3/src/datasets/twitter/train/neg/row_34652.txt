Not planning, but praying.I'm not the kind of person that can call someone and tell them what's wrong. Talking makes me nervous and uncomfortable. I can text and email people, but I find it hard to really say what I'm feeling - I go off on tangents and then miss the point completely.

I feel pathetic for feeling so down all the time. Even more so because it's about school and home when neither are that bad. Everyone else seems to be able to cope and I just feel like I'm faulty. I find myself crying if I can't do my work, then I make it worse by wanting to give up and not trying. When I get work back and I've not done well (which in my books is always) I feel even worse about myself.

I self harm and recently it's not been enough - I keep thinking about how nice it'd be to not wake up. Or just to know that soon I wouldn't wake up. I don''t have the guts to kill myself, I could never be so selfish, but sometimes I just really wish I was dying. Cancer, or something. Anything. That probably sounds really heartless or mean, or something else it's not meant to :\ 

It's worse when another reason I feel shit is because I'm so utterly terrified of growing up - and there's only one way to stop that from happening...
