She was the love of my lifeI was so in love with her, and now I've lost her forever.

We were together for almost a year, and we started to talk about the future together.  Like an idiot, and asked her for her "number".  I don't know why, but I had to know how many guys she'd been with in her life before me.  She told me that I didn't really want to know.  I pressed for an answer.  She said she was "experienced" when she met me.  I asked her what that meant, exactly.  She said "at least 50".  But she doesn't know the real number of guys she'd been with before me.  She just stopped counting at around 50.

At an average of 6 inches each, the love of my life has had 25 feet of cock inside her.  That's like... a tree-sized dick.  I couldn't live with that knowledge.  I said some things to her that I regret, and now it's over.

I want to die.
