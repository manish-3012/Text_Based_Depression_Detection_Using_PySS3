My swan song.I'm not looking for help and I'm not looking to vent.

I'm done.

20 years ago my elder brother commuted suicide, jumped in front of a train. I envy him a lot.

Because of my brother through my teenage years I was resigned to the fact that I couldn't take my life because I didn't want my parents to feel the pain of losing their second oldest child however it's gotten to the point where I have no empathy and couldn't care less how they feel after.

I despise that I'm forced to live an existence I didn't ask for nor want to continue living.

I've made peace with myself and in less than an hour my dad will fall asleep and I will overdose on paracetamol. I've done my research its a long and painful death that takes approximately 3 days to destroy your liver and relief can finally be achieved.

I've written all my notes to my family and my best friend so as the title suggests this post will be my swan song.
I hope you all find help or are able to pull through and for those of you who are certain you're about to do what you're about to do good luck but reconsider unless you know without a doubt it's what you want remember once its done there's no going back.

Thanks for listening.
