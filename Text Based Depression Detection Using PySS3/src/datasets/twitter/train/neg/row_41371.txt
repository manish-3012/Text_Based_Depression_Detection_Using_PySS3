I'm an attractive guy, and i feel lonelyi get told a lot by people that I'm attractive, could get a girlfriend easily and that I "know my way around people" so... why do i feel lonely? well, i suffer from boderline personality disorder, and I am schizophrenic, very paranoid all the time, anxious and in a constant state of panic when off meds, i burned down an abandoned barn in my hometown while in a manic state, i am notorious for being the schizo violent weirdo since freshman in highschool, i am 19 years old, never had sex, never had a girlfriend, I don't have any friends. bet it feels nice to not being absolutely fucked in the head. i constantly think about suicide, this life simply doesn't look worth living to me anymore, being this out of the curve when it comes to mental illnesses has been really damaging to me for a very long time. i don't know if I can take this for much longer.
