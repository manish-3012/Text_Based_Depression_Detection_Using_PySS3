I been having thoughts. Dark thoughts.I am planning my way out. The pressure, hope, peopleâ€™s eyes focused on me, i canâ€™t take it.  I am Indian, living in U.K, I was brought here by my parents for a better life but I canâ€™t have one. To have friends, I need to drink with them, party with them but I am not allowed too. Itâ€™s lonely, when you â€œfriendsâ€ hang out and you....canâ€™t. I canâ€™t disobey my parents, because I know what they say is for my own good, I love them and I canâ€™t disappoint them. If itâ€™s hard for me, itâ€™s hard for them too, they donâ€™t have a friends, they live their lives in a loop. I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t ever disappoint them. I canâ€™t understand the English language very well but I do my best, I am starting my university course. When people see my they think and say you are smart, you donâ€™t have to try as hard as us. Theyâ€™re wrong I try my hardest, when they get stuck they ask their parents to help them, when I get stuck, I canâ€™t ask them because donâ€™t English so I try harder for them and for myself. 
I...I..am starting my course, itâ€™s going to be hard, I might even fail, this will disappoint my parents, I canâ€™t take that. I canâ€™t take the fact, I have to pay 13k just because I have leave to remain, not irl. 

Thatâ€™s my story. Thatâ€™s my ending. Rather have my parents spend their saving on me, I should kill my self. 
Anyways, even with all that saving they only support me for a year. So I canâ€™t finish my course which is 4 years. 
So this is my end. Thank you....
