Every SINGLE day is a struggle to not kill myself. I'm so tired of fighting.I'm just so tired of trying to find happiness in my life. I've been utterly miserable for such a long time. For the past few months I've come genuinely close to killing myself at least twice a week. 

I grew up in a horrific abusive home that left me badly scarred mentally. The one good thing I had was a girlfriend who stood by me for a few years. We moved in together a few months ago and within the first couple of weeks she broke up with me and ran off with someone else. I can't afford to move out and have nowhere but an abusive home to return to. I supported her for years both financially and emotionally so she could earn a degree and make a good living. She treats me like shit while I have nothing. I can't help but love her because she's the only one who's ever shown me what it's like to be loved. I'm just so confused and dazed. She loved me for so long while I was surviving abuse, telling me how awful my family were and how we'd have a great life when I moved out of there and now she's just as bad as my parents, except for the physical abuse. Just emotional abuse every day. I'm just so tired of crying and feeling numb. Fuck life. 

It should not be this hard to have a little bit of happiness for fucks sake. I'm so socially awkward and anxious at this stage I can't even begin to make other friends or girlfriends. I'm just fucked. Dosed up to the eyeballs on meds to keep me from offing myself. It's a joke.
