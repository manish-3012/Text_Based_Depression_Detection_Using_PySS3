Been digging myself too deep - now there is no way out.After my world crumbled seven months ago where I lost everything I have managed to only make my life infinitely worse by letting the most toxic person imaginable back into my life. 

Maybe youâ€™ve heard the phrase â€œdonâ€™t drink poison just because you are thirsty.â€ Well, I did. Big time. And now I can never get out. Everyoneâ€™s turned their back against me and I have no one but him. Will forever be tied to his manipulation and gaslighting. I feel physically weak and I feel sicker every day. No way out but one. Wish there was a button to press. I feel too weak to even go out and end it. Hoping one day soon it will come over me and I will be able to finally free myself. Canâ€™t keep living in my skin.
