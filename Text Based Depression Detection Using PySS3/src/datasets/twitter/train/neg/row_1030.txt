Hi, my name is Ken.Hi, I'm ken. I'm 15. I'm a person. I don't know how to start this but....well, I can't go into detail but I want to kill myself. It's a long story why, and it spans over 4 years. But i've come to the conclusion that i'm worthless just like everyone said I am. Every thing I try fails and I go down with optimism but I can't hide it anymore. I've been dead for a long time and now all I'm doing is burying the body. Society didn't kill me, people didn't kill me, I killed me.

So, reddit, you've been providing me entertainment for a long time, so thanks. It be cool to say reddit saved my life but I'm unable to save my own. So, any advice? Help?
