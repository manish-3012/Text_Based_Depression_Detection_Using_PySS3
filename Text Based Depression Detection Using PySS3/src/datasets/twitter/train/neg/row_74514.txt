Schizophrenia has ruined my lifeI have schizophrenia and recently everything has taken a turn for the worst. I was planning on killing myself last Friday but for some reason I've been trying to work out I wasn't able to do it. I have all the tools I need and a plan (well, several plans), and am now just waiting for the courage. I can't go through another day with these voices like this, I can't continue pretending that I don't want to kill myself because I desperately want to die. I even know how to avoid my family finding my body, but still I'm trapped here and it's a fate worse than death. Please, someone, I just want to kill myself and not being able to go through with it is even worse than dying itself.
