I hate my pastSo last night I was with some of my friends and it was late (like 11pm to 1am) and we weren't feeling well and we were all sad for different reasons. I don't know what triggered me but I started dissociating alot and stuff. My friends asked what's wrong and all I could do was just nod. We had a therapy circle (basically we find a talking peice and we just talk about stuff bothering us) and I went first. I talked about being catfished and how I have flashbacks from it. I talked about how I think I have ptsd. My brother was with us and told me stuff about it that I don't remember. I was catfished for 7 months and not 3. I started crying and shit. I got a really bad flashback of my computer screen when I texted these fake people. Everything went black kind of and I could like literally see the texts and screen. 
I think I should get help. I feel like I'm faking it and that I don't have ptsd. I feel like I'm doing it to myself. At the times when it's really bad I don't feel that way.
I don't know what to do anymore.
