I want to die!Honestly, i just want to die, especially because believe i have no future. I just need to wait for the right moment. Is suicide always wrong? Even if it saves you from being homeless? Or just poor? I don't mean less money than the average poor. I mean really poor. I don't want to end up in poverty. But i know my future looks bleak. Anyone want to kill themselves because of poverty?
