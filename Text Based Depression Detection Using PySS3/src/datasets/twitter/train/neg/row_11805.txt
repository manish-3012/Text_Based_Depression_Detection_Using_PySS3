Can someone give me some advice? (Self harm)My girlfriend is sleeping next to me right now. I just found out she's still self harming when she said she had stopped for years. I don't know what to do. I was writing her a poem and she pretended to go to the bathtoom and then came back wearing long sleeves so I assumed she was just cold. She read my poem and started crying and I thought it was something I had done. After literally two hours of just sitting and staring at her she finally told me the truth. I tried so hard to help her. I cleaned her cuts with alcohol, washed the knife and just sat and talked with her. She says that it's about control. I tried telling her she's not in control that the addiction is but she just said that it was her actions. She's in therapy and on meds. It seems as though I'm the only one who has ever actually understood what she was going through. She said her aunt found a post where she had ranted on instagram and told her family she was doing it for attention and that her brother hands her razor blades. I told her I wasn't angry but that I wasn't going to be like them and just sit by and watch while she destroys herself. I think this is more of a rant just to get it off my chest. I'm not telling anyone atleast not right now because I don't think more hospital time and medication is the answer. I know I can't control her life I'm not trying to. I just want to find a way to help her that actually works. I'm afraid to go to sleep because she might not actually be asleep. I know she's smart and desperate. I'm gonna end this here. Just anyone who has any advice message or comment.
