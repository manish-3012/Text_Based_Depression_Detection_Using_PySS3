Can you help me?Iâ€™m M16 and basically Iâ€™m worried about my mental health and my closest friend is too,, theyâ€™ve basically begged me to get help but I made them swear not to contact parents,, school etc about it. I want to open a convo with my parents about getting checked out and seeing if Iâ€™m okay but I donâ€™t have the guts to do it. If youâ€™ve spoken to your parents before,, how did you do it?? How did you open the convo up?? Any help is appreciated so many thanks in advance
