I can't deal with thisFilling out the void until the big sleep.
I can't deal with it, I wanna the end.

No lover, the friends are turning their backs on me, just the stress at work. Im turning into a faceless blob and my anxiety worst than ever.
Just the few of the reasons.
 
I cant see the purpose of life.
