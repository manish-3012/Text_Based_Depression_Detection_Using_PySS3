Had to call the police for a well check for my mom tonight.I'm 33. My mother is 51. She's been through a few bad relationships. Her current significant other just told her he was leaving her this morning and she's been on a drinking spree since 11am. Well about an hour about she sent me a picture of her car dash running in her garage saying tell blabla I love him and I'm sleepy and hot and going to see my mom in heaven. I broke down into tears and immediately called the cops for a well check. Turns out she was sitting on the porch drinking a beer when they showed up. Now she's pissed and at the hospital texting me all kinds of shitty stuff about how I ruined her life and what not. I still feel like I did the right thing. Just had to get that off my chest. Don't even know if it belongs in this sub reddit.
