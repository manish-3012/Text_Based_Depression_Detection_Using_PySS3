Told Everyone I Want to Die; Still Want to DieIt just came spilling out of me one night when talking to my mom. Then I stumbled into telling an empathetic acquaintance when I asked her for advice on something over drinks. A few days later, during an anxiety attack, a friend messaged me and I impulsively told her that I've been suicidal for the past year and that I was having a mental breakdown. 

And now I'm telling you, internet stranger.

I'm not sure what I expected to get out of telling people. I guess I was looking for some reason to live to just hit me, but it hasn't. 

Now I just feel more trapped than ever. 

If I kill myself now, I'm going to cause any immense amount of pain and guilt. My death wouldn't have been painless for my parents anyway, which is why I've forced myself to live for so long, but now I would be a complete fucking asshole for killing myself after I told them. 

I think the problem is that I now feel obligated to improve, and I don't know how to do that. I've been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for a year now. Changed therapists 3 times now (insurance issues, long story).  The drugs don't work though. And as for the therapy - the simple fact is that you can't decide for someone that their life is worth living. 

I have been suicidal many times over my life, but they were at emotional crisis points when I hated myself. I don't necessarily hate myself now. I just haven't thought life was worth living for a year now and I still don't. Food is unappetizing. Nothing is funny anymore. I don't get joy from anything. 

All that remains is an obligation to others. That's all I have left.
