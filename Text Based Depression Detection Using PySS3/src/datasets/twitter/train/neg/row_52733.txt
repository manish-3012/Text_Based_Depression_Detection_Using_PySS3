nothing's changedi was here a few months ago at my low point. nothing's changed. i still want to die. the thoughts aren't there as often, but they're still the same thoughts. nothing's gotten better. things in my life have changed, seemingly for the better, but everything still hurts just as much as it always has. the feelings remain. in some regards i'm better than my low point, i'm probably not going to attempt again, not tonight at least. in others i'm worse. i've accepted my low point as routine. bc of the fires here in socal combined w/ winter break, i haven't had school in almost 6 weeks. i spent most of it sleeping. but i'm still tired. WHY AM I SO FUCKING TIRED. it's 11pm &amp; i'm lying awake in bed so f u c k i n g tired, and all i can think about are all of the fake people who will attend my funeral. and i'm so f u c k i n g tired but everytime i try to close my eyes everything in my head is so loud, not even intrusive thoughts, just screaming. ugh, i'm tired. i'll probably just cut &amp; watch some documentaries gn sw.
