I told my boyfriend I wanted to kill myself todayhe couldnâ€™t even muster it up enough to tell me to not do it but to just say to me â€œstop being a jackassâ€ like yes that really helps me when Iâ€™m up at 5am thinking about why I havenâ€™t done it yet and why I even bother to still be alive.. I mean really would it be such a huge loss if I killed myself? would it fucking even matter? Would he even be sad? Would he even cry? or would he just move on? Life isnâ€™t worth shit. I donâ€™t even have it in me to reach out to a crisis line. 

I guess the main reason I want to kill myself is.. well. I hate myself and I feel like everyone would be so much better off and good without me. who wants a girlfriend / daughter thatâ€™s autistic,over weight and just sad and negative all the time.. no one does. Absolutely no one.
