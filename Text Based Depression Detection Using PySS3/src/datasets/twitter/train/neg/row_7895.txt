Its always sounded like an optionSometimes its comforting knowing you have a way out. Knowing there is an end to the pain, the failure, that has become my life. The constant let downs, fuck ups and mistakes that will riddle my future with uncertainty. I don't know if I could ever do it to my friends and family, but knowing there's a way out helps me breath easier. Romanticizing it brings clarity, you can always leave when you decide it's too much to handle.
