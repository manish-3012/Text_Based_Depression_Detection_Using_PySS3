I think I might be ready to dieThatâ€™s it really.

I know I donâ€™t have any friends who are really bothered about me.

The girl I like wants to rid me out of her life and sheâ€™s even got close with someone else since me, she never thinks of me or cares.

I just feel empty, demotivated and worthless.

Iâ€™m too scared to do it but I really think I am ready to die, thereâ€™s nothing to live for.

I just need to get some pills, go to the shed at 3am or something and swallow them.

Thatâ€™s the only way to stop feeling like this.
