I don't know if I can do this for much longerI'm only 16 but I already feel like a tired, worn out old man. Everyday it feels like life beats me down just little more until it starts adding up and I just feel constantly tired and miserable. Life is so fucking complicated, too. There's so much shit I have to do yet I never have any motivation to do it. I always feel behind the other kids, like I never know what's going on and they have their lives all figured out. What jobs they want, what they want to major in, and I'm here just sleepwalking through each day never paying attention. Honestly, if this is how life is, I don't know that I want to experience decades more of it. That's all.
