Boy who cried wolf?(14f) Me and my mom got into a fight because I told her that I felt like my sister was favored (I told my dad that so he texted her), and that I wanted to die. She's sent me to the psych ward before and knows it made me worse. So she says "I'll send you away to the psych ward." She then said that I don't care about any one else in the family and that i'm selfish and difficult. I told her "If i'm that much of a burden I'll be gone." So after that she told me i'm the boy who cried wolf and that i'm saying it to manipulate her. Guess what? The boy who cried wolf is dead. And maybe soon if i'm lucky I will be too. I'll prove to my mom that i'm not lying. If I stayed alive it'd be worse. I'm sick of life and everything so...hey. Why not? I'm just born as a burden to everyone around me. I don't even see myself to grow up into the career I want. Don't say what you usually say. I've already heard it. "You have a future." "Don't kill yourself." "Stay strong." "I deal with the same things." I'm goddamn tired. If there was actually anything to live for I wouldn't feel this way. :)
