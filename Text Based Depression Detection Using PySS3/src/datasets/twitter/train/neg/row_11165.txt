This sucksI've really fallen in a deep hole. Living with parents. Started feeling suicidal for the first time last year. Felt really suicidal in the fall but met a girl in a support group and that helped. But now I feel like I'm just going to snap if I go do something without her, like college in a different state or something, or if we break up. She has a job and just started back at school, which makes it even worse.

I can't hold a job, I couldn't even finish the one class I took last semester, I have no hope for the future in any way.

Probably just gonna go lay down in the snow in the next couple days, as I think that'd be a peaceful death as I would numb out before I died. I may end up being stuck here on this earthly plane having to watch the unfathomable agony my parents will be in once I do it, but such is my fate, I guess.
