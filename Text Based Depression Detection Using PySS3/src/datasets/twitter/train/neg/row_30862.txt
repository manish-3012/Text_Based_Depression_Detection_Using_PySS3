I feel like sometimes it must just happen.I feel like no matter how many hotlines are set up, some people will just slip through all of it and eventually kill themselves, if not now then later. I might at least just be talking about myself, but that's still what I think.

Some people go on and on, either no one else notices the warning signs or if they do, they either don't say anything and those who did get pushed away, which is what I kept doing. Even though I've always felt like my whole family and everyone I've known knows I have nothing to offer, that I'm a huge dumb ass and just overall a huge joke. When couple of teachers did reach out I just declined. A couple of old friends tried to reach out and again I declined. I'm too embarrassed to contact any of them again because then we would have to talk about how we are and what we've been doing. They would say they are at university and have partners or whatever and the only honest answer I could give about myself is that I kept dropping out of school and I constantly think about killing myself. That's the only thing that goes through my head. I have no skills, I'm useless at finding jobs and my only hobbies seem to be hating myself and feeling sorry for myself.

The end.
