I need helpI've been suicidal since I was in my lower teens and it was spotting until now. I just out my fiancÃ©e of 6 years had sex with someone else and really liked the other guy. I know some would say this a dumb reason to do it but if you know how much she meant to me you'd get it.  I've alone in my apartment with our dog for 2 months so she could go out of state for an internship. And now I'm on vacation with my mom and step dad and her and I hate it. I don't see any reason to live anymore. I don't see a future for me and I haven't for awhile. Idk what to do...
