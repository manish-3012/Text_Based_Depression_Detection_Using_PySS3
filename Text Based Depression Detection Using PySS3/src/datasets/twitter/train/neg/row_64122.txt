Not completely suicidal, but I really feel sad.My life is literally fine without my mother.

I have a decent grade at school (taking accelerated and advanced science and math courses with A's and A+ but i have s hit grades for English and History)

I used to be interested in History since I was a war/military enthusiast but I started bombing World History and I always get crappy grades in quizes after that year of WH.

But I don't really have a problem with that - getting into, say a science-oriented university isn't going to require A+'s in everything. Furthermore, my English and History grades are not bad (B's and B+'s) but my mother insists that I get A's. Although I believe that I should get the highest grades possible, it just isn't possible.

But my mother keeps on giving me threats, sometimes maybe over the line, like how she will

1. get rid of my stuff to "**Inflict Pain**" so i will understand (not a joke)
2. send me back to my home country (i'm currently in an american high school) and the education there is really bad and it is likely that after 4 years overseas, my academic performance in my home country will be beyond unimaginable
3. Shout at me in front of my sister to show that she hates me

You guessed it, fucked up family. She says she got sick of me since I am too nerdy and too reclusive and yet she thinks i slack around when it comes to English and Social studies.

And moving out isn't an option. I **absolutely need** to graduate here. Going back to my home country is worse than graduating with all D's. I'm not joking. She doesn't hit me, but I'd rather get beaten with a sledgehammer rather than endure all this shit.

EDIT: I also need to go to a good american university or my parents won't fund it. I know why she would say I need to get straight A's, but seriously, my school is one of the top in my region and it is near impossible for me to get an A in the two subjects. And that still doesn't explain why she is giving me a hard time. So my point is this: what do I need to tell her?

EDIT2: I'll come back after an hour. doing homework usually helps me wind down.

so reddit, i had a lot of fun here (on my main) and I know reddit is more than having fun. help.
