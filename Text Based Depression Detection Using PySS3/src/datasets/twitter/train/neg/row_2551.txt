The reasons that make people depressed and suicidal IMO1. While you are alone, you let negative thoughts take over your mind. You did this a few days in a row and it became a habbit.


2. You don't do what you love in life. Try to do what you love and don't force yourself into doing things you hate. If you really hate ur job then quit. You hate anything? Get rid of it if you can. Or at least stay away from it.


3. You think you need something but you really don't. You are frustrated because you think you deserve something, maybe you do but thats the luck of the draw. All you really need is food, water and shelter to survive.

4.Because of society. It tells you what your life should be like. Its just a recommandation, don't take it too seriously. It makes you think you are worthless if you dont obey its rules. But its just not true.

5. If none of the above...you may have a real, temporary problem. Something that can't be solved/avoided no matter what...Like a convict being imprisoned in jail. Like a kid not being loved by the parents. In this case, I'm sorry. I hope you can carry on. But even those problems will be solved in the end... time will solve them.  The prisoner will get out of jail eventually...the kid will grow and will be independent of his parents eventually. There is still enough reason to carry on.

6. The permanent real problems. Like the prisoner sentenced for life. Or like someone with a disability. This saddens me the most. I hope that people with those kind of problems find inner peace and the strength to carry on.
