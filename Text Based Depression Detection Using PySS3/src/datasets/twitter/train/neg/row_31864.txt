Don't want to talk to my therapistI don't want to tell my therapist about my suicidal thoughts because I feel like I'm just being an attention-seeking piece of shit.  I mean, I've attempted suicide like once and got close, but idk if I'd do it now or not.

I've been having suicidal thoughts, but I don't think I'd actively commit suicide, I'd just do something reckless, like start doing heroin, or binge-drink until I pass out or almost die.

I just feel like bringing up my shitty vaguely suicidal thoughts to her would be being an attention-seeking bitch, although that doesn't really make sense, since I'm paying her to listen to my shit.
