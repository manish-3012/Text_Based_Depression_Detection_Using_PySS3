Need advice dealing with temporary pet loss+QuestionsSorry I canâ€™t remember if Iâ€™ve already made a post here about this 

I also posted this on r/Pets 

I have two six month old kittens that I am absolutely in love with. They mean the world to me, and I was about to kill myself before I got them but now they have changed my entire life.

However, mine and my familyâ€™s living situation and financial situation is horrible

We have to move out in three days and we still donâ€™t have a place to live

And I have to give the kittens back to the woman I got them from

Iâ€™m honestly contemplating suicide, but I know thatâ€™s a bad idea

I have no way to convince my parents not to make me give them back

I just need advice on how to deal with it

When we find a new home, we might be able to sneak them back in

Although that might take a month or two

If we canâ€™t, Iâ€™ll be forced to take them back in two years, when I move out.

Will my kittens remember me after two years? Will they hate me for abandoning them for that long? Will they miss me? Will they know I miss them? I just want to know if theyâ€™ll remember me after two years, and if theyâ€™ll hate me.

They love me so much, they never leave my side and constantly ask me for kisses and cuddles. I canâ€™t sleep without them nestled on my chest.

I havenâ€™t been able to stop crying, these kittens were the only thing keeping me from killing myself and now that I wonâ€™t have them I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll do.

Please help me.
