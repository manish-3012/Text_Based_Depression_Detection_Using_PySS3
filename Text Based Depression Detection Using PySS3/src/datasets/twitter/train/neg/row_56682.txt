How do you know when it's time?The actual suicide isn't a problem, I'm fine with death and everything. Only thing that I'm worried about is my parents. But I know that the time when it could have gotten better has passed, so I'm just kind of here running out the clock on my life because I don't want my parents to be sad.

I already gave up a long time ago but how do I know when it's time to call it for good?
