Feeling like things will never get better. My brain wants me deadI just feel so hopeless. Things used to be going well for me, I had my academics to count on, but now I realize that is all so meaningless, especially when youre an unmotivated, boring loser like me that nobody would ever take interest in. I will probably spend the rest of my life working a dead end job that I hate. Nobody will ever be able to love me. I can't even make and maintain friends, ever since I was a kid I've just been inept at it - I push everyone in my life away. I've been in this position so many times before and it just feels like a never ending cycle. Things won't get better. It will always come back to this. I've tried a couple different meds and even those don't work, and then when I tried to reach out to a counsellor I was told I was basically unhelpable until I found meds that worked. So I guess I am just stuck like this. I really don't want to be here anymore. I wish I had taken the opportunity to kill myself when I was living on my own, just so I didn't have to traumatize my family as they'll be the ones who will find me now. I just can't do this anymore. I just want a hug.
