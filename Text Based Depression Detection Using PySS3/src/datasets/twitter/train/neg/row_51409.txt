i want to give upi am so fucking tired 100% of the time. even though i get plenty of sleep and so when i say iâ€™m tired people laugh and joke about it,
itâ€™s more than that. iâ€™m mentally exhausted. i canâ€™t do this anymore. i canâ€™t be happy and jokey and cute, sometimes i manage to be and i find it insane - itâ€™s like thatâ€™s a different person. i tried so desperately to be a good person for so long and i guess maybe iâ€™m still a good person but with everything i just CANT.

so much stress. so much nothing-ness. even when i do the my absolute hardest itâ€™s still not enough, it never fucking is. i try so hard i swear i do - i try so much and still everything is so shitty. iâ€™m so tired of it all.

iâ€™m too scared to kill myself so i probably never will and i already know that no one is gonna be able to help me anyway if they try and message me so iâ€™m just stuck. why am i such a failure of a goddamn person??
why canâ€™t i just be normal and good and cool and cute and idek what else? i need to stop wallowing in my own sadness i tell myself but I CANT god i canâ€™t i canâ€™t i canâ€™t i canâ€™t i canâ€™t.
sometimes i feel ok, i donâ€™t know how i get to that point.

iâ€™m gonna go to sleep now and maybe iâ€™ll feel better tomorrow. i hope that maybe this is all one big nightmare and iâ€™ll wake up but i know thatâ€™s not true.
