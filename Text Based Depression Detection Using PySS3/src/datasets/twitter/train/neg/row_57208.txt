I don't know what to doHi.
I am a 16 year old girl living in Ireland. Everything in life I have a problem with-friends, self-image, family, school just everything.
Currently I'm in a leadership course and I'm scared. Socially. I sit here saying nothing and I don't know what to say. I have severe social anxiety even going to the shop scares me I just want to stay in my room playing video games all day. This anxiety has led to my depression and a heavy heart. I am forever worried what others think of me and don't feel the energy to start talking to people. Sometimes I just want it all to end. Please I just need some advice some guidance, anything. I don't know what to do.
