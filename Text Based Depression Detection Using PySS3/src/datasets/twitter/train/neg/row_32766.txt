No reason to liveThere's this woman I love who I've been friends with for a year. I started to love her early on, but I was under 18 (she is very early 20's). So I wait for my birthday, and even afterwards, months after, and I speak to her about this topic. And she tells me she does not feel that way about me and probably never will.

When contemplating suicide, I used to hang in by thinking about dating, living with her, and helping her to achieve her goals and be happy. Now I know all of this to be impossible, and I feel that there is no reason to life. Advice on this matter is appreciated
