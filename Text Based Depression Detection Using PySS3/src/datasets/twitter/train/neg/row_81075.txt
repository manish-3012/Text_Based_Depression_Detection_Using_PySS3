No latter what medication I take or any healthy lifestyle choices I make , I always want to milk myself .I have been depressed since I was 14 and started thinking about suicide shortly after .  It has now been 17 years and I am more miserable then ever .  I always told myself I was going to wait until my parents pass away before I do it .  I donâ€™t know if I can wait anymore .  There is nothing that inspires me , nothing that motivates me , no real reason to keep going through my sad pathetic .  I have become such a mean person.  I actively avoid almost everyone because I freak out over everything.  I canâ€™t wait for the day to die .  Itâ€™s all I think about :(
