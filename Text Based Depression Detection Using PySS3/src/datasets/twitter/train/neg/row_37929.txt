Parents arenâ€™t home for 3 days and Iâ€™ve been thinkingMy own parents just donâ€™t like me. I get grounded for not changing my clothes after i come back from school within 5 minutes. They have all of these weird rules and things that just donâ€™t make sense. Theyâ€™re just illogical and unreasonable people. If I just killed myself wouldnâ€™t that solve my problems? People at school just act like theyâ€™re my friends but they wouldnâ€™t care if I killed myself. I bought a pistol illegally and i have a couple rounds. I wouldnâ€™t even hurt for more than a second. But iâ€™ll give people on social media 2 days to convince me otherwise. Do your magic.
