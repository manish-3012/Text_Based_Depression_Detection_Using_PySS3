Iâ€™ve got nothingThere is absolutely no point in my life. I literally have nothing that I can look to in the near or distant future to look at and think â€œthat is the reason I should continueâ€ my life is so empty and hollow, and all in all utterly pointless. Iâ€™ve lost the only good thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me in my girlfriend. She made me think that maybe things could be ok. But Iâ€™ve now lost her and I have nothing left. There is no point to my life at all. What is the point in trying anymore
