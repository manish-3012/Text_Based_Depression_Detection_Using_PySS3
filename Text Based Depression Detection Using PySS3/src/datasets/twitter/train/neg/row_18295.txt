ever since i attempted suicide, i donâ€™t care about life anymore.i attempted suicide last september when my boyfriend broke up with me. he doesnâ€™t know the details of what happened or that i did it on purpose, but regardless, he couldnâ€™t give less of a fuck that i almost died and moved on immediately after our breakup. the only reason i am not attempting again is because iâ€™m worried someone will find me before i die (like last time) and i also donâ€™t want to put my family through it again (especially my younger sister, sheâ€™s my best friend in the world). ever since i survived though, i just couldnâ€™t care less about anything.
life feels like a game. it doesnâ€™t feel real. iâ€™m 25 and maybe thatâ€™s young and life has more to offer but i really couldnâ€™t care less. i havenâ€™t had a job since the attempt and i donâ€™t care to get one. i donâ€™t care about having a new relationship because i donâ€™t think love is real anymore. if life is a pointless game iâ€™m just waiting to die. i donâ€™t care about myself or my future anymore. iâ€™m not grateful for life or my survival. iâ€™m jus waiting for death and i couldnâ€™t care less what happens in between.
