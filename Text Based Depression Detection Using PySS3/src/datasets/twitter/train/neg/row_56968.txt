Started to Die in my dreams, Something is wrong with me.I am currently a guy in college and have recently started having a lot of dreams. There are two types of dreams happy ones where i am having the time of my life and death, where I end up dying then waking up. 

Both of these dreams hit me hard. The ones were I'm happy literally make me cry just because I didn't want it to end. The ones about death just wake me up and I feel weird as if I should just accept me dying. I can't really explain it. 

My depression itself is getting worse as well. I have started feeling sick as in I feel like throwing up all the time. I feel like I'm trapped in a room where the walls are caving in. I have started not to care about anything. Doing risky things like driving too fast and even letting my grades slip. 

My free time is just spent thinking about death. Every night I lay in bed just imagining a different way I die. This may be weird but I use my imagination trying to picture myself being happy. Like i would pretend I lived a different life and the only difference was i was happy. It's weird to describe it. 

My parents don't seem to understand that I'm even depressed. I told them about these death dreams and they brushed it off. 

I used to be able to cover my depression. I was able to move on with daily life. Now i feel like shit. I can't hide it anymore. If I can't get out of this feeling. I don't think I can live like this anymore. 

What is wrong with me. I just want everything to be normal.
