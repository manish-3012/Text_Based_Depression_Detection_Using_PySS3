I'm doing just fine, this is about my momYesterday morning, my dad called me and told me my mom had texted him a suicide note and now wasn't picking up.
My mom had locked her door so my little brother broke it down and we found my mom in her bed drifting in and out of consciousness. I called 911 and all of that.

My mom attempted suicide by trying to overdose on her bipolar/depression medication. But she's stable and in the hospital right now.

Now, a few years back, I was in a extremely dark place. It got to the point where I was standing on the roof of an office building but I decided not to because I knew it would hurt my mom.
My sister, who was/is (she's getting better tho) in a dark place. She started cutting and got close to just slitting her wrists. But she didn't, because she knew it would hurt my mom.
We have told my mom this over and over again that she saved our lives and that we don't know what we would do without her. But she did it anyway.

I'm not a angry person but I am absolutely furious. I don't know if I have ever been this angry at someone close to me. I wasn't mad at my sister at all.

I feel so fucking hurt and betrayed by my mom.

And I know you're supposed to be kind and sweet to a person after something like this, that they are hurting and they need comfort. But I don't know if I can do that for her. 

Am I horrible?  What can I do?


(y'all who are hurting, please don't take your life. It's not an answer. I know that's said over and over again but I've been there. I'm studying psychology to be a therapist so I can make people's lives better. It probably doesn't help, but a random internet stranger doesn't want you to die)
