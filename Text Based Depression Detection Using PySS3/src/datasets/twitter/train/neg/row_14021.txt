i want to preempt thisi'll be brief, because, frankly, i don't care anymore. within a few days, few hours, or something like that, the absolute love of my life is going to tell me that she feels nothing for me anymore. she woke up one day and everything was different in her mind, including me, her loving mate. we never fought. we got along perfectly. we matched in all the right places. we were deeply and madly in love. we opened up new worlds for one another. it made life worth living. and it's going to end. i didn't do anything to cause it, but that doesn't matter in the end.

so, the question is: what can i do to avoid killing myself? i don't like the idea of antidepressants. my pointless pride prevents me from getting a therapist. i've been through an awful depression before and i almost killed myself there. this one is already several magnitudes worse and it hasn't even really started yet. i don't know what to do.
