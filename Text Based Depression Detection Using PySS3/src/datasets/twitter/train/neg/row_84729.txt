Iâ€™m way too sensitive for this worldIâ€™m so sensitive to everything and Iâ€™m a failure I can barely leave the house without getting such bad sensory overload but when I donâ€™t leave the house I feel bored and lonely. I take everything every single little thing to heart and work is so exhausting I just want to jump off the railing at work while all the customers are there so they can see me die and theyâ€™ll feel bad for me. My physical illness makes me so nauseous and itâ€™s probably not even that bad but it really affects me I literally have dreams that Iâ€™m in high school or at my old job just screaming at everyone how much theyâ€™ve made me want to kill myself. Fuck me!
