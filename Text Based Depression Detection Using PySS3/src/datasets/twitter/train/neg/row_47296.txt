Enough. I'm a 17 year old male high school senior and I have had enough of life. I despise myself, society, my status in this world, people (most notably my parent's), and so on. I've had enough of everything I've been through and will be going through. 

I'm going to take my own life because I do not want to deal with life anymore, or anymore of its repetitive obstacles. I'm glad I'm doing this. I don't care who gets hurt, even if my parent's are the ones who will be the most devastated. This is for my own benefit. It's a very brutal and personal middle finger to the whole world.
