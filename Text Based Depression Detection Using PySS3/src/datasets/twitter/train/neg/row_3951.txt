I want to kill myself because I am guilty of being privilege and meeting beauty standardsI am 4'8" and female.  Every single woman between 5'7"-5'9" is jealous of me and wants to be my height.  I get told by 5'7" women that they want to be womanly like me.   I hate having insecurities because my height is literally the best part of me and yet I want to be at least 5'0".  I literally want to look less feminine and conventionally attractive.  I want to look more masculine and ugly and be more oppressed.  I am more privileged than a 5'0" woman because my body is more dainty and petite, but I want to look ugly and manly and gross so I don't feel as guilty.

I am guilty and I wish I was either a 5'9" man or a 5'7" woman so I could feel ACTUAL oppression.  Being more than 7' as a man or less than 4'9" as a woman is the definition of privilege and patriarchal beauty standards and I feel like I am taking society backwards by meeting the biggest beauty standard.  Honestly being deformed and less than 4'9" as a woman is considered more privileged than being beautiful and 5'4" and I feel guilty for taking society backwards by being a privileged height.

I live in the UK by the way, where the beauty standard is apparently to be 4'8" according to everyone I meet.
