Why do I want to kill myself?I don't want to live. I suppose that's pretty common on this thread but for me, there isn't much reason to not want to live. I love my family, my roommates are great, and I'm being given enough antidepressants to make anyone happy. Despite all this, I still want to kill myself.  I have brief moments of happiness, but they always fade away quickly back into pain. I know my death would be heartbreaking to the people who love me, but I don't think I can go on much longer.
