I can't keep doing this...I wish that I didnt have to keep coming back here...that I could for once be in control of my emotions. 


Recently I started feeling okay, I had some semblance of confidence and self worth. I wasn't constantly obsessed with ending things. I mean, I wasn't happy, but it was just such a nice break. I've learned by now that these things won't last so there's no point in trying to make them. Still, it just feels like a sick game where I'm occasionally reminded of what it would be like to be a person again. 


I hate feeling this way. I resent how pitiful I've become. I feel like such a joke, not just in life but around other depressed people. I have no hardships in my life, I've never been abused or poor. I have no reason to feel this way but yet I do. I feel that I have a good grip on what my problems are but what really gets to me is why. I have no idea why I'm like this or how I can just make it stop. 


I've tried a lot of things. I honestly have. Every time I try to step out of my comfort zone I get beaten down. I've never really been in a relationship but I've tried talking to girls. Sooner or later they just stop replying. I don't blame them though. I've tried making new friends and well... Thats a whole other story. Please don't get me wrong though, I don't hate people, nor am I an angry person. I don't hate the world or my life even, I just hate myself. 


I just don't get why it's so hard to do it. Even when I'm not an emotional wreck, when I'm apathetic but rash I still want to end it. No matter how many times I try it I just can't. I know it's cliche but I'm so damn tired. 


Sorry for the ranting.
