Can't postpone this much longerI've been seriously considering escape plans for a few weeks now, and I finally have got a good option.  I have to avoid the psych ward at all costs, so obviously I've gotta be as sure as possible that it will work.  Not having access to a gun makes this so much more challenging, and the fact that newer cars don't emit much CO anymore is truly tragic, makes me wish I still had my 96 chevy.

Anyway, I couldn't kill myself last week cus my great aunt had just passed, and to have my death coincide with hers would be to take away from the celebration of her life and be doubly devastating for my family.  And now I have a cousin getting married next weekend, and unfortunately I care too much about that cousin to do it a week before her big day, it would mean a bleak wedding assuming they didn't postpone.

So I've gotta wait until next Monday.  Just thinking about that fills me with horror.  How do I pass a week?  Reading nihilist philosophy and the ever incisive David Foster Wallace helps, I guess, but my attention span is kinda short right now and that makes it harder.  Video games don't help. Sleeping 14 hrs a day helps, but I always wish it could be more, unconsciousness is my favorite state, getting high is mediocre at getting drunk is worse. 

Whaddaya say reddit? Should I just suck it up and do it today, and just say fuck it to putting a damper on my cousin's wedding?  I'm already having to neglect a lot of people's future emotions to do this in the first place, who cares if I affect what is supposed to be a joyous day?  I just worry that If I go through with it today or tomorrow, the thought of ruining this wedding a week away will hold me back, and I can't have that.  Once things are in place, there can't be any turning back, which means I can't be worrying about what effect my suicide will have on the people who care about "me".
