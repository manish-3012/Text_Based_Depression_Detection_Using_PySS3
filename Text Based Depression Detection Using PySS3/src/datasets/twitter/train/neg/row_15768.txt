I'm so tired of being in painIf I killed myself it would be better for everyone. I have a chronic condition that makes working damn near impossible and leaves me in pain everyday. This is due to having kids, whom I love and I only regret having them because if i hadnt i would be stuck with this condition and situation. I'm married to someone who is  ot attracted to me, but lies and says he is. His body tells me the truth. He is also a liar and untrustworthy but I love him all the same. It's so hard. I have a letter to give him what he wants. Other women, sexy women because I'm not not can I be ever again. I know he wants other women because he watches porn, despite how much it hurts me. He seeks out craigslist hookers and happy ending massage parlors. The happiest hes ever been is when our marriage was open, but it was the most pain I was ever in and I broke because of it even more. If I give him an open marriage he will find someone hot young thing to love and leave me because she will give him his oxygen, which is sex. He has hurt me too much and refuses to get help because he doesnt see it as a problem. But he speaks pretty by saying sorry (but not acting) and promises to stop, just stop lying. I'm fat ugly and we are both to blame for my condition and yet. If he would just admit how much I disugst him, like his penis tells me he does,  I think I would feel validated. So this letter would be my death sentence, right now i am sure hes getting some side tail, i dont blame him with a wife as traumatized and disgusting as me, but it still hurts. So, to just make everyone happy I should leave. He will be guilt free to fuck all the hot ass he wants without ever having to fuck his troll of a wife anymore
