Iâ€™m so tiredI feel so empty nothing makes me happy anymore I feel so worthless like Iâ€™m just ruining peoples lives just by breathing Iâ€™m just sick of feeling like so low or numb all the time canâ€™t I just feel happy for once? So many bad things have happened in my life like people bullying me in school physically and verbally,sexual abuse,had to deal with toxic people,people coming into my life just to cut me out once I get attached to them itâ€™s so fucking stupid itâ€™s like a game that everyone is playing trying to push me closer to the edge Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was 11 and people where like â€œit will get betterâ€ well fuck Iâ€™m still here two years later and itâ€™s gotten way worse so whatâ€™s the fucking point I am 100% sure things are going to get worse I try to hold on for my family but I just donâ€™t think I can I donâ€™t know how to cope everything is just to much I hate myself I cut myself because it makes me feel happy for a bit but even that is not making me feel much better anymore Iâ€™ve been starving myself so maybe then people will treat me like a person but I guess at the end of the day I still hate myself and am still just as empty and not good enough as I was before so I just feel like suicide is the only escape from all this shit I feel like Iâ€™ve tried everything I can such as therapy and medication and talking to childline and suicide hotlines and talking to CAMHS Iâ€™ve been to the doctors itâ€™s still just unbearable I have lost hope Iâ€™ve tried to end my life several times before and it makes me so upset that Iâ€™m still here like why the fuck canâ€™t I just be at peace the only thing thatâ€™s stopping me from ending it all today is itâ€™s my friends birthday so I canâ€™t ruin her birthday that would be a shitty thing to do but Iâ€™m thinking tomorrow or the day after I will do it Iâ€™m trying to think of other options but I just canâ€™t see any I feel like I have to do this
