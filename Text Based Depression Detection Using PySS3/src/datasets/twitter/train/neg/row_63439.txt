I'm not anything, I will not be missed, like, at all. I'm sorry for all my posts i wish I wasn't hereI'm sorry for how many posts I have made I just legitimately have nobody but so many stupid thoughts.

I thought Journaling would help but it does nothing for me, i just want a friend, I just need a friend :( 

Does anything ever feel okay? Ever?
