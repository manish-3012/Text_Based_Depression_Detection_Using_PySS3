Gun or nitrogen. I haven't decided.I want to die. Everyone hates me. I have everything in life, and all I can think of is hanging myself. I walk around my house telling myself I should kill myself. Talking out loud ""No one loves you man, everyone is waiting for you to eat a bullet. They know  how sad you are and that you're going to.

Everyone else found meaningful lives. I haven't because I'm such a rotten person. My soul is rotten. No one could ever love me. And knowing this, it's clear that I wouldn't be missing anything. My future offers a bleak tundra of interpersonal relationships. I'll trudge along until I'm too weak. And then I'll just...rot. And maybe that's what I deserve. 

I don't want to exist. I never have. My family says I'm a mean spirited person. I don't have friends. I post to social media so I have something to look at later can to convince myself my life is worthwhile. It doesn't work. I dive in to hobbies to drown out the silence. The crushing silence of being alone, because everyone's abandoned your life as worth saving. Like being adrift alone at sea. People attempt a rescue, but they give up mid-effort when they get to know you. To hell with that, they say.

I'm so desperate to not feel like this. I want to feel the warmth of having friends. I want to feel like it would matter if I died in my sleep, like maybe someone would come looking. But I'm kidding myself to think as much. To think that I wouldn't just rot, discovered as a puddle of liquifacted fat by whomever bought my house out of foreclosure. After all, no one had answered the mail or noticed it pilling up. 

If I could press a button it'd have been pressed a long time ago. I'm just so starved for meaning, for feeling like I did it for a reason, like today's the day because...x
