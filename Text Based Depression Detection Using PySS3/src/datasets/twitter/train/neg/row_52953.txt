I wish I could die young from natural causes.Being a human, I've always despised physical harm, especially self-inflicted harm. The fact that I won't be able to die for another 50-60 years (at least) really just makes me more depressed. My father currently reigns over me and this will continue for at least 5-6 more years (college). I can't argue or refuse to do something without getting yelled at, which is psychological torture to me because when I was younger it used to mean a beating was coming. I am expected to be independent and competitive but I've pretty much been conditioned to be the opposite. I wish I could die at 20 in my sleep. I wonder if being depressed, crying every day, and violently shaking can reduce my life expectancy.
