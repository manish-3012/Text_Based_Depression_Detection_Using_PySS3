"You're too young to be depressed."I'm so tired of people telling me "oh, you're only 13? You have a whole life to live and you're so young. You can't be depressed or suicidal!1!1!" 
I didn't know mental illness had a fucking age limit? Everytime I post something on this sub reddit, people immediately attack me for being 13 and "having nothing to complain about".  I've been neglected since I was 2. I've been abused. My parents were always fighting. My father taught me how to kill someone and showed me how a gun worked at 8 because he was always drunk and bored. Left me when I was 9 after threatening to kill me and my sister. And then my mother started abusing me. Telling me how i'm useless and a big mistake. How a stray cat was better than me and that I should just die. I had toxic friends. I pulled a knife on my sister and got in alot of trouble with the police a year ago. I got diagnosed with depression and conduct disorder. I don't need people to tell me I'm young and that I shouldn't complain. Or that I "still have a whole life to live" and that I should "just wait 'till i'm a bit older". I'm tired of people thinking 13 year olds aren't capable of thinking or something. 

I just need a hella good reason not to kill myself tonight.
