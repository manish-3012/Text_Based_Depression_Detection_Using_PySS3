I'm a FailureThe cycle continues - every day I tell myself I'll be a better girlfriend, daughter and friend but I inevitably fall back into the same toxic habits. I scream at myself internally, always, that I must stop the nonsense and yet I don't. It's as though I'm merely observing myself doing and saying all these stupid things, rather than feeling in control of what is going on, despite that being the case. 

My poor boyfriend has endured enough, and is constantly reassuring me that my deluded and irrational thinking is exactly that - I believe him, yet I continue to question his love and motives. He's expressed to me how hurtful my actions are, yet I continue to do it. I'm stuck in my own personal hell, hating who I am and yet feeling powerless to the paranoia and anxieties that seem to rule my life. 

I have not slept in days, save for an hour or two a night, and I cannot turn my brain off. I mull over what I've said and done, wishing against all reason that I could go back and change what I've done. It won't stop. I want to get out of my body and my mind, it's too much. I want to rip my skin off, everything is so uncomfortable. It feels as though this negative pressure inside me is going to explode, the two halves of me competing for control. 

I don't want to hurt anybody by killing myself, but I also don't want to continue on this way. I try and try and try to change, going to therapy and making promises that I never keep. I want to start cutting myself again and not stop until all of the blood has drained from my useless, pathetic body. 

I hate myself. I need to die. I'm a burden and everybody would truly be all the better without my existence.
