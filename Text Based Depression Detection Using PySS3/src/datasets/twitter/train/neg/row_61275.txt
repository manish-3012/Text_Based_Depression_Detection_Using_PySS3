I'm just so sad.I'm so sad that it's come to this. I've struggled with negative feelings my entire life and just recently they've resulted in me contemplating suicide. I think about overdosing, jumping off of a building, an exit bag, but no way seems full-proof or painless. I'm so scared of surviving a suicide attempt and having to deal with the aftermath of that. I'm so scared of leaving this world and leaving others in pain, but i'm also in so much pain. I with there was a button you could press where you could just opt out of life and everyone will forget about you. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up. I think of a scenario where I actually end up killing myself and I can't help but cry at how lonely and sad it would be.
