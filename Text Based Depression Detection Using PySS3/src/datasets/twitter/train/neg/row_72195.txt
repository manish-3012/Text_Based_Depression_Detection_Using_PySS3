im feeling suicidal almost every day now, maybe i should really do it in a few weeksim 21 years old ( my birthday was 5 days ago ) and everything is only getting worse . i really dont have a single reason to keep on living , most dont care about me , and im quite sure most in my family wouldnt mind if i killed myself either 

i could never get a job , im ill too often to ever visit a school and actually finish it ( had to stop going to school in "highschool" due to health issues 4 or 5 years ago , and everything just keeps on getting worse

i also quickly took a depression test and it says i have severe depression 

i really dont want to live on , my life is getting worse with every day , and worst of all , i am currently alone , my mother wont be home for 2 more days , i wont do anything drastical right now , but it still gives me lots of time to think about the best way to do
it 

i just cant find any motivation to keep going anymore , im ugly , i have no friends , my family wouldnt even care if i was dead , and i know (by looking at the past 5+ years . if i dont do it , i will just end up worse again , every day i wake up with headaches , nausea , and all sorts of other problems , no doctor cares

i promise i wont do anything tonight , but i really think i should try it tomorrow , we have some pipecleaner at home the shop had behind a closed shelf ( doesnt gurantee its going to be enough , but i can try ) and we probably have some blood pressure pills aswell , i got enough time to think about it right now , the more i write here the more my will to live fades away , i just dont feel anything anymore , i even cut myself a short time ago , and i dont feel anything from it , not even an itching feeling

i also havent felt any other emotion for the past year , no sadness and especially no joy ( last time i felt joy was around 2012 or earlier )

i dont know if i have the energy left to really wait much longer i just want to be dead . i dont even care how painfull it will be , i just want to chose a method that is less likely going to fail , i have a feeling if i fail everything will just get so much worse again like always 

like i said , wont do anything today , cant gurantee tomorrow
