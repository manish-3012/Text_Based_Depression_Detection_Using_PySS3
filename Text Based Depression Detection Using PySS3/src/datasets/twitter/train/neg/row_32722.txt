Iâ€™m stuck.I am 13 and dealing with (what I believe to be) depression. During the lockdown I started getting numb to my feelings and started getting suicidal thoughts. I want to get help but Iâ€™m afraid if I tell anyone Iâ€™ll just be â€œthat thirteen year old who thinks heâ€™s edgy.â€ What do I do?
