Have you ever driven someone to suicide?I have. And I can't stand that I did it. It was the beginning of 2018. I wish I could go back and change it all. I didn't realize it at the time, but now I realize. I'm posting here a lot lately. I'm sorry if it's bothering any one. I'm just so fucked right now.
