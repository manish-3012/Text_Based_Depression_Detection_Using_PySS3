I don't know how to escape it. Please help.I have no will to fight anymore. She'll never see me as more than a friend and I'll never be satisfied with that even if I do find someone else. It'll always eat at me. Like a poison. It hurts to think about it. And I think about it all the time. It dictates my mood. Sometimes she can make my day and other times she can make me want to post on suicidewatch. But even on the days she makes me feel good I know in the back of my mind it'll never happen. I see her nearly every day at work. I know she talks to a lot of different guys and it kills me. It kills me cause I want it so bad and it'll never happen.  I just don't want to feel it anymore. I don't want to live through it. I've tried to fight it back so hard so many times for so long. It always ends up being the same thing. Its not worth it. Please. I need something.
