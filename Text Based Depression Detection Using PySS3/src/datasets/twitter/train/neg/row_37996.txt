Coming HomeI (19) want to go home, my parents house where also my violent and rude sister (15) lives is not my home anymore. If we don't share some kind of opinion she starts to hit me and scratching me. I don't feel safe there. 

My bfs home, is also not my home it feels like the whole household is my job we always fight about it and he says i live here without paying rent bc i still go to school i don't have money or a job. I don't feel wanted here. 

I feel lost. My parents don't understand me and they don't see how sick and violent my sister is. I think my bf doesn't care about my feelings he jas no interest in me but when i ask him he says he loves me more than anything else .. So i rather staying here and fight with him than get beaten up by my YOUNGER sister.

I don't want this all anymore.

One year. One damn year and I can start working and get my OWN home MY HOME a place where i am welcome and feel well but i don't know how long I can keep this going.

I just want a place where i feel loved and welcome but there is no such a place.

I want to go home, cut my wrists and bleed out. Bleeding the pain out. Coming home.
