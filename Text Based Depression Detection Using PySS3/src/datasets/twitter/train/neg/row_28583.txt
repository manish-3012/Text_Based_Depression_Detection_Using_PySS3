I've seen some fucked up shit...Yesterday afternoon I tried some LSD for the first time. It was probably 7 or 7:30pm. Everything was fine. I had people watching me. All was good. Slowly but surely, one by one, the people started leaving. They were tired, had to work today. Whatever. I should be fine by myself.

FUCKING NOPE.

I talked with dead people. LSD was one of the worst experiences of my life. And now that it's supposed to be over it still hasn't entirely worn off. I just want to be done... Fuck this...
