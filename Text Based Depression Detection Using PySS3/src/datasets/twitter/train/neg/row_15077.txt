My dad just made a joke about eating me when we run out of food during the corona virus outbreak and thought it was ok, he got mad at my mother, screaming at her for not â€œgettingâ€ the jokeMy dad is an asshole, every since I was bullied he called me weak for not fighting back, every time I was doing my homework he would scream at me for not helping my mother clean the house even though he never helped her, he would slap me and mock me if I talked back, he would always make me smile because â€œhe hated the face I was makingâ€ when I was sad, Iâ€™ve been bullied for almost 6 years in school and everyday when I come back home my mom and dad would fight, and then my mom or dad would come to my room and reminded me of how worthless I was, that I was lazy and stupid, even when Iâ€™m home I canâ€™t even be lifted alone, please just kill me, let this virus end this stupid selfish species.
