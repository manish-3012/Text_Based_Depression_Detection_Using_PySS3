Itâ€™s not easy to live being unlovableItâ€™s a new account because my friends started spying on my old account please donâ€™t judge. Honestly it fucking sucks that everyone around you are in a relationship and youâ€™re always alone no matter what. People itâ€™s easier and it will happen but no it wonâ€™t happen. Loneliness sucks balls and no one even acknowledge it. Life is not happy alone. Iâ€™m 24 already and I have no idea what a relationship looks like. Maybe if Darwin was correct, people like me will die in the evolution trend. Iâ€™m just the weak and itâ€™s survival of the fittest. Obviously Iâ€™m a weak ass so I donâ€™t need to play a game which I cannot win. I should just quit it. Losers like me are only an abomination to the society. Better off without me
