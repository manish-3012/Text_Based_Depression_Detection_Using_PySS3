I'm sorryI'm very sorry I talk, walk, eat, sleep, exist, and breathe. I get so angry that I move my own body, have the feeling of hunger, wake up in the morning, see things around me, smell things, taste, hear, and fucking breathe. I'm definitely going to be committing suicide very soon. I have no one. I want no one. I want to die so fucking bad. I have to get rid of certain things in my room, clean, wipe my phone of everything/destroy my card, and write letters. Some are already written and some need rewritten. I'm very sorry I was born.
