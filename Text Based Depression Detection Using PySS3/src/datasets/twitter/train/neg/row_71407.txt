72 hour hold at Home?Hi, Iâ€™m curious if thereâ€™s any info out there about doing a 72 hour hold at home? 
Maybe some way my boyfriend could just be watching over me/support me in helping my mental health? 
Iâ€™ve googled it but thereâ€™s not info... 

I donâ€™t have insurance and I have to work my normal Monday-Friday job. But I canâ€™t handle my emotions anymore and Iâ€™m overthinking with bad thoughts... 

This is just me trying to figure out a way to fix my shit without getting a huge bill and having something potentially against me in my upcoming divorce/custody agreement 
Thanks
