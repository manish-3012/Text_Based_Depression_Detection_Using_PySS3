i m not looking for answers anymorei jump to the conclusion that damn , i want to be gone . my body aches . but i stay for my mom not to be sad . i feel so trapped in my pain and by life . i m so amazed by functionality and malfunctions , of the untouchable , the unthinkable , how wonderful senses are when you experience all of them , i am mind blowed by too many different things , but from way too far . life is too much . i m too distant . death is my happy destination and i m waiting for it . 

" you need stability and devotion to something " blablabla .... i m paralyzed by everything . or i m fucked on anything . i m constantly between unhealthily enjoying , and inevitably failing . always running away or falling head over heels . 

i don t belong . and i m fine with it ! let me go .... 
i don t want to be a joy or a sadness . 
please forget about me , it s ok ! 

i want to stop hurting you . happiness is not my fucking goal . i want to stop being me .
