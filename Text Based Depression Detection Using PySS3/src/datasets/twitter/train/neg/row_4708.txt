2019 was the best year of my life. 2020 might be the last
In 2019 I left an abusive relationship for good. In 2019 I left my toxic home environment for good. I went abroad and found myself â€“ outside of abuse and harm. I spent the year learning and growing. I made new friends and had new experiences. I got my first tattoo. After I left such a toxic environment, the skills I had been learning for the past 7 years finally began to work. I could finally comfort myself, appreciate myself and feed myself without hating my body. I finally developed relationships with real boundaries and genuine care. 

In March of 2020, I moved back to the house I never thought I would be in again. I began to hate myself. My own thoughts drowned by the mindless shaming that I experienced. My family filled my room with their unwanted items. I began to feel swallowed with the feeling of being forgotten. Surrounded by unwanted items, I began to feel unwanted. I woke up in pain and I fell asleep in pain. I cried until my head hurt so badly that I couldnâ€™t move. I watched my dad welcome my sexual assaulter into my home. I listened to my mom as she told me that they loved me, and that this â€“ the toxicity â€“ was all in my head. 

In June 2020, I canâ€™t decide if I am more scared to die or to live the rest of my life with these feelings inside of me. I feel like I am locked inside of 4 green walls. I try to shatter the windows and break the door, but I am stuck. Confined to the psychosis in my own mind. Barricaded by the noise of â€œnever good enoughâ€.
