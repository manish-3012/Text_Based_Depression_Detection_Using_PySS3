So close to tying a nooseIâ€™ve had depression for as long as I can remember. I got dumped recently and since I donâ€™t have a SO to leave behind perhaps itâ€™s time to tie myself a noose and commit.  Iâ€™ve been unhappy with my life for years and my mental and physical heath isnâ€™t getting better. Iâ€™m 100lbs (20lbs underweight) and look like a skeleton. Perhaps itâ€™s time I go and perish on my own terms.
