Im turning 18 today.All of those years I said I would end my life on the day I turned 18.  
I live basically alone with my father, who had been threatening to kick me out for a few weeks now and earlier today while drunk he went on this huge rant that included him mentioning that I was, quote, not his real son, because at 18 years of age I don't have a driving licence or girlfriend. He followed up by calling me a faggot multiple times, some degrading stuff that I don't remember probably because I was in shock by how serious he was.   


I feel like the stars aligned and this was the push I needed to finally end my life.
