I just have a question if anyone is willing to anwserI have been dealing with depression with many many years im feel like a huge burden to everyone i know and i was just wondering if it would be better to kill myself somewhere where no one will find my body so it would seem like i had run away. If i left a note saying i had run away do u think it would lessen the impact on those around me. I just feel it would be worse if they had found out i had died. And if i had "ran away" they would believe im still out there and it wont hurt as bad does this seem like a better idea im offing myself either way i just need an anwser
