maybe i'm doneSometimes when I feel very suicidal, I go for a long walk so that I can listen to music and be alone. It usually helps me calm down and I'm able to get through the day. But today seems to be different. I'm on one of those walks right now, and I feel just as bad as when I left home. 

I don't have my rope with me, but there's a bridge I could jump off of pretty near. I can't stop thinking about that bridge.
The fall is so high that it's very likely I'll die when I hit the water. And even if I don't die from that, I'll hit the bottom and get stuck. It's almost guaranteed suicide. And it sounds wonderful.
