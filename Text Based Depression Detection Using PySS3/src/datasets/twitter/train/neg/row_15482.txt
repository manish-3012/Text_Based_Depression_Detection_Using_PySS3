Brokeup with gf yesterday and unexpectedly saw her today...The love of my life, the woman that helped me through several periods of depression for 3 years dumped me just yesterday. I was already doing quite bad... but when I unexpectedly saw her in real life holy shit i want to die. There are no words for how bad it fucking hurt, i thought about killing myself but i think i can stay strong and fight it for now. But fuck this pain... i was honestly devastated, nothing fucking matters anymore. Shes gone from my life and i want to fucking die. Just stop feeling anything. This hurts so damn bad i honestly have no energy to live on anymore.
