Everything I had is lost (22 years old)I now have two misdemeanors in California. I have no clue how much trouble I'm in. I cannot talk to my parents because they are emotionally detached and succumb to their anxiety whenever confronted with serious issues. I've never connected with my father and my mother just seems to be depressed in life. I love them but whenever I need them they let me down. Sometimes I feel like dirt. Sometimes I feel like I have no one in this world who would love me. I had a three year relationship with a wonderful girl but she ended up leaving me for another guy.

I miss having somebody who I can always depend on. I cannot live this life alone for much longer. I try to be 'normal' but I just can't do it. I hate the 'normal' ways. I hate how everyone around me acts like there are no problems in the world. People do not take life seriously. Neither do I. 

I want to believe that mankind is just a long developed form from a single cell-- but I just can't escape the subjective impact of my life. Sometimes I wish I had no connections and could just start over, but then again, I would enter a very deep depression due to the loneliness. I feel like a loser. I smoke. Alcohol is my best friend. In a way I am committing a very slow suicide. But what does it matter if I die in my 80's or in my late 60's? Death is nothing. Death is blankness. Death is just the computer shutting down... no pain, no awareness.. just a total shut down.
