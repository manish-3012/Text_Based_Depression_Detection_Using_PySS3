Iâ€™m suffocating, drowning in a sea of my unshed tearsIâ€™m being so emo right now aha but I opened up I told my parents how I felt and I lived happily ever after.â€¦ WRONG I got a therapist who is recommending partial hospitalization which if u donâ€™t know is skipping school for 10 days and going here instead to manage ur emotions or whatever and my mental health isnâ€™t even that bad like I have the urge to cut who cares?? Itâ€™s an urge that doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™ll do it I also want to die but hasnâ€™t everybody I mean my feelings do suck but thatâ€™s a bit much my parents arenâ€™t even giving me any privacy anymore which sucks cuz they just think Iâ€™m constantly cutting myself which Iâ€™m not Iâ€™m scared that if they find out what Iâ€™ve done theyâ€™ll definitely send me to a mental health facility which scares me I canâ€™t even cry in my room because Iâ€™m scared theyâ€™ll hear me isnâ€™t therapy supposed to make u feel better cuz itâ€™s not for me anyways I know that this is just me being an ungrateful teenager and I know Iâ€™m lucky that I have the chance to go to therapy and I shouldnâ€™t be complaining but I just want to scream because I have to hide all of these stupid symptoms even more cuz now theyâ€™re looking for them Iâ€™m sorry for ranting and if u think therapy would help u at least try but this is just my experience so far if u actually made it this far sorry for complaining I sound like an entitled kid thatâ€™s just whining about problems that arenâ€™t rly there but ya Iâ€™ll stop now
