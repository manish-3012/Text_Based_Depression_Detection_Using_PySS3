Im scared I'll take all the antiplatelets and I don't want to ruin Christmas but I want this to stop...I feel so fucking shitty right now. I don't know what is chemically wrong with me, why I feel so hopeless and corpse-like 90% of the time despite my life being incredible. I just lost my job after lying and saying I had gastro and couldn't come in and my boss yelled at me and told me I fucked up the business and he hasn't paid me. My parents tried to help and then it all went downhill and Im in my room with a bottle of antiplatelets in my dresser and I'm having this powerful urge to down it all and slice my pathetic thighs open but I can't do that because so many people love me for whatever reason. I dont want to burden anybody, yet the thought of me wanting to die being a burden makes me want to die even more. I feel so fucking trapped. I want this to stop. I just wish I were dead. I was supposed to join my family on a vacation tomorrow but I just can't do it. I don't want to get out of bed and make shitty gifts by hand because im completely broke and cry because "wehh im depressed". I feel like such a lazy sack of shit and I hate how I can't take responsibility for my actions, and I also hate that I downplay everything and make it seem like im fine so that when I'm really not okay my family thinks I'm just exaggerating or hormonal. Maybe they're right. I don;t know. I don;t care to know. I just dont want to be alive anymore. And that makes me feel like a selfish fucking asshole. My life is the best it's ever been. I feel like such a little bitch. I don;t want the consequences of killing myself or trying to, I just want my life to stop. I just want this feeling to stop. It's fucking torture. What do I do
