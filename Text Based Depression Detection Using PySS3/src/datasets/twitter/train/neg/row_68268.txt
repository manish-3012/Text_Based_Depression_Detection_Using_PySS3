What's an effective method?I don't plan on killing myself anytime soon. But having a way to do it feels comforting. Strange as it sounds. I don't have a place where I can hang a rope, I don't want to go through the process of getting a gun, and from what I heard overdosing doesn't really work. I just want to have a plan just in case I feel ready.
