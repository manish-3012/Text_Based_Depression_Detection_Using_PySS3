I'm thinking about suicide.I want to die. I'm a failure, I'm a nuisance and I'm unfunny. I wish I had a purpose to this world. What's the point of my life anymore? I self-harm, I can't do anything right. I'm so lazy and useless. Everybody else would be better off with me dead. I have no skills, I have no friends that would care. I'm a horrible person. What's the point of my existence? I know if somebody reads this, they'll say I'm seeking attention, that I'm being dramatic. This is the reason why I never say anything about my feelings, I keep it all in because nobody wants to hear about my personal problems, nobody would care. I don't know why I'm typing this.. I'm thinking about suicide. I want to die. I can't do well in school either, I'm dumb. My very existence is pointless. I feel like an attention-seeking dumbass. Everybody would be better without me. I'm sorry for sharing my problems/feelings, nobody would care. The only reason I'm still alive is because I'm too scared to take my life.
