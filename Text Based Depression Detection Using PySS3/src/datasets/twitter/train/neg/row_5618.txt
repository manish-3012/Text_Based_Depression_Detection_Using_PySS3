I have everything I could want...By all traditional measures, I am successful. My life has been pretty easy up until this point. My parents raised me well, never had any serious financial or emotional concerns. Everyone in my life who I care about is healthy. I am healthy. I just graduated from an elite institution and have accepted a high paying, "prestigious" job in the major city that I grew up in and where most of my friends live.  


I obsess about killing myself. I can't focus on anything anymore. I get distracted within minutes, drifting off into my own world, imagining ways to take my life. The only reason I haven't yet is because I don't want to pass my burden onto family and friends--they don't deserve to feel this pain. I've thought about ways to fake an accident, or how to quietly disappear. I have taken steps. I tried to kill myself in a car accident in January, but the engine of my van miraculously blew out a few hundred feet from the wall I wanted to slam into. I'm still here.  


I don't understand my purpose. I know I am not supposed to think about that kind of question for too long; greater (wo)men than me have gone crazy contemplating life's mysteries. But really, why do I do anything? What's the point of having a high paying job and living in an expensive city? Why don't I just move to an island off the coast of Colombia or Vietnam and live out my days there? 

I am 26 years old. I have been depressed for as long as I remember. I have achieved all manner of material and academic success, but the high from any achievement fades almost instantly. I feel worthless. I am directionless. I want to die. I don't think I'm being rash, and (excuse my arrogance) I think I'm fairly smart. I think I've thought this through from just about every angle. I can't rationalize my continued existence.   


I want to kill myself. Why shouldn't I?
