I feel like I'm reaching the end of the line, and I should just off myself soonI can't take much pressure anymore. I've been suicidal for years, but only now am I getting more and more certain that I should do it. I can't run away from my problems anymore as it's already getting way too late. I simply don't belong to this world.
