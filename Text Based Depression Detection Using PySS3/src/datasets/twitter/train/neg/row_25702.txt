Having a bad few weeks, and tomorrow, failing out of university, for the third time.I've had a bad few weeks with self destructiveness, including harm, and tonight I know I'm failing classes again and will be suspended for at minimum 8 months, and with 5 Fs tomorrow my gpa will be too low to graduate...ever. Without special dispensation from the University. I have rent payed until Aug but I'm short on everything else. Can't talk to anyone I know, but I need to talk.
