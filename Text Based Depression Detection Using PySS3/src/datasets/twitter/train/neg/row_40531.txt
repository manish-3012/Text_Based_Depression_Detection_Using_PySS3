Rock BottomI've hit rock bottom. I'll always be unlovable and insufferable; completely worthless. I don't know what else to do. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety for over eight years now, and still no one wants to help. Ive lost so many friends, ruined so many things, been toxic so many times. Therapy doesn't work, and they won't let me try medication. No one I know gives a fuck. I'm 1000 miles, alone in a college dorm. I'm going to be taking a shit load of tylonel, probably up to 13,000-14,000 mg after I finish my homework (gives me great anxiety if I don't) and keep my fingers crossed. Because no one gives a shit about me no one will know until Its too late, and I won't have to suffer with this anymore. My only regret is that I'll have died without getting my first kiss.
