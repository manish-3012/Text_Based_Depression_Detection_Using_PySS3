I don't feel like I deserve to live.I have done some really bad shit. I was caught by my mom who wasn't really pleased with what I've done, and then threatened to hit me, (not abuse I deserved it) and then wanted to send me away. My family is falling apart, I have one friend, and no money. I just lost my cat of 15 years and things just aren't going right in my life and I'm not sure if they ever will. I almost tried to drink 12 oz. of nail polish remover and hoped that I would die by Acetone poisoning. I can't do my life anymore.
