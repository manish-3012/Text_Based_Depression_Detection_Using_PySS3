Life is but an illusionHi people i'm 13 years old and live in the Netherlands.
I feel fucked up because my life is nothing but setbacks my parents are divorced, my mother is in a shit ton of debt and has a relationship with a guy that has murdered 2 children.
I haven't seen her for 1.5 years back when i was 11 and my sisters all lived in a small village 200km away from my home.
My father will never be able to work anymore because he was almost dead 1 year ago.
He has a relationship with my stepmother who is only complaining about what i do or even when i do nothing. She and my father always say that refugees should return to their own country although some of them have lived here for 20 years. I despise my stepmother, my parents and my life.
My question is should i just end it or not? And if not what should i do to help me out of this fucked up shit!
