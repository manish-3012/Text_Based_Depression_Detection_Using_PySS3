SufferingIâ€™m 17 Whatâ€™s the point of all my suffering if weâ€™re just gonna die one day. I suffer from bad hypochondria/health anxiety. Anything health wise about me Iâ€™m extremely vigilant, Iâ€™m easily convinced I have a terrible illness, and I panic and worry all day. Itâ€™s hard to not give a fuck about my body. The crying, shaking, panicking to try to save and protect my body just to end up dying one day . But suicide canâ€™t be that bad. Kurt cobain commited suicide . What makes this all worse is I have no safe place, I have to deal with it all day with no breaks. Every single day full of worry and panic for what to die . Itâ€™s hard for me to live a regular life I used to have. Why always such a constant worry that somethings wrong with me. Skin cancer , throat cancer , brain infections
