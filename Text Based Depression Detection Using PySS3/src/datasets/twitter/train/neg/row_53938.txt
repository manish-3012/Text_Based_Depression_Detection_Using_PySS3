reached the lowest low yesterday *tw*yesterday i was just so tired. i want nothing out of life and i feel like a burden to my family. i came home from work and took a knife to my throat and tried to slit it. the knife was wayyy too dull and obviously human instinct kicks in so i didn't end up going deep enough&amp; gave up. it wasn't even my planned way to go, it was such a weird impulsive moment. i cleaned it up, pretended it didn't happen, and went to my friend's house. he kept asking me why i was hiding my neck and i completely broke down and couldn't stop sobbing. i told him what i did and he's the only one that knows. i don't want anyone to know because i don't want to get told to go to a mental hospital since i have classes next week. i'm aware i need some mental help but i feel like im fine as of now. anyways, life is weird. this entire summer i kept begging the universe to let me just see a monarch butterfly up close, and today, august 31st, the last day of "summer", i saw a monarch and almost held it. i know this is something small, but it was like a sign. if i actually killed myself i wouldn't have gotten to see what i wanted to see this entire summer. if you're reading this, have some patience with life, theres little surprises everywhere
