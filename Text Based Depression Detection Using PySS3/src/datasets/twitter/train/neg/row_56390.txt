Why can't people just let me kill myself?I can't even look up suicide memes at school to cheer me up about it. My mom asks me everyday if I wanna kill myself. I can't find where a damn exit bag is and now nobody is answering my question about what a peaceful death would be. I'm disabled. I'm a runt of my species and a burden on the future of humanity. Why can't anybody get that? Now I can't even leave the house to go find a rope. Just let me die you guys. I'm getting more upset. PLEASE, for the love of all things good, tell me a good, quick, painless, and peaceful way of dying if you're reading this.
