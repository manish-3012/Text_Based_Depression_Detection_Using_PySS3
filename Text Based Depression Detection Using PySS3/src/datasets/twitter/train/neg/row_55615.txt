I don't want to dieI took about 30 iron pills a little less than an hour ago (about 2000 mg) and I tried to make myself throw them up, but I'm not sure if I did, and thinking about dying has made me regret this. I don't want to die, I just want to stop feeling nothing but pain all the time. I've been sent to in-patient twice and it never helps, but my parents don't understand that. I'm just so tired
