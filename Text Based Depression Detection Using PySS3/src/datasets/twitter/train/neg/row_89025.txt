So Alone.It's been a good amount of time since I have posted on here, I think. I only post when I am really having a break down, 'cause I usually hold it in for so long. I have absolutely no one to talk to about any of my problems as of the moment and feel, well alone. My room mates were all here, and I know they could hear me sobbing so much, but didn't bother to ask what's wrong, even though I always do...I am always there, but when it's my turn, I am just cast aside as the room mate with problems. 

Truth is, I just want to be talked to, that's it. I won't even share my problems. I just want to talk. To be brought back to reality, and away from the darkness that is strangling me right now as I type. It's so hard to breathe from all the crying and I just want to be set free from my hell...But I know that's irrational. I just want to know someone, somewhere would care about me, however selfish that sounds...
