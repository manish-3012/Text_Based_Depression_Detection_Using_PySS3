What the fuck is wrong with me.I literally have no redeeming qualities, I'm ugly, failing school, can't do any job correctly. At work I overheard the manager complaining about how "fucking useless" I am and that she intends to fire me within the next few days. I have 0 friends, I cannot socially interact with another human without making an awkward situation, giving way too much information, or making them creeped out by me for whatever reason. At school I tried to make friends with a group of people and they literally just got up and walking away while giving me dirty looks. I am a worthless pile of trash, I have 0 redeeming qualities, I'm not even good at the one thing I enjoy, video games. I am the very definition of useless, my life was a mistake, whatever deity decided I should be born clearly didn't mean to decide that. Hopefully by the end of these school holidays I'll be fucking gone and everyone can rejoice.
