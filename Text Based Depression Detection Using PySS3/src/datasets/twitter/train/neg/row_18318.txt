yikesi'm going to start writing a note, just in case.

i already have a plan; escape the house after the holidays (most likely at sometime late in the night), leave my note on my bed, see if i could go stargazing before i do what i need to do, find a pretty view at some lake far away from home (at least a couple miles), then jump in.

i'll wear my favourite articles of clothing, bring some of my prized possessions, turn on some music, and as i'm in the water i'll close my eyes and just listen.

people say drowning isn't peaceful, but you'll never know if you never try right?
