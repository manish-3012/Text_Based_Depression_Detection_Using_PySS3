What have i become..?Good question.. im just  another guy who's tired of life. Its the same thing everyday. Wake up late, stay up late. Sleep too much. Eat once a day, sometimes nothing. I have no friends ( real friends)  or any relationship with anyone. The lonenliest guy you would imagine. Im not good with anyone. Never fit in anywhere. Im just fuckin different  you know. Very solitary. My heart's  been broken way too many times. That little boy i used to know ..who was always happy is gone forever. I have no job. Or income. But i can do most things well( jack of all trades) but anyway. My teeth is in bad condition. No medical aid or support. The pain i feel constantly... just  to explain that to you would make your skin crawl. Suffer in silence is the only option. Im no one. More and more everyday i feel that. I'll never be happy. I think about my death constantly. Just make this agony stop. Im empty. Done.  Take that 100,s of sleeping pills.. put a fucking bag over my face and let me fall asleep forever.
