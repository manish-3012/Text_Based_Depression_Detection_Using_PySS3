Recovering addict. No reason to live.After abusing fentanyl through my teens and being unable to count on my hands the number of overdoses ive had Im still here. Why? I got on the methadone program to save my life and have been on it for a year and its just sucked the life from my body. I tried NA. Did well in it but ended up with enemies with everyone there. I have no old friends because they're all users or are from a long time ago like grade 9 and it would be weird to contact them. I'm basically lonely and done feeling like a zombie. Life is a chore. I tried to kill myself earlier last month by taking enough xanax to fall asleep in the snow, only to be found hours later with severe frostbite. A month later im out of the hospital and i tried to cut open an artery. I wasn't very successful as they released me and I'm here today. But tomorrow morning i get 7 methadone bottles and i have 100 xanax. It would be a peaceful way to go. And wouldnt fail this time. Just a final goodbye to whoever cares enough to read this
Luv u mandy
