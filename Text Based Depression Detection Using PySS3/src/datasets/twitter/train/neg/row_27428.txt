Ready to give up.I have been dealing with depression for many years. I attempted suicide at 19 and was put on medication, but today I am overwhelmed. My dog is in need of surgery and I can't afford it until June. She is not going to be able to hold out until then. I have been searching around the clock for funding and was able to find an organization that was willing to put up 200.00 of her 500.00 surgery but then I hit a wall. It sucks to come so close to saving her and I feel like a complete failure. No one in my life understands why I am taking this so hard so I feel alone in this. I feel like I am ready to slam my car into a tree and just be done.
