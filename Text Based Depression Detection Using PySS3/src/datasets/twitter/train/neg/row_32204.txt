I wonâ€™t kill myselfBut I wish I were dead. 

I have had issues with passive suicidality since childhood but 2020 has nailed the lid in that coffin. The world would be better off without me and I would be better off not in this world. It is that simple. 

I donâ€™t ask for much of the world but I havenâ€™t touched another human being in 11 months. Thereâ€™s a kind of madness in that. My region is extending lockdown and itâ€™s not like I have any kind of relationship so who knows how long it will be. I canâ€™t live like this. I donâ€™t need movie theaters and packed restaurants but I need to be touched. And I havenâ€™t been and wonâ€™t be. 

I woke up in the middle of the night with the weight of a boulder on my chest. And thereâ€™s nothing to relieve it. I tried calling the suicide hotline and they hung up on me because I donâ€™t â€œhave a plan.â€

At the beginning of the pandemic I put an end of life plan into my medical paperwork and specifically added a DNR. I wish it was easy to just walk out into the wilderness and slowly freeze to death. I donâ€™t want to keep going like this until I am a wizened old man, alone and isolated and no one to even care to find my body. Not that anyone would care now.
