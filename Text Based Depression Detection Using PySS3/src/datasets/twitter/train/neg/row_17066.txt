I never wanted to make this postSo a month ago I met the girl of my dreams. . But she doesnâ€™t prefer physically intimacy . . She kinda just wants to be left alone a lot and I get that but Iâ€™ve been alone for so long that it was nice to meet someone I felt I could be with... idk even if Iâ€™m worth being here. Iâ€™ve been sad before, Iâ€™ve wanted to die, but the last two-three months, Iâ€™ve really gotten fixated on death and I mean I doubt sheâ€™d miss me too long, I doubt the other people in my life could truly miss me as itâ€™s not like they know me how I know me. . I just kinda donâ€™t wanna feel pain and after seeing how no one can really take that pain away. . I just donâ€™t think I wanna feel much anymore.... I drink a lot too and itâ€™s not out of control but eh whatever like that part matters
