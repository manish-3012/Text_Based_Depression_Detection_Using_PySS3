I give up, my life sucks and I don't belong here. I hope you guys will be able to turn your life around, I'm notLast time I said that I will kill myself to someone, the person replied just "you're and idiot". Everyone thinks I'm fine and nobody understands me

I believe in reincarnation so this makes it easier, there is a big chance that my next life will be better.
My problem with this bullshit life is that I work at a job that I hate from the bottom of my heart, I hated every single of them, I just can't stand the fact that I'm forced to waste 8-9 hours of my life every single day in some stupid meaningless job with annoying people with big egos, I hate them so much. Make me anxious. I hate this system and this society. I don't have any hobbies that I can a living from, I'm from a poor family, we were poor since I was born and we still are, we barely can afford food for whole month, we can, but barely, my mom has thousands borrowed from banks, all I'm hearing everyday is money money money. I'm 23 years old and I've had enough, I tried, I thought I will get used to this "adult life" but no, I can't, I'm done. I have much more problems but fuck it, for example I never had a girlfriend and I never will because I'm an ugly weirdo, socially awkward target for bullies
