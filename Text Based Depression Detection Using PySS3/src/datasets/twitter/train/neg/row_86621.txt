Life sucksLike a lot of you, I've also thought a lot about ending it. Never been able to do it though and life is a constant struggle. I wish there was just a button to end it all. Click it and you just die. Abusive parents are one of the biggest reasons why I am what I am today. Always wanted the best, never really loved me, shouted, screamed, criticized...Maybe I'm the problem. Nothing but a disappointment. A useless creature no one will ever give a shit about. Can't stop having pity on myself. Can't stop crying. Can't do anything good. Anyone have any ways to end it? Simple and painless if possible...
