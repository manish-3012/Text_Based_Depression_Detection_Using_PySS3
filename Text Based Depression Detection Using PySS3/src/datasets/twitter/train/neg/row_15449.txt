In love with somebody who does not like me. At all. Do not want to live.She is the most interesting and beautiful woman I've ever met. I've known her for a while but she won't even add me to facebook. 

Intellectually I know it's stupid to kill myself over one person, but life has been getting worse over the past two years and I see no reason why it's trajectory would suddenly change. Living a life without her in it seems joyless. I'd rather die so at least other people who want to live can get my organs. Please help
