SW, I need your best wishes. This isn't going to be easy. [Update]([Original post is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f59lv/sw_i_need_your_best_wishes_this_isnt_going_to_be/))

So it was today. I went there by car, I wasn't even tempted to hit a tree - needless to say, I'm proud. I found myself in front of her and it was a shock. It had been 4 months since I'd last seen her.

We had a great talk. I didn't bring flowers, as you advised me, but I brought my best excuses. We figured out we had been mostly missing each other while we were broken up. She hasn't been doing too well - and neither have I.

I realized that, really, I craved for the same things as her, even though I was too afraid and wounded to admit it back then and to even let her into my life. She admitted that maybe she intoxicated me because she always wanted to be too close. That she tried to manipulate me so I wouldn't go.

I told her she deserved better. Then I finally told her that I believed we can do better. She didn't answer at first, and then I told her she didn't have to give answer right now, that she should take time to think about it. She said "you know damn right what I think".

We talked about lots of things. We both admitted our mistakes and I think we're off to a good start now. We're taking it slow. She walked me back to my car, and there was this awkward moment. We have so much to reconstruct. I didn't know what to do, so we hugged for a while. Then we talked some more. And then I gave her a kiss on the lips to say goodbye - till next time. She showed the prettiest smile ever and we parted.

Thank you for your support, SW &lt;3.
