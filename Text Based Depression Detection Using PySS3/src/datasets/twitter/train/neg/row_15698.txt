it seemsit just seems like all i want lately is to kill myself. i feel uncomfortable everywhere. no matter who i see or where i go.

i just want to silence my thoughts for once.

i just dont want to think anymore.

i dont want my trauma to consume me. its always consuming me.

it drips out of my words and in my actions. its in my eyes its in my head. 

i love my boyfriend. i love my friends. i love my mom.

but some days, all the time, even when i am trying to improve myself.

i hear myself speak and i see myself move.

i just want to die. i want to end my life. 

i want to run away, far away. i wanna hide in the woods. i wanna cut my arms open. i wanna scream and scream. i want to sleep and sleep and sleep. 

i want to feel loved and when i have it all i do is push it away

god please please let me absorb it
 

i am
hurting
