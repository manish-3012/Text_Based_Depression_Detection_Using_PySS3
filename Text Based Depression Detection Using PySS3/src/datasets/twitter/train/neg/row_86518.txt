not vibing with the "i don't want to die" thingI've just been seeing this so often lately, the i'm suicidal but i don't /actually/ want to die, or people saying that suicidal people don't want to really die they just want the pain to stop.

I just keep thinking to myself that I do actually, honestly want to die, it's not because i want the pain to stop or anything like that I just truly, honestly, want to die and stop wasting space. The only reason I don't really go through with it is because I don't want my family to find my body, like that HAS to be traumatic. I'm not looking to cause my little brothers that kind of trauma, I just want to die idk, alone and forgotten and soon, hopefully.

Does anyone else feel like that? not being in constant pain but very insistently wanting to die? I actually laugh about it a lot, maybe I am trying to escape from something..
