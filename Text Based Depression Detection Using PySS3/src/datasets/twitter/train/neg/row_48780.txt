Depressed and suicidal because of acneI pity those who are suicidal and depressed when they have a good enough job and have had a girlfriend in the past. Why? Because at least they have enough confidence to obtain those things, I'm 18 and I have moderate-severe cystic acne since 12 years old. It turns my confidence inside out and takes a giant shit on it. About 70% of my face is filled with blackheads, scars, hyperpigmantation and current cystic acne and no matter how many OTC products I try nothing works. I've spent literally hundreds of dollars on prodcuts over the counter and only available online, yet nothing.

Why don't I go to the dermatologist? With what money? My family doesn't even have health insurance, in my 18 years of living I've NEVER had a check up and I'm surprised I've made it this far considering I used to skateboard and was in track for 2 years in high school. My dad says "it'll go away" my mom says she'll take me to the derm but I know she can't because she's in $3k debt her self. 

Acne has turned me into a schizoid as if I wasn't already naturally shy before, I bet no one knows the feeling of when people ask "Why do you have so many zits on your face?" many times throughout the week . Or when you live in a family of clear skinned people. Honestly I'm ready to explode when the next person asks that. I have a short temper but I have enough will power to control it but it's come to the point where I'm ready to keep a list of who says such things, blow their brains off, and then take my own life. I don't want to die with acne so I want to throw a harsh chemical that will burn away all my skin.
