I sacrificed so much for help for all of it to fail of course. I cant handle it.I swear to god I feel like my counselor is the scummiest fuck in the world. The help ive worked for so hard to get this and you to finally help me and you just offer me some pills that of course I cant have because my mom ruined that for me too and tell me hes just here to help me build healthy relationships. Like you do realize I just see you like once every two weeks staying in this apartment 24/7. How the fuck do i build relationships if I never had any.


I dont even know. I just dont understand what I did to deserve all this. I just want a friend. I dont want to have to hide everything just to make my moms life easier cause she knows very fucking well how neglected I am. I am so done. Everything is falling apart. I cant even feel anything anymore.

Why does this have to happen to me. Ive waited for years to leave this fucking place and you act like its the easiest thing in the world. You tossed me in this shit and I had to figure out EVERYTHING. Why are you so surprised this wouldn't have lasting fucking damage.
