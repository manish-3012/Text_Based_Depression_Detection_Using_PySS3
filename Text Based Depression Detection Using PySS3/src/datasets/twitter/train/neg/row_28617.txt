SuicidalI'm at the hospital, having been admitted to the Psychiatrie of my own free will. Yet I keep feeling really awful, maybe even worse. Of course I have only been here for a few days, but it's all becoming too much already. 
I can't stop thinking about slashing my wrists in my bathroom at my room and just bleed out before they check on me. It has been occupying my mind 24/7 since I arrived here. I know i should tell them... but. I don't want to.
