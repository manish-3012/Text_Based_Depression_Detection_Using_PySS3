I feel so lost and hopelessFirst off, sorry for the throwaway account and mobile format etc. But mainly sorry for how disjointed and self pitying this will probably be.

I have diagnosed Bipolar2 and have basically spend all of my time destroying my life, and those of the people around me. I don't want to take my meds now and I just don't want to exist anymore.

I have 2 young children (5&amp;2) who I love to bits, but I just can't go on wrecking their lives by being me. I've tried so fucking hard but nothing i do is ever good enough (no one has said that, but i just know I'm a complete failure). 

I hurt people, I let them like me and then i do something wrong and fuck everything up. Repeatedly. 

I want to disappear forever but I can't find a way to do it without worrying i might cause the kids and my partner pain. I already cause them pain by being me, so logic says I'm just taking future pain away by removing me from the scenario. 

Quite honestly I don't want to be safe or happy anymore but I dont know how to do any of this without potentially affecting the others. People seem to care about me, and I can't understand why. I just want to stop life now please.
