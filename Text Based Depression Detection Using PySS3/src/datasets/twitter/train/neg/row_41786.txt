I'm Going to Die 

My life is some cruel joke. Really it is. Itâ€™s like I keep getting everything proved to me over and over again. Iâ€™m constantly rejected. Itâ€™s fucking amazing! /s. Whatâ€™s so wrong with me? Seriously, there must be something seriously wrong with me. I constantly keep getting rejected. I just want to be accepted but I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s ever going to happen. Iâ€™m constantly hurt. Constantly. Everyone that I care about eventually hurts me one way or another. Eventually. They all do. Every. Single. Last. One.

Happiness is something Iâ€™m locked away from. Iâ€™m never going to get that. Ever. It genuinely hurts. 

I never asked for this. I mean who the fuck does? I canâ€™t believe I thought people cared. They donâ€™t. Itâ€™s extremely simple. Itâ€™s not hard to understand. Iâ€™m just kinda dumb. My dumbass really thought people cared.

I'm going to an Open-mic, get some good food, and then kill myself. Within a week or two, I don't think I'll be here anymore. I already have a pretty sure fire method. I would write a letter, but no one would care, haha. It's so sad it's funny.
