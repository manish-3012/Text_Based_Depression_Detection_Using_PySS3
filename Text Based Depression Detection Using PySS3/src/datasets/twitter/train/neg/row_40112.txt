I couldnâ€™t do it, and I donâ€™t know why.I was going to go a park at night and cut myself. You know, somewhere secluded and quiet. But I got there and sat down and for someone reason couldnâ€™t do it. Now I feel like a coward and an idiot, because despite really not wanting to be here anymore, Iâ€™m too scared to be in pain.
