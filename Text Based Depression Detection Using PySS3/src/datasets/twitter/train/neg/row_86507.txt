I shouldn't even be here in the first place.I'm just looking for a way out. There is no "getting better" for me. I can't kill myself because of how awkward my funeral will be. I was born in the wrong family and in the wrong area. There is nothing to be happy about, I've tried everything. I'm just waiting for someone to kill me. Like I said, I was a complete mistake. My dumb bitch of a mom already had about 15 births before me and I'm a disaster. The only thing that excites me is bullying people online.
