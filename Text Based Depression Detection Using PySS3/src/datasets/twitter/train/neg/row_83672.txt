When will this endI've been depressed lately. Work is the only thing keeping my thoughts in line. When I'm home alone, the thoughts get dark and even when I try to cheer myself up, it never works.

I play guitar, I game sometimes, I explore the areas behind my house and a few more things, but I just can't seem to be happy at the moment.

Over the weekend, I tried to take my own life and since then, it's been drinking nonstop until today and the depression kicked in. Right now, I'm trying to find a purpose to keep on going. My life just isn't going well for me.
