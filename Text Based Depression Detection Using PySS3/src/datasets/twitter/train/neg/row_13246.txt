I donâ€™t know how I got hereI have been incredibly depressed since I was maybe 8 years old. Body image issues, self esteem issues, suicide in the family, alcoholic father, etc. I have gone to therapy, DBT, and have tried tons of meds and to be honest I was still hopeful up until last year that something would work. 

I am so tired of people telling me how much I have to be thankful for. I graduated college, have my dream job, wonderful dogs, a nice house, but nothing can fill the hole inside me that has been growing. I know I should be happy. I know Iâ€™m a selfish dick for being depressed. But my mind doesnâ€™t listen to logic when it starts thinking about suicide. 

Lately, Iâ€™ve been stabbing into my thighs and stomach with exactly knives, and burning myself with lighters daily. Itâ€™s the only thing that I can think about anymore. Today I woke up and immediately downed a handful of xanax and hurt myself.  All that is on my mind is going into my garage and hanging myself. No more pain, no more having to deal with my guilt, just nothing. But I canâ€™t do it to my family. 

Iâ€™m stuck in a place where I know Iâ€™m sick and need help, but my mind canâ€™t stop the impulse to self harm or create suicide scenarios. 

This post doesnâ€™t mean anything either. Itâ€™s just to get these thoughts out.
