I think I'm going to kill myself tonightI've been thinking about this for a long time and struggled to land on a method. I choked myself with a rope the other night and felt myself start to black out. It wasn't painful and didn't take that long so I think that's how I'm going to do it. I wasn't trying to hang myself before, just testing the waters I guess. There's a party tonight that I'm going to go to, hopefully get drunk and then I'll do it when I come home. I don't know why I'm posting this. Either some part of me is still trying to fight it or maybe I just want to leave something behind to say goodbye.. I'm not sure.
