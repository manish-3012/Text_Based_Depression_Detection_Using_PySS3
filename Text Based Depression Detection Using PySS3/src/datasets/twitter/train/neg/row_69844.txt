I've had casual suicidal thoughts since I was about 10 years old. I know all about everyone that can help me, I have no void in my life that is a source of this. I've had many girlfriends, I'm close with my parents and friends, i just can't shake it. Tell me about yourself. Fill me in.i think just hearing about other people might help?
