It's my ex-boyfriend's birthday and I don't want to be alive.Today my ex turns eighteen. He is in a new relationship with the girl he left me for and seems super happy. I on the other hand have just been in a downward spiral since we broke up and I have been increasingly depressed and anxious. I think I want to die today.
