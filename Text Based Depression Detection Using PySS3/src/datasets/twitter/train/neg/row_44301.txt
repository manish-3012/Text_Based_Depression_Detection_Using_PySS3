Depression has ruined my lifeI don't know what I expect to happen by posting here, but I thought I'd at least give it a shot since I have no one else to say this to. For the past 3 years, I've been severely depressed. I like to believe it's for a combination of 3 things that cause it: I'm not good at anything, I have no friends, and I have no girlfriend or any chance at love. My main focus for most of my life has been to find something that I'm good at and enjoy. The main problem I have with this though is that I have a bit of a learning disability. It takes me much longer (if at all) to aquire skills that should be easy for most. Recently, I tried to get back into competitive Super Smash Bros Melee (which I've played on and off for the past 2 years), only to fail to improve at all once again. Also recently, my friends left me because of my depression. I was hoping I could make friends through Melee, but it seems people only care about you if you're good at the game. It's gotten to the point where I no longer care about trying to stay alive. I'm not actively trying to kill myself, but I've certainly stopped making choices that would prolong my life. I want to magically turn my life around, but I don't see that ever happening. I just thought I'd post this here, I don't think anyone can help me at this point though.
