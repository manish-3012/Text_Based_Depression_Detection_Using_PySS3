Middle-aged loser tired of living...I've spent the majority of my life as a hermit because of my dumb ass parents. Now I'm older(mid 30s)and realize that my life has passed me by. I have a seemingly permanent trash personality, awkward and passive. I've made a little improvement but I should be way better off at my age. Been thinking of buying a gun and ending it all.


Sorry if this is whiny I just had to get this out. I hate myself so much.
