All I've ever wanted to do is change the worldI'm a 15 year old trans boy. And like the title says, all I've ever wanted to do is change the world. I've always had this stupid idea that I would revive the punk style from the 70s and teach people to love each other and all that shit, and do that through music. But I know I can never do that, even a little bit. Because how could I if all I ever want to do is die, all I ever do is sleep. And no one would ever appreciate the kind of music I like, meaning no one would ever join a band with me, and even if I managed that, I would probably annoy everybody with my social ineptness, and they would annoy me being annoying shallow gen zs. And I'm so ugly that I have no buisness being a performer anyway, no one wants to see my ugly face moving around on a stage. And also what kind of idiot do i have to be to want to be a vocalist when I have voice dysphoria. So I guess you can all see how stuck I am in my life by my stupid rant, and you can probably tell what an annoying piece of shit I am. Trust me I feel like an idiot all day everyday so there's not much reason to confirm that for me, unless you want to, in which case I don't care, say what you will.
