I've lost everything.I've lost everything. My mother passed away when I was very young from cervical cancer. My father just passed away 4 months ago. My ex-fiance of 6 years and I were going to get married this month. But she cheated on me, and kicked me out of the house. Shortly before this, I was laid off from work. We lost a contract of over 8000 products and they had a mass lay off of over 300 employees. I'm currently homeless. I have my car, my laptop, and just over $60 in my bank account. I've been sitting outside of McDonalds for nearly 3 days sapping their wifi and periodically going in to charge my laptop. I've been here enough to know the employees on a first name basis. Most of them give me a drink here and there. But I have no idea where to go from here. My siblings are across the country, and no other family. I have no friends, I was in a bad crowd in my later years of highschool, and I know if I contact some of my old friends I'll quickly go back into bad habits I had before. I've thought of many ways to end it, and I'm quite seriously debating it. I've been thinking on my last bit of money, fill the tank and just floor it into a tree. I can't see any other way out. I'm severely depressed, and I have no one else to turn to. I'm not one to spout about my feelings, but I really needed someone to hear me out. Just to get all of this off my chest. I'm not sure if tonight will be the night, but the thought of being inside of nothingness, eternal darkness, no thought, no harm, and all alone; has become rather inviting.
