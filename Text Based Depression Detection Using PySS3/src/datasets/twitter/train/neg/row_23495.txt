I feel like If I don't get into a good school that might be itI have been very not well the past 5 or 6 years, constantly on and off this sub, on and off meds and through some of the hardest nights of my life, especially within the past 2 years. 

I have grad school admissions coming up in the next semester. I will get back the decisions sometime next spring, and honestly I don't know if I can keep going if those don't go as planned. 

I have 3 relatable majors from a good public school, good research experience, I think some good letters of recomendation, but my grades leave something to be desired and thats the one thing I can't change. 

My grades aren't awful, nothing below a B, but not many A's in there. I tried my best too, which in my mind makes things worse. I have lost all direction in my life over the past 4 or 5 years, the only thing keeping me grounded and turning was school, and I have no idea what I will do if I don't have that after my undergraduate is done
