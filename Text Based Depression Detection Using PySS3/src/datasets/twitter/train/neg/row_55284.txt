I don't want to dieI don't know if this is the right place to post this, and if it isn't, please let me know where would be more appropriate.
I don't want to die. I don't even want to stop living. And I've been there before, I was there for a long time.  
I have a generally good life, I've worked hard to be comfortable and happy. I have a bright future, fulfilling hobbies, good relationships, a wonderful husband. The thought of ceasing to live, of causing pain to my loved ones, of dying.. really upsets me and makes me sad and anxious.    
But sometimes I just want to stand on a ledge and look down. I don't want to jump.. but I want to peer over that edge. I don't know why. I almost.. fantasize about it. I don't believe I'm a danger to myself, at least not at this point, but these feelings seem really weird and confusing. Has anyone else experienced this? Why do I have these thoughts?
