I never had a 'real' friendI never had those friends that you can trust, and talk about anything you want.

When I was in elementary school I had a small group friends, but it was just have fun and play video games, childhood friends. But it makes me sad that I never had more than that

Today I can just remember those times all alone in shame because I wasted the opportunity of keeping those friends around and now I don't have anyone who cares.

Maybe I am ungrateful?
