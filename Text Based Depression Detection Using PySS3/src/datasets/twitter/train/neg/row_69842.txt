Iâ€™m sorryI canâ€™t do this anymore I really really want to do it. Iâ€™m so tired of all my eating disordered eating habits, my lack of self love and super low self esteem. Why does it matter to me so damn much? I hate myself so much that I want to kms. I donâ€™t do it because I donâ€™t want to hurt others, but then again I canâ€™t be suffering with my head everyday. Iâ€™m exhausted.
