Here again.I donâ€™t want to end my life but I feel like I have no other choice. Iâ€™m a lazy person who refuses to help myself get better. I keep telling myself on my days off from work Iâ€™ll start working out or go for a walk or just do anything other than lay down a feel sorry for myself but I end up laying down a feeling sorry for myself no matter what. I donâ€™t see much joy in getting a full time job and working majority of my life away in said job just to go home and lay down on my time off. I want to be happy I want to be better but no matter how much I want something the need for me to lay down and do nothing always wins. Why should I waste my life away like this when I could just end it no and save everyone time.
