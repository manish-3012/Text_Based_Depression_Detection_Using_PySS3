Nothing seems like progressSo I'm 18 years old, work full time, go to college part time, and pay all my own bills, but I don't have any friends, and every night I lay down and cry because of what I've lost. And what I should have. I remember trying to commit suicide when I was in early middle school because my mom was diagnosed with cancer, I didn't know how to handle it but it made me the head of the house. I helped my mom raise my autistic little brother and I left him with and abusive step father, and a mom who doesn't feed him. I tried again when I was 17 and actually should have died, my fiance ( yes I was that couple ) told me I didn't have the balls to do it, so I swallowed 3 handfuls of ibuprofen. And now tonight, with her out of the picture my only true friend, albiet someone im romantically interested in, told me I'm nothing and that I'm not going anywhere. I just don't know how I'm supposed to go on alone when it seems like everyone else has someone. My ex has my best friend. All of my other highschool friends have each other and they all just left me rot. And have encouraged me to kill myself multiple times. Thank you for your time, and sorry about the formatting( on mobile)
