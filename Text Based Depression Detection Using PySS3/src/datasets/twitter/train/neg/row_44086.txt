Anxiety controls me and I can't get over anythingI always have the same old regrets and stupid things that I've done going through my head and nothing will make them go away. Sometimes I think that dying will be the only way to make it stop. There is nothing to look forward to and everything in the past just fills me with sadness, anger, or guilt. I'm so sick of it.
