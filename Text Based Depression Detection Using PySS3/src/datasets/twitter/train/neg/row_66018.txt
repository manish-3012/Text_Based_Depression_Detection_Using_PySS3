Iâ€™m hellishly alone.Iâ€™m not lonely, I am alone. Been on my own since childhood (lived with extremely, graphically abusive parents) and ran away at 16, faced lots of homelessness and being used by people. The loneliness is a killer. Some kind of companionship is needed. To the point Iâ€™m looking for someone to commit suicide with. 
How do people successfully kill themselves? I heard if you take mushrooms you can easily jump off a building at peace. Is this true? Would I still want to jump when Iâ€™m on mushrooms? I just want a way to peace.
