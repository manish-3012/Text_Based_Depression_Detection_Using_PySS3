My suicidal thoughts are completely debilitating18 year old female here. I recently moved out of my parents house and I'm living in a shitty basement apartment. I'm late on rent and two months behind on my car payments. I had this big dream of being a full time student but because of my finances i dropped all but one class. I quit my shitty full time job that I only had for 2 weeks and I have about 6 dollars in my bank account. I'm terrified that I'm just going to end up in another shitty full time office job, spending hours everyday doing something I hate; waiting for the day to end only to repeat the same cycle the next day. I'm horrified that I'll never meet someone who can stand to be around me. I feel absolutely hopeless and convinced that my bad work ethic and depression will always keep me from achieving my goal of becoming a journalist. I'm scared that I won't be able to stop myself from ending it all tonight. Please... I don't know what to do.
