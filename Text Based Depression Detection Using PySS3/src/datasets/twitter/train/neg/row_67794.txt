I don't know what to do, I don't know if I care.More than ever, I want to die. More than ever, I feel so separate from myself and I can't enjoy anything at all or distract myself from that fact. I just don't know why I've even bothered going this far, and I've started doing things that are against my morals, and I find that I just don't care. I've gotten to the point where I care less and less every day what the impact of me going missing or killing myself will do to people. I can't get it out of my head that I know people will be able to move on, and that it will never be a good time. I don't even know what I'm looking for here. I have tried counselling, I have tried finding hobbies and developing patterns and habits, I have tried getting myself healthy by going to the gym and eating well, I have tried music and writing as outlets, I have tried reaching out to family- some of whom have dismissed me, and therefore those I feel bad for when I do go, I have tried reaching out to friends- many of whom understand or try to. I really have tried everything I can think. "Wait until tomorrow" has lost its appeal, "things can/will get better" doesn't mean anything. I don't know.
