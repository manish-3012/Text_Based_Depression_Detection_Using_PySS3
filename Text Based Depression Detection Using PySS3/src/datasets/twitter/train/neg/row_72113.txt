Irrational thinkingSometimes I get thoughts like "Life is just a game and when you realise in it's a game you can kill yourself and the older you are when you do it the in lower your score on the game is. If you die of natural causes you get zero. What if my real family outside the game is just waiting for me to figure out that it's a game so that I'll kill myself and join them and they'll laugh at how long it took me. The longer I wait to do it the dumber I'll appear."

Most days I know this isn't real but every now and again these thoughts will feel super real and logical.

What is this called? What do I do if I can't always figure out which thoughts make really "sense" when they feel very convincing
