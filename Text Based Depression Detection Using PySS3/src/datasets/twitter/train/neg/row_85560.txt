Iâ€™m leavingI have decided to go through with my plan. Iâ€™ve thought about it and really thereâ€™s no reason for me to be here anymore. I canâ€™t make my boyfriend happy, Iâ€™m useless in every situation, and Iâ€™m the biggest disappointment. So Iâ€™m ending it all then everyone would be happier and so would I. Recently my S/O has been going through something and I havenâ€™t been able to help him. I have been being selfish by telling him not to end it all when in reality I wanted to do it myself. So Iâ€™m going to. I guess this is my goodbye to the world.
