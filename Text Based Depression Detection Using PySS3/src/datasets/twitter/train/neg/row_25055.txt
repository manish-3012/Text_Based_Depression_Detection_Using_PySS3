I hope my neck breaks on impact and I dieIâ€™m going to jump off of a bridge next semester. Hopefully I will destroy enough bones and organs in my body to the point where I will die instantly. 

There are others who were robbed of their lives at a very early age. Some of them actually had the desire to live longer. I wish I could trade places with them. 

I donâ€™t deserve to be alive. I am a lazy waste of human existence that wants to do absolutely nothing with their life.
