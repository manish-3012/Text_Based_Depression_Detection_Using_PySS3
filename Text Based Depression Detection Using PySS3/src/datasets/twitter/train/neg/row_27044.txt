Hopeless and NumbI no longer feel anything any more. I no longer enjoy things or look forward to anything. I am at that point where all im doing is going thru the motions. 
No matter how i try to fix the problem it always goes bad and i end up worse off than i was to start with. I no longer care about living and pray for death ever night. I know it is only a matter of time before I make an attempt on my life again. DEATH IS MY ONLY ESCAPE...
