I didn't have a choice of whether I wanted to live on this Earth. Why can't I leave on my own terms?UNFAIR. it is unfair that I am forced to live a life that I do not want. That I had to go through so much pain and trauma, JUST BECAUSE. Why is suicide frowned upon when they don't even understand how it is to feel like you're living in someone else's body?
