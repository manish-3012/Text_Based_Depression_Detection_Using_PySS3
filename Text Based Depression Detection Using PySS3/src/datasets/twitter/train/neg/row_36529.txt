So many reasonsThere are a lot of reasons why I consistently consider offing myself.

Depression is one, for sure. I was diagnosed at 18, but I'm sure it started at 14. Or maybe it started sooner. Maybe it started growing at age 6, when I was raped. Maybe it started when my parents started pressuring me to a point where I thought I would never be good enough. It doesn't matter. It's an ugly black mark on my mind that slowly eats away at it.

Another reason is lack of escape. I have nothing to distract me from how awful I feel. Video games, reading, TV, porn. I just...sigh and give up on them. Like 'What's the point in playing this game if it doesn't make me happy like it used to?' 'Why bother watching porn when I'll never experience real sex?' 'I used to love to read, but now I'm so retarded it just doesn't hold my attention anymore.'

Then there's the loneliness. The isolation. In high school, I had friends I saw often. I could hang out with people. Be around them. I had a few relationships, even. Now, it's just a lot of first dates with no second dates in sight, trying to get interest on dating sites to no avail, and just...feeling like I'm never gonna feel loved again. Like I had my shot, and I fucked it.

I also feel like I won't be able to...make it own my own. I have to move out this year. I have to try to find someplace else with more people. Find friends. Find relationships. Live on my own. Try to go to school.

But...what if I can't? What if I fuck it all up? What if I lose all my money? What if I go to school and fail? What if I don't make those friends I so desperately need?

All of this leads me to consider killing myself before it gets worse. I already feel like I can't be happy anymore, so what's the point in going on?

But...I can't ever bring myself to do it and I don't know why.
