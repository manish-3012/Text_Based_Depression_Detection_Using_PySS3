I always end up here.Whether to actually post or just think about posting. Suicidal thoughts are becoming more and more intrusive with every day and I don't know how to tell anybody around me. My emotions are all over the place and I just want to feel grounded but my SO has his own shit to deal with and most of the time hugging me seems to bother him. I could use a hug. Or five. Just comfort. I know I'm an attention whore. I know I require a lot of comfort, but he's the opposite and it's killing me. I don't feel comfortable ever. Nightmares of PTSD flashbacks and just nightmares of how lost I am inhibit a lot of sleep lately. I feel so hopeless. I don't have enough motivation, enough money, enough love, enough time to feel like going on is worth it very much. Every day is so fucking hard to get through but I can't exactly ask for or give myself applause just for making it to class and work today. Nobody gives a shit. Why should I?
