I didn't get into Cambridge for postgraduate, feeling suicidalIt's not just the "not getting into Cambridge." It's not getting into anything. On paper I'm doing well. I've got publications, a good undergraduate degree and everything to my name. But in interviews (for jobs and graduate places)  I'm extremely socially anxious, I go into autopilot. I suffer from existential depression, so I'm not sure why I get anxious. I shouldn't care about anything, but my body goes into fight or flight mode. 

This rejection came after a whole string of rejections. I feel worthless. I feel like I can't expose the real me or people will see what I'm made of. I feel empty. I feel like I have zero presence. When with new people, I feel like eyes are on me as if I have a learning disability or some social awkwardness. I search myself for it and can't modify my behaviour. I don't know what to do to go on.

My anxiety is also crippling. My favourite thing is reading. I can't do it at the moment as my mind races ahead. 

I would turn myself off now if it didn't hurt.
