Yup, the time has come.My family has just told me that I am a piece of shit. Won't get anything accomplished, haven't gotten anything accomplished because I am too screwed up. That was my greatest fear. I am currently in a depressive episode too.

I have the means. I am in the process. I wrote my note. It is a reset button. Spirit will take me into another life. I met my dog who passed earlier this year in a dream this week, and he told me that he will be there (communicated via thoughts). It was definitely a visitation and so vivid. Maybe the spirit realm knew this was coming and my time was up. I have been so physically tired and no one takes me seriously. Mysterious rashes, infections. No one cares. Hopefully if I go, they will finally find out what is wrong. 

And if I go all in and fail, they will be angry/beat me and not give a shit, lecture me, and it will be even more confirmation that I am too screwed up for them to deal with. I am 23, and about to go back to college. But I don't even care. No one else cares. I am lonely. No one fucking loves me. Objectively. This month has been hell and it is almost like the universe is giving me signs not to continue. 

Hopefully I take the rest and don't pussy out.
