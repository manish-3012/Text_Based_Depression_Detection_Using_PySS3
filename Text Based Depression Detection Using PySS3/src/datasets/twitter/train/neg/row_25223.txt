I feel the abyss closing inI failed college one semester a few years ago and took some time off, sporadically taking classes in the summer time while working and living with my folks.  I went back full time this past semester as a senior and failed again, because I am stuck in a major I hate and am too far along to switch/not mature enough to tough it out.  I've been notified by the school that I cannot attend for 2 years because of my performance, and my housing has dropped me since I no longer am enrolled.  My girlfriend, who I've been together with for over 4 years, is the one thing I care most about and the main reason I can feel afloat sometimes, but she has her own issues and is going back to her home country in the next few weeks for an unforeseeable amount of time.  I've burned up my parent's trust, and I don't blame them - I'm 24 with no degree and no prospects, and I can't keep living at home with them.  I'm about to be homeless and the fact that my girlfriend is going back to her country and won't be coming back to finish college here in the states any time soon makes me feel like giving up completely on love and life. I have no money, and I've burned through bridges with old friends and don't want to hold my hand out to them, and even if I did have money and friends, I have no will to keep struggling through life on my current path because I am uninspired and keep hitting roadblocks.  I feel like I wasn't made for this world, that I am not comprised of the same "stuff" that keeps other people chugging along through the mundane aspects of day to day life.  I want to off myself, but I just worry about breaking my girlfriend and my parents.  My girlfriend has had some suicidal thoughts of her own recently, and I don't want to push her over the edge.  I've been holding this all in for months now, so I guess I just needed a place to vent.  If you made it this far, thanks for for reading.
