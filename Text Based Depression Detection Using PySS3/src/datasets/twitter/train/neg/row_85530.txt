acceptancesomeone told me that I just have to accept that I have depression and that I cant really do anything about it, and accept that someday things will change for the better. They told me that if I say things like "i know im gonna kms sooner or later" or "I give myself til next month til I kms" or something along those lines that I already admitted defeat. They said they'd rather live to see things change than die sad.
