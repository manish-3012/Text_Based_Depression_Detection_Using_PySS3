I'm 13 and life's already beat me to the ground.I can't go on anymore. I can't deal with my mom's psychological torture. The thing is, she thinks her behavior is completely reasonable, so I can't get her to understand what she's doing. It's the same with my sister and father, but my father recognizes my mom/sis's behavior as strange, just not his own. My poor little brother is already a narcissist in training. The reason I'm posting here instead of r/raisedbynarcissists is because I've been having suicidal thoughts since I was 11 that have gotten progressively worse over the years. It's gotten to the point where death is the only thing on my mind and I can't concentrate. I've tried every possible creative outlet that you could think of. Drawing, sewing, journaling, all of that. I am an optomist and am happy a lot of my time ourside my house, but there's constantly this gaping wound in my chest that can't let me fully enjoy anything. Sorry for the long rant. I just can't "hold on" anymore.
