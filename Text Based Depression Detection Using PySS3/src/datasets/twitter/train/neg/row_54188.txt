Almost 36 hours after an attempt, not sure where to get help.sorry if this is not suitable for this sub, but 36 hours ago i tried to kill myself with 10 x 500mg of Paracetamol + Parabrom (?) pills. right now i feel so lightheaded and giddy, and really nauseous. i've been to the doctor, i was too nervous to tell her i OD'd so i told her i took a lot of panadol tablets ("about 10") because i was sick. she didn't care and our consultation lasted for like less than a minute. 

what can i do now? is the nausea related. i've been googling and idk. thank you for helping each and everyone of us. :)
