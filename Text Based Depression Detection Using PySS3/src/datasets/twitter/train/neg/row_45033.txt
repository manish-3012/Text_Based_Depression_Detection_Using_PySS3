Am I suicidalI have always feared the death of my parents. I have also always been an intense day dreamer, extremely vivid... I could live in the day dreams I create. Anyways recently in light of COVID, I have been especially worrisome that my parents will die or in general that my entire family (one brother) will die or be killed off or something where I am left all alone. In my day dreams tho I can physically feel the pain of losing these people and it overwhelms me to the point that I always resolve that I would commit suicide if something ever happened to my entire family. I have GAD/Depression/BPD but have been feeling okay recently thanks to mood stabilizers. But sometimes I genuinely enjoy reliving these day dreams and have been wondering if I am fetishizing my death or something. I don't think people think about death as often as I do, it's honestly so normal to me.
