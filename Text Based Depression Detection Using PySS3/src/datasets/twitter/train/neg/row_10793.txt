I am unwantedI do not feel like I belong anywhere. Every day I am miserable and lonely. I keep crying, I barely eat, I never want to get out of bed. I have no motivation at all. I know I will probably never find happiness in this life. I am sick of being autistic, different, I'm a virgin at 21, I am sick of feeling like I'm missing out on everything, I am so tired of this shit. All I have ever wanted was a normal life. I just wish I could dream forever, I hate this life. Without love
And connections with people I just don't see the point. I am bitter and I am angry. I got a shitty hand of cards, my life was over from the fucking start.
