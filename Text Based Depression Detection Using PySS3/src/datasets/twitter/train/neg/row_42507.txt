Messed up my part of the group project and I feel like I'd rather die than finish this course or face my group members againI fucking hate group projects. At least if I fuck up on my own it's just me who's going to be upset. No intentions on dropping the course because it'll show up as a fail on my transcript. This is also my final year so I'd rather not take any longer to get the fuck away from school.

At the same time I have 0 self-esteem and I almost entirely hate myself as a person so realizing that I was the weakest link in the group despite putting in the effort has me struggling to cope with the fact I have to do one more project with this group before the end of the semester. I wish I could just fall off the face of the earth and stop existing, but I guess I'm too scared to do that myself. I'm just so tired of feeling like I fuck up everything I fucking touch. I don't know how much more of this I can take.
