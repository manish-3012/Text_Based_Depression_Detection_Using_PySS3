I feel i am close to death nowThings are not turning up for me. Each passing day is difficult. Last week I made a list of things to sort out before i die. Few days back tried a home made rope on my throat. I feel i am getting closer to death now. I cannot handle this anymore. Hanging on a very thin hope here. But chances are it will snap anytime soon. I am scared, I am ashamed, I feel bad, I feel the guilt...i feel it all yet it feels like I am prepared if this is meant to happen.
