I don't know how much longer I can hang onI started a therapy program in October and got on meds and a therapist and all. But now I'm nosediving again. I can't stop thinking about death. I watch videos of people dying and take comfort in how their suffering is over. I don't want to die. I have an SO who loves me, at least I think so. Sometimes I think I love him more than he loves me. My friends won't text me back or hang out with me. They don't know I'm like this. I'm worthless. I just got my first fulltime job and I just can't do it. I struggle every day with depression because of it. I'm such a fucking baby. Everybody has to work so I shouldn't complain. I know that. But I still feel like my life is over. If I can't do this, how will I make it the rest of my life? Something has to give.
