I (29f) have nothing going on in life.Hi everyone, I am truly at the lowest point in my life. I see everyone living amazing lives around me (getting married, great jobs, traveling, having kids) and I am honestly a loser. I am ugly, live at home, do not date, barely leave the house (only for work). I cannot do it another day. I cry a lot, barely sleep, and am sad most of the time. It no way to live.
