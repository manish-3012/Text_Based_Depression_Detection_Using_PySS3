I want to explain it all, but I know no one will read. it comes down to basic logic and science now, I disappeared for years, and no one would even know if I did end itidk why I cant connect, is it autism? nothing I've tried ever works, why am I so broken? no one will miss me, no one relies on me, I'm in no ones life. and now people who dont know me even hate me. if every day is painful, why exist?
