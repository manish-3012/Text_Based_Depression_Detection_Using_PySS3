I wish I was never born.I'm too lazy to make another throwaway so I'll be deleting this soon. I just really need to get something off my chest.

I wish I was never born. I can't kill myself because I care about a lot of people and I don't want them to be hurt, but I want to. I wish I didn't have to be here in the first place.

It feels like a lot of people would be objectively better off if they'd never met me. It's like I leave a path of destruction and I just drag people down. Like yeah they care about me now that they know me, but what if they never met me? What if I never existed? All the awful things that I've directly or indirectly caused would have never happened.

I've been fighting with my boyfriend. There's a lot of stress in our lives. Fighting with him is hard because I care about him so much.  If I was never born, we would have never met, and he wouldn't have to care about me or have me get frustrated at him.

I'm so happy I know so many good people, but I'm sad at the same time. Even though I feel very sad and alone, I still know they care about me and they'd be hurt if I died. That is good because I have people I love and care about, but I feel bad about it because I am feeling a lot of hurt and have to deal with having daily suicidal thoughts and I can't end this. Bad things keep happening to me, old memories keep haunting me, and I just want to find PEACE.
