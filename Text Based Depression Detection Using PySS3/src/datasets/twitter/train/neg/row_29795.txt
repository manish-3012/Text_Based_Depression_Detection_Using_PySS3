my worries about the afterlifewhat if this is hell. i've been living in one constant severe dissociation episode for the past 4 years and i dont think any of this is real. life isn't real it's all just fake. what's the point in living if it's all a lie. i'm 17 and i've already had multiple suicide attempts but all failed because i'm too scared that if i fully commit and die, nothing will change. i feel that i already died. i'm miserable and alone and im giving up. i feel like we are living in hell because every day of mine is a nightmare and maybe that's why they say the good people die early because if there is a real life or a heaven, that's where they go.
