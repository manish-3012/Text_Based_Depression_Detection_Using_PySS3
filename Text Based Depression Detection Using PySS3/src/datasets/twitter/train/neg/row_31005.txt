Question for anyone.....This week Iâ€™ve been feeling better and sort of getting back to my old self ( fingers crossed) . Yet Iâ€™ve been really fascinated with death lately and I have no idea why. Iâ€™ve just been watching YouTube videos about graveyards and such , plus wondering what happens afterwards . Has anyone else been like this here ?
