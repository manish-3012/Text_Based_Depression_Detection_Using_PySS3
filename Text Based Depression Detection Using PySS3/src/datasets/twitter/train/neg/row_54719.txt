I think i overdosed but idk what to do (16f)I took 12/13 co-codamol (8/500mg) and my arms are really aching and I've gone dizzy. I don't know if im just being paranoid or something but it's 1am for me and my mother is asleep so i don't want to wake her and im too afraid to tell her plus at 9am i have a very important exam and if i went to the hospital I'd miss it and i don't know what to do right now. Will i be okay if i stay at home?
