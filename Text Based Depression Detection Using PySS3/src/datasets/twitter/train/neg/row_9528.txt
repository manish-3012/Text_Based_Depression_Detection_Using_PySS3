Tomorrow is my birthday and hoping i am able to make it my deathday also.Nothing new to add that hasn't been heard a million times before. Just need to go buy the stuff I need (I've got the money to afford it now!) and stroll off this mortal coil.

This pain isn't going to end itself. 39 years has proven that.

Hopefully I'm not so damn depressed that it keeps me from leaving the house, and I can still fake being happy long enough to do my shopping.
