Not strong enoughThe want to kill myself is there. Its always been there. Lately its always there. After everything that's happening in my life right now its constantly there coupled with heartbreak and hope of something good but the thoughts still win. No distractions. No music no hobbies. Nothing to derail the thoughts of ending it all. The only thing is the two people in my life that are everything to me. Theyre the only ones stopping me from finding the strength to kill myself. Because I can't stand the thought of breaking them, more than I have already. I can't stand the thought of them never being okay with me gone. They depend on me just as I depend on them. And I can't stand them living with the knowledge of me gone. I can't find it In me to put them through that. But God I wish I wasn't here. I wish it would all just stop. I dont want to be here anymore. I don't care for myself and haven't for a long time. Its all because of them that I stay though. They're not toxic people they're very loving and caring and supportive but im such a peice of shit. Im not okay. Please somebody show me what to do. Cause I don't know anymore.
