Canâ€™t sleep, ramblingI donâ€™t think I will ever be able to provide a life for my lifeless children like the one my family provided for me. I donâ€™t think the world will be better without me in it, I think my life could be better without the future in it. I donâ€™t want to be posting here. I want a better life for myself and my friends and my partner but Iâ€™m trapped now, riddled with inertia, I donâ€™t have the courage to say so. I could never say this to a person and I can barely say it to myself. I was insulated to the consequences of reality for years, I thought I was different, I always thought it was different when I did it. Thereâ€™s no release anymore. I took but I donâ€™t think I was a thief, I feel like I am now even though I donâ€™t now. I wish I could sleep still, now I only sleep for a couple of hours a night because I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know if this is a suicide post, I donâ€™t know what this is, I could fall asleep before I finish. Itâ€™s fucked. I donâ€™t think I have a future to take from myself anymore, it took me a while to realise that there wasnâ€™t much to it but I donâ€™t feel like a person. I donâ€™t recognise this text as authentic to my experience. Iâ€™ve made a victim out of my life. I feel like Iâ€™ve lived the dream already and I still resented it. I need to be awake in two hours and a further twelve, or eight at least and this will be the case for the foreseeable future or maybe not long at all. They might be putting me in prison but I donâ€™t really think about it that often. I didnâ€™t resent it I loved it and to be free like that again would be like exhumation. I could go for a walk but itâ€™s darker now than it used to be so Iâ€™ll stay here for now. I donâ€™t have access to weaponry to use against myself.
