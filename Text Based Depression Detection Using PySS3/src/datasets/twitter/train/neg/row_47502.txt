everything I own is packed up, I'm readyJust moved into a new apartment, I'm so lonely and I hate my life so much. At this point everyone would be better off if I just jumped off a bridge without unpacking. My family could just swing by and get rid of all my shit without even needing to sort or pack it. I would even settle with spending the rest of my life in solitary confinement in prison just so that I didn't have to bother with money or anything and could just rot away without giving anyone the guilt of thinking they should've tried to help me, but I don't want to hurt anyone enough that I could actually get that sentence. I just want to lie in bed in the dark for the rest of my life but there's no way I could afford that. I just need to end myself.
