what in the fucki fucking despise my depression, why do i have to feel like shit all the time? hobbies don't work, friends are bailing on me because every day i become more of an asshole because i deeply hate every fiber of my existence, holidays seem pointless when i don't look forward to tomorrow

i hate that i want to die, but i hate living, i hate the damn thought of not being here because everything will get better, but the future seems blurry, my train of thought is stuck in dying, all my future plans have stopped, everytime i find myself with my blood on my hands, i find myself crying again because this is not who i am, this is not what i want to be but every path in my life leads to this

i hate that i'm alone, i hate that my family thinks this is a phase when i've been wanting to fucking die ever since i became conscious of my emotions and i was fucking 5 years old! the very few things in my life started withering away and as everything came it started getting quicker until everything stopped, and my family keeps saying it's all in my mind! of course it is, how the fuck do i get it out from there then? my family seems better off without me yet they won't let me fucking leave, so I'm better off doing so on other terms

i hate my friends too, all those fake fucks that never took a second of their day to ask how i was, to let me know they were there, to listen, to even fucking care about anyone but themselves while i tried to give them all the happiness i've never had when they were down and gave them the time i so desperately needed before the clock's ticking started going faster and faster. and honestly, i'm the only one at fault here.

i don't know why the fuck i want to die, i'm utterly terrified of it. but i dread the thought of living the rest of my life like this, however long that is.
