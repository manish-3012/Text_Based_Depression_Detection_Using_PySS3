I'm so lost right nowI've backed myself into a corner and I can't see a way out that doesn't involve my death. I have a long story, but in the intrest of not wasting anyones time, here's the (sort of) TL;DR:

Eight years ago I got busted for dealing/using heroin. After a lengthy (2-3 years) battle with smack, I finally got clean. During my tenure as a junkie, I met a girl (not a drug user), fell in love, and then proceeded to put her and myself and my family through hell as they suffered from my addiction. After finally getting clean, I started to rebuild the shambles that were my life. I managed to hold jobs here and there, but never anything substantial. For awhile, things were looking up: I had a job, was going to school, etc. But then I started drinking and I fucked off school, countless jobs and many golden opportunities. By this time, my GF and I have been together 8 years. We have an apartment together that I have not been able to pay rent on since last month. I've tried my best to find a job, as well as daily promises to pay the back rent of 500$. Nothing has panned out. I'm fucked. I have no family to take me in if I lose my apt. I'll be homeless and my GF will probably leave me. I cannot abide a life like this. I feel it would be better to just end my suffering. I can't fucking believe that my life has come down to 500$. So many people take money, food, and housing for granted...I don't. I want nothing more than to be a productive member of society, but it seems this isn't 'in the cards' for me. I have nowhere to turn. I am lost.

EDIT: To clarify, I quit drinking a few weeks ago. Life still hasn't gotten better.
LAST EDIT: Swallowed sleeping pills, wrote my note, and am now going to "sleep" with a plastic bag over my head. Goodbye.
