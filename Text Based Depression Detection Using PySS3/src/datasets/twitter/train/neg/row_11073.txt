I should have ended my life when my husband ended hisI had a brief window where I could have done it and all the fallout from his death would have intermingled with mine and no one would have been put in any extra pain.

I frequently look back on that time and curse myself for not taking the smart way out. Now it just feels like the amount of pain I would cause would be catastrophic, but I cant live like this anymore.
