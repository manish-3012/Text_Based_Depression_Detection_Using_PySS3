Is this actually real?I try to convince myself that the feelings I feel are simply a passing phase or some kind of "placebo effect" that I placed in order to validate my uselessness as a human being. Yet, urges come more and more to take my own life away. Can a placebo effect go this far or do I have to just admit to the reality that I have a "problem"
