I want to kill myself, but I'm to scared to do itI'm not scared of dying, I'm just worried about my family and what they would do if I did. I've never attempted suicide, but I do cause self harm by scratching my skin until it starts to get red or even bleed. Or just hitting my head against the wall. My family life isn't bad now, except for the yelling. It's my emotions. My sadness has been overwhelming the past year and a half, and quarantine isn't helping. I've been taking depression meds, but they don't work. I've told my mom, but she said I seem fine. But, I've been acting fine around her, so I don't have to take any more medicine than I have to. Sorry for the life story, I just don't know what to do with my miserable life. I just want to die
