How to hurt others as little as possibleHi

I've contemplated ending my life for years. The problem is, I know it's going to hurt many people around me. I'm looking for ways to minimize the harm caused to others. 

My parents are dead but I do have two sisters and a couple of close friends. 

My attachment style is, well, Messed Up, to say the least. Anything but secure. My self-image and identity are in no way cohesive. They're not just fractured, all they are is a pile of slivers of something that could have one day been a coherent human personality. Emotionally, I'm a child. I have BPD with vulnerable narsissistic traits. All I ever want to hear or talk about is myself. I don't genuinely care about anyone elses interests or thoughts.

I really really don't want to put them through the pain of losing someone to suicide, but I'm also not able to live for decades and decades to come (I'm 23 and physically healthy). I've been put in a terrible situation, there are no winning moves, only an impossible one and a deeply destructive, hurtful one.

What can I do? Would it hurt them less if it seemed like I died of an illness rather than suicide? I'm planning on distancing myself from everyone (so I'm not so close to them anymore) in order to make it less painful for them that way.
