Falsely accusedA couple months ago I was accused of rape by a female acquaintance. Iâ€™m a virgin. But, things being the way they are in high school, Iâ€™ve lost basically every friend I ever really trusted. While I was able to convince most of the people who knew about the situation that I was innocent, I still realized I had been doing bad things to my significant others over the years. I feel nothing but guilt over it and Iâ€™ve been trying to make amends however possible but nothing is working. Iâ€™m basically just in isolation now. I donâ€™t think I deserve to live, and feel like my passing might just make a few people feel better. It just fucks me up so bad that people thought I would ever intentionally hurt someone, and it fucks me up even more that I actually did and was just too stupid to see it. I donâ€™t feel like myself anymore and Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll just be this shell forever.
