Is there anybody else starting to get their things in order?Hey guys , i'm just wondering if anybody else has thought about how to leave things , before you leave..

Unfortunatly i had to deal with my mother passing and all that is to that last year and it broke me.

I do not wish that task upon my sister.
So i'm not sure if this post is ok to post here or not , but i feel like if i can maybe start with this (selling all my stuff except the bare essentials , getting a will and so on) I might get a bit of rest from that aswell.

I have already started in one way or another , i don't know is anybody else going this way , instead of in an impuslive way?
