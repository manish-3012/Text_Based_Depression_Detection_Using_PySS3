Life is not fulfilling; no skills; living is a daily choreI have hit the point where the pain of living has become greater than the fear of dying. Death is really enticing. One shotgun blow to the throat and its over. Gone for the rest of eternity. Never have to live a single day again for the rest of eternity. 

I went into a career that is saturated and cant find a job. Im not passionate about it, so it doesnt really matter. I chose it because I didnt know what else to do. I really have no skills. I hate to work a slave low pay job. Its not like if I was hired I would become fulfilled. It would just make it more bearable to not pull the trigger. My 2 cents.
