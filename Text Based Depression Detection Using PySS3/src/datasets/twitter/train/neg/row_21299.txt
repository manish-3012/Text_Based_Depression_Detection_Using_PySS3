Real friends are there when you need them the most.I have realized that if I kill myself today absolutely nobody will notice, absolutely 0 people. I have decided to see if any o my school \*\*friends\*\* that are nothing more then colleagues and a bunch of douchebags will even see that I disappear. I didn't write them any messages for almost 2 weeks and none of them none have reached out to see if everything is ok or if even I am alive.
