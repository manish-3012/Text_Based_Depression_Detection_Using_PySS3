Hey Guys. I hope you are all living a good life unlike me.I used to be a very athletic guy running marathons and going to the gym. 2 years earlier due to a loud exposure to sound i developed a heart condition. But it was just the beginning. Soon I developed OCD and anxiety which was  followed up by extreme stress
I was still in school back then. Once a happy outgoing guy now i battle depression and extreme stress. I do have a lot of family issues too. My father is a dick and does not provide any mental support. My mum called me a mad dog when i opened up about my depression and my sister laughed at me. So No family support. 
I suffer from high blood pressure due to extreme stress i was in and pretty much given up on life.
I have failed to find what i love and i have no purpose in life. I also have a lot of insecurities which lower my self esteem further down. I am living in a hell hole.
I am now thinking that suicide may be the best option for me but I do want to take a last chance to see where I end up in life. If not. I wil be gone.
Please help me in anyway possible.
