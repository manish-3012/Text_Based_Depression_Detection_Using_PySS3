Ah where to beginI honestly cant feel much because of how numb i am. Ive been drinking...again. This is a couple of weeks old but gid my chest hurts. My heart hurts. 
My partners were going to leave together (im polya and my life partner and husband live all together) apparently i wasnt living up to standards and not meeting the qualifications to our reletionships because while thinking everything is fine...its not. They were planning to leave. Even went as far as to plan on snapchat so i wouldnt find out even though i dont go on their phones. Until i was told about the plan to get a Restaining O agaisnt me to remove me from my own apartment that my name is on the lease. (Not legal here) It doesnt make sense. Theyve both apologized. Said theyve seen my progress. 

But nothings right. Nothing feels right anymore. 
I am exhusated. 

I look like a fool for staying. Fuck ive looked like a fool long before now. But this....ive gone to therapy with them theyve seen me work on myself. 
Goddamn them. And fuck me for trusting anyone anymore. 
I sit here and act like everythings fine but god it hurts so bad. I need to delete the messages. The proof of what they did. Maybe i can forget. But i dont think i want to anymore.
