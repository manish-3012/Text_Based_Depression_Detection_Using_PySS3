back againi broke up with my boyfriend. I donâ€™t handle breakups well. It doesnâ€™t help that we literally live together. I donâ€™t handle breakups well at all and now Iâ€™m in physical pain from it and I want to hurt myself so bad I canâ€™t move. I want to be catatonic. I want to be so sedated that my vision is blurry and I canâ€™t hold onto a thought. I want to get hit by a truck. I want to bleed everywhere. I want this to end.
