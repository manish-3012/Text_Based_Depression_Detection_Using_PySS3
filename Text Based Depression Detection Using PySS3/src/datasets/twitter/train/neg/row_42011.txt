Feeling lostI'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, I've never used Reddit before.

I've been thinking about ending it all for a little over a year, not a few days go by that it comes to mind.

I'm 19 years old, I have no friends, no siblings, no pets. I live with my mother, my father left when I was around 7/8 years old. My mother dismisses my feelings, so I've become used to keeping everything inside. I don't know how much longer I can keep going, everything just keeps getting worse for some reason. My mother is physically and verbally abusive to me, it really hurts. I don't have anyone to talk to about my problems anymore, I've lost every friend I've made.

When I was around 6-8 years old I was sexually assaulted multiple times. I can still feel the cold tile floor. When I was 15 I was sexually assaulted by a family friend. From 4th grade through 12th grade I've been brutally bullied, it caused me to move school districts twice. Why do people hate me? What did I do wrong? I'm sorry if i did something wrong. I just want people to care about me and maybe love me. Is that too much to ask for?

My life is worthless, the only person who would notice my disappearance is my mother, but I'm beyond feeling guilty for her if something were to happen to me. I know it sounds selfish, sorry.
