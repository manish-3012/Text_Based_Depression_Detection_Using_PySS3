Nothing is Wrong With Me In Theory But Everything Makes Me Want to Fucking Kill MyselfI first felt suicidal in 2014. I have been pretty good about taking my bipolar meds. But I have been off them for three days and I feel like ending it yet again.
I have had countless, hundreds of suicidal thoughts over the past six years and two attempts.

I donâ€™t really know if it gets better and for how long.

It just makes me feel like getting better is a big fucking tease.

I am better for a couple days and then I spend All. Fucking. Day. Inside.

Iâ€™ve spent six hours on my phone today.
I think it causes my depression to get worse but here I am rambling for hours and posting 30+ posts a day across social media.

What in Godâ€™s name is wrong with me.
