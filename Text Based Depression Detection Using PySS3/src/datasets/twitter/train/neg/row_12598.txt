Feeling lower than I ever have beforeSo I've just lost the love of my life, my fiancÃ© and who I thought was my soulmate. I was verbally abusive to her so I deserve to be left. All our friends have seen it and despise me. I grew up in an abusive household, my mother was an alcoholic and my father left when I was 2. 

I was with my fiancÃ© for almost 9 years, and in those 9 years my dad died from a heart attack, my grandpa died from heart failure, and my mom was murdered. Her boyfriend punched her and she had a brain hemmorage, probably worsened due to the alcohol in her system. 

All of this together turned me into a monster with a temper and I used my words to hurt the one person thatoved me in this world, and now she's moving out this month and has told me she has feelings for her best friend. I am absolutely crushed and I just don't want to go on living this failed attempt at a life. I always thought I was a good guy but this time I've realized I'm really a piece of shit. I've never felt this much pain, even when my mom passed away.
