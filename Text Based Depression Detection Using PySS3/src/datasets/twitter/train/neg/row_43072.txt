I can't have the one thing I've always wantedAll I've ever wanted is to fall in love and have a healthy relationship. I'm 32 and now have been single for 14 years, my entire adult life. I've been turned down sooo many times. Every time I see a pretty girl I melt and get suicidal. I feel old and gross and stupid. Everyone always says you have to love yourself before someone else loves you... I loved myself for a long time before the constant rejection got to me so I'm not sure that's a deciding factor. 
So now I'm trying to decide if the rest of my worthless life is worth it. 

I get that this story is as old as time and there's legions of men and women in the same boat and no one gives a shit. Until I figure things out I just want a paper trail so my parents will understand if and when I pull the trigger.
