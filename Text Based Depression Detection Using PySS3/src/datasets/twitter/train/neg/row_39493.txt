Alright Reddit, I'm done!I posted in depression early about how am incredibly distant and transparent with people.  Happiness and joy are things I really no longer experience.  Most emotions in general just don't mean anything to me because I know longer understand how they work.  Self alienation has become my nature and I'm slowly looking for the ultimate exit.  The end is coming, I know.  Whether it's this year or next.  I have accepted that I am slowly breaking down and may not be suited for this world.  I no longer do well opening up to those I'm close with(never really did) and I know it may seem like a hassle but I'd really like to find someone on here i could just throw back and forth with about whatever even if its just a PM.
