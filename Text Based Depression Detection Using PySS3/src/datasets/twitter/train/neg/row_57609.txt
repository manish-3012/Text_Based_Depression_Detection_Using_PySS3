My life is so pointless and stupid. I will never amount to anything. I want to die and end this string of endless panic attacks and depressive episodesI wasnt able to sleep last night and I've been so anxious today I keep throwing up.

I keep wanting to call a suicide hotline or go to a hospital but I feel like they'll think I'm being foolish and I know they won't be able to help me.

I keep getting overwhelmed and wanting to hurt myself and then I have to take a nap and calm down and it's a terrible cycle and I'll never escape or amount to anything.

Mostly I feel extremely childish and like I'm being a terrible brat. I want desperately not to be this way. I want to be a responsible, fulfilled adult and its never going to be possible for me

Earlier this year I decided not to kill myself but it gets harder every fucking day. I remember sitting in the living room with my mom when I was about 16, bawling about how badly I hated my life and how much I wanted to escape it. She agreed that my life was awful, but assured me it would only get better. She was wrong. It gets worse everyday.
