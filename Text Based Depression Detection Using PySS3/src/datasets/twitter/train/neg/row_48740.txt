what even am II gave up on life when I was nine years old. Stopped doing homework, stopped going outside, stopped trying to make friends. I was lonely. But I had no drive. I had no motivation to change anything about my life, and I was too fragile for my parents to force me into anything. I spent more than half my life in complete isolation from society. I didn't develop any social skills or any identity. I was, and still am, a nowhere person. The closest thing that I have to a soul is meaningless personal preferences and an undiagnosed case of narcissistic personality disorder.

Now, add all that to the fact that I'm a cancer patient, and that I have hypersensitivity so severe that my father's voice feels like knives in my ears, and you have everything that I am. I have achieved nothing, I specialize in nothing, I love no one. I don't know how to feel things for other people. I don't know how to like them. And I don't know how to stop feeling so angry and lonely. No one can give me a straight answer of how to do it, and no process leads me to a point where I can figure it out on my own. I am too crippled to reach out for any in-person service, and too stupid to make enough money to live comfortably. All I do is binge eat and beat myself until I can't feel anything anymore. I'm miserable, but, even more than that, I'm completely fucking hollow.

What the fuck do I do now.
