Dad is always too busy. When I try to talk to him about my problem, he's too busy and never stops his time for meI laugh at this thought that when I'm dead, he will think about this. 

Ppl with suicide dad, when they want to talk to you, it took them so much courage and all they get is "I'm working" "I'm too busy" "I got to go somewhere" or would ignore and continue watching the tv, forgetting i wanted to talk to you.

I cried tonight. These damn ideations hit me so hard

I seriously want to go now 

I want to go
