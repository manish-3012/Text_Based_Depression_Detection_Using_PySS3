I've wanted to die for 23 years and I don't know how much longer I can take itI got very serious about it three times including once when I was seven years old. The last was late 2016/early 2017 when I got as far as donating all my savings to charity to prepare for my exit. I haven't gone through with it because I feel a moral obligation to my mother and friends (and my cat) but I can't even make myself feel that any more. I'm even out of spite and spite kept me going for years. I have nothing left. Im just tired. I want to go to a hospital and tell them I want to die because maybe then I could get rest but I can't because the world is too sick right now for me to tie up a bed. I'm so exhausted.

And the fucked up part is I resent my brother because he tried to hang himself in my mom's spare bedroom and she found him and I feel like he, idk, used up my chance. Like he wasted it when I've been saving it up all those years so I wouldn't do to her what he did. 

I don't want my mom to die, God knows, I really don't, it's my worst nightmare, but she has copd and is going into work and there's this awful part of me that's saying "maybe in a few months it won't matter anymore" and I'm scared of that too
