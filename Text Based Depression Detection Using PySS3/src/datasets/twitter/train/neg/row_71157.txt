I really hope that I donâ€™t wake up tomorrow
People are like â€œthank god for another dayâ€ yeah another day of the same bullshit. Iâ€™m just so damn tired of living I donâ€™t understand why I wonâ€™t fucking die already. I would kill myself but Iâ€™m scared of what might happen if I do. The good thing is that life is temporary ( thank god ) so Iâ€™ll get my death wish one day. It just seems like itâ€™s taking FOREVER to come true. I just really hope I die tonight so I can finally be at external peace.
