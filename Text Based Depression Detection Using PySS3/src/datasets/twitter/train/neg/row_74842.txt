HelpIm lost. Im almost 18 and so im not even nearly mentally grown if that makes sense, im not coming here pretending like i know the world and yes im still young but im just lost right now.

 Ive spent past years in and out of different therapies with different services and on and off medication. Earlier this year i fell into a relationship out of nowhere and it threw my life upside, it was the best drug id ever tasted, my ideal of "love". Me and the girl are still together we love each other very much we just both struggle greatly, in many ways were hugely different people but we understand each other on another level. Enough rambling about the relationship, over the last few months i have felt my mind descending once more, life's gotten more chaotic yet calmer in some ways than its ever been. 

I struggle with pretty bad anxiety, especially separation anxiety rooting from abandonment issues, im heavily insecure and above all i just constantly feel this craving of death. Im at that common impasse however in which i know i don't have the courage to go through with it and i know even if she doesnt always see it now if i left so to speak, my partner wouldn't be able to cope.

Im trying to explain things no one cares about and usually i can compose my thoughts but right now i just cant, everything in my mind is rushing like a damn waterfalls in my ears. Ive got hours sat here waiting and my minds wondering. I dont know necessarily what i want i just want something anything, help, options i guess. As you may be able to tell im quite an open person, my hearts on my sleeve and maybe i just want to talk? to relate and find common ground? i dont know i just use reddit alot for other things and came here in a ditch attempt in a dark time to see if there's some form of light.

sorry for wasting all of your time.
