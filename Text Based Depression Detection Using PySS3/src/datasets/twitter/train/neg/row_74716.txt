Iâ€™m ready to go tonight 23:23 GMT atmHi,

Iâ€™m nice, promise, wonâ€™t bite. 

Do I very nearly finished writing my goodbyes in my notes app to everybody. 

So Iâ€™m ready to go really. Soon... reallly soon. Lol. I should maybe have checked on drugs.com before I posted because i donâ€™t want to be talked out of this. 

Iâ€™m a really nice person, Iâ€™m loving caring and, I guess, ever so needy lol. Anyway... So Iâ€™ve decided that I canâ€™t do this - life - anymore. I need to leave the country at least but I canâ€™t do that because I have not the money nor friends. So I need to leave this earth. Iâ€™m so sick and tired of it all. All of it. So Iâ€™ve put my best clothes on and Iâ€™ve gone to bed. Even did my hair!

Basically all I want to know is Iâ€™ve had a really strong spliff that should show down my heart... Iâ€™ve had a massive Budweiser and some clonazepam earlier and also some duloxetine. None of this has to do with depression btw. So I was thinking...

If I have one more bud, 1.5mg of clonazepam and 75mg of promethezne, will I not wake up tomorrow or should I take more or some more stuff too?

Thanks
