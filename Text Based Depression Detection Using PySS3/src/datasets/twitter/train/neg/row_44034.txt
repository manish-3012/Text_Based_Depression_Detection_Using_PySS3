Suicide because of sanity degradation, and no free will.I feel like no one's really in control of their actions, that happiness caused by good deeds is simply our selfish desire to feel good about being responsible for the good deed, and the benefits we get from the way our chemicals react.

I can't even blame criminals anymore, nor anyone in this world for any reason, as no action seems to me to be purely toxic, as it's all caused by brain structure and chemical washes.

I'm pretty much next to selectively mute due to my anxiety, but no matter how far I go trying to act extroverted and friendly, it's impossible to get rid of the phantom pain inside of me, kind of like a missing limb, or the lack of breath at the top of my chest.

It's easy, "fake it till you make it", but you never make it. I already am who I constsntly tried to fake.

It's not that faking it will get rid of the void, the void's there, and you act the way you act because of it. You become who you are &gt;because&lt; of this void, and not because who you are brought this void upon yourself. The void came, and it destroyed you. Your pain isn't what caused the void to appear, the void won't go away no matter how much you change, even if you're happy.

The more I got help, the worse it got, because I realized that the more help I get, the harder it seems to actually be able to feed the void. I was hoping for a magical "feed good now" treatment, but that's not possible knowing I'm not in control of it, and I know no one will truly care, as it's all reactions of your brain, and your chemical washes.

I think I am the perfect example of a degrading sanity, used to believe in ethics beyond all else, but what do ethics matter now if we're all not in control?

Fuck this, fuck you.
