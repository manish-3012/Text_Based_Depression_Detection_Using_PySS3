Unresolved medical issue, I am giving upOver the past year and a half I have had increasingly worse medical issues. Some congenital, others unknown. My chest pain has become unbearable and do to vertigo, shortness of breath, and the pain caused when I minimally exert myself, I am coming to an end.

I am a 150lb, 6â€™0â€, formerly athletic 31F who can no longer shower without gasping for breath. Leaving my home is nearly impossible and after multiple hospitalizations, specialists visits, surgeries, and a pacemaker, I have no answers and no relief.

January 19th, mid-afternoon, local national forest, .38 special, and a hollow point round.

Everything is arranged, my goodbye written, and now Iâ€™m just waiting. I needed to tell someone.

I hope my wife will find love againâ€”she may never forgive me.
