I cannot afford health insurance, should I commit suicide ?I cannot afford rent, healthy food, and an acceptable standard of living ( like having a weekend) because I have not been allowed a high income by those in charge. I have HIV and several other pre-existing conditions and absolutely hate my job with a passion. What reason is there to live ?
