Time to go, I guessLife only gets worse. It's been a month since I "lost" my job and I have no income at all.  There is not a single job in my area. Even the government of Canada won't help me whatsoever. So I guess it will be better to hang myself instead of waiting to starve to death.  I see no other solution. And I've meant to do it for a long time.anyway
