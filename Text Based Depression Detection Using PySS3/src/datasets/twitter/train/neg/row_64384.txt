I get the feeling my friend doesn't believe meI confided how I'm feeling to my best friend. But when I talk about suicide I get the feeling she doesn't believe I'm going to do it. She knows I am in pain, and I know she doesn't doubt that I feel suicidal. 

But I think she doesn't realize I'm planning on going through with it. I gave myself a hundred days ( now I'm down to 95) 

I am so surprised that even after all of this, I still can't get through to her. 
At least now, she can't say I didn't warn her. She can't say I didn't try to reach out. I'm currently writing her a letter. I'm going to give it to her right before I die. If anyone can give me some advice on what to write, it would be very much appreciated. 

 And, * 
please* no one suggesting that I talk to a professional, or call a hotline. At this point, that just gets on my damn nerves
