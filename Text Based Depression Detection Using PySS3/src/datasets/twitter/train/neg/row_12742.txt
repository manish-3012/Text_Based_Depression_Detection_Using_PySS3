Having trouble sleeping,, looking for someone to talk to tonightCan someone just reach out and talk to me until I fall asleep? I am on this forum pretty much nightly, and yea. 

it's the isolation that can only be filled by living with someone else, and it kills me inside. 

if I could get out of this I could fix that. but I can't fix that without getting out of this first. fucking catch 22.
