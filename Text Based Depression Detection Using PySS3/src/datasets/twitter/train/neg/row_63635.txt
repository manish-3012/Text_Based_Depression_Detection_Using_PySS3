people always say how much pain youâ€™re going to put people through if you killed yourself, donâ€™t they understand that their bereavement is nothing in comparison to the pain the suicidal person was feeling?Listen im not one who wants to put people through pain but the thing is that people get over grief much easily then they can get over mental illness/chronic pain. I know this sounds selfish but I think itâ€™s quite a stupid argument to make, those people that will suffer because of my choice to kill myself wonâ€™t be even getting a taste of what I felt here on earth, donâ€™t try to guilt trip is with that because what about our pain? what about how bad it is for us? Surely if it gets too bad for the people I left behind they can just take the â€œeasy way outâ€ and kill themselves but many will not reach that point.
