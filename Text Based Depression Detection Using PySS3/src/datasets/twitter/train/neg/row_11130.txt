worse life weird mindset19f would turn 20 this week. I've been suicidal for literally as long as i can remember but for the most part i figured after 18 I could figure it out. i have no family, a lot of debt, no job no money ni car no phone no house and like one almost friend who couldn't help me if she wanted to cause of her own life. I am 100% the most helpless I have ever been. truly im sure we all know how poverty is a hole that digs deeper the more you try to get out but fr I have never been this just factually helpless like one of those things were everyone can kinda agree there's no hope, but im weirdly less suicidal? like at 16 I would've ran around w a fake gun in traffic just tryinh to go out w a bang but now im just like oh I'm sitting here I guess. does this make sense? like it doesn't hurt as bad as being 16 did but i sensically have no hope. I keep thinking of a plan but its like im too lazy and i rwmember all the times it didn't work. kinda wish I had that manic energy to end it instead of apathetically agonizing through the day. what really sent it was my car breaking down. its always been my everything. everything everything everything. i should've screamed and cried right then. instead I casually walked away. no feelings. what's wrong with me
