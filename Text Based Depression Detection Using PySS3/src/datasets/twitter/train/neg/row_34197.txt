There's nobody left anymore.I seem to have ran out of people to talk to, they all seem to have got bored of my state, or just moved on in their life. Every second of the day I'm starting to think more and more that taking my own life is the smartest option. At least then I won't have to worry about having someone to talk to. I've been thinking about taking a big ol' dose of whatever drugs I can lay my hands on. At least if I take a sedative, I won't feel a thing, I'll be so high nothing'll matter anymore.

I don't know how my friends and family would take it, I would like to think that they would understand, I mean it is my life after all. Who knows, I wouldn't judge them if they took their own life, I can only assume they would treat me the same.

I have thought about the prospect of a god, but I'm sure he/she/it is an understanding entity, I mean there is so much love in the world, just not everyone can bask in its glow.
