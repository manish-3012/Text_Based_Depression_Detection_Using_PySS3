Had a self harm relapse and if it wasnâ€™t for my dog I would have ended it allIâ€™m stupid, I just feel worthless and that I deserve to die. I got into a fight with my abusive ex and he told me that Iâ€™m dirt on the bottom of his shoe and heâ€™s right. Iâ€™m literally sitting in a small puddle of my own blood with my razor blade and the only thing that stops me is my dog sitting next to me. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting. I am tired of being sad all the time.
