Why Should I Even Try?I have no motivation to do anything.  I couldn't remember a thing to save my life.  My life adds no value to society and offers no pleasure or happiness to myself.  I am an empty shell.  I exist only to contribute to the eventual exergy death of the universe.  I am ready to die.
