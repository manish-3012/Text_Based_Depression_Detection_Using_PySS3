Bleh, this is getting stupid. I am back... again.Tonight I am a little drunk. I feel pretty high but not pretty good. 

The power of suicidal thoughts is back up and in my face again.

I tried a few distracting things and almost decided to leave the country and live in a foreign place for the rest of my unknown number of days. I just want to get out of this horrid painful lonely life.

I joined a number of dating sites just to find men with whom to chat, flirt, feel alive.  What did I find?  Hmmm, scammers.  and I lapped it up.  They lied and fake loved me. But they gave me attention.

It makes me wonder if prostitutes are really runaways and addicts or if they are sad sad lonely people who just crave a little love.
 
I have been seeing a therapist for about 9 months. I lie to her. I never reveal that I am still planning my own demise. She is earnest and very good at her job. I am just hopeless.

There is little to do. This numbness is heavy.

Can you tell me you love me? Can you tell me that someone will care for me despite this sadness? Can you tell me that there is anyone who might miss me? SO many times in the last several months, my family has ignored me, my 'friends' have taken from and never given to me, my acquaintances have expected me to stroke their effing egos in exchange for NOTHING. I would love to have my pitiful little ego stroked, just a little.... just a little little bit. 

Tell me you think I write interesting words. Tell me you like my voice. Just tell me you hear me. Lie to me and tell me you love me. You do not have to really love me, just tell me you do.

Please just tell me you love me.

Good night
