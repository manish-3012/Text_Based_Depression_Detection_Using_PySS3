Take a showerI don't really post so I apologise for any format or content errors.
I've been feeling exceptionally suicidal lately due to a recent infection of bed bugs in my home. I'm a home care nurse and enter questionable homes on a regular basis. After three years at this job and being what I thought was careful, I got them. 
I can't sleep, don't want to leave the house, and constantly feel shame and disgust. I haven't seen my friends or family for weeks because I'm too ashamed. I'm isolating myself.
Tonight I could not stop crying thinking about how this will never end and I will constantly be the gross person with bed bugs. I seriously considered suicide. Got meds and a knife ready and was going to fill the bath. That's when I decided to take a shower instead. Still feel gross and unwanted, but I feel like a layer of shame has been washed away.
My take is, take a shower when you're feeling bad. See how you feel afterwards.
