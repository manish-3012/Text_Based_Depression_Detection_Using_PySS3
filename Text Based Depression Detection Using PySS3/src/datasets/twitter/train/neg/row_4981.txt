I have no purpose in life.I've been trying for so long to hide my pain but nothing works. I was 18 (f) when I found out I couldn't have children or my own and it's been killing me. I always had a dream of being a mother and doing one good thing in my life but it's taken away from me. 

All of my friends and family are in relationships and starting families while I'm alone. Why should I live if my dream is never going to be reality? I've been self medicating with whiskey and self harming for 4 years now (now 22 years old)  I recently lost my grandfather ( he had health issues like bad kidneys/ heart issues/ ect.) a few months ago and I wished it was me that was dead. 

I have his old pocket knife and it's been tempting to end it with his blade. If I can't be loved nor have children, why the fuck am I alive? Nobody fucking gets it and what's the use of life if it's to ultimately die alone with nobody. I don't know how much fight I have left in me. I've suffered for most of my teenage years and now my twenties. 

I'm a failure- an fuck up to my family tree. All I want is to live a decent life where I was happily married with a child of my own. Why do the shitty mothers are able to have children while I suffer with this? Where's your god? Where's a miracle when I need it? 

who would miss me when I do die? Nobody.  Therapy doesn't do shit, talking to people doesn't help- all they say is the same shitty advice I've heard too many times (try adoption, parenthood isn't perfect, you'll find someone someday, don't look for love, try being a babysitter/foster mom.) , my drinking  and self harming is giving me pleasure.
