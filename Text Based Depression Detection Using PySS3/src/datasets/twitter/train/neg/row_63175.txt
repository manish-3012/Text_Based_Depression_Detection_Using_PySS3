I lost my parents, my siblings, my baby, and now my boyfriend. My family left me and I feel like I don't want to live alone like thisits not any of their fault, my parents and siblings had to move for my dads work, I put my baby up for adoption, and my boyfriend just couldn't deal with my depression on top of his anxiety. I'm only 19 and I'm alone. I have friends but its just not the same. I miss them and I can't get out of bed without adderall. I can't sleep without melatonin. I've been researching ways to kill myself I just feel so guilty cause I promised my boyfriend that I'd get help even if he broke up with me, if I do it he'll think its his fault. I want to get help but I'm on my own and I have responsibilities I can't ignore for a week or more while I go to the hospital, and I'm afraid if I was honest with a counselor I'd be forced to go. What am I supposed to do
