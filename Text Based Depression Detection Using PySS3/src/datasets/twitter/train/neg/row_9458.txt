I am toxic and am better off not being aliveEspecially to my girlfriend. I should be grateful that a scummy, awful person like me has someone who loves them. Instead I push her away, hurt her with my words when I get upset and angry, make her feel like she isn't good enough. I have told her to break it off with me because i am toxic and will ruin her life, but she won't. 
I think she, and the world, would be better off without me.
