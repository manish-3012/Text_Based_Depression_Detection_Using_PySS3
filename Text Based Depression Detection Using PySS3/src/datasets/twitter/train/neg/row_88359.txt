Not sure what to sayI pretend I'm satisfied with my life. In reality, I have had a bad upbringing and live dependent on a parent that's about as fucked up as I am. We are hardly on speaking terms so I have to beg them to do simple things such as drive me to sports.

I absolutely hate asking people to do favors for me. I've been in excruciating pain for the past week because I re-broke a bone in my arm and don't want to ask my parent to take me to get a cast because I can already anticipate my parent making fun of me over it and telling me how much a trip to the doctor will cost me. It's shit like this that makes me hate myself. 

On top of all of that, I have off and on anxiety that makes me feel reluctant about talking to people and somewhat paranoid in general. The only thing I look forward to anymore is the short amount of sleep I get per night, and even that brief illusion of freedom is often tainted by the reoccurring nightmares of my horrible childhood experiences.

I feel like I'm going to be a slave my whole life and honestly, I rather steal some lunesta and finish this now.
