I got a friend doxxed and now they're gone/hurt. I want to commit suicide to make up for it.Someone trusted me and I broke that trust with someone else I trusted. But it was the wrong person to trust. Now they're gone completely and I can't contact them. I feel like the best thing I can do is suicide. I've been considering another attempt for a few months now but this gives me the greenlight to go ahead.

I'll never have this person back, I ruined what could have been a really good relationship. I was kind of starting to fall for them too.
Whoever expresses affection by getting personal information spread only deserves a painful death imo. 

I'm planning on poisoning myself later on tonight hopefully with a concoction of pills. Not much in the cabinet I can use but I'm doing my research. I took a few antidepressants because I was upset earlier but I want to go back for a full on poisoning once my family is asleep. 
Luckily I've poisoned myself so many times in the past that people stopped even calling 911 when they see I'm sick. So a suicide attempt will be really easy for me.
