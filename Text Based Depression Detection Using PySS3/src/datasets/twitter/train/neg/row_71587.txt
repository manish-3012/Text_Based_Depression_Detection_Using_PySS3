If anyone has nothing else to doI'm sorry for posting here again. I don't want to waste anyones times who could help other ones better. I just need to write some stuff so I feel not as stressed because I have a driving lesson later.

I don't really know what to write. Just being in this situation of writing for a bit calms me down after seeing things that stress me out. I am a bit better since my last post but can't shake the feeling of being lost and stuck. If anyone knows how to talk to other people better or how to find a person you can talk to I would be very grateful for advice. Personal human contact is really the only thing that could help me. I know really nice people I talk to but only over text. And it is helpful but they still are far away and can't do much more than texting. The type of person I like is rare and the only friend I ever really had who I could do stuff with and feel comfortable and safe with is not there anymore.

Thank you for reading.
