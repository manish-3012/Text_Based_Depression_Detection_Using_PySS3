I'm planing on killing myself on my birth dayHey...
Idk why I'm posting this right now, maybe to do some sort of catharsis or something like that.

I've been feeling like shit for a couple of years by now... Every day feeling shittier than the previous one.

All my life I've been a fucking failure, with no accomplishments at all, I suck at everything that I do and always been under the shadow of my little sister, who is actually someone in her life.

My birthday is coming soon (Feb the 7th to be precise) and I'm actually thinking bout ending it all on that day.

I don't want to bother anyone anymore nor want to get in the way of anyone else tbh.

So yeh... Basically that, I'm not 100% sure I'll do it, but most likely I will.

Sorry for bothering ya'll, have a good night and good lifes.
