I donâ€™t think I can do this anymoreIâ€™ve attempted suicide so many times before and always end up living, I canâ€™t do this anymore though. I know itâ€™ll hurt my family but I know theyâ€™ll stop caring after a while. I kept myself alive for other people, that was my only reason to live. But now no ones here for me, Iâ€™m alone, I completely destroyed my personality and interests to appeal to other people and try to make myself the ideal friend only for the people around me to leave me. I donâ€™t know who I am anymore I donâ€™t know what to do to recover the parts of myself I destroyed. I never had a childhood and canâ€™t feel anything other than pain. I let people abuse me cause it makes me feel useful and needed, I constantly breakdown I find it hard to feel joy. Though sometimes I feel tiny amounts of it in stupid things like music and animals, the joy is only temporary and it always gets ruined by people telling me my interests are stupid. I need to find myself but itâ€™s impossible to do. I just wish that tonight I could finally close my eyes and never open them.
