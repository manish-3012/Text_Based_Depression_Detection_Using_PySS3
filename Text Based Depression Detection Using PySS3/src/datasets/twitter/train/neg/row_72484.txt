I'm a TrannySo I came out as transgender back in February and since then, things have just gotten worse for me mentally and everyday is a struggle. Iâ€™ve lost all motivation to do much of anything at all, Iâ€™ve started hating myself more and more as time has gone on, and I donâ€™t see a good outlook for myself regardless of what happens now. Iâ€™ve already gone through female puberty and thereâ€™s nothing I can do now about my body not being the way that I would like it to be. I could work out or whatever and go on testosterone, but I wouldnâ€™t actually get the results I would like. And my hips are still growing, meaning I'm fucked. I will never be over 5â€™5, I will never have smaller hips than I do, my hands and feet will always be too small to be considered male, and I could keep going, but you probably don't care too much about the specifics. I donâ€™t want to be a tranny, I donâ€™t want to be a girl, I donâ€™t have another option. So I feel ending it all would be best. I will never have what I want in life and I donâ€™t want to lead the life Iâ€™m bound to. I know that I can never be a real man, and for me, being dead is better than always being a woman.
