Constant suicidal thoughts have stripped me of any motivation I haveI have had suicidal thoughts since I was in 5th grade, Iâ€™m 22 graduating college in a month. I simply donâ€™t want to do this anymore. Itâ€™s no ones fault but my own, no one owes me anything. I think Iâ€™m a happy person to everyone else, I even had a coworker say last Friday, â€œyknow, you just really enjoy life man you never complain about anything i wish i could be like thatâ€. I have people compliment me for my height and looks all the time, i would agree that Iâ€™m an above average attractive guy but what does that even matter for. Iâ€™m just not happy, I wish I wasnâ€™t born.

I donâ€™t want to be a burden for my friends and family, or my girlfriend anymore. They say Iâ€™m not a burden but I know I am. The world will be perfectly fine without me and Iâ€™m aware of that. Oddly enough thatâ€™s one of the only things keeping me here, knowing just how meaningless my life is and how replaceable I am.
