My thoughts SpiralThis last fall into self pity was a long one, it was made up of initially a worry about a sick friend who I canâ€™t get ahold of. This friend means so much to me and the thought theyâ€™re sick or hurt without me knowing even a little bit is distressing, they always said theyâ€™d be here for me, unlike the other people who just dropped me out of their lives with no closure. Which is why I cringe to her so much, she is the only person who messages me first for a conversations. To think I might lose her feels terrible. 

After that I began worrying about how much Iâ€™ve screwed up: university application, AS levels, any sport I tried, any hobby I dragged my self through to try and be a better or even happy human and the best romantic relationship Iâ€™ll ever get. I just donâ€™t do good things no matter the effort, but Iâ€™m uncertain if Iâ€™ve put any effort into living besides the bare minimum. It all comes back to how Iâ€™m a non-human who lacks any good qualities despite every advantage and chance handed to me. I know I canâ€™t achieve anything good without massive burdensome help from others, who try to help me as an individual be better. It all just seems like a lie to me, every time anyone says Iâ€™ve done a good thing or am a good person I get angry at their lies. They donâ€™t know me like I know me, and I know Iâ€™m a awful person. 

I think Iâ€™m intrinsically broken, Iâ€™m unable to find reasons why Iâ€™m friends with the people I am or why theyâ€™re friends with me. There doesnâ€™t feel like there is anything there of substance beside a shared proximity of about 7 years. Or how I lack anything besides a passive â€œlikeâ€ for my parents who have given me the world and more. I want to love them but I feel such distance from them. Theyâ€™re two good people who got saddled with an inept child like me and they deserve better.  

Iâ€™m looking at a fucking downhill slope of a life fit for mountain bike track. Iâ€™m going to uni in a week, maybe, if Iâ€™m able to scrape together enough fucking competence to get finances in order, but the last time I did this subject I failed. If I fail university which is likely I am terrified about what the future holds, so I might cut it short or rope it short; besides being unfunny and awful, Iâ€™m also indecisive.
