almost my birthday;might as well give myself the present i've always wantedi have enough medication that i can take to overdose.

it's almost my birthday.
i'm stuck in a shitty relationship where the bf won't let me break up with him, i am not working, the medication's side effects make life harder than it is...i feel like i'm just waiting to die at this point.

why not make it go faster?

i have three bottles full of meds.

why should i not take all of these today?
