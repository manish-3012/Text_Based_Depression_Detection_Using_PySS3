Time to fall asleep foreverMany years ago I woke up from coma after my (not first) suicide attempt and what was waiting for me were guilt, disdain from others and a difficult, lonely recovery. Strange enough, I don't wish I had died that time. Life didn't get better, over all, actually it got worse and worse and worse.

I've never been happy, my life has been a mess since I was born. Never had a happy family, I've been abandoned so many times by the people that should have took care of me. I also survived to a sexual assault from a close relative that totally destroyed my self esteem, because I loved and still love him so much.

I woke up. I tried my best. And I find it so ironic how shit still kept happening to me. I've been raped. Then I've been diagnosed with an illness and I suffered for years, going through physical pain and surgeries.

And yet, between all this pain, I met people that made me happy. I wasn't okay. I was struggling, I thought about killing myself more than occasionally. I went through so many long paths of darkness. But they were there (and I was there for them too). I was able to keep waking day after day with a reason to love the fact that I survived. I have so many precious memories of times where I've felt like I was exploding with joy. Times that were worth the effort to stay alive.

Now those people have gone and I feel like all these years after I wake up from the coma have been a dream. A beautiful dream that now has come to an end. And it's time to fall asleep forever.
