Kinda Done. My Friend Killed ThemselvesWow, I'm back here. Haven't posted, but lurked for a long time. I'm kinda done with everything. Like goddamn. My friend is gone, and there's so much I could've done to stop it, but also, he committed suicide for the same reasons I want to commit suicide: global warming, wars, injustice, etc.  A part feels like, maybe, in some, if I kill myself we will be reconnected.  Furthermore, my mom has decided that since the incident, she is just going to run. She no longer sleeps at home most nights, and I barely see her. 
I'm sorry, I'm just done and emotionally drained. I don't know where else to go.
