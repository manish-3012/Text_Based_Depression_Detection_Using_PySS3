I just want you to know you are loved.Stupid title I know, I would pass over it too if I saw it....

I've dealt with suicidal thoughts and ideation since I was 18, 6 years now. I've made plans before. There's been months go by where it consumes my thoughts. I think about it everyday. 

Last week, after a few events got me really depressed. I went out and bought a bag of heroin. I've struggled with drug abuse for a few years now so I only saw it fitting that that would be my way out. I was very drunk and in the middle of a heavy Xanax binge. The night is a blur, but I ate a few more bars and began smoking some heroin with the intention to pass out and never wake up.

Obviously I got up the next morning. I felt even more dead inside than I ever have before. I went to classes and work feeling like a ghost, looking at people living, thinking to myself, "they have no idea what I did the other night.

In days since part of me keeps wishing I was successful. I got home from work today, heartbroken, depressed, angry. I still have the H, my ticket out. But I have a lingering thought: I don't want to go out dying in obscurity. 

I reached out to an old friend, he lives in a town over but happily came to join me for drinks. I told him what I did. He told me if I succeeded and he got that news, his life would have been different forever. He told me he would have carried the pain of my death to his own grave.

I know it doesn't mean much to hear from a stranger off the internet, but you have people like this in your life too. People who would be devastated if you died. Don't be afraid to reach out. You matter to someone.
