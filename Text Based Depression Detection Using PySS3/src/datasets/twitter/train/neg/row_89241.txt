Diary Entry of a Numb, Sad Soul**Wednesday, August 23, 2017 (11:17PM)**

Were I to die tomorrow, how long would it take before anyone asked where I was?  Would anyone even care?  All my friends have moved on and away with their lives and I am stuck â€“ trapped in a dead-end job with only the hope and dream of meeting that bitter end.  Spread my ashes on the closest dumpster when I am gone; no one will notice.

I am the laughing stock of my own personal hell; a complete and utter failure in my own eyes by doing everything my father asked without consideration for myself.  I changed my major from one I love to one I hate â€“ at dadâ€™s suggestion.  I joined the family business, a dysfunctional shit-hole filled with people I hate â€“ again, dadâ€™s suggestion.  The majority of my life has been lived at the vicarious whim of someone else, and I have no one to turn to outside of them for support. 

My parents wanted the best for me; I understand that, though it makes little difference.  I want to kill myself because I listened to them.  I want them to know that I no longer wish to live, and I hold them accountable.  I can only find peace when I dream, for when I wake, the life they have given me holds a pall under which all tastes of ash.  I no longer dream. 

What happened to me?  I was so vibrant when I was younger.  Sensitive, yes, but goddamnit at least I had charisma going for me.  I should have gone towards my goals.  I should have been a better man for my own sake.  What is left of me?  Can it be salvaged?  Should I take the cowardâ€™s way out and bleed out on my apartment floor?  Iâ€™m not sure; I really donâ€™t know anymore.  Itâ€™s unhealthy, this dismal spiral â€“ I know that, I do.  But I really donâ€™t want to change where Iâ€™m going.  Writing out this letter is the first thing Iâ€™ve done to address what Iâ€™m going through, and Iâ€™ll probably stow it away somewhere so no one else can read it.  Iâ€™dâ€™ like to say that I keep going for my familyâ€™s sake, but I donâ€™t care.  I donâ€™t care about anything anymore, and thatâ€™s the problem.  My entire life has been one big, half-assed joke and if I had actually applied myself, I might have been in a completely different place than I am now.  It's that thought that has defeated me so quickly and so thoroughly, a storm under a clear blue sky.

The way things are going, I'm not going to make it to the end of the year and it doesnâ€™t sadden me anymore, thinking as such. Iâ€™m waiting at this point. The death sentence has already been written; I need only the lever of the electric chair to be placed in my hand for the fireworks to start.
