Please be safe this Holiday season.Hey I understand with the Holidays coming up this can be a really hard time to deal with depression. You feel like you have to be happy around family when youâ€™re not. The stress can be overwhelming sometimes too. Iâ€™ve felt the slippery slopes of suicide too and almost took my life 4 years ago. I just want to say life is worth it. Even during these tough times. I will be busy much of this week due to Christmas. Even though I might not be able to get back to you right away if your feeling suicidal and need a friend please call 911 or message me I will be there for you as soon as I can. Be safe during the holiday seasons your life matters.
