I'm done tryingI'm 26, but feel much older. I have Aspergers, I've been beaten down and kicked around. My parents put me in a disciplinary school when I was in middle school. They thought I was a bad kid. At 14 my uncle molested me, my family still doesn't believe me. I was arrested for throwing a flip-flop at someone. I was raped. I was kicked out of my parents home with no warning and had to spend a week in the cemetery. I've been on and off the streets since. I was engaged, but he cheated and left me pregnant. I had to let my parents adopt my son. I sleep with men just for a meal or a warm place to sleep. I'm so tired, goodbye.
