I can't believe I want to die againI'm 18, the last time I was seriously contemplating suicide was when I was 15. I haven't been 100% OK since then but at least I didn't plan on killing myself. 

But three years later I find myself in the same exact spot, fucking up school just as badly, except this time I'm legally an adult and I don't have my mother to LEGALLY fall back on. She is retiring, I wish I could be of support to her instead of a burden. I'm gettick kicked out of high school AGAIN. I've been to two different ones, I'm already a year behind because of this.

I was planning on being famous by this point. Guess things don't work that way. I burnt all (100%) of my savings a mere two weeks after my 18th birthday on a trip to Japan, just to let myself live a little and experience something before I died.

I've done almost everything I've wanted to do, gone to Japan, dyed my hair a crazy color. Not a lot else motivates me. I have access to heroin, I want to go that way. Always have, deep down.


I'm just really baffled and disappointed that I'm back here again. And like the last time I was right on the edge, my family only seems to push me off. When I was feeling better, maybe a year ago, I told them about my previous suicide attempt with oxycodone. They cried. But now I'm showing the symptoms again, that I'm getting bad, I even explicitly told my mother I'm back in that state of mind. 

But she only makes the same mistakes she did last time. Lash out at me, call me a piece of shit child. Oh well. Part of me wants to die, to prove a point, to let her know it's her fault for being selfish. The other part of me just wants to get out, for this to be over with.

I gave it another three years, I crossed a lot of my bucket list. And that's enough for me to check out forever. 

I'll meet you all in the infinite conciousness, I guess. Hasta la vista baby.
