I'm honestly worthlessI've been suffering for awhile now. I think of killing myself daily now but I'm too scared to do it. I'm 26, my husband and I are $18,000 in debt. I have no friends. The only "friend" I had kept blowing me off and when I told her my thoughs of suicide she just said "oh no I'm so sorry, im here if you need me" obviously not since she never wants to hang out or even text me to check in. I live in pain every day. My shoulders have been killing me for years and lately my foot. I can barely walk but I cant afford to go to the doctor. I have quit every job I've had without a notice. All I've ever worked is shitty food service jobs and manufacturing jobs.  I have nothing to show for my life. No accomplishments, no school, no money. No house, no friends, no savings, nothing. I can't even have kids like a real woman is supposed to. I have never been happy in my own body. I am ugly and fat. My self esteem is the absolute worst. My smile is fake. My laugh is fake. I haven't been truly happy in awhile. My emotions are numb and it's like I can't feel anything. The only reason I am still here is because of my husband and my animals. The loaded gun kept on the nightstand taunts me more and more every day though. The past week I keep breaking down and crying at nothing. Living is becoming too painful lately in more ways than one. I know I need help and I've been depressed for a really long time. But I am too scared to get help because I feel like I am overreacting and being stupid. Hopefully one day I get the courage to shoot myself and get off of this hell hole. I'm not sure if I see a light at the end of the tunnel here.
