No one has been able to give me a compelling reason to stay aliveFor context, I am 19, and I've been suicidal on and off for the past 10 years. It started when I was 8, and my parents got a divorce, and my dad just fucked right off. I lean on suicide as a crutch, I use it to have autonomy and control; I can always jump ship if I want to. I like planning how I would do it, I look at statistics and ranking for different methods for variables like agony, time to die, and success rate. I make plans accordingly. I also make to-do lists for what needs to happen beforehand, like cleaning my room and empty the fridge because I have no idea how long it would take for someone to notice my death. I am usually pretty methodical about the whole thing, I like preparing to die.

I am in university and last October my mother died. She was my only family and the only one who might have cared if I died. I didn't deal with it as well as I'd hoped and I ended up failing two classes last semester and barely scraping by on the others. As a former overachiever I was devastated, in high school, anything below an 80 was heartbreaking to me. I am not doing better this semester, and I really hope I don't end up failing again because I might get kicked out of university. I feel I have thrown away everything I worked for, for as long as I can remember the importance university was stressed and the idea that you can't be successful if you don't have a degree, so I am here at the top university in my country about to ruin everything. 

I'm sorry for the long preamble, I'll get to the point. I've spoken to a couple of people about this, suicide hotline people, police officers, school councillors, a friend once. No one has given me a good reason not to do it, and certainly not one that would outweigh the potential benefits. I've been told the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1) "It's a permanent solution to a temporary problem" \*exactly\* I will not have any problems ever again, it's done. No more pain, no more failure, suffering, you know the whole bit. I don't want the rest of my life, I don't care how good you promise me it will get, I want to rest, please let me rest. We all die eventually, why not here and now? This has been going on for long enough that I don't see it getting better, I've sought help from a number of therapists, and none have been successful, I can't be well, and it doesn't get better.

&amp;#x200B;

2)"you will hurt your family" said by a counsellor who didn't bother to ask about my family, at which point I would have told him I don't have one. This is incredibly harmful to the special few of us who don't have a family. I have no one who relies upon me, no one who would be hurt by my death, so why stay alive?

&amp;#x200B;

3)"There's still so much to do! still, So much of the world to see!" I don't care. I don't care if I see it or not, I've had about as much of this world as I can take and I don't care to see more. The most beautiful sunrise doesn't compare with the sweet release of death.

&amp;#x200B;

I could probably add more, but I am very tired.
