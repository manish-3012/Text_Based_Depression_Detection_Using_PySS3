UselessI really really try. I try to be happy. I try to smile. I try to be nice. I try my steps to calm down. I have no one. My friends all left me. My family is not helping. The suicide hotline doesn't help. I can't do it anymore. It hurts.  The heavy feeling inside hurts. I don't know what else to do...

Can someone talk to me? Please?
