I canâ€™t escapeI have debilitating anxiety. The only job I can keep, that I also love, unfortunately forces me to work with the person who has hurt, traumatized and abused everyone in my life. Everyone Iâ€™ve ever loved. After finding out the most recent abuse. I canâ€™t do it anymore. But I canâ€™t quit my job. I canâ€™t afford to. And I canâ€™t keep a job anywhere else because of my anxiety. 

I donâ€™t want to die. But I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.

Iâ€™m trapped. 

Iâ€™m medicated. Iâ€™ve been to therapy. Psychologists. For years. Nothing makes my life easier. Or better. Their solutions arenâ€™t realistic. I have no one to help me. No one to turn to. No where to go.

If I could just pay my house off so I could at least know I have a place to live...that would be a step in the right direction. But at this rate, I still owe $50,000. I wonâ€™t have it paid off for another 20 years.

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. It would be so much easier to just give up. I donâ€™t know of any other solution. Quit my job, become homeless. Or stay at my job and continue this miserable cycle. 

Or die.
