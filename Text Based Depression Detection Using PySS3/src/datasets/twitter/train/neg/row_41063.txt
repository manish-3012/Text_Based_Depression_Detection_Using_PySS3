I'm disappointingMy whole life I was told I'm so smart and that I can do anything I put my mind to. I was held to a higher expectation because I excelled in many areas. But I just took that for granted and thought I didn't need to do any work for what I wanted because it was easy and I thought I would do it eventually. Now I have let everyone down. My parents, my boyfriend, my teachers, and friends. I don't put forth effort and when I do its too late. I feel terrible. Although nobody has said anything I still know and can sense I'm a disappointment. I feel like my life is worthless and I have no reason to be here. Maybe I should just give up. I've already messed up enough.
