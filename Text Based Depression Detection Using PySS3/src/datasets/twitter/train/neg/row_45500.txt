I am weary.Right now, my fondest desire is to lie down in a clean, white room and rest for a while in silence.  I'm not really suicidal, I just want to disappear.  If this is all life is, I don't think I can do it anymore.  

You don't have to say anything;  I simply wanted to let this out into the aether.
