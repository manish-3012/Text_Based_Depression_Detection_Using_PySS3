7 daysItâ€™s been too long since Iâ€™ve been happy. In 7 days Iâ€™m going to have my family leave me alone at home, Iâ€™m going to end my life. Iâ€™ve been thinking of this for a while and Iâ€™m giving myself until Monday of next week to decide if Iâ€™m going through with it. Iâ€™ve got everything ready, a note, the way Iâ€™m going out. Iâ€™ve had my ups and downs but I think that this is actually it, Iâ€™ve convinced myself until now to keep going but I canâ€™t anymore.
