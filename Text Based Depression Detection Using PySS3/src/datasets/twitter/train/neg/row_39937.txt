Just leavingI took a handful of pills and am passing out tonight for good.  I tried to end it before but it wasn't enough, so here I am again. Well, I'm sick of the world. I turned 22 this year, and I can't find a reason to continue.  I'm just can't stand hearing myself constantly criticizing me and always making me feel empty.  I want to feel anything but the dead-ness I feel like now.  I don't care if anyone reads this, i don't care if anyone finds me.  I just don't know anymore. Maybe at least it will be quiet.
