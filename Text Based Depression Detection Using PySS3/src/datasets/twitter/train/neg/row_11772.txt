Im stuckThe story is that i got my ptsd activated when i started studying. My childhood was a mess. The psychology put me on meds that made me function to much and i ended up with a gf. We are both done with our education and just bought a house. I tried working but the stress of selling houses in the biggest city in my country just ended me. 

I don't want to live this life. I'm used to my adrenaline pumping from fear all day from my childhood. I know work won't work because I can't function around others without medications witch i don't want.

I want to move away. Leave my perfect gf and just say fuck it all. I have my mother left as family and she is already getting sick. When she dies i die. 

Currently I'm stuck. I want to feel love, have a family and so on, but the other side of me don't at all. I have anxiety every day and its just getting worse.

I don't dare make the move leaving my gf. I think that would haunt me for the rest of my life, but she might leave me if i just keep getting sicker.

Thanks for anyone reading. Just had to get some stuff out.

I would love not to wake up tomorrow.
