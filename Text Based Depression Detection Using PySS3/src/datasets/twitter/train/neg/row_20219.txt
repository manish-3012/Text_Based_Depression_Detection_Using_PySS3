Im starting to have serious thought of killing myself.lately ive been crying every night i just hope I never wake up from my sleep. These suicide thoughts have really been getting to me and i swear the only thing stopping me is my cousins and some of my friends who im not even sure likes me. Im currently living with a stomach disease and it wont kill me but god is it ever annoying. I miss alot of school because of it i get so far behind and i got my parents starting to cuss me out if im not doing my homework. I literally dont remember what happiness feels like i dont remember what normal feels like. Ive thought of the way i would kill myself, my mom has a container filled with sleeping pills and i heard that is the easiest way to do it. I dont want to do it any other way because i dont want to feel the pain. I would use a gun but i woulnt be able to find a gun anywhere. I think the only time i ever laugh is on xbox then when i have to get off because my parents tell me to I literally feel awful, i feel my xbox is an escape from reality i dont have to deal with any bullshit from people. Im actually sick of feeling this way i just feel like a big disappointment and feel like it would be better if i took my life so i wont keep feeling like this. Im taking a pill to for my acne its called "Accutane" apparently causes suicidal thoughts but ive been feeling like this for a long time. Im a twin, and my sister studys goes out with friends has a good time shes just so much better than me its crazy. I used to be like that too but i dont know what happened, i just started staying in my room doing nothing. Man i dont even know why im on here, just really feel like this week is gonna be the week i guess this was sort of a cry for help. I dont know I just dont wanna deal with being alive and a dissapointment to the family.
