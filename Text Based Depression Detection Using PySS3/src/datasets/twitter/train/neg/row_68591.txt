I think I need some1 to talk toI mean, like, some1 who gets me u know?
I've been talking to a psychologist for quite a while now, but it's really hard to open up to an old doctor who barely even knows what a computer is, u feel me?

I'm tired of talking to experts who have spent years and years studying the pseudo-science that modern psychology is. I'm tired of being looked at as "subject 37b". I wanna talk to a real human being who is not being paid to pretend to care about me. I wanna talk to someone who knows what it feels like to live in motherfking 2016.

I wanna talk to you.
It would be nice if I could have a short conversation with you every other day or smthing like that. Even if I don't really have anything to say. Hell, I'll talk about dank memes if I have to. Anything will do.


I dunno why u are here, or why u are reading this shit. If u truly care about other people, then I could really use ur help. But if u just wanna feel better about urself cuz u "helped someone else", then please don't bother.

Oh yeah, I just realized I haven't mentioned suicide at all. Unfortunately, I think I'll eventually "pull the trigger". But not before I do a couple of things. So... maybe one or two years from now? Is that too far in the future? Can I still post this now? lol
