Heart attackI have a question and I really want answers so I can stop thinking like this 
-
Can I make my self think really bad and have a heart attack ?

Like i donâ€™t have any heart issues or nothing 
But I experience panic attacks multiple times
That traumatized me
Thinking my heart gonna stop and ama die from a heart attack or a stroke
-

And In my head Iâ€™m convinced that I can have a heart attack or a stroke by just thinking about it
Is it possible?

And ig my anxiety and worries boost it up thinking it will happen and sometimes my mind is to focused in my heart that I can feel it or something Idk Iâ€™m just
So Scarred Iâ€™m sorry 
but

Can someone confirm that having a heart attack by think about it isnâ€™t possible or if it is 

And Iâ€™ll say it again I had it checked out and everything and Iâ€™m okay

I just still feel this feeling from all those panic attack 
And my mind is soo convinced 
And I know by knowing the real truth I will no longer be worried .
