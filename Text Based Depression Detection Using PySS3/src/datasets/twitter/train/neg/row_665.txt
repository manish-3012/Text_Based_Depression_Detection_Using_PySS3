8 reasons i don't want to livewhen i consider the option of death, i usually think of the following problems:
1. i have depression.
2. i have an eating disorder. i was somewhat fat, then lost some weight but now can't eat normally, usually overeat.
3. because of 2. my boobs are not that firm anymore, not sure if they're even beautiful.
4. this summer i will have to pass exams in order to enter the university, but all this uni stuff, grades, papers is stressing me out.
5. i have bad vision (-3.5 both eyes). and i am afraid it might get worse.
6. i am a girl, as you noticed, therefore i have my periods. every damn month. so stupid, pointless and painful.
7. i live in country i don't really want to live in, but don't have other optins right now since i'm 17.
8. family issues, mostly daddy ones.
