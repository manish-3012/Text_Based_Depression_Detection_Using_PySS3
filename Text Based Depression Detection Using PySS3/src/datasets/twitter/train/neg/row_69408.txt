Please take a minute to reply (a small rant)Iâ€™m a 19 year old male done the first year of university on the fast track to year two. I have supportive parents and a few good friends, yet Iâ€™m sitting in a dark room, hitting the back of my head against the wall. My antidepressants have lost their edge and old thoughts are resurfacing. 

To sum it all up, I want to die. Not sure if it is from depression, childhood trauma or my inner demons but I struggle to bury the thoughts as they once were. All I want is someone to hug me and say they understand and feel that my emotions are valid. I canâ€™t explain it but something stops me over and over again from dying and I just want someone to listen. 

People of reddit, thank you for your time and I hope you find the courage to carry on.
