I'm tired of my pointless life 

I've  had good marks and been a hard worker my whole life, I used to think it  was great and the correct thing to do, but now I realize it was  completely pointless. I didn't have too much social interaction at  school and now I'm studying something I don't enjoy. I don't have any  friends and constantly think about how I'm going to be stuck in a career  I hate for the rest of my life and still all alone for ever. I haven't been able  to concentrate on my current responsibilities, so they are piling up,  that added to the fact that I don't want to work and my social anxiety  is killing me inside. The worst  part is that quit is not an option. I have a scholarship and study for  free, so if I quit I'm gonna be a loser who will never have the  opportunity to study again. Being a hard worker has been the worst thing  of my life, can sound ridiculous but that's it how I feel. I constantly  feel that everyone is watching me and expecting me to be successful and  I'm really exhausted. I'm wondering if killing myself might be a good  option.
