I am a 17 year old rising junior. The academic stress and there being no purpose living makes me jump. I will be jumping off a four story building near my house. GoodbyeI just finished writing my final goodbye letters to my mom, dad, and brother. Goodbye. I want to talk to someone but I donâ€™t know who. Iâ€™m planning on overdosing on lean or some other drug. I know that my parents will just say that depression and suicidal thoughts are just common and focus on my grade and GPA. I feel hopeless. I want to know where to take my  life from. No comfort or support will help me much. I feel like Iâ€™m better off gone than having to work more and study and prepare for school and the SAT. To me that is all there is to life. Iâ€™m sorry mom and dad. Even though I spent time with you I simply canâ€™t get over it. Goodbye and I love you because this is not your fault. Thank you for all the memories and support you have me for the past seventeen years of my life. The times when you scolded me that if I didnâ€™t get a good SAT score, then I would be sent to academies and my dog would be forced to eat canned food, it just breaks my heart. If so, then it is better off for me to just jump and disappear so that you could take care of my dog. Goodbye.
