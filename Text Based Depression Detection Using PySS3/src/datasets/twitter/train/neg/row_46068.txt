This pain made me horrible until the endI was writing here last night but i realized all those words were for someone. How do you tell someone you're going to kill yourself? To the only one that ever loved you? But I did as selfish and horrible as it was. He answered. I'm glad I can die with words of love in my head. I'm sure he'll be all right in the end, we all become a memory, I'm glad to know at least for him I'll be a good one. I'm so lucky, he's so wonderful, he doesn't deserve any of this but I'm glad he understood I can't go on with this pain. I made him promise he won't blame himself, ever. I've been waiting just to find the perfect moment to hang myself and not get interrupted. I'm so scared all I want is to hear his voice forever echoing in my head. I want to call him again but I won't. It's already been unfair and horrible for him, I can only imagine. He's been the best thing that has ever happened to me. This is so scary I just want this pain to go away I wish he could take it away but he can't. I can't. Love can't cure cancer, so it can't cure a mental illness either. I'm so scared I don't want this pain anymore please i don't want myself anymore
