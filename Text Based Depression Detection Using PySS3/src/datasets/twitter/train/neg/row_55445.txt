Can anyone give me one reason to live ? 

I am only 18 but I may be at the end of my life. I am unable to learn for school, enjoy my hobbies , take care of myself (hygiene , eating food , drinking water ...)

My pain is too great for me to handle it at this point. Only things keeping me here are my mum and my cat. I dont care about anything else than those two at this point. I

know I am probably not gonna finish school / go to uni or get a decent job, but I just want one reason to live other than my mum being sad.

I tried playing on musical instruments, go to therapy regularly and used to work out (now I dont ) , but nothing helped

Fk I just realized how much I actually want to die and how I really dont enjoy being her

I am atheist so Heaven , Hell or God isn't important to me

Thank you for reading this, sorry if this does't make much sense , but I am really not in a great mindset rn and english is not my native language
