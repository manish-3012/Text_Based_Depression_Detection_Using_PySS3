Am I suicidal?I have always been very anxious and I am dealing with my father I had never seen coming back into my life + a rough patch with my boyfriend, it's chaos in my life.  
  
Lately I keep thinking all day, everyday, that things would be so much easier if I got in an car accident, if my plane crashed, if my food was poisoned, if a bomb exploded etc. I don't ever think of doing it myself, it sounds too scary, but I catch myself thinking about the relief of everything ending... I can't get it out of my mind.
