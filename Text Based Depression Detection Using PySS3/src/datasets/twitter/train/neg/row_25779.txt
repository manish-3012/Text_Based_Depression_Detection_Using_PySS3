So, I'm just laying on the couch here watching ghost shows.Had a pretty bad fight today with my girl. We took our kids trick or treating and made up part way through though. I still feel pretty bad.

Been going to trade school for a year. Bout halfway through my classes. I've been slacking though. Just can't find the energy to be motivated or go do things. Im slowly starting to hate myself.  I look back on the 25 years of years of shit I've slogged through and nothing makes me even crack a smile or feel happy to recall.

I have a daughter, and I love her dearly. I didn't know I could love another person as much as I do her, don't get me wrong I love my girlfriend dearly, my mom, family and friends too but it's not the same. Not even close. She's the only thing keeping me going.

I'm losing the battle though. I feel it. I think about dying all the time, how nice, warm and quiet it probably feels. I guess I'm romanticizing it in a sort of way that's akin to a good nap. I can sleep for 14 hours a day easily. I haven't even washed myself properly in a week. I'm feeling pretty low. People ask me what's wrong occasionally but I'm a great liar. I play it off as I'm tired or I have RBF.

I'm just sick of it all. I want to give up.
