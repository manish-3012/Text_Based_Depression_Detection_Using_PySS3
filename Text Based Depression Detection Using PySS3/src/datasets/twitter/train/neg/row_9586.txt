Should I kill myself over loneliness?I'm an 18-year-old about to graduate High School in a couple of weeks, with college and the rest of my life ahead of me. 

I'm a virgin, and I've never had a physical girlfriend or boyfriend. This embarrasses and enrages me. I hate myself for this. 

I'm not too physically attractive, maybe a 6 or 7. I understand why people wouldn't like me, but besides looks, I believe that I'm a very kind, relatable, nice person. This is wasted by my social anxiety and quietness, however. 

To wake up every day alone is to suffer. I can't go a day without crying. I'm coming closer and closer to suicide. I have various methods at my disposal, and while I see the appeal of holding on to life, I'm losing hope and care. 

Why am I obsessed with having someone? Why? Why can't I find happiness in myself and my passions? Why can't I get a boy/girlfriend? Why does the world hate me?

I'm not saying a bullet or a train would answer these questions, but they would remove me from this seemingly permanent misery. 

18 years of loneliness - when could it end, if ever? 

Does it end? Does it get better?
