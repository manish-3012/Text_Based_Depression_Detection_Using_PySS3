I am about to go over the edgeI've head several panic attacks in the last hour since waking up (6:30 MET) and I'm trying as hard as I can to convince myself anything is going to get better but - and this might sound melodramatic - I think there is no place in this world for someone like me. I'm giving everything I have left to not be subjected to another panic attack right now and I'm 95% ready to end it. Please, somebody save me. Suicide Hotlines are no option for me and the few people I have left would just send an ambulance because they don't understand medical care might be what would be right, but it's not what I need right now. So please, internet strangers, help me...
