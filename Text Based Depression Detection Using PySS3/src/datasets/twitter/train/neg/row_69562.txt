I have Sodium Nitrite, why shouldn't I drink it?I've tried hard to find a reason to keep living but I can't find one. I'm always going to have to work(which I hate doing) to stay alive, I'll never have money to do anything, other than barely being able to pay bills. I'm never going to be rich, travel, have children, etc. My life is just going to be work, sleep, and repeat for the rest of my life. Why would I want to be miserable going old when I can end it right now? I don't really know what the purpose of this post is because I doubt anyone can say or do anything to change my mind. Everyone says suicide is bad, but I don't know, it seems like the only solution to my problems.
