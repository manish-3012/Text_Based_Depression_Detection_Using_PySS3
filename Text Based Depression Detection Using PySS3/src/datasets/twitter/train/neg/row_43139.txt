How I cope with things: I donâ€™tIâ€™ve just realised this at 2:30am. Iâ€™m 16f, my dad died when I was 9, and although I did grieve of course I feel like I hid it away in my mind. I canâ€™t even talk about him to anyone now without my eyes tearing up so I stop and then I just donâ€™t talk about him. I feel like this has had a huge effect on the way I cope with everything else.

My mom and step-dad broke up in December, I wasnâ€™t even bothered, and we moved house, I didnâ€™t care, even when my mom was crying I just couldnâ€™t feel bad about the situation because I didnâ€™t want to. When I actually thing about bad things that have happened I get sad, so I just donâ€™t think about them, or try to convince myself I am over them.

I got my first boyfriend last year, and I felt like I loved him, and I was going to tell him and then he suddenly broke up with me in January. I cried for 10 minutes, and then told myself it doesnâ€™t matter, I didnâ€™t actually love him and I properly felt like I didnâ€™t and like I had lost nothing. I donâ€™t even know if I miss him or not because Iâ€™m so in denial. Like I think and dream about him sometimes but then I donâ€™t actually feel like I want him back. I never know what I feel because half my mind is like: you feel this way. And the other half is saying: donâ€™t be stupid, you obviously donâ€™t. 

This is affecting me quite badly at the moment because I feel like my awareness of my own emotions isnâ€™t real because I donâ€™t even know what emotions I am feeling.
