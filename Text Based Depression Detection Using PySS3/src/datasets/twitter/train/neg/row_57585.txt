Killing myself as a statement against the current mental health careIâ€™ve been fucked up since I was just a kid, depression, anxiety, ptsd whatever. Iâ€™m 22 now.!Never getting the help I really need. Iâ€™m on a fucking waiting list for a year now again. Not the first time. Waiting waiting waiting until itâ€™s too late and even when I said Iâ€™m gonna KILL MYSELF â€˜yeah sorry we donâ€™t have enough beds, figure it out.â€™ I live in a fucking wealthy country but itâ€™s all about making money now in health care.  I often fantasize about a public suicide with a note saying itâ€™s their fault and something needs to change. Maybe my death will then help others who are in the same situation. Iâ€™m a lost cause already. I donâ€™t know. Maybe I should just finally do it.
