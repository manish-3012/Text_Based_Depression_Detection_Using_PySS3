i give upiâ€™m, serious. iâ€™m gluing to make sure i donâ€™t fail.
I canâ€™t do it, this is it, what if this is the end for me. I canâ€™t believe iâ€™m able to slowly dwindle out of this stupid fucking place. I appreciate all the support, trust me, i just canâ€™t continue living with so much suffering and misery anymore. Every, single, fucking day. Itâ€™s so much, School, family, depression, everything is too much. Iâ€™ve tried to fix everything, but i ended up fuckjng everything over.  Nothing is helping, i canâ€™t do it anymore. everything sucks and i canâ€™t fucking stand it, It sucks for me, this was my life. Such a shame innit?
Iâ€™m sorry, i love you.
