I wanted to drive my car into the concrete barrier on the highway.As I was driving home today I felt like I couldnâ€™t handle it anymore. I canâ€™t and donâ€™t want to be alive. I donâ€™t want to feel. I donâ€™t want anything anymore. I wanted to drive my car into the concrete barrier on the highway and just fucking end it. Iâ€™ve been thinking about it a lot. I obviously couldnâ€™t do it. I cried the rest of the drive home..
