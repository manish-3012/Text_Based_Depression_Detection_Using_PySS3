i just donâ€™t want to add any more pain to the worldBasically I (17m) donâ€™t want to live anymore. As one would assume, i guess, since Iâ€™m on this subreddit.... the short version is Ive had on-and-off depression and suicidal tendencies for the past 7 years. Life hasnâ€™t been easy, either. My dad has severe PTSD and physical disabilities. My mom works a double full-time job. So I get to watch my 4 youngest siblings pretty much 24/7. I guess you could say our family is kind of dysfunctional. Oh and weâ€™re also homeschooled and I havenâ€™t done practically any substantive coursework in over two years now. Technically, I should graduate high school soon but I donâ€™t think I can show my mom anything to put in my portfolio. Honestly? I donâ€™t care. Iâ€™m tired of everything. Iâ€™m not passionate about any major or career path that Iâ€™ve looked into (Iâ€™m not ready for college anyway lmao). Iâ€™m  not remarkably talented at what I enjoy doing. Iâ€™ve had very few experiences because of my home-life. Iâ€™m not attractive. Every instance where Iâ€™ve tried making something last with a boy has ended in disaster..... I just really donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. But at the same time I know for a fact that there are a lot of people whoâ€™d be pretty fucked up if I killed myself.... and I really donâ€™t want to add any more pain into the world. I especially donâ€™t want to burden my little brothers and sisters with that. But at the same time it would tear them apart a lot to see me give up on myself and throw my life away like I inevitably will. I just donâ€™t know which would hurt worse....
