Ready to end it all - I'm here for solutions to my problemsI have been going through a very difficult time, but it's not depression that's leading me to this decision.  I always reach out to others for help and people say, "It's going to get better!" but I need solutions, not comfort.  It sounds cold, but it's the truth.  I don't want to end my life but I truly don't see another option at this point.

Background:

- got divorced over a year ago

- was left with $0

- I work full time and take home $3200 a month, but my expenses exceed that (even though I don't have cable, internet, any discretionary funds, and live in a studio apartment with my daughter far away from any public transportation)

- can't relocate out of NYC because of a joint custody arrangement

- not receiving child support but my ex pays for daughter's day care; she will be in regular school next year

- was a few months away from having my certification to be a school principal when a situation at work put this in jeopardy, so now I am paying back tuition for a certification that I can't use for at least another 2 years until the situation is resolved

- owe $10,000 in day care expenses from before my ex started paying

- literally drowning in debt even though I have a good job

- I make too much for food stamps or WIC, but every month my expenses exceed my income by a few hundred dollars

- I don't eat breakfast or lunch and I'm still struggling, and it breaks my heart to put my daughter in this situation

I was a few days away from being homeless when, thank God, I was able to get a modest 0% interest loan from my pension (which I have to pay back over the next 5 years).

I drive for UberEATS for about an hour a day in between the time I get off work and the time I have to pick up my daughter from day care.  I can't get a normal second job because I have her on nights and most weekends, and when my ex is able to take her, I only get 12 hours notice.  I have tried to do work online, but I can't afford wifi at my apartment at $70 a month with the only provider in the area.  I just applied for a freelance teacher training position that would pay $1,000-3,500 a day, but I have to attend training in January and then find my own prospects, and take unpaid leave from my actual job to do this, putting my job in jeopardy as it is strictly forbidden to use sick leave to take other jobs.

I do believe that life can be beautiful and I don't want to end it all, but I'm about to lose everything.  I've already sold my belongings and moved into a studio apartment.  I've cut out every single unnecessary expense.  I even wear my clothes more than once so I don't have to wash them that often.  I used to be doing so well and now I'm completely stuck.  

I do not see a way out of this.  I'm here for advice and solutions.  If I end it all, my daughter will be in the care of family who are well-off and who will give her everything they can. My unsecured debts will go away.  A death benefit will go to her in the amount of 3x my yearly salary, with no exclusions regarding cause of death.  Life insurance won't if it's a suicide, but I think my policy is too small to make a difference anyway.  It will hurt her to lose her mom but she's only 3 so she will have few memories of me anyway.

The only family I have nearby is my dad, who tries his best to help and support me, but he can't make this go away either.  We just got back from having breakfast together and doing the math and we've found that every expense has already been cut.

Help.
