i am jealous and miserableeverywhere i go, internet, real life, even fucking suicidewatch i see people talking about relationships... it's to the point where even seeing "gf" or "bf" makes me want to violently harm myself. it has been this way since junior year of high school, when i finally mustered the courage to try asking girls out. rejection after rejection. what hurts even more is that after going to college some of them immediately found boyfriends (some of whom they are still with) when i couldn't even get one single date.

i don't care about sex. i just want a meaningful relationship, i want to experience what a relationship that's more than friendship is like. i withdrew from college due to depression causing me to miss class and now i'm back in my tiny fucking hick hometown, where the chance of finding someone right for me is about nil, which is just another reason i'm posting here today. i fucking hate this place.

i'm doing a website design for $500 (actually less, since i agreed to $12/hr with a maximum of 40 hours, which i probably won't reach since it's just an informational website) but it's not enough to leave this place. i'm just going to end up wasting it on stupid shit, too, because i'm too bored and depressed and have to buy stuff that will keep my mind off ending myself

whatever. i'm tired of this bullshit. i already applied to the community college here so now i'm stuck here for at least the duration of the summer. just fucking end me, i'm not making it to the end of the summer, i will find a way to remove myself from this place, even if it has to be by death
