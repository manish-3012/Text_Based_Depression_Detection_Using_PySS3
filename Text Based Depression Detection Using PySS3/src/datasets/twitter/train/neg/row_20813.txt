Iâ€™ve already decidedI donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting here. Today I decided Iâ€™ll going kill myself soon. I just need a few more weeks to settle everything before I go. I work a shift from 3 am-7am and the go straight to school come home do homework and repeat. Iâ€™m stuck at my job cause of school and Iâ€™m starting to fail school cause of my job. My best friend of 4+ years threw me to the side and blocked me on everything despite me doing everything I could possibly do for that girl. I rarely ever get to see my regular friends and when I do they donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m feeling inside cause they know me as the funny guy. If only people knew itâ€™s usually the funny guy to feel the worst inside. You do your best to make yourself laugh to ease the pain and you make others laugh cause you never want them to feel how you do. Whenever I get serious and tell someone what Iâ€™m feeling I donâ€™t know if they take me seriously. I told one of my closer friends that I know wouldnâ€™t tell anyone what Iâ€™m thinking or planning on doing, that I was planning to killing myself in the near future  and he told me to stop talking like that so I said okay and we dropped  it. Iâ€™m forced into a career plan by my mother and I hate every second of college. Iâ€™ve asked her if I can do what I want and she basically said if I fail my engineering pathway, then she would kick me out of the house. So itâ€™s die now, and be remembered as someone who busted their ass or die as a hobo on the street remembered as a college failure.
