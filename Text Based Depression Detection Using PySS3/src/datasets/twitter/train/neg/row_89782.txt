I posted here before, well I'm back...I posted on here before, but basically, currently I lost all my hope I'm sobbing.Let me put the story in a short piece.I love programming games, I do play games but not addicted, my siblings start to hate me because I bought myself an epic setup, they convince parents that I need serious help, fight breaks out, idk where my computer is right now, my receipts are "Magically" gone (I suspect they took them), and this is a big hit for me, everything I worked for, is on my computer, all my things I created was on it to, and now my, parents, family, think I'm a lost cause, and when I went to the kitchen my siblings told me with a grin on their face "Your never getting it back" and they say "You set yourself up" "You deserve this", honestly, my family is already abusive, and this just added on, my dream of becoming a game programmer, or to pursue youtube, or streaming is done.I just lost all hope, I'm crying right now, and scared, and fuckin pissed at the same time.
