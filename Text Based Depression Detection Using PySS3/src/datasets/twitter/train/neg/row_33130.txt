GOODBYE WORLD.Hi my name's Bella, I'm supposed to turn 17 next month but since I'm gonna kill myself in a few hours I'mma die as 16 y/o girl, I'm writing my note here cuz I have no one in my life to leave a note for (no family or friends), I planned my suicide 10 days ago and then decided to download Reddit to listen and try to help some people before I go, I talked to a lot of good people in these days I'm glad to know that there are still kind people in this cruel world so I wanna thank u all for everything and I'm sorry if I disappointed any of u. I've been hanging out of an edge for so long, I'm so tired, so done and ready to let go now cuz I can't feel joy in anything only pain and suffering everywhere I have no reason to live for so my existence's not neccessary anymore, everything's gonna be better without me and I'm gonna finally feel peace. I truly wish u all the best and endless happinessâ™¡ Goodbye world.
