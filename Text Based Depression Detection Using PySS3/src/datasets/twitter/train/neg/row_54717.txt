can someone talk to me?? extremely lonely suicidal 18 yr old girlI feel embarrassed to admit how lonely I actually am. I literally have no one. I lost all my friends over the past couple years bc my depression made it hard to maintain friendships. Iâ€™m in a toxic â€œrelationshipâ€ w a boy that Iâ€™m still very much in love with. Some times he gives me his time &amp; attention, other times (like tonight) heâ€™s ignoring me, making me feel like shit. He was the only one I really had. I donâ€™t really want to talk about him tho. Weekends are when the suicidal thoughts are the worst for me bc everybody is out having a good time &amp; im cooped up in the house having to get High by myself just to keep from killing my self. Iâ€™ve had several attempts but I thought I was doing better these past couple weeks.. but here I am again.

If anybody out there wants to talk to me to keep myself from negative thoughts that would be great. Either on here or Snapchat, whatever works. It would be best w someone closest to my age but Iâ€™m open to anything to keep my mind off of shit
