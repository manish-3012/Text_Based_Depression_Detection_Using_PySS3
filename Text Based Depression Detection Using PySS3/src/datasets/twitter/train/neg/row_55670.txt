anyone been through a bad breakup?7 months ago I got my heart broken for the first time. It really sucked and still does. About 2 months after the breakup I got into a bad habit of cutting. A lot of the people who I thought had my back pushed me away at this time and I spent the following 3 months in and out of hospital. I think I figured some stuff out because itâ€™s been 3 months and I havenâ€™t cut. I still battle with thoughts of self harm a few times every week. I find my self thinking about the past a lot and wanting things back that are gone. But at the same time I am able to look forward and see that maybe the future has something more for me.
