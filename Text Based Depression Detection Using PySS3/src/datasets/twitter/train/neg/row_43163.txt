Overwhelmed, not seeing a way outMarried with the agreement that we'd never ever have kids.  Once she got the ring, the emotional blackmail began.  I finally relented after a few years.  My son is now an adult with autism spectrum disorder, living at home and attending college classes.

I am a 100% disabled veteran, PTSD and major depression.

My wife is a disabled veteran as well (not 100%), and is out of work from her postmilitary job thanks to her using her disability as a license to overeat herself into morbid obesity and absolutely kill her back.  Her claim for continued short term disability benefits from her postmilitary job was denied today.  Our income just got cut in half and she isn't able to work, and it's all due to her willful self-neglect.

I love my son, but I am completely hosed here.  I've been unhappy in this marriage for a long time, but I was sticking it out to provide stability for my son while he gets through schooling.

I can't leave without being absolutely shafted by the court system.  I'm angry at her and don't dare say or do anything that would trigger that process.  

I obviously don't want to die or I'd just implement my plan and not even post.  I can only fake my way through this joke of a life for so long, though, and my options appear to be to keep living it or trade it in on one that's worse.  If I go quickly enough, there's some decent insurance in it for them.

I know about the VA hotline or even going to ER and self-admitting, but there's nobody who can address the root of this.  I'm hosed and I see no way out.
