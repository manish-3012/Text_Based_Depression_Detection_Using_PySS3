Listen to my story and see where you really areOk, so, I'm by no means the smartest, handsomest, wealthiest, most popular, strongest, or talented guy around. I'm just a guy. Worse than that I have 0 friends. And I don't mean that in a "no one likes me way" I mean it as in "There is no one in my life that is there for me, for real." My family life is average. I have some cool family members and others are just..... people. I am currently in college after having dropped out once before and don't enjoy the structured learning so it's not that much fun. I am unemployed so I can't really afford to do a lot of things. I am not religious at all. I have no fear of going to a hell for killing myself or that there is a loving god who will protect me. Best part is I love living. I love life. I love everything about this world: the good, the bad, the ugly. You have ONE life and most of you here are probably under 25, more likely under 18. I haven't always seen the world this way, I was sad, lonely and had depressive episodes. 
Think about all the things you know are possible in life that you will never get to experience and then think about there are 100x more things than you even know about. Life can be rough but the will to live is too strong in humans. Your posts here prove that. So go outside and live a little. See the world from a new angle and just love life.
