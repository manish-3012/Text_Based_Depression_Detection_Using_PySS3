I feel I have no direction and my political affiliations are ruining my lifeI lost both of my best friends of 7 and 3 years recently, who both betrayed my trust right around the same time. I lost my boyfriend not long after because he lied elaborately about something for the entire relationship and then came clean. I was seeing another man who cheated and blamed it on me and has dropped out of my life.

I have no friends. I went to a festival alone yesterday. Everyone was with someone else, talking and having fun and I had no one to share it with. 

I lost one of my best friends due to my political affiliations. I am involved in far right politics. I want to leave, I want to get away from it, but it feels like the only place people accept me. I have the views, they're engrained in me. Outside of this political group I have nothing, but it is killing me too.

I don't want to end it, but the feelings of being trapped with nothing, no one, and zero direction make that inevitable.
