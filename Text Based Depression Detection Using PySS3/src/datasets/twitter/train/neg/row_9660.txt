I know im a bitch and just need to fucking man the fuck up but jesus christ all i do is stare in the mirror and tell myself to kill myelf.I spent 9 months in counseling but my insurance ran out, and I could afford the 120$ a session. My step mother has a restraining order and came into my work about a month ago telling me she knows where I work and she wants to shop there so I have to quit because she will call the cops if she sees me again. I know it was BS but after that I began having panic attacks each shift and about two weeks ago I quit because I couldnt go in anymore. Im old... ancient... these things should affect me anymore but... all I do now is stare in the mirror and say " kill yourself you piece of fucking shit, fucking kill yourself. Stop, Stop what your doing,SI  go to sleep. No. Seriously. fucking do it. Right fucking now. Fucking do it. Do it right fucking now. Stop looking in the mirror. Stop talking to yourself you worthless piece of shit. Stop. SI. Go to sleep. Right fucking now." I am tired and and im just done.
