The World is Fucked and it is Only Getting Worse. I Don't Want to be a Part of ItHumans are fucking awful monsters. If I could make the human race go extinct, I would. Everything is fucking trash because of humans. I hate to even consider myself one. They are monsters. Things are so horrible in the world, and nothing will change. It will just get worse and worse. I wish I had the balls to kill myself so I don't have to live on this god forsaken planet anymore.
