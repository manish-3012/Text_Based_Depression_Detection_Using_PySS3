I feel like i will snap somedayI am treated so bad, teachers won't care anything about it, i got fucking ridiculed everyday. i have no hope anymore. 

i have read someone's post before that it won't get better someday. if it's over, then it's over. nothing you can do about it. not everyone is meant to have a good life.

i really hoped that reincarnation is true and i will have a good and better life in the next universe. 

well, thanks "god".
