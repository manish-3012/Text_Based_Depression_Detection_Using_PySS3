Lost all sense of positivityI canâ€™t feel happy anymore i hate anyone who spreads positivity itâ€™s annoying it doesnâ€™t help anyone they only list the reasons we shouldnâ€™t do it that make us want to give up and try a new life like â€œyouâ€™ll hurt the ones you love living worth it in the endâ€ we have no one to love and if its worth it in the end killing ourselves will get to the end faster then the pain and suffering we have to go to people who are happy piss me off thereâ€™s nothing to smile about theres a fucking pandemic that has been going on for a year when it could of been ended in a month if everyone fucking wore a mask everyoneâ€™s favorite actors are dying games and music donâ€™t feel the same if lifeâ€™s about the little things those little things are fucking microscopic
