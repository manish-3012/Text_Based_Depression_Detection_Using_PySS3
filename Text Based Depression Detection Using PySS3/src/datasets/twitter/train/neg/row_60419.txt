I don't think i can do this anymoreMy partner who was in an emotionally abusive marriage has gone back to her.
This is the second time, and after the first time I thought we were stronger and we were helping each other but on Friday I knew it was happening again from his messages. When I got home he told me he loved me but she had called him the day before and she seemed like she had genuinely changed and she loved him. He said he loved her and me but he had to hurt one of us.

Apart from all his stuff is hich he will arrange to get through my mom my house is now cold dead and empty
Like me
I want it to end now because I can't go back to the unhappy person I was before him. He helped me to feel happy and now it's all gone.
I miss him so much and I miss his children
I want to die
