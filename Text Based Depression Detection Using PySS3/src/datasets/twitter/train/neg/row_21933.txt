I donâ€™t want to be alive but Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to kill myselfHi my names Andy Iâ€™m 18YO from London England , and Iâ€™m sure absolutely no one will read this but wanna get it off my chest.

Ever since I was a kid Iâ€™ve had few to no friends and those I did get I was always the hanger on and always forgotten. Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship and doubt I ever will be. For the past year or so Iâ€™ve thought how much easier it would be to not exist but too much of a pussy to actually do it.

Iâ€™ve only told two people about this but Iâ€™m pretty sure they think Iâ€™m trying to get attention. Believe me this is the last thing I would want attention for. Iâ€™ve never felt weaker than I did telling them.

As my username suggests Iâ€™m an amateur Muay Thai kick-boxer with a record of 8-0 (7KOs). This is irrelevant and seems just vain but honestly itâ€™s the only thing in my life Iâ€™m proud of. Watching and doing kickboxing is the only thing that distracts me from everything and honestly Iâ€™ve never admitted this to anyone but pounding on someone else is therapeutic to me as sadistic as this sounds.

Honestly donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going with this just wanted to say whatâ€™s been in my head for a year with no judgement.

I donâ€™t want to be alive. But I cant do it myself. Hereâ€™s to a car crash or act of god some time soon.
