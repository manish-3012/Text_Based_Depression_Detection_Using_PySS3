i feel dirty and guilty and in pain. so much pain.i was sexually abused as a child. i've never said that, i didn't even acknowledge it myself until a very little while ago. i feel like i'm gonna throw up. i hate myself. the worst part is i literally begged. i fucking begged for it, every fucking time. i wanted it. why was i born so broken
