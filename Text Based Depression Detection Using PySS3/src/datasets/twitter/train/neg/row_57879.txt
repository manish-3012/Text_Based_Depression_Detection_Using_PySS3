This is it, i can't take it...story here: http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/18y5d8/girlfriend_of_3_years_cheated_abused_and_left_me/

i've had enough, it has been weeks of me trying to cope with the pain but it has only gotten worse and even if i just try to go anywhere or do anything i just break down in a second onto the ground/floor and starts shaking and crying... 

my life without her is nothing but a pathetic meaningless excuse for existing and just a waste of money space and time for everyone else.. 

i even approached my father crying and said i was suicidal and that i only feel that i can't go on living after i lost everything, he just looked at me and said "i know it hurts, it does for a while." and then resumed watching tv without a single word...

there is only one thing i want to do if i have to lose everything i've ever loved so much and that have ever loved me...
