Iâ€™m afraid of life after deathMy boyfriend passed away in June suddenly and tragically. My family is poor. I donâ€™t have any ambitions or aspirations in life because I donâ€™t dream of working for the rest of my life. I smoke pretty often but it doesnâ€™t smooth the loneliness I feel 24/7. I want to make it and become successful as a way to rub it into my peers faces. But at the same time, I just canâ€™t take living anymore. Iâ€™m a 17 year old girl and Iâ€™m pretty popular in my area with mixed feelings about me, being that some people like me, some people donâ€™t. I just know that some people will be happy especially because a lot of people blame me for my bfâ€™s death. The thing is, Iâ€™m extremely afraid of death. Iâ€™m afraid what happens after. I have a few theories but no one actually knows. 

Iâ€™ve had about 3 suicide attempts, one of them put me in a coma and I was expected to die and I wish I had then and there so I wouldnâ€™t know. I know a drug dealer that can hook my up w some tabs and xans. And then I can get alcohol. Like I swear itâ€™s not hard for me to do it, but Iâ€™m just scared Iâ€™ll regret it like a second after I take them and call the police on myself like the other 2 times I attempted and Iâ€™ll be sent to a hospital.
