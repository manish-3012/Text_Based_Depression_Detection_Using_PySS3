Is anyone angry and bitter all the time?I canâ€™t tolerate anybody. I hate the sound of any voice, children playing, cars, people laughing- anything. 

I was always sort of a loner but now I canâ€™t tolerate any human presence. At this point my friends are my characters. I create the people I want to talk to and thatâ€™s my life and Iâ€™m fine with that. 

Nobody in my life understands me or even cares enough to try to understand.
