Too useless to liveThis is short because my hands hurt, and I'm too depressed to go into detail. 
I have been sick and in pain for two years now. I'm going through topical corticosteroid Withdrawal (TSW). The condition causes me to have raw patches of skin. I'm red raw and oozy all the time. I feel like I'm burning or on fire. I'm in constant discomfort. For more info please go to itsan.com

As if the condition wasn't bad enough I literally cannot support myself because of it. I tried moving home with my mom (I'm 23) but she lives with her bf now, and it was bad. My mom started picking fights with me, and wouldn't let me use her bath tub which sounds weird, but its the only thing that relieves my skin. So her action was literally to cause me physical pain. So I really couldn't stay where I wasn't welcomed.
 So I moved across the country to live with my girlfriend and her family.
Today a month later my gf comes home from her first day of work and breaks up with me.
I'm literally useless and alone. I've been fighting suicidal thoughts, but having somebody love me, made it ok. I was choosing my love over fear. Without love I have nothing. This stupid TSW condition left me nothing. I want the pain to just stop. 
Not sure why I would even post this. Sorry for my sad story. Hopefully its over soon.
