16F my life is going nowhere, no talent, no intelligence no support.I know I was a happy baby but I cannot remember ever feeling happy. I hate where I live, it's dull and creativity is shunned. Young girls have the highest suicide rate here. I am not going to be able to move to a city I would like in america because a) no money b) I'm an idiot and an ugly loser, I've been told so my whole life by everyone c) immigration d) I have no skills or talent. I get Cs in everything. I have never been noticed by a boy my entire life the only time they see me is when they want to bully me. I have -1000 motivation even writing this is too difficult. I have to get work experience but anywhere I want to work won't take me and my brain literally cannot work. I don't know what's wrong with me but I'm going to go to los Angeles some time in the future and kill myself by overdosing. Bye
