I don't really think I should be alive.I know, people who care for me would be devastated to hear I died. I should live for them right? What about me? Do I really have to live a shitty live I haven't even asked for? Do I have to look every day in the mirror and feel like I want to hurt myself as I am not a girl? I'm just a weirdo who wastes his life on the internet. Everyone that I feel the slightest bit of connection to just leaves every time leaving me alone. I am tired of this. I have thought so many times this week to hurt myself just to maybe get the power to finally commit suicide. I fucking couldn't. All that I can do is be fucking numb and collapse on the bed. That's it. No crying no anything. Just feeling completely numb. Oh, I forgot to mention. I am 16 right? A teenager. Teenagers can't be trusted or taken serious. I am just a "emo kid" that asks for attention. At least that's how I feel people are treating me when I say about this. A part of this hate towards myself is because I'm a piece of shit and the other one is that I am not a girl. I so hate my body, my face, my everything. Why couldn't I be a girl? Instead I am born a guy and can't even change it. Again, teens are stupid they don't know what they want etc. No one believes me. Also, I'm very sure I'm going to be  ridiculed for this. As much as hate myself, that would give me to hate myself even more. I can't live like this anymore. I want to die.
