Feeling the most suicidal I've ever beenI have OCD, PTSD, and schizophrenia. I saw my psychiatrist for the first time, and he gave me medicine, but some of it, my state insurance won't cover. Nobody cares about the poor or homeless. I want to die, and there's no more hope. I wrote my suicide note, and killing myself this weekend.
