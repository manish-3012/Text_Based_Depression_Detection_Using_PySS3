â€ªI donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything more depressing than finding yourself on the way to the hospital after a suicide attempt and realizing you donâ€™t even have anyone to tell. â€¬Cut too deep, on my way to the hospital to get stitches. Second suicide attempt this month. Iâ€™m already at a residential treatment center but clearly itâ€™s not working. Sitting in the car with a staff member I donâ€™t know and realizing I have no one to text to let them know that Iâ€™m on my way to the hospital. How depressing is that.
