I'm trappedI'm trapped in the military, I'm trapped in my own life. I feel a deep loneliness in my stomach. I desperately want to connect with someone I want someone to understand me but everything feels superficial, I feel like I am always alone, forever until I die. I'm gripping on to this feeling I don't want it to pass, I'm desperate for the loneliness to overwhelm me enough that it pushes me to end it all. It's the only feeling that feels real and true anymore. Everything else feels fake and delusional. I feel like sharing my thoughts just makes other people's life more complicated and burdens then. Everyone thinks I'm doing fine. I'm not really looking for answers, just can't fall asleep.
