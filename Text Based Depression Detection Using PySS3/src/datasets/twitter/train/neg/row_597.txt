My final goodbyeItâ€™s come to my realization recently there is an almost zero chance that I will ever have the life that Iâ€™ve been trying to manifest for the last decade and Iâ€™m simply not okay with that. Iâ€™m no closer to success today than I was 20 years ago and Iâ€™m not going to spend the rest of my life hoping and praying and visualizing that a life that is tolerable will somehow magically happen to me. Itâ€™s become painfully clear that visualization is bullshit. I am so tired of struggling. Always having nothing. Iâ€™ve been in debt literally my entire adult life. Even with two bankruptcies I canâ€™t seem to get my shit together. Every time I try something new to dig my way out it goes to hell. Constant repeated failure really is no longer acceptable to me. I will no longer live with debt that cannot be erased regardless of what I do to try - Iâ€™m so tired of the overwhelming stress that comes with that - Itâ€™s been literally my entire fucking life. I donâ€™t remember a time that I wasnâ€™t in debt and I donâ€™t remember a time that I havenâ€™t been stressed about finances. It seems as though that the universe has decided, without me, that I am not allowed to be successful financially because literally nothing works out for me regardless how much I want it or how hard I try for it.  
About a year ago I had what I would call a spiritual awakening. A realization that we are all connected and that our consciousness is eternal but our time here on earth is only temporary. I believe we choose our lives before we get here and everybody has a mission that is spelled out before weâ€™re born. The bonds we create on earth are actually created long before weâ€™re ever even conceived. We all have a pre-destine mission in life and the universe will push us in a the direction we need to go but we are given free will in order to achieve your life mission. Iâ€™ve had a lot of amazing opportunities in my life, many of which I have completely fucked up beyond what I can ever recover from. Iâ€™ve done stupid things, said stupid things and Iâ€™ve hurt people that I was supposed to walk this life with. Itâ€™s unfortunate because I know I could have achieved great things with the right partner and proper support. I just got tired of waiting and too proud to ask for more help at this point. 
Time for a reset. 
Please also know that there is absolutely nothing that anybody close to me couldâ€™ve done to prevent this - literally nothing - so you have absolutely no reason to feel bad or have any thought of â€œI shouldâ€™ve or couldâ€™ve or wouldâ€™veâ€ done something had I only known how bad he was. 
Iâ€™m so sorry to my family and friends and mostly my nephews. I promise that no matter what I will always look out for all of you from the other side. 
I love you

PS please do NOT have a funeral for me. I donâ€™t want anyones money spent on a ridiculous party to celebrate a failed life. Also, I wouldnâ€™t bother dealing with the CRA or the bankruptcy. Youâ€™ll only find insurmountably crushing debt thatâ€™s pretty much un-erasable anyway... believe me Iâ€™ve tried. Iâ€™m so sorry if my passing has caused any financial strain to anybody. I have nothing to offer financially but maybe you can sell some of my belongings to cover any expenses that come up from this.
Again, Iâ€™m so sorry. I just canâ€™t live like this anymore.
