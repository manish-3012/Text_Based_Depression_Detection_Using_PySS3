tempted and unsure.i know it's been said a hundred times over, but i'm just so tired. i'm just so lonely. part of me wants to spill my guts and just finally get out every little thing that's been bothering me, and another part of me just wants to do the opposite.

i want to live, but i'm so sad. i'm lonely. i'm tired. i can make my problems seem so important but in the end they're only important to me. i don't think there's anyone left.

i've never felt like this before. i've never sat here and had these kinds of ideas, almost like i'm planning it out. and i'm unsure about it, or i'd be gone by now. but i keep reminding myself that there's just no one left. 

i just need to get it out somewhere. i don't know. i can't sleep soundly anymore so i might as well try and distract myself somehow
