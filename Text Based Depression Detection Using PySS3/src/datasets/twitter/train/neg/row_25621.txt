My mom filled a police report against meI posted about this before but I deleted the post then I found out some things.

My mom filled a report against me for slender. She once planned to kill my father and my grandmother (her mother) with her lover and we (my grandma, father and me) found her texts after she was commited to a psych ward. I told this to my sister and apparently my mother found out about this and now is accusing me of slander, asking for my custody and for more money from my father. She said in the police report that I have schizophrenia (I don't but she told all my family I am schizophrenic and she even lead me to believe this for a while) and that she did let me ran away (I ran away from her home because she was becoming incresiagly unstable and paranoid against me and had kicked me out only to "unkick me out" with some violence, of course) because she feared I would get violent. I'm quite devasted. I think of killing myself, I feel really lonely and hopeless. I just wish I had a real family, that people wouldn't ignore me and so on and so on.
