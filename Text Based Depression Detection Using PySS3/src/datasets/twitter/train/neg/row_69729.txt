My life is perfect on paper but I want to dieI have a great life. I'm pursuing what I want to in college, have good grades, a solid group of friends, good parents and a new boyfriend. I have food to eat and a place to sleep and have money to spare. But I don't want to exist. I want to sleep all of the time and I'm struggling with bulimia. I feel like I used to know where I was going but I lost my way and I would rather not exist. I spend hours looking up ways to painlessly kill myself or ways to die. I wish they would legally euthanize healthy people. I want to die. And there is no good reason, so I feel like a fraud. i can't talk to anyone about this. Someone help please.
