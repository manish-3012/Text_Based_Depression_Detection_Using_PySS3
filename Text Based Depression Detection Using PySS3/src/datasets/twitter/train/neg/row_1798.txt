My classmate killed himself a few days ago. Today the police found his suicide note. It was addressed to me.I didn't know him much. I honestly just knew him as the guy who swore way too much with his friends in class.  


I barely talk to him maybe once a week? And even then its him coming up to me and then leaving in the middle.  


I understand suicidal thoughts, I have them too, but why??

His suicide note said that he loved me. That I was the single best thing in his life and that he was already saving up some money to take me out on a date (they found about $1200 cash). But it also said that his loneliness was too painful and that he's "unlovable".  


I dont understand... He never showed that kind of interest in me when we talked... I dont know. Maybe I'm gonna go up there to him.  


Why didnt he tell me? He always seemed like a cool guy, I wouldn't mind going out with him. I... I want answers. I was emotionally detached from it but now he's involved me. He loved me. I know what that meant to him, the entire school saw his scars. His note was 2 long pages of everything he found beautiful about me.  


I'm fucking crying. I promised myself I wouldn't cry.  


C, I'm coming soon. I just need to figure out how. And then you can take me out when we're up there and I'll let you kiss me, no problem. But please do tell me what made you do this. Please.

  Yours.
