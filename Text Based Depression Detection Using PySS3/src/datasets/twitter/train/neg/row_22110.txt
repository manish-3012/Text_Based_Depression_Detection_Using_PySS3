I'm not sure how to helpNot sure if this is the right place to post.

I'll start off by saying I know snooping is bad, but I was concerned.

Recently, My husband mentioned to me about a post on reddit about a person just wanting to die and how he feels the same way. "Not in a suicidal way, but more of just an accelerated path, nothing matters what he is doing. He's just doing what society wants him to be doing." Of course, I got concerned and tried to talk to him a little more about it, but he didn't really seem to want to talk about it and changed the subject. 

Later that night he was showing me something on reddit, and I noticed he had a different username than his usual account. I looked up that account later and saw all his posts about depression and suicide and his loss of will to live. I did see one about how he doesn't want to kill himself per say, but he wouldn't not try to die if something were to happen. He's just going through the motions and nothing seems to have meaning to him. "Life is just a disturbance between periods of peace" and he just wants an accelerated path to that peace.

 I know he's struggled with depression. He was seeing a counselor for a while, but it seemed to just end when winter happened and bad weather prevented him from getting to appointments. I noticed a difference and thought he was doing better, apparently I was wrong. 

 I'm just baffled to be honest. We're not a couple that hides things from each other. I don't know how I totally missed this, or maybe its more common than I thought. I'm not sure how to bring up that maybe he should start seeing his counselor again, or that I even saw his alt account where he's getting all these feelings out. Some people say suicide is such a selfish thing to do, but is it selfish of me to want to keep him here for myself and our kids? 

Any advice here is greatly appreciated. Thank you.
