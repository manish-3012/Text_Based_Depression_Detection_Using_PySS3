Need helpI was in a seriously abusive relationship with someone who undoubtedly has sociopathic tendencies. Ever since I've gotten out of it 6 weeks ago, I've been seeing a therapist twice a week which has been helping. Every single time he asks me if I'm suicidal I lie because I don't want to end up in a psych ward or make my life anymore difficult. I know the pain will lessen over time and it has, but it's such a tremendously hard uphill battle. I'm very fortunate and privileged to have a lot of people care about me but sadly ever since this relationship I've learned the extent of human selfishness. We're all going about our own lives concerned with our own problems. Never in my life have I had suicidal thoughts before but now they are stronger than ever. I really don't know what to do, but I really don't feel like I'll ever be okay.
