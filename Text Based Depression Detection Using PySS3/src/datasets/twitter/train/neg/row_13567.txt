A poem I found that nearly perfectly describes the way I feelIâ€™m great, fine, spectacular. In a way
I relish every night, and I live every day.
I live, I laugh, I write, I sing,
I wonder what the new days will bring.

Then I get home, and I take off the mask.
The day, and almost impossible task, 
Is finally over, and so I lie Down, 
and wait patiently for the day that I die.

I cry, I scream, I bawl, and sleep,
even though I have promises to keep.
I wait, and wonder, and cry some more, 
And I ache and burn from my very core.

Then, Iâ€™m not alone, and the mask reappears:
Out goes the grief, pain and all of the tears,
As I am a happy person, cheerful all the day.
A world full of rainbow, not one shade of grey.

Of course Iâ€™m not okay, Iâ€™m not fine,
No matter how much I seem to shine.
I donâ€™t even know why I feel this...
Why my existence is one long, endless abyss.

But it is, and will be, so I cling to life,
As one day I might slip, and end it with a knife.
But, Iâ€™m still here, no matter what my dreams might say
And I hope that one day I will actually be okay.
