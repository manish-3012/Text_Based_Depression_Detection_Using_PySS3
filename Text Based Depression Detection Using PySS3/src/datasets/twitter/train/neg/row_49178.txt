What To DoI've been in rough points in my life before, but it wasn't until earlier this week that I started legitimately wanting to kill myself. I've daydreamed of standing on the edge of a highway and jumping in front of a speeding car last second so they can't stop in time. I've also thought of chugging a bottle of NyQuil and tying a bag tightly around my head. I don't know what to do. All that's stopping is fear of messing it up and how I would effect my family. Although now that I think of it, it might be a good example for my dad, and maybe my brothers can be treated like humans like I never got to. I'm too depressed to do schoolwork so I'm going to fail Sophomore year and I'll be sent to a public school. Last year, I was an Honor Roll student. Wtf happened to me and what should I do?
