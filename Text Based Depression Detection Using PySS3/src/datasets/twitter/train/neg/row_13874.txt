AnxietyMy anxiety is so bad I canâ€™t even go hang out with people. I get invited and then I get so nervous about it that I ignore everything and stay in my room. 
So I end up blowing them off but not on purpose. I also hate confrontation so I donâ€™t want to disappoint them by saying I canâ€™t make it. 
There are only so many times I can say my phone broke. Itâ€™s too much pressure going out and getting into a conversation about my life because itâ€™s fucked up and embarrassing. 
Iâ€™m a horrible person. And Iâ€™m lonely. I only feel confident to be around people if I have Xanax. 
I also know Iâ€™ll never in my life get a boyfriend - I have the worse smile that canâ€™t be fixed by cosmetic surgery Iâ€™m honestly cursed. Especially because everyone says a person is prettiest when they smile. 
Well not me. Why does god give certain people ugly features and other people beautiful features? Itâ€™s not fair. 
So I basically ignore people so Iâ€™m not forced to smile - what a life.  And it prevents me from doing any social media. I would never in my life use Snapchat - so I am left out of a huge part of society by not participating in social media. 

I really want to kill myself. Iâ€™m just figuring out the logistics of it. I wish I knew what happened when we died so I could feel more confident. And Iâ€™m getting older with zero money saved for retirement. So Iâ€™m going to die alone and poor and ugly. 

Iâ€™m not looking forward to living the rest of my life poor, ugly and alone. Iâ€™d rather go out now while I still have a bit of dignity.
