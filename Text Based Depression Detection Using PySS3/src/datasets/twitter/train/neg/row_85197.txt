Stupid reason. But it was like the last drop.Today I found out that I no longer have gf. Likely she found somebody else, and now doesn't even want to come from her town for winter holidays, which we already planned, and she purchased a ticket. But no, tha't all in the past, now she comes up with stupidest reasons not to come and generally avoids talking to me.

Screw it. But sadly it became a really bad moment in my life; first girl in ten years, I thought I finally was able to find gf. No, I'm unable. Cry a lot today after I came from work, hard to stop. Now a bit better, I was even able to go to store, but still feel extremely exhausted.

Listenign to sad WW1 song, calming...

Don't know what to do next. No desire. I want relationships, but I can't have such a roller coaster again. Why is it so extremely hard? And again, one more lonely christmas awaits. I was close to death soem tiem ago, tha's sad that I remained alive then. Maybe next time.
