Surviving suicide attemptQuick question, has anyone survived a suicide attempt before? If so, did you never feel the same way you did before your attempt? I survived a suicide attempt in a forest about a month ago via overdose on oxy, seroquil, melatonin and liquor. Still wondering if im just emotionally recovering or not. I also overdosed on MDMA about 2 weeks ago and feel even more dead. Who can relate? When you feel dead inside, does it stay that way forever ???
