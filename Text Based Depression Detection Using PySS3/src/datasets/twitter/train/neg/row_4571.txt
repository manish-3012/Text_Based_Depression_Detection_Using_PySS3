My life is fine, but I'm ruining itI just don't care enough for anything, so it's all going to shit and I honestly think I'm going to kill myself so I don't have to deal with the consequences of not trying for the last few months. I'm about to be kicked out of high school because I stopped going, I just couldn't see why I should bother. I'm a senior with one semester left and I don't think I can salvage this semester so I either have to retake all of my classes and graduate a year late, or just give up and drop out. Honestly, I just want to die, but I'm terrified of what happens once you're gone.

People like me, but I don't have any real friends I can talk to. I have superficial friendships. I've never been in a relationship, but I have casual sex pretty often. I've never met a girl who liked me as a person for more than a week, everyone who likes me only does because I'm pretty. The only relationship stopping me from ending this is how much it would ruin my parents and how much my pets would miss me. I don't think any of my friends or fuck buddies would care for more than a week or two.
