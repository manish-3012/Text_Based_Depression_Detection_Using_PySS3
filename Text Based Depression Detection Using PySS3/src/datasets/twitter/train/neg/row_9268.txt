Current pandemic makes me wish my suicide attempt was successfulI attempted suicide when I was 17 (now 30f)
I tried to OD in sleeping pills and to this day canâ€™t stand the sound of birds chirping in the morning. 

Over the years Iâ€™ve had moments I was thankful and even felt like there was some greater meaning that I didnâ€™t succeed. 

The only reason I didnâ€™t was I was young and dumb,/!; I donâ€™t think I can keep going. 

Iâ€™ve had some good times over the years but I donâ€™t really think itâ€™s been worth the effort.
