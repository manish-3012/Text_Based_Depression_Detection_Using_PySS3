someone please kill meI want to die. 

I donâ€™t know if I want to do it myself.

If a car hit me right now, I would be fine with it. But I donâ€™t want to wake up after the car crash. I want to die, I donâ€™t want to fail in dying. I donâ€™t want to fail in dying. Iâ€™m too much of a coward of what might happen to kill myself but every time the thought comes into my head every single day my mind instantly leaps to the pocket knife hidden in my bookshelf. Iâ€™m too much of a coward to do it. Iâ€™m too much of a fucking coward to kill myself and Iâ€™m too much of a fucking coward to live anymore. I donâ€™t want to be here. I donâ€™t want to be here. I donâ€™t want to fail. I want it to be over for good, with no exceptions. No ifs. I need it to stop. I canâ€™t do this and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
