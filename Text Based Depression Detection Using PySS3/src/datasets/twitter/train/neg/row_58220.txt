Breaking downFirst off, male 25. My ex girlfriend came back into my life for a bit and we became pretty good friends again. But she wanted more and I couldn't get passed old issues we had. Well just recently I had a change in those thoughts, I opened up to her. But she said now she wasn't sure and that I had made it seem so clear. She told me she still loved me a week ago 4 days befora I told her I developed feelings again. I'm at a loss. I haven't been this depressed in 5 years at least. Everything hurts and I feel ready to just give up and break. Today was the first time I harmed myself in 3 years. I can't keep food down. I had to leave work early because I just couldn't keep my legs under me. Just need help please.
