I am dead inside[14] I feel literally nothing. And I don't even give a shit anymore if i accidentally died or something like that. I have no social life anyways. Nothing excites me anymore. There are dozens of people my age who are better than me. I am fucking useless. I have no creativity. I cant even come with a better title for this post. I think I have seen literally everything. This world is shit. I want to die
