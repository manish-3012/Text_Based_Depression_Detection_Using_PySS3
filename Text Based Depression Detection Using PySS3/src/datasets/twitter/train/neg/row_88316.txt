I will never attract the kind of woman I find attractive and that simple fact makes me want to kill myself. Is that pathetic?Since I was a kid all I wanted in life was a girlfriend who is pretty both inside and out but Iâ€™ve never been able to attain a relationship with one. They donâ€™t even look my way.
