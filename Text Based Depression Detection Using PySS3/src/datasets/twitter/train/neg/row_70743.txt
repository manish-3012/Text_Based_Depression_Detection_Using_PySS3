brain damaged and nothing in the world can make me feel any emotionsEver since last July I have been developing painful health conditions and I no longer see any reasons to continue life. I have very painful heat intolerance and because of my location I wont be able to go outside much until October, I also have debilitating shortness of breath and I have lost 20lb from a gastrointestinal disease. Since march I have been unable to eat without pain and nausea and I don't even like food anymore.

While all these issues may sound very depressing my biggest issue I face is that I no longer feel any emotions and it has been gradually progressing since I first noticed it last summer. I know it is being caused by an organic brain disease because I have been losing my memory and academic ability since the 10th grade in high school 4 years ago.

The things that make normal people happy, sad, or scared make me feel nothing at all anymore. I know that things have changed because sometimes if I listen to my old music or read old books, I can still remember what I was thinking when I first read it and I can tell that all my emotion is completely gone nothing in the world can make me happy or sad no matter how hard I try.

I am already taking the antidepressant Wellbutrin but it doesn't work as well as it needs to for me to care about being alive.
