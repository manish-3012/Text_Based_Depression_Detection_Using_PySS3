Whatâ€™s the big deal?So I attempted to kill myself, but it wasnâ€™t working correctly, so I stopped trying. A few hours later my friends asked me how I was doing. I told them what happened, but out of honesty and a curiosity to discuss why I failed, not because I was looking for help. They didnâ€™t see it the way I was seeing it and got really upset and angry. When I was attempting, it was just a matter of fact thing. I wasnâ€™t really thinking about much. And my friendsâ€™ response ended up making me feel bad about myself and giving me a desire to try again. They also told me the way I was doing it wasnâ€™t a good way, which is laughable and made me want to prove them wrong. Iâ€™m the one here thatâ€™s done the weeks of research.

I dunno. I donâ€™t really see what the big deal is or what the point of it all is.
