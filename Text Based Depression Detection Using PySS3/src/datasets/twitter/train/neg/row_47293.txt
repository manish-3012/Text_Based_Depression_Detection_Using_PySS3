I only need to stay strong for a couple more monthsIn July my life insurance policy is going to include suicide. I'm going to kill myself so my family can afford to pay my 100k of student loan and credit card debt. I'm a failure beyond all failures I could have dreamed of. I was the first person in the history of my family to go to college, and I had to fail out of one that costs more per semester than my family makes in two years, especially now that my parents are retired. I work 40 hours a week minimum wage but I still can't afford my payments. When my parents die I won't be able to afford anything. So I'm going to kill myself so they can pay off my debt and live a quiet, worry free life for the rest of their lives, however many or few years that may be. I'm sorry I failed everyone. I love you all. I'm so sorry.
