I'm fucking pathetic.Not really sure what to say so this will probably just be weird and rambly... But pretty much I'm 18 friendless just finished my second semester of college. All I do besides school is play video games and reddit/YouTube. I'm overweight and have been pretty much all my life because i am a lazy piece of shit. I know I need to change I know I need to do something but I don't because I simply don't want to put the effort in... I don't want to work out, I don't want to do my classwork, I don't want to grow up and get a boring job. I don't enjoy anything anymore and I hate myself for being so lazy but no matter how much I do I've never been able to force myself to do anything.. I've never had anyone to push me to do things my parents just ignore me for the most part and I don't have any one else that cares about me either. At this point I don't want to live anymore... Dieing would just be so much easier... I wish I could to make myself change but I don't know how...
