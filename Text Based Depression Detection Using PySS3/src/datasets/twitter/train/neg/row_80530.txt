Dead Mans SwitchSo, Like 30 mins ago, I just found out one of my friends from high school had sent out a DMS to his best friend, and I've just been pacing back and forth like a dumbass for over an hour. I just got off the phone with 911, and they told EMS would be on the scene, but he's missing so hopefully I get an update soon, and don't have to hear tthe worst.
