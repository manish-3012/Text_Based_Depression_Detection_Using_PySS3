Feeling severely isolated with no one to talk toI have no one that cares about me except my mother who is highly medicated for her bipolar so she is of no help to me. My brother won't ever talk to me and my dad doesn't give me much attention. I could just continue to sit alone in the basement wasting each second away playing cs go but I need more to my life than just a game. I feel as though I don't even want to talk to anyone anyway because no one knows how I feel, and they probably don't because I recently got out of the mental ward and they diagnosed me with depression and autism. I have zero social skills and even when I do get the chance to talk to someone like a therapist I chicken out and say I don't want to go. I've played over 2000 hours of cs go in 10 months and I'm sick of the game but I don't know where to turn to next, except severely injuring or even killing myself. I can only pay attention to the negatives of my life like the fact that I dropped out of school because I was severely bullied and how I'll never have a gf because I don't even feel comfortable enough to open up to my mom about the pathetic life that I live. I won't ever get the help I need because I'll never open up enough for anyone to understand the way I feel. I don't know what else to do besides trying to overdose on my antidepressants or jump out in front of a large truck. I don't want to end up in the mental ward again, I was treated like shit in there and they made my self esteem even worse. And I still haven't even begun to get into the most depressing part of my situation. It feels as though the only thing that will make me happier right now is attempting to kill myself. Demoralized is the best way to describe how I feel. The only thing stopping me from killing myself is my mom and she is as mentally unstable as me and has been in and out of mental wards as well. I feel as though I'm just waiting for my mother to die so I can just kill my pathetic self.
