Not going to do it, but been thinking about it a lot.For some years now, if I've thought about a bad memory or how I imagine my future I'll involuntarily mutter that I want to kill myself. But lately I've felt a weird compulsion to write a suicide note. I thought it might be way I'm telling myself to let my feelings out, because I wouldn't be able to kill myself if I tried. I just don't like having these thoughts in case I decide to act on them at some point.
