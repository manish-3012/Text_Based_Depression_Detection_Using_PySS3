okay so this is a long story and let me just say I don't mean to belittle anyone or seem homophobic

hi my name is Sara im 15 years old bi and live in Canada where I haven't experienced that much hate for my sexuality externally i suppose but anyways when i was growing up everyone said " that's so gay" or f\*ggot a lot i went to a Catholic school where gay was bad (not saying all religious ppl are like this just the ones I went to school with) and my dad always taught me that gay was a sin but i also grew up with a lot of gay people and all i saw where people they were my big sisters cool friends why would i care who this kissed at that age kissing was yucky anyways so i didn't really think about it until i was about 10 and my mum told me it be okay if i was a lesbian and something inside me cringed and i said i wasn't and went back to whatever i was doing at ten skip to a few years later i was 12 or 13 at the time and me and my friend well call her sam went to go see that movie chips and basiccly there was a sceane where kristen bell is in a swimsuit and i stared at her in awwe and thought fuck maybe im gay i pretended to have crushes on boys to keep my secret i figured i should be sure before i tell anyone about my lessbian-ness then eventually i genuenly did start liking boys so i googled what does this mean like tf and afer about 800 am i gay test i figured i was bi cool whatever eventally i told my bestfriwd sammy who identified as that she was cool with it at this point in my life i was dealing with some self harm and other shit but my orientation was something i was cool with skip to summer of grade 8 a few of my friends knew and i had had a crush on sammy for a bit and told my other friend L me and sammy ended up making out then got in an argument an she said some stuff and basiccly we wernt talking then i come home one day the week before grade 9 to my sister on the couch she says we need to talk she tells me thst her and mum know i kissed a girl and basiccly made me figure out what i am right there and then then made me tell mum i was bisexual i really wasnt readfy yet i figured it was sammy who told them and she said yeah it was and im gonna tell others so i rushed and made a coming out video and i got possitive replys i didnt go to that catholic school and my dad dosent use the internet so that was fine ig turns out my sister found out from reading my texts to L i was freaked tf out for the first month then said fuck it and i was a proud bi even went to pride and eventally it was like my thing i hung a flag and had to have everything rainbow then im like ok this is annoying i need to not eventally i started coralating myself liking girls as being bad idk how but i did but i coulnt let anyone know this bc im fine with every other lgbt person why coulnt i like myself so until about a month ago i pretended to be chill withj it i wasnt i feel that same sinking cringe feeling as when i was 10 i asked an older friend of mine whos not straight if she hated it too she said no and looked at me funny so clearly im the only freak who feels like this and i feel bad bc i shoulnt feel like this everyone (dad still dosent know lives in another city) was exepting so why am i so selfish feeling like this? i cut myself and tried to overdose out of guilt of being like this 2 weeks ago cut to a few days ago i cried and ripped my flags down and hid them and told everyone i was straight and looked at them like they were crazy if they stated otherwise now i really just want to die i hate it sm and no matter how much i pray or try to be straight it doesn't work so i want to die to just stop the guilt and gross sinking feeling inside and if im dead ill never have to tell my dad and step mum that im like this and i won't have to deal with my other issues but this is the big one umm yeah sorry that was like an absolute bible but yeah please help me what do i do will i always hate myself or is there something i can do about this or should i give up and kill myself (btw im not saying lgbt ppl deserve to die also suicide should never be an awnser but i cant see any light in this tunnul im hopeless and not getting anywhere)
