Depression with heartbreak makes going on impossibleMy heart hurts so badly I can't take it, I can't see a way out, it won't stop and I don't want to die because I have parents and a sister but I can't keep going either I haven't slept in so long I don't know what to do in trying my best but it hurts so much I can't make it stop
