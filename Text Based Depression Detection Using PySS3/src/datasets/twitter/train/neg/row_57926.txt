Help is ineffectiveI've been on at least 3 different anti depressants over the last 2 years, which have proven quite ineffective. I quickly coming to a line where I will become homeless for the 3rd time (Im 27). I work anywhere from 60-75 hours a week and yet still can barely afford to eat more than once a day. I can't remember the last time I was actually happy, my life is just marred with strife, pain, and loneliness. I'm just tired of not going anywhere, im tired of being sick, hungry, cold, and alone. I really hate and despise this situation and just want it to end with a short drop and a sudden stop. Happiness isn't something I can attain or even feel anymore, once my homeless deadline hits I doubt ill have the constitution to work that hard just to live in my car.
