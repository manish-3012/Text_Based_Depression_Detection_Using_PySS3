Feeling a bit more... happy?I talked in depth to one of my online friends and rant. I'm feeling better and people here gave me tips and help on how to cope. Thank you very much for that^ Even if knowing I don't want to die, why does thinking of suicide make me cry so much? Not dying by the word itself.... 

How do I get thick skin? Maybe I cry because I am over sensitive? If not having that, does it mean I'm pussy? Sensitive and weak? I don't want saddness, but why do the bad thoughts always come back?
