Angry at my twin sister for telling me she would be destroyed if I killed myself...She just doesn't get it. No one does. The thoughts are constant, my heart is permenetely broken and there is no hope of me every pulling it together. Even she admitted she didn't think I could get over my ex or have a normal relationship because I'm so mental ill. I'm too far gone and I just want the pain to stop. 

Thing is my sister treats me as if I don't have any illness, that I'm just some petulant child screaming for attention, someone to be ignored and not encouraged but I'm dying inside. I'm dying inside and I want to be dead before I'm totally gone. I don't want to live that hell.

I'm working at a camp now where I could do it. I could hang myself from a tree and someone other than my family would find me and keep them from suffering. I can't go to the hospital cause I'm at this camp and can't miss any sick days and what will the hospital do for me? Keep me there until they think I won't do it an let me out again. Suicide hotlines? HA! they just tell you to go to the hospital cause guess what... there is no fixing me. I'll just always be in pain. 

The humane thing to do is to kill myself and be allowed to kill myself without the guilt of one family member hanging over me. 

She's a healthy happy person, why does she get to dictate what I do? I need to die.
