My mum crushing my dreams...I just turned 13 4 days ago (happy late b day!) and I know what I want to be. A cross country runner. I dream was to be a netballer before but that ended when I wasn't allowed to join the netball team. My parents (mostly mum) are OVER protective and when I asked my mum to join the cross country team she said yes! I was sooo excited and told all my friends, they said good for you your really fast and I was like tell me something I dont know(I didn't say that but I was thinking it).The next day I asked my mum again because saying yes didn't sound like her, she asked if it costed money and I said maybe..... so the answer was a straight up NO. She said I should be more like my older sister (shout out nicest sis ever) but shes the smart one and im the sporty one and everyone knows that I'll never be as smart as her. Anyways I wanted to join the cross country team so much that I cried to sleep the night she said no. What should I do to be able to join?? BTW I've NEVER thought of suicide (just saying cause the url says suicide watch which also sounds kinda creepy). BYE hope this didn't bore.
