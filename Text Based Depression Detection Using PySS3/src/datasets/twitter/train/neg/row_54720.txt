I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but my best friend has attempted suicide multiple times and I have no idea what to do.Background info: Me and my friend are both 14 (so you can just leave now if you're gonna brush this off as "kid problems"), and we have known each other for about five years.

So, my best friend, let's call her Alexis for the sake of the story, has generally always been a happy girl. I've known her for about 5 years now, and while she does frequently have quarrels with her parents, she's generally an optimistic girl. This past month or so, though, she's been different.  Her and her parents have been fighting more frequently, with them calling her names and making fun of her. She was really distraught over it, so I tried to comfort her. Fairly recently, we were talking about how her depression has been getting worse and worse, and she confessed that she had attempted suicide twice. This confession hit me like a sack of bricks, I was devastated. Since then, she's been saying things like, "I don't think I can handle it anymore" and "I'm just done with it all", and it honestly mortifies me. She says that her fighting with her parents does play a part in why she tried to kill herself, but that the main reason was something bigger, something she couldn't tell me. This really worries me, since we practically tell each other everything, even our deepest secrets. I'm really trying to support her, but being so young and all, I don't have much experience in that department.

Sorry for dragging this on so long, but I really need some advice. How can I be there for her? How can I help her through her depression? I'm sure there are people on here who are a lot older and wiser than me, any advice or tips would be much appreciated.
