I have been alone my entire life. Never had a single person I felt close to. What is it like to care?I am going to be 30 in a few months. They made a movie called the 30 year old virgin, but I am even sad compared to that. I haven't even held onto a girls hand walking down the street. I have no clue what it feels like to have someone love me. I could give up all my money and possessions to live on the streets and be happy as long as I had someone by my side, but I will never have that. I am just working so I can eat when I am able to. I am so depressed that I force myself to eat once a day, sometimes every other day.

I did meet someone this year that I thought hey maybe she might like me. She was a kind single mother of two. I helped her out when I could. Things like her car broke down so I drove two hours to fix it. When it died i bought a PT cruiser that was in rough shape from a buddy, I spent 2 months fixing it up for her.... Well anyway none of that matters. Now she is with someone else. I am yet again forgotten. 

I am working to eat, so that I can die a slow painful death. I have been burned, stabbed, thrown, and injured many ways in my life. But nothing hurts more than this loneliness. I would give anything, do anything to have someone in my life.

I don't know what I expect from this. Guess I am just hoping I am wrong and there is someone out there reading this. I can't go on like this.
