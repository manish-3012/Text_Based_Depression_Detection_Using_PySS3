No matter what I do, it just isnt enough.Had trouble finding a job after highschool. Constantly ridiculed for it.

Started college. Constantly ridiculed for my progress.

My semester absolutely sucks. They changed all my classes last second. So I decide im likely gonna drop and get a job for now.

Get an interview for this week. Felt amazing hearing back about a job for once. Told family. The FIRST thing they said was â€œyou need something long termâ€

Just completely fucking defeated. Every single time I try to do something to help myself all anyone can do is complain it isnt enough. A full-time job paying ok above minimum wage. Its something until I can find a better job when one becomes available. Ive been searching for weeks.

I just cant. Ive been facing an uphill battle with mental illness most my life and especially these last 4-5 years. Its becoming evermore apparent theres nothing I can do to please this awful world. So great. Im now suicidal for the third time in a week.
