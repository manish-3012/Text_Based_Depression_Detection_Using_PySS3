Pls help meI feel no one truly likes me for who I am. Everyone likes me but know one has a special connection with me.  People are just nice to me bacause they are good people.  If I had no traits other than my personality no one would want to be with me. I want to kill myself but I donâ€™t know how. Pls donâ€™t depress me more with the comments,  I just need to get my anger out
