i wish i were deadfor as long as i can remember iâ€™ve been unhappy. my whole life iâ€™ve had issues with mental health. iâ€™ve always thought about suicide but only now am i seriously pondering it. 

i really have no reason to live. i am ugly and socially inept. i have no friends, no talents, no skills, no hobbies, and no motivation to do anything. i am painfully mediocre at everything i do. not only am i extremely ugly but i am also gay and too socially anxious to try dating websites which even lessens my chances of getting a girlfriend. 

iâ€™ve tried taking several different antidepressants + anxiety medications, working out and talking to new people which didnâ€™t help. nobodyâ€™s advice works for me. i hate humanity and the way people treat each other. sometimes i think iâ€™m too sensitive to live in this world. 

now i just have to wait until my parents die to kill myself because i know it would devastate them and i canâ€™t bare the thought of it. i wish i could just die in my sleep tonight instead of going on like this forever.
