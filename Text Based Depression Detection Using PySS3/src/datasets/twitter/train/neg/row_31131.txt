Just thought I should tell someoneIâ€™m 19, my parents were abusive and controlling, I didnâ€™t realize it till a year ago or two because I was so brainwashed. The night I turned 18 I moved out and was homeless living with random guys and getting addicting to cocaine while still trying to finish highschool. Iâ€™ve been raped a few times, I canâ€™t remember how many anymore. I had to move back in with my shitbag dad because I was robbed and I couldnâ€™t take the sexual abuse anymore. I met a really, really amazing guy who is in the navy and stationed here, heâ€™s helped me so much. We dated for 2 months when we first met and I ended up breaking up with him because I wasnâ€™t feeling it. Weâ€™re still close, but heâ€™s leaving for Florida in a few months and Iâ€™m going to be alone, going with him isnâ€™t an option. I donâ€™t have any good friends other than him, Iâ€™m surrounded by horrible people. I smoke weed daily just to get by, the rapes left me pretty fucked up, I canâ€™t find a decent job, recently I tried to get my life together and go into the navy but my ex trying to look out for me told me I wouldnâ€™t be able to handle the stress and bullshit people go through there. Iâ€™m going nowhere in life, I have no one, Iâ€™m terrified of ending up a druggie or a drunk piece of shit like the rest of my family. Iâ€™m ready for all of this to end. I tried calling everyone on my contacts list to try and get help but not one person answered. I feel like Iâ€™m trapped in my head and I just wanna die man. Iâ€™m over it
