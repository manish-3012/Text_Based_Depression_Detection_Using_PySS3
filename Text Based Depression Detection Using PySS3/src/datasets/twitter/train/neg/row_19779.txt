Won't it be wonderful...When we can truly place ourselves in a virtual reality. Our bodies sustained or suspended while our minds are fed dreams filled with whatever our heart desires. 

I'd like to think death is like that but I can't help but feel it would be more like nothingness, a lack of existence. It's just hard to comprehend because existence is all we've ever known.

I'm tired. I'm angry, I'm bitter, I'm hurt.  I want to say I'm numb but I'm not when all those things are still present. I'm numb of joy, passion and hope. I was never built to survive, I live in a fantasy world that is my mind where everything is romanticised and everything means something.

Let me continue living in that world til my last breath, let me pretend. Tell me about you instead. Tell me how your day was even if it was boring. Tell me of something you like to or would like to do no matter how small, like cuddling up on the sofa and watching a movie on a rainy day. Tell me your healthy passions and fantasies.
