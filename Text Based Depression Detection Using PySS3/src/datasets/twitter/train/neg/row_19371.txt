Not sure if I'm in the right place.....Things came to a head tonight....I have been fighting with my wife, and my mother is dying. (stage 4 lung cancer that has spread to her lymph nodes in neck, and is cutting off her right lung)  Add this with years of depression and you get me staring at the end of a shot gun.  I was debating getting on something but i was trying chantix to quit smoking.  I am now not a quitter so I was just wondering how has anti depressants treated you??  Also I will be getting on something, cause i literally have to.

(it was more of just a straight up break down than a recurring issue, but still I am aware enough to know this is SERIOUS AF)
