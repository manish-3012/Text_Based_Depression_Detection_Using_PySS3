I know my life is never going to be goodLast weekend I got very close but I was able to stop myself. I don't know if I will be able to stop myself again.l this weekend.

I truly feel like everything's over for me. I tried to be a musician but that didn't work out. I have good intentions but I'm just not very talented. At 26 years old I am also too old and jaded to really feel that same spark and confidence I had when I was 20 when I thought I was good. 

I tried transitioning but that was another failure. I'm back to being "male" though I can never fix what I did to myself.  

I don't have a career or friends for that matter. I am too depressed and insecure to commit myself to anything without bailing out at the last second and I am nothing but a pity party. I spend my time every day strumming the guitar aimlessly and just racking my brain for a reason to go on. It's not there anymore. There is no hope. 

I am still able to hold down a job but only because my boss is sympathetic to me and I'd guess know I am struggling immensely. I had a panic attack earlier this week and ended up fainting. I was thinking about how I destroyed my body and how utterly doomed I was.  I had to Uber home that day. 

I just want out so terribly bad. I truly truly want to die. I wish I could seriously ask for help  but I can't fix my mistakes or all the time I've lost. I haven't had a single happy moment since I graduated from college and even that experience was mostly negative. Life is never going to be good, I am going to be lost forever. 

Thanks for reading.
