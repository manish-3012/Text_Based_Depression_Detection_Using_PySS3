My anxiety is pulling me into my doomhello there. My name does not matter, all i can say is that i'm someone beyond help. i'm very much a hypochondriac and anxious, and it's killing me. my fears have spiked in severity as of recently, and i fucking cannot take it anymore. i cant see the future i used to believe in so much. tomorrow, once i get home, is when i'll find a way to escape it. i apologize in advance.
