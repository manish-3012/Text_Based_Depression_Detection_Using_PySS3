I just want her to hug me againHi

My gf who I was madly in love with broke up with me when I was kicked out of my house by my mother a few months back. I dropped out of university which is why I was kicked out.

Since then I haven't really...even been touched at all by another human. She used to hold me and cuddle with me and make me feel whole. The way she hugged me...it just made me feel safe. I miss it more than anything. I loved her more than anything.

Now I just get drunk every night and cut myself to feel any sort of emotion. I'm dead. I just want a hug

Please

I can't go on like this anymore
