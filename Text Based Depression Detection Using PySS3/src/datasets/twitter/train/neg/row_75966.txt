Becoming comfortable with the ideaI have been struggling with depression and anxiety for over 25 years. I have my good days and I have my bad. Right now, the bad days have outnumbered the good. I would have a bad couple of days and then have one good one. The cycle would then repeat. On my bad days the thought of suicide would enter my head and would scare the everloving bejesus out of me. Lately, Iâ€™ve been less and less scared about the idea. I have been in the mental hospital twice this year alone, three times all together. 

I have been physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by those close to me, by those I could not get away from, and even those that I could. 

I am socially awkward as I never learned how to form close friendships. I have tried to settle on things and those things have backfired on me so bad. 

I keep buying things that I donâ€™t need in an attempt to guilt myself to not kill myself and leave my family with my debt.  I am literally trying to buy my own life. 

Iâ€™m tired of pretending, of searching, of failing. Iâ€™ve lost so much and gained so little.
