I don't want to be told it's okay, I want to be told I'm wrong, but I know I'm not and there's nothing I can do about itTherapist just keeps saying it just comes from my insecurities my family gave me and shit and whenever I think about it (the fact that girls (people in general) can fucking get off with the bath tap or water jets and showerheads and sex toys and fucking shit) I want to fucking believe that they can't, I fucking hate everything that has to do with sex

I read a post on the front page or somewhere I think from /r/TIFU or something about some girl when she was 15 discovering masturbation and she read online to try shower heads or the bath faucet and she had the faucet in the bath all the way on and she said she came instantly like her stomach was pulsing and jelly legs and everything and I just want to fucking die

My girlfriend a long long time ago told me about how showerheads were the best feeling and pool jets and I want to fucking kill everyone

Why can't sex only ever be something that has to do with love and nothing to do with fucking physical sensations

I'm not insecure about like my performance or whatever, it's more along the lines that these other things give literally INHUMAN sensations and it fucking pisses me right the fuck off

My therapist says that even if my girlfriend uses showerheads or loves how it feels (i told her that 'it made me uncomfortable' and she said she regrets and wishes she never did it but that doesnt mean it wouldnt still feel good and she wouldnt naturally want to (i swear there is no way out of this)) that it doesn't mean *it changes how she feels about me*

What the fuck, that doesn't fix anything for me

I think about her wishing I could make her feel as good as a showerhead can

I get fucking disgusted, thinking about girls using things like that

I think about girls getting fucked by dudes and not caring about anything because it feels so good, or riding a sybian and the same thing, or a hitachi magic wand

The fucking thing that makes it impossible for me is because either I fucking put up with it and keep everything in a shell and accept it but always want to die

Or I can just make it known how I hate all things that make people feel good sexually if it's not a single person, and I know that since my girlfriend used to use the showerhead that she does love how it feels and only doesnt do it because of my fucking insecurity

Throughout a lot of my middle school I watched a fuck ton of fucked up porn, pretty sure all my retarded ideas came from it, like that every girl naturally wants to be dominated and had vibrators on her and just loses their mind if it feels good enough

I fucking hate everything related to sex and I want to kill myself because to me, everything I hate is a fact and I can't do anything about it, either accept it and hate it or be in denial, knowing that I am, and keeping my girlfriend from doing what she thinks feels good

She said that if I got a fleshlight it woiuld make her extremely upset

WHy don't they fucking make extremely unnatural robotic shit for men? all the crazy stuff is fucking vibrators and dildoes and all for woman, literally the best thing that my dick has ever felt is my girlfriend, and the best thing my girlfriend has ever felt is a showerhead, and that's not even the best thing there is for her

I want to kill myself not because I think I'll never be enough, because as my therapist said, a showerhead isn't compassionate and doesn't love or have feeling and doesnt cuddle after sex, and if my girlfriend was using it, she was probably thinking of my anyway

But that's not it

Because when I read on the front page about that girl having an orgasm from the bath faucet, I wished she was dead and I was too because I can't kill everyone

I really want the world to explode right now more than anything in the world

I can't leave me girlfriend because I love her and she has it really rough and I try to be there for her, but I'm not meant to be in relationships, I should be a recluse and avoid people because everyone, unless they had some accident, has a part of their body that can be physically stimulated in such a way and of such magnitude that they lose their minds and don't care about anything in the world other than whatever it is making them feel good, and wanting more

I want to kill myself because it's true, and there's nothing I can do

When I see those couples that are like "Yeah we use toys in bed, it's revitalized our relationship" all I can think about if a guy using a vibrator on his woman and her loving it and that's it, nothing for the guy because the best fucking thing there is for dudes is an actual fucking vagina

Sorry if this post doesnt fit with the sub, if I posted when I wasnt having a breakdown it would have been much shorter and less repetitive, more concise, but I've only posted once before a long time ago

**TL;DR:** People have orgasms, people are physically and sexually stimulated, inanimate objects provide inhuman orgasms, and I want to kill myself and I'm super immature and edgy
