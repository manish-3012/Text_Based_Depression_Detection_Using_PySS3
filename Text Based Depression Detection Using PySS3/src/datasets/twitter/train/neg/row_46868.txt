Daily survivalI always wonder is it just me who fights every single day to not off myself. I try to think maybe the next day is going to be better or maybe my situation will change but lately itâ€™s getting harder and harder to live for that reason. I get close some days and hold the gun In my hand and picture where Iâ€™m going to do it and then thatâ€™s when that hope usually kicks in but itâ€™s becoming less and less inspiring lately. I know Iâ€™m probably not alone even though it feels like that all the time of every day. I think about calling 911 before I do it so I can leave a recording for my family but I really donâ€™t know if that would help them or make things worse. I have written a couple letters already but I think maybe a last recording might be good to leave behind. I literally donâ€™t have anyone who I can talk with about this. I donâ€™t want to be committed somewhere so the therapist route is not going to happen so here I am on reddit. Iâ€™m sure one day soon that last bit of hope will fade and I will leave this world behind. I use to love life at one point but itâ€™s been along time since I felt that way.
