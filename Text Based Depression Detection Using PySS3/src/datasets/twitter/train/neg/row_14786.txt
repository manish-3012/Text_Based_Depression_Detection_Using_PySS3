The only true reason I am alive..The only reason Iâ€™m still alive is because I donâ€™t want my debt to go to my family such as my student loans and I donâ€™t want my choice to die to permanently affect my family forever so I stay alive and continue to suffer. Life has no meaning and I wish everyday that I was never born. I feel like life is suffering and I am bored of being here and have nothing to look forward to. Everything I try and do ends in failure and disappointment. All the beauty that people talk about in life doesnâ€™t compare to the suffering of existing. I feel like itâ€™s such a massive effort to do everything and to exist I wonâ€™t even say live. I hate the struggles I have that I canâ€™t control and the numbness I feel and disinterest I have in life. The only reason Iâ€™m alive now is to work, be alone and die. I have given up on romantic relationships and friendships. Iâ€™m too depressed and tiring to be around but people donâ€™t see how much effort I put in everyday and am told to try harder and life is a choice. I just wish I didnâ€™t believe when people say it gets better because it doesnâ€™t and hasnâ€™t and just donâ€™t see the point of continuing to stay alive. Everyday I envy those that dead from covid or sick in the hospital from covid and then I see that suicide might not work and I wish that assisted suicide was a thing. The other night I had a dream that I was shot and that was the most peace I had ever felt but then I woke up and everything started again. I just have zero desire to stay here. I donâ€™t even want things to get better, I donâ€™t want to be happy, I feel numb and just want to die.
