Just a little thing to talk out loud for onceWell to start things off Iâ€™ve been at the lowest stage of my life, family has stopped associating with me a while back so I got no one to talk to. Iâ€™ve been homeless for a year and have only recently been able to stay in a hotel every once in a while, jobs have been hard to come by so Iâ€™ve resorted to live by unemployment which really hasnâ€™t helped considering I really donâ€™t get much to sustain a healthy lifestyle. Iâ€™m a 22 year old male living a complete life of solitude which has put me in a mindset where I canâ€™t get out of this hole Iâ€™ve put myself in, its as if when I try to reach out thereâ€™s always something to push me under even more, I really donâ€™t want to have suicidal thoughts but is as if the world has put a giant weight on me to the point where thereâ€™s no getting out anymore. The looks I get as if I donâ€™t belong where Iâ€™m at, it just hurts to the point where Iâ€™m disgusted with myself and canâ€™t even look at myself without hating every being in my reflection. Sorry to cast this long message on here, thank you for anyone that took the time to read, even thinking that one person read this without judging helps more than anything.
