Should I put a bag over my head to contain the mess?So I'm going to blow my brains out here in a couple minutes, but I don't want to make a hell of a mess in this apartment. Should I put a bag over my head so atleast most of the splatter will go in the bag? Sure the bullet is going to go clean through my skull and out the bag, but I figure most of the brain matter and blood will be contained in the bag? It will be easier for the authorities and coroner to clean up.
