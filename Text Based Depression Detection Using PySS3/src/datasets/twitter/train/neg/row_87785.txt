Iâ€™m really hoping I did in 2018 tbh.Iâ€™m only a 15 year old girl. Some might say thatâ€™s young,  but I donâ€™t really care. My life is pointless. Everyone yells at me no matter what I do. Everyone leaves me for no reason. Ugly with low self esteem. Never had a boyfriend. Nothing redeeming about me. I highly doubt Iâ€™ll do anything successful in life, so why continue? My parents always tell me being an adult sucks. I hate my life already, so why in the world should I continue into adult hood? Iâ€™m on antidepressants and they make me (I guess too happy?) and I laugh too much while Iâ€™m on them and it supposedly pisses of my parents so Iâ€™m confused. I canâ€™t be happy nor sad. When Iâ€™m trying to make friends, Iâ€™m either too annoying and clingy or jealous, or boring and uninteresting. I havenâ€™t done anything the cool kids have done such as drugs and drinking. Iâ€™ve never been to a party (unless a birthday party when you were like 10 counts) and Iâ€™m not talented or smart in anyway. School stresses me the hell out. Iâ€™m just done. My mom claims she loves me more than anything but I donâ€™t believe that. My dad probably doesnâ€™t care about me nor do my non existent friends. Whatâ€™s the best way to kill yourself? That would be the best wish of 2018.!
