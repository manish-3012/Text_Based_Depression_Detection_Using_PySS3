I waited for my life to get better but it still hasn't?I'm thinking about just killing myself. I don't see the point of living anymore. Life is not worth living. I have nothing to live for. Nobody cares about me anyway. If I die people will just laugh and be glad. Nobody will even come to my funeral. Nobody likes me. People like to bully me. I'm done.
