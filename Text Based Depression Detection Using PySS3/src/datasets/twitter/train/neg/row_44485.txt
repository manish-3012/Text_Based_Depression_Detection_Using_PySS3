AI've been getting 2 hours of sleep for a couple weeks now because all I can think of at night is I want to die. I told my dad how I feel about a year ago and he said I'm not because I have no reason to. I cant find any anti suicide websites that don't require you to call a number. I feel sad at day and suicidal at night. I've made 2 accounts and selected the give help and support thing and nothing has happened why won't it work
