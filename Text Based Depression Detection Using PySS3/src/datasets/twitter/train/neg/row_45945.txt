Suicide is a good plan...think about itAlive: learn how to be an adult, learn how to be polite even when angry, develop a dependency on substances, figure out a way to be sober, find someone who will love you and put up with their shit the rest of your life (and everyone has to), be a parent who doesnâ€™t pass this Suicide tendency down to your kids so you suppress it (causing a worse situation I imagine). And I havenâ€™t even started on the political climate (everyone is racist if they even dare support trump publicly, I am not a trump supporter but I find it odd nobody is allowed to agree with any single thing he has done or is doing without being raked over the coals, this is only an example) and COVID....

Suicide - Iâ€™m dead, I canâ€™t hurt anyone anymore, I wonâ€™t yell at my kids anymore, I wonâ€™t fight with my wife anymore, I donâ€™t need to go to work anymore, my political opinion wonâ€™t matter and COVID canâ€™t hurt me.

Seems pretty open and shut to me. I know youâ€™re all having these thoughts too. Life is hard and itâ€™s too hard to live for it anymore.
