I've dug myself into a hole so deep i cant see the top. (Also in r/assistance)I recently found out im pregnant to a guy who has now gone back to his ex-gf and will no longer speak to me. I just got fired from the job i quit my first job for because im pregnant and can't work on a farm apparently. I got scammed out of my last few dollars by a con artist, and haven't managed to get anything back. I was living on the farm i was working at but cant stay there anymore so am now crashing on peoples couches for as long as they'll let me, and finally, my family is all in New Zealand and can't help me other than to tell me to come home (which i can't afford to do and also don't want to do). I know i need a job, a place to live, and probably to go home but i just cant think about any one thing long enough to fix it because its all happened in the last 3 days and its burying me. I dont know how to climb back out and im worried that since i have clinical depression im going to do something stupid if i don't fix anything soon.

TL/DR; I'm broke, homeless, unemployed, pregnant, and in a different country to all my friends and family. I dont know how to get out of this hole and im scared im just going to dig it so deep that theres no way up for me.
