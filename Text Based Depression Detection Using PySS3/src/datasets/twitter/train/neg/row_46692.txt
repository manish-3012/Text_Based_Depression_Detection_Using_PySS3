I need some advice.My brother (22) has been in a depressive state and has threatened suicide multiple times since July because his first girlfriend broke up with him around then. He wonâ€™t leave the house, he wonâ€™t work, he wonâ€™t play video games, all he does is sleep. We try and try to get him up and we even took him on a trip to Denver last weekend, and as soon as he got back he went back to the same as he has been since July. He refuses help from his family, friends, and wonâ€™t go to the doctors. He left a suicide note two weeks ago but came back the next day. At this point, should we get him admitted by force? I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I panic every morning when I wake up to check my messages. He needs help, but wonâ€™t get it.
