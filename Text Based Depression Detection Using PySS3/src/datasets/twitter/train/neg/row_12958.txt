Burning coal with room sealed tight as I type.I've explained my issues enough to friends, doctors, strangers, and myself in these 6 years.

I was abused by my parents.

I was sexually abused by a stranger.

I ended a 7 years time of therapy and medication because I give up.

I have a cancerous disease.

My parents are divorced.

The boy I was going to have a future with cheated on me.

I stopped classes. I stopped social media. I stopped video games. I stopped eating. I stopped everything. I'm so hungry and depraved and ????

I don't love myself. I live for others and others hurt me. Now, I don't want to live for others.

I used to be top in class and university. I was always executives of student organizations. I was the one friend, girlfriend and daughter that did her best and succeeded in all eyes of strangers and familial in her prime because they wanted me to. I took in other's hate easier. Hate and hate and hate and anger and anger and sadness and apathy.

I attempted suicide recently and failed. I spent the night at the emergency ward. 

My mom told me I was humiliating her for doing that. My ex friend pretended to care and told others I'm toxic to take advantage of taking up my exec position.

The smoke will make me sleepy soon.

And I'll sleep.
