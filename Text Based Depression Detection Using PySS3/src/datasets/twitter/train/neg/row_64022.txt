Ironic username huh?I really have no one to talk to, or that I could feel comfortable with sharing where I am at right now. First off, I don't feel suicidal, having dealt with suicidal attempts and thoughts in my past, I can honestly say now they are just thoughts that intrude when I am depressed or feel down. I know better than to act on them, and that they are just dark thoughts that enter when I let my guard down. And I've never felt so low, things just aren't going right for me and I feel like I'm losing grip on who I am sometimes.  Im just having a hard time blocking out these thoughts of ending my life, I could use someone to talk to.
