My suicide plan is looping in my head. Can't get it to stop.Thinking about suicide again. Can't keep doing this. Even made my plan, although I don't know how effective it will be.

Wrote down the steps, but I can't post them here. For the better I suppose.

It's looping in my mind. I'm scared that it will be painful, and am sure it will be. I feel so normal about it and it scares me.

I have a lot of friends, and can imagine them and my family being very upset. Only a very few and my parents know of my struggle. I don't feel keeping myself alive is worth the pain that I will have to keep facing and the pain it saves them.

It feels like I am going through with it. I just need an opportunity. Don't know what to do.
