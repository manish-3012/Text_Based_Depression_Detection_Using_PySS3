Reasons not to contemplate suicide?I really hate life sometimes, and at this point I'm kinda sick of it. I'm sick of the hopelessness, the boredom, the discomfort and all the crap that I go through. I want to kill myself so badly. Another thing is that I can't share this with anyone I know, because our conversations don't go anywhere. I can't understand why I was put in my family, or why I have the friends that I have. I'm done trying to make myself feel as though any of this actually feels worth it. I want to die.
