I just want to dieIâ€™m laying here and just thinking about my life and what itâ€™s become. Iâ€™m sick of it. Iâ€™m not happy. I hate everything. Donâ€™t want to do the things I once enjoyed doing. Iâ€™m so tired and just want to be dead. I canâ€™t stand who Iâ€™ve become. Canâ€™t even look myself in the mirror. I want something to happen that will end my life. Iâ€™m tired of my thoughts. I canâ€™t do my school work, canâ€™t eat, canâ€™t sleep, and Iâ€™m just so fucking tired of it all. Iâ€™m ready to just expire.
