I am not wanted, welcomed or belong here.But will be prevented from leaving regardless.

Unemployment. I am unable to acquire a source of income to feed or house myself, but I am not even allowed to die? What am I suppose to do here, be a financial parasite to people stuck raising me because they happen to share blood with this wretched person? 
That naive idiot who stupidly believed born incompetence can be overcome with effort, swearing to make a new life away from this shitfarm called a country, who came running back with his tail between his legs when he failed doing that, just like everything else in his life. Back to the abuse and cultism infested *home*. 

After swearing that you would end your life if you ever had to go back, what a joke. Killing yourself? Oh no, look at all that mental distress and pain you will cause to them, so go ahead and stay alive.... to be a fucking financial strain on them. What? You actually believed you had a choice here? Don't be stupid, be a good little slave and keep being a nuisance to those around you, that is your purpose in life.

An idiot would be able to tell that the right choice here is to end my life, but every-fucking-body will get in the way of me actually doing it, for what reason? How many of you even come close to the idea of death in your day to day life that qualifies you to judge that I belong to life? Does it bring you pride and satisfaction that you are performing your cultural teachings despite it being completely irrational and unfair? Does it bring comfort to your delusional reality that life will not ever turn for the worst so long as you deny the reality of my situation? Do you fear to admit that dying, ending your own life, *Suicide* **IS** the correct answer to certain conditions? For what reason then do you get in my way? For what reason am I stopped. Please enlighten me, for what reason? FOR WHAT FUCKING REASON DO ANY YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DENY ME THE DIGNITY OF A CLEAN DEATH!? YOU WOULD FORCE ME TO SUFFER TO SATISFY YOUR OWN SELFISH NEEDS, EVER FUCKING CONVENIENTLY PEGGING THE LABEL OF *MENTAL ILLNESS* TO DENY THE SENSE I MAKE. YOU WOULD DISREGARD MY WELLBEING TO FULFILL YOUR OWN, WHAT REASON IS THERE FOR ME TO RESPECT YOURS? WHY DO I NOT JUST KILL MY WAY OUT OF THIS SITUATION!??

Oh. *Oh*. Look, now doesn't that sound exactly like a mental illness? We were right all along. (Â°â€¿Â°)
C-O-N-V-E-Fucking-N-I-E-N-T.

Before you even consider wasting your breath of me, I will say this: The fact that the majority of "suicidal" people stem from perfectly solvable problems that simply require you to work through pain and stress only aids to validate those self-righteous fucks in their denial. You disgust me just as much as they do.
