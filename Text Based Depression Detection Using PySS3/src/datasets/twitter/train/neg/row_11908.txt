Let's be real... It is not worth anymore....I think I have reached the conclusion that nothing matters and that I am going to finally kill myself this month. I bought poison, it is going to be delivered soon I hope. Not the best method out there but it is what it is. I am going to the woods, close to a river, lie down and let it be. Maybe I will do it and then jump in the river, if one doesn't do its job, the other will.

I am tired of everything and everyone. I think I am in a toxic relationship somehow. I don't know what I have done to deserve all that but it doesn't matter now.

I wish I had someone to talk to. It doesn't matter anymore.

It is pointless to talk about it because I know nothing will change.

I'm pathetic and I am sorry about that.
