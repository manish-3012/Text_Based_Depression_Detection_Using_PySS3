I'm planning on suicideI don't wanna die but I want the pain to end. I've been planning on killing killing myself IF things don't get better soon. Maybe I won't do it but if things get worse then I can't handle it anymore. But I'm still planning on doing it. I've been googling suicide methods and writing suicide notes to my family members and other important people. I still think it could get better but if it doesn't I'm gonna do it
