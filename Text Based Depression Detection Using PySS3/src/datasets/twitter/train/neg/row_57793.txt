A week ago today, I failed at committing suicide. I can't tell anyone and I can't go back to being normal.I took the week off from work and told them I got the stomach flu.

Monday-Wednesday were spent throwing up and sleeping. Thursday I watched Netflix, Friday I vacuumed my apartment for the first time since September, Saturday I did laundry and Sunday I picked my dad up from the airport.

Today was my first day back at work. I started the day thinking maybe my failure at dying could be a new start for me, maybe I could be better and lead a better life. But by 9am I was overwhelmed with the daily stress of my job, by noon I had a panic attack and soon enough I was sobbing in my car at 4:30pm as I drove home. I can't fucking do this. I can't go back to normal. The happiest I've felt in 5 years was when I swallowed the last handful of pills and really thought death was finally coming.

I don't have another method in mind yet, and the one I tried was fucking awful. But I'm fucking done with this.
