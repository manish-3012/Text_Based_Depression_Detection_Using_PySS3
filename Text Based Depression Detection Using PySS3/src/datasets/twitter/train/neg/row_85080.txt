I can't figure out why I'm fighting so hard to stay alive anymore.I've had depression for a few years now and it's been a constant struggle of keeping my body safe from my mind. I just can't find a reason to do that anymore. I'm so exhausted and I don't know how it is fair to myself to keep living like this. At some point I'm supposed to see it all get better but I haven't seen that at all. 

I'm tired of telling people I'm depressed and don't feel safe by myself. They're all annoyed with me, they don't understand why it doesn't go away. "You were doing so much better though" "I thought you were over this" "Fake it 'til you make it" because faking it all this time has done me so much good. 

I'm done.
