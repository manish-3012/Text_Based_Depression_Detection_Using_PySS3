28, In Debt, Unemployed, Depressed, Just Moved HomeI've struggled with depression on and off my whole life. I just turned 28 on Monday, and this year I feel like I ruined my life.

I started a bipolar research study last November and was on an experimental medication that helped me out of a tough spot. I also had a good contractual job that ended in December. I finally was out of debt, and it seemed like my life was stabilizing.

I made a series of bad decisions since then though. I paid for these emotional intelligence trainings and stopped taking the medication in February because I "felt better", then I felt so good that I paid for online business coaching programs with credit cards that I can't afford.

This whole time I didn't have a job. When I realized what I had done, it was already too late. Now I'm $15k in debt, unemployed with a spotty resume and job history. I moved home to my parents' house with 4 months left on my lease at my old place because my car broke down, and I couldn't pay for the repairs and I stopped taking care of myself. I felt bad because I didn't want my girlfriend (who I lived with) to feel like she had to take care of me when I couldn't. I feel like I've fucked up my life and like there's no way I can turn things around.

Everyone keeps giving me advice and encouragement, but the truth is I've hated every job I've ever had and feel like I have dug myself in too deep of a hole this time to get out of it.

I keep running from my problems and can't face myself. I know people around me love me, but I can't see why. I've been selfish. I don't feel strong. I feel like I've wasted every opportunity that's been given me, and I'm ashamed.

I want to die because then at least I'll stop being a burden on everyone around me. Right now, I feel like I'm just going to continue to be this ungrateful, underachieving person for the rest of my life. And I can't live with that.
