I've been on the brink. It's all getting very real.First I wrote a letter. Then I wrote another one with a list delegating who I wanted my belongings to go to. Then I wrote another and cleaned my apartment, making sure my social security card and all other important documents were laid out so no one had to search. Another day I rounded up all the pills in my house and just stared at them thinking "I could do it and no one would barge in. No one would get here in time or wonder where I was." With each day that passes my will to live shrinks and it terrifies me. I'm in therapy and all but I'm just not meant to live on this world. There is no place for me. Everyone feels like a stranger. I'm paranoid and can't relax. I'm angry and bitter. I don't want the rest of my life to feel like this because the pain is unbearable. Everyday of my life is a mental breakdown and I just can't take it anymore. I can't say if I will or if I won't but the option is there and so far, it's the option I'm most fond of.
