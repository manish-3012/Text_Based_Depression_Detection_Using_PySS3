We're All UniqueEach of us are unique, each of us have problems. Some that we can't help. I won't explain some sickness or asthma I have, because those problems don't even come close to the one I am about to inform you of, reader. I have Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism.

For years, I was told my brain was wired incorrectly, and being talked down to on and on about that. Still, I today struggle with communicating with others, and I have extreme sensitivity. And I don't mean just getting hurt by words, no, but by noises. I get headaches, and I'm unable to withstand how my clothes feel sometimes. Noises from the bell ringing between classes, restraunts, theme parks. These things may sometimes all work together to form a sensitivity overload, as some call it. This is basically when you lose control and can't take all the things coming at you.

Here's a little about me, to let you all know...
I'm in high school, and I happen to have a plan for the next twenty-four or so years. Finishing high school, entering college for free because of going into the military after, doing ROTC during college, military, then become, hopefully, a writer. I don't have any friends that come over to my place, no one hangs out with me. Doing pretty well in my classes, above average grades. I enjoy drawing and especially drawing. Also a fan of the Big Bang Theory television show and a bit of superhero stuff. My social anxiety (which comes along with the Aspergers package, woohoo!) pushes a lot of people away from my life. My dad lives in another state, days away from me. That's because of job reasons, so he can work, and the rest of the family miles away is supported. Police were called a week ago from yesterday on me by the person who called my brain "incorrectly wired".

And today, I post for the first time on reddit.
