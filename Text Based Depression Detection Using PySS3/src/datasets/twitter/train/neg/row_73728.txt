I donâ€™t want to be here anymoreI canâ€™t find a job so Iâ€™m just living off my parents money. I have really great friends. Probably the best Iâ€™ve ever had. But I have no idea why they like me. The thing that really makes me not want to be here anymore is how fuckin ugly I am. Itâ€™s so hard for me to value my life when I know how other people see me. I just wish I would not be here anymore. Iâ€™m too afraid to kill myself and I know my family would be sad but I donâ€™t wanna live like this anymore. And I know itâ€™s a stupid reason to be so upset but I canâ€™t help feeling this way. I have since I was 12 and it stopped briefly when I was working but itâ€™s back again. The sinking feeling that Iâ€™ll never be loved. That I donâ€™t deserve anyone or anything because I look like this.
