I'm going to kill myself after the weekendI had a whole post written, but it was accidentally deleted (I'm on the mobile version). 

So in short, I have no future, all I do is bring my friends and family down, and I just can't handle living like this anymore. Everyday I feel severely depressed and nothing has changed that. Id usually self harm to feel better, but it's losing its touch. I can't stand being alive.

I would do it tonight, but I have a few plans to finish on the weekend. I'm posting this on here cause I'd just like to tell, someone, how I'm feeling before I go ahead with it. I obviously couldn't tell my friends and family, they'd intercept. I could write a note, but that would be too much to write, I don't have the patience.

I hope this will work.
