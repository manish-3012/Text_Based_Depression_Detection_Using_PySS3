I hold no purpose in this life.I made the worst mistake of my life in February 2018. At the time, it was the middle of my junior year of high school, and I suffered a mental breakdown and had to leave school. I was #1 in my class at the time and possibly couldâ€™ve been valedictorian if I stayed. 

I started doing online school after that, but Iâ€™m just now starting my senior year while my friends are going to college. Iâ€™m so behind. I hate myself so much for leaving. Iâ€™m such a fucking idiot. I went from being the best in my class to nearly a high school drop out. 

I donâ€™t have the energy to keep going. I wish I had had a true senior experience with my friends but I gave that up. Now my life is set for failure. Everyone is curious asking me when Iâ€™ll go to college, what Iâ€™m doing with my life... etc. Being a fucking failure is what Iâ€™m doing. 

I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I hate this life.
