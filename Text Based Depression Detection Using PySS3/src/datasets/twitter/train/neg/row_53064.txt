Stop saying it's selfish.I've been having suicidal thoughts for a very long time now. I went to therapy, but not by my decision. I've attempted to kill myself by going to a super busy road and jumping in front of the biggest truck I saw, but I realized I might not die if I did, that's the only thing that stopped me. People have said, it's selfish to kill yourself because of the people that love you, my own sister told me that. But if they did love me why don't they act like it?

I have lots of 'friends' but I'm always left out, and there's no way I can voice that I hurts me without sounding crazy and jealous. People say that I care to much about what others say, but how can I change that, I was raised in a good home, but I was made fun of my entire life. That's who I am, that's how I was molded. 


I feel like if I was gone, no one would care. Yeah, my parents, family, and family friends would be sad, but they would go on with their lives. I'm nothing special, I don't have anyone that really needs me. Not to sound like I took this from something, but I could honestly die, and the world would keep moving, people would keep living, and it wouldn't be much different then the other people that kill themselves. 

I live with my parents who are hunters, I've hunted before, and I know how to load many different types of guns, I know where that main veins are, and I could easily load a gun, point it at my head and pull the trigger, or I could cut myself where it only takes 3 seconds to bleed out and die. So what's stopping me?
