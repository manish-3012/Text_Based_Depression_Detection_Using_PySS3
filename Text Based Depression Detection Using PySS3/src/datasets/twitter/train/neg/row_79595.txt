Lost my dad to cancer a few years agoIâ€™m almost 18 and I feel like these past years have been so hard and I want them to be over. Moved to a different country after his death and I think Iâ€™m ready to end my life here. I canâ€™t take the pain anymore knowing I can never talk to him again. He wonâ€™t be able to walk me down the aisle, watch me graduate in a few months, he wonâ€™t ever meet my future children so whatâ€™s the point of doing these things without him. I have accepted that my life is not ever gonna be how it used to and Iâ€™m not willing to go through life without him anymore.
