Ten years of abuse and all I can think is that maybe ending my life will open their eyes  It's been almost ten years since I was first raped at 13. From 13 to 16 I was raped and emotionally abused. Since then, I've done a lot to try and recover, try and trust again, try to love and be loved.
For a while it worked, I've tried again and again to let people get close and to I've tried to love, but every time I do, my lover leaves me or cheats on me. 
Two years ago, I was pregnant but didn't know until I miscarried, and it took a serious toll on my mental health when the would-be father stopped talking to me. It took about a year before I opened up again. 
In October when I did finally feel like I was in love again, I found out I pregnant with twins and I had an abortion. A week ago, the would-be father of that pregnancy stopped talking to me out of nowhere, with no explanation. I finally broke down and contacted one of his best friends to ask if he was ok and he told me that his daughter was born 3 days ago. He hid it from me the entire time. 
I've tried so hard to march on, putting my baggage beside me but after 10 years of constant abuse I just want to die. I can't imagine a future where this doesn't repeat itself over and over again. 
And just maybe if I were to kill myself, maybe they could see the impact that they've wrecked on my psyche. 
I'm in so much pain and I can't cope anymore. 
:EDIT: I replied to the friend who I contacted, now he blocked me. I feel especially defeated now. He was a mutual friend of 9 years.
