Why canâ€™t they cease to existI get triggered by seeing a specific youtuber, sure I can click do not recommend channel on his channel so I donâ€™t see it again but what about his friends? Iâ€™ve clicked it on all of them too but then thereâ€™ll be an edit, or another friend, or whatever the fuck.. It felt on purpose this time, Iâ€™ve done so much to make it so I never see this fucking persons face but yet it got spit out at me once again, it feels too intentional. I want to block them from appearing, in any context, just make it so they never appear again, but I cant. I often find myself wishing heâ€™s a pedophile so he looses his career. Itâ€™s a disgusting thing to wish but itâ€™d sure be convenient for me. Id gone a whole month without this and now Iâ€™m right back to stewing alone wanting to die
