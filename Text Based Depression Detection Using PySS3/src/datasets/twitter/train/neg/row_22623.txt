How is therapy meant to help, when your suicidal thoughts are not mental but physical problemsLong story short, my life has gotten remarkably worse over the last 24 months, and I think about ending my life more than ever. But the reasons behind the desire to end my life are tangible, physical problems, rather than mental ones. Low paying job, mother dying, girlfriend leaving, dog dying, stuck renting forever, stuck cycling to work etc.

My point being that talking about these issues doesn't stop them occurring in my day-to-day life, so how would therapy help?



Edit: 1 response sort of drives my point home. This place is a hole
