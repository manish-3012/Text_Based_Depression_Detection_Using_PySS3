Can someone help me?I want to kill myself but I'm afraid if I'll be a failure at even killing myself. The thought of me surviving makes it even scarier. I'm afraid of the pain too. I know its stupid  I've been in pain so I want atleast the last bit to be ok. I'm writing this today because I found an old diary from when I was eight (I'm 24 now). In almost every page at the end it says I'm sad and I hope I can be happy tomorrow. Towards the end its all disturbing drawings and written 'I just want to die' or 'Someone please kill me'. I've never been happy. My mom has told me to go kill myself for as long as I remember. I guess she was right a failure like me doesn't deserve to live. Maybe if I die everyone will be happy. Sorry for the long rant. If anyone can help me end this miserable life please tell me. I don't have a gun to shoot myself and there are no high places around here to jumb off. I'm a good swimmer so I'm not sure if the river is a good choice either. Please help me and I'm sorry if this post is awkward or weird. Also I don't knownif its inappropriate but I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so sorry.
