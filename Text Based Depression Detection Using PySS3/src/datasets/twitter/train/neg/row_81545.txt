I'm starting to think it's too late for meI just can't ever see myself changing. &amp; if anyone ever really knew what was going on in my head, they would agree that I'm awful. I've become so toxic &amp; angry. I hate everything &amp; everyone. I just don't see the point anymore.

&amp; you know what? I think I've at least in part made myself this way. By giving up so early &amp; letting myself deteriorate over the years. I know I've fallen into a negative way of thinking. I just don't believe at all that it can be changed. I don't have a normal self to revert back to anymore. Things have been fucked up for so long.

I'm so fucking pathetic &amp; everyone who meets me can see it.
