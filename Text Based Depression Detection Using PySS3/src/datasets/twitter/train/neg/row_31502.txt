Probably gonna die slowly when I leaveI am a 20M in a Psych Ward I cant afford with medical and student debt to my name. Once I came in to this facility my family didnâ€™t want me back with them so my only route out of this is homelessness and a shelter.

Well I did my research and I believe my time to die is in a matter of weeks or even days, just Iâ€™m going to die soon. There is so much I wish I could have done better and decisions I regret taking but that is life. Iâ€™m am at the end of my rope and only texting this to be heard one of the few last times by random people who may not ever see me. 

I will end my life hopefully soon because my situation shows of a very short future. Thank you for reading this. &lt;3 XO

If you are interested I could tell you of a lot of shit that happened to me in the past like others wrote in their post but you probably wouldnâ€™t be.
