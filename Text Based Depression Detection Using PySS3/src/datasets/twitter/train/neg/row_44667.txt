What is the cleanest, easiest, and most painless way to die?I feel like I might act on it soon and when I do I want it to be the least painful way to go out. I dont want to leave a mess behind for anyone to clean up and I definitely dont want to fail because that would be so fucking embarassing not only for me but for my parents, not to mention the amount of resources they might have to shell out in case I become a vegetable.

It sucks too because I'm basically their only child capable of taking care of them in the future. My brother is on the severe end of the autism spectrum and I had planned to take care of him when my parents became too old to do so, but with my mental state, I guess he's better off with another family member or the government as much as I hate both of those options. 

Man living is just a fucking bitch. Dying is so fucking hard. And I dont even want to die; I just wish I didnt exist. I wish I could just erase my existence from the universe. I dont want my friends, families, and people I know to remember I existed. I dont think I'm important enough to get a Facebook or Instagram post, but I really don't want that either. I dont want a memorial, a social media post, tears, eulogies; I just want to be forgotten and left alone.
