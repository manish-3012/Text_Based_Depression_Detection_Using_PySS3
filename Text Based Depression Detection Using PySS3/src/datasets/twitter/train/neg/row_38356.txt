It's been nice enough on here, but I'm leaving .I've been working on my mental health and have been really struggling lately. I tried to hang myself in my closet last week and failed, and it was an eye-opening moment for me. I'm trying to get back on the road to recovery, and I don't think this sub is helping me in that regard. Thank you for the support, all of you, and I wish you the best, but this will likely be my last post on here.

Love, --M
