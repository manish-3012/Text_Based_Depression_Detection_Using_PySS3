Wrote this suicide note for whenever I get the balls hopefully soonEveryday I just want to kill my self. No matter how many people I tell or what they say it doesnâ€™t work. It just makes me want to shut down and not listen. Everyone says the same shit and I can tell they donâ€™t mean it. I get no joy out of anything I do. Those rare moments of happiness I have are quickly followed by an immense sense of dread like I donâ€™t want myself to be happy. I do so many pointless things just to please other. I know no one will accept me for my true self. Whenever I do feel happiness I go right back to feeling empty and annoying at existing. Everyday I think about shooting myself multiple times a day and it wonâ€™t stop no matter who I tell. Worst of all I only feel shame around my parents. They always want me to do something extra when I barely feel like doing anything at all. They always see me so annoyed and distant and they never make an effort to change their behavior. I find it nearly impossible to explain my true feelings to anyone and this just makes me feel more alone. I always feel like my parents look at me with shame and this frustrates me. I do not see the point in the extending my suffering any longer. I donâ€™t give a fuck about their feelings because they never gave a fuck about mine. Whenever I did try to tell someone how I felt I just felt stupid for feeling this way. I beat myself up internally constantly so when other people are mean it hurts 100x worse especially those I love. I feel others constantly try to invalidate my feelings rather than truly address them. Iâ€™ve even started cutting and no one noticed. Iâ€™ve just wanted to end my life for the longest time.
Iâ€™m sorry - my name
