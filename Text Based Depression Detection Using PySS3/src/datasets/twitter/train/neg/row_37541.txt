if this is life then I don't want itI tried to open up to family and told them all the things that happened which are pushing me to this point and all she could say is that's life, bad things happen, deal with it

I don't want to deal with it I don't think it's fair that bad things happen for no reason and I didn't ask to be alive so why am I being forced to?

I would do it right now but I had failed attempt before and have no desire to end up in hospital again I only gonna do it if I can guarantee it will work

but I can't find anything useful online cos everything I type sends me back to helplines
