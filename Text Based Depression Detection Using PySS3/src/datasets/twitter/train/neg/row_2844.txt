I just wrote my suicide note.I don't really know what to say. I'm not going to do it tonight, and I probably won't tomorrow either. But everything in my heart wants me to do it. This isn't about any person or event, but just about what my life is and how it will always be. I don't want to be here, and I have no one to talk to. The loneliness and hopelessness is crushing. I really don't know how much longer I can go on. Please help.
