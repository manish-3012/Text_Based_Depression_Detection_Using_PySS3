Help.I want to buy a gun, but I figure everyone here would tell me not to. Unfortunately, I'm making this choice whether any of you have a say in it or not.

But if anyone be as so kind to message me what guns wont leave you crippled and will actually kill you, I would be grateful. I think this might be deleted, I'm just afraid I wont get a reply and I'll end up doing it completely wrong.
