I think i lost the war with myself todayI (26M) has been contemplating suicide for years now, ive not exactly had the worst life nor the best. I have a somewhat loving family, a good job, good friends, everything that should make a person happy, but im not.

I wouldn't say i am particularly sad, i am just nothing, i almost have no feeling at all. I literally feel like an empty vessel that does what it has to do, anyway going a little off topic there as ive finally decided i am to end my own life, i have ran out of reasons to carry on living, i have written notes to the people closest to me and im actually ready. I haven't been this sure of anything in a long time, it's an odd feeling tbh, i feel comfort from knowing this is going to be the end very soon, i know its contradictory but i almost feel happy. Its such a strange feeling.

I did have therapy, anti depressants, you name it ive tried it, nothing worked as i just think its as simple as i don't want to be here anymore.

Im sorry for posting something like this but i wanted to share my thoughts with someone that isn't to close too me, feels like closure really. 

For anyone reading this, before ending your life, try everything! i did, it works for many people out there, just this time it didn't.
