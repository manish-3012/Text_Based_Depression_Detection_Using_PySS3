iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™m going to turn 14.Iâ€™m so tired of being alive. my only reason to stay alive is so my family wonâ€™t have to suffer at home and not be able to get mental help. On my grave it wonâ€™t even say Jamie. it will say my fucking deadname. iâ€™ll never be a man. iâ€™ll always just be... this. I donâ€™t know how much longer I have. I might not make it till next month, let alone turning 14. iâ€™m so afraid. help. please
