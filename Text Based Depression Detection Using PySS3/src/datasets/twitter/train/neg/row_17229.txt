I need guidance or support. I don't know what to do.I am a college student in a public university in New York. I go to school about 5 hours from my home town. Last summer, I met and started a relationship with someone from my home town. She is a few years younger than me and she has struggled with a lot of abuse and bad relationships and I have tried to be very supportive of her, and I feel like I have made a lot of sacrifices, more than I should have, in order to keep her happy. Now I am supposed to be going back to school and she is trying to hold herself hostage in order to make me stay. She says things like if I leave, I am killing her and that the only way she won't try to kill herself is if I don't go to school. I come from a very poor upbringing with just my mom as my sole caregiver, and I have always felt that school is my ticket to a better life. Not only is it what I feel I should be doing, I actually enjoy it too. I am a psychology major, finishing up my junior year of college with above a 3.5 GPA. And I have been struggling with depression and anxiety too. I know I should talk to her parents about how she is behaving, but she says if I tell them, that will just make her more apt to harm or kill herself. And I know her parents, they are very religious and often don't have the patience of the understanding to help her. And we don't have really any mental health facilities in the area, besides the one she currently goes to once every few weeks. I'm am so scared of making things worse that I am paralyzed. I know I have to go to school, but how should I handle this situation with her?
