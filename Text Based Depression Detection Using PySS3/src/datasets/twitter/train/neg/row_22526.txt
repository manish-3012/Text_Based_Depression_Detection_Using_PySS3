I can't stop thinking about killing myself on my birthday next week.I've been depressed before. I've gone through break-ups before. I just can't shake the pain. I have previously requested my birthday off from work. I can't stop thinking about using the opportunity to buy a shotgun and blowing my head off. I don't know if I'll do it or not, but I just needed to say that.
