my life is beyond repairI'm 23f, I lost my job in october, I've been married for almost two years to someone who I feel doesn't respect me. I don't have an education and I just feel like I'm stuck in quick sand and can't get out. My husband won't let go of his ex, and I have always felt like I don't deserve life ever since my ex killed himself. I just feel like a nuisance to humanity..
I don't have anywhere to go ever since I pushed my friends away for this person I'm with.. I feel like a shitty person.. I hate being helpless. I hate myself in general
