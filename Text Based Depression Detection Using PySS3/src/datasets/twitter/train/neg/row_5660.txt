The end of days.Today feels like everything Iâ€™ve ever been though is crashing through my head, the walls are failing in on me. Iâ€™ve felt like this for such a long time, but you would never know. I phoned a crisis hotline (uk) the nurse is due to ring me back....I phoned the Samaritans but I was on hold for 5 mins so gave up, no dis respect to them, Iâ€™m sure they are busy.

If I didnâ€™t have my beautiful dog I would have done it by now.
