Well idk if i had a mental illness, and because of that i donÂ´t post this in the r/depressionThe motive of that is the fact than in my country, Argentina, we are in a bad economical position, and a family where donÂ´t belive in therapy (althourgh i study psychology). IÂ´m sorry for the crappy intro, let me explain. When i was 7 years old i had cancer, Hodking lymphoma, and i saw a lot of childrens dying close to me, in the moment i didnÂ´t realize what that means. At the 10 yo, i begin to understand that, and had bad moments thinking on it, when i talk with my family they just say: "Screw it, u maded it, you won, donÂ´t pay atention on that" that didnÂ´t help. At the 15yo, i had a lot of problems at school, for my behavior... i didnÂ´t talk at all with my partners and cut myself in class a few times, just to go home, then the school commend a therapist and my family takes it, but in the 10th session my father take me out, saying "ur okey now, right?"  
Now with 20 i had a lot more of suicidal thoughts, and i can get over it, also i developt some kind of emotional dependence and itÂ´s awfull. The only thing that keep me alive itÂ´s the study, and the fact than iÂ´m a coward, i know that if i had the chance to kill myself, i would not do it. IÂ´m tired  
PD: Sorry for the bad english, iÂ´m not a first speaker. Have a nice day, love yÂ´all
