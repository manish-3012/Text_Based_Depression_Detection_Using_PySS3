I'm not going to tell anyone I'm suicidal.I don't want anyone to have the burden of worrying about me. At this point I know I'm going to do it eventually so there's no reason to tell anyone.

Honestly for a while I hoped someone would figure out that I was depressed but I don't think anyone really cares about me enough to figure it out. People always think I'm doing great just because I get good grades in school. 

For a while I was only not telling anyone because I didn't want to have to go to therapy or some shit but now I feel like it'll just be easier to do it if no one is worried about me beforehand.
