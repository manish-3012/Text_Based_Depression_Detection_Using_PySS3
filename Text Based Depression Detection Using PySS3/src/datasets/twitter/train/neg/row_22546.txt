What the fuck is wrong with me??Today was a normal day in an otherwise shitty life. But for some reason all the depression and anger just started bursting today. I had a few anxiety panics, I just lost control over myself. It started when I had a small insignificant fight with my brother. For some reason I just filled with rage I never knew I could feel. I punched the bathroom door and just left. Than I wandered around for a while feeling even angrier and just kicking and punching everything in my way, hurting myself in the process but still continuing. Than I started having suicidal thoughts which made me only more nervous than I was. I started having those episodes where if I think even for a microsecond of any problem I have in my life i start to loose control of my breathing, i start to cry uncontrollably, i fall on the floor and just feel really really bad, until it just passes. I take a few deep breaths and I look normal again. It started a few hours ago and I've had 8 or 9 of those already. I had suicidal thoughts in the past, but i never was close to actually killing myself. Today after feeling angry I went to the beach and stood on one of the cliffs contemplating suicide seriously, in the last second i decided i can't do this to my mom. When I got home I started researching suicide methods online and afterwards I took a 500mg acamol box which I wanted to mix with alcohol, at this point I'm not sure whether or not I wanted to kill myself, i was on semi auto-pilot. Eventually i took 4 tablets which I eventually vomited.

WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME?? WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO ME TODAY??

p.s I took the pills about an hour ago and I'm not feeling so good. Can the pills take effect even if i didn't digest them?

Edit: Following AndCat's advice I went to the emergency room where they gave me a pill to come me down. I feel normal again, but still a bit baffled  by the whole experience. I need to go back there now to talk to some peope. Thanks for the kind words.
