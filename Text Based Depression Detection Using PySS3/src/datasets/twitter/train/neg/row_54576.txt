God is real, and that motherfucker loves irony.I don't know how it has escaped me for this long, but I just remembered that my state practically doesn't have gun laws. I'm up to my chest in credit card debt, but if I sell some securities, I should be able to afford a gun some ammo. But, of course, my car had to break down just before I came to this realization, so I'm marooned at my college campus. By the time I get this car fixed, I might still feel like doing it. Holy shit, I'm kind of scared.
