Maybe itâ€™s alright for me to dieDying is scary it is. I donâ€™t want others to die and itâ€™s sad to see others suffer. But maybe itâ€™s alright for it to end. Thereâ€™s no reason for me to live. I have my family and I love them soso much but I really donâ€™t want to continue living. I had depression and anxiety for so many years and I never told anyone. I didnâ€™t want to be problematic. Now Iâ€™m already 19 years old and Iâ€™m set to be an adult but I canâ€™t be one. I feel really out of place and depressed. I think itâ€™s alright to end suffering sometimes. Renting on the internet does help me which is why Iâ€™m writing this so maybe I just want to seek help. I donâ€™t even really know what I want. Well thank you whoeverâ€™s reading since I really want someone to hear me out.
