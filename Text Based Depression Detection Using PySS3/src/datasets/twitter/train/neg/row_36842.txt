I donâ€™t want this anymoreSo my wife has broken off our relationship. We have a young daughter together and I love both of them more than anything in this world.
But she doesnâ€™t feel the same. Which is fine, I donâ€™t want her to be with me and to be unhappy if she can find happiness elsewhere, good.
The biggest problem I have is that she doesnâ€™t have the money to leave and her parents donâ€™t have the space for them. So Iâ€™m stuck living with someone who I love more than anything but wonâ€™t be in the same room as me for more time than it takes to walk through it.
I just want it all to end. My life has been a shit show for longer than I care to remember. Iâ€™d found someone who kind of stopped the 24/7 wanting to end it all and reduced it to 22/7. 
Now itâ€™s back with a vengeance. I just want out. With me gone she can be happy and not worry about all the shit I cause. Family wonâ€™t have to worry about me feeling like shit. I can finally be at peace. Something Iâ€™ve not felt in a decade.
