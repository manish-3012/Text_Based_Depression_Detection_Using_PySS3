One day for sureI won't kill myself today, not tomorrow, but I will one day. I'm in university, second year. I have 3 - 4years left. I'll live that. I have friends, friends that I love with all my heart. But I know I will loose them one day, like I lost everyone else. And don't talk about a lover, I don't have one since years and I know I will never know a love story. My friends say I will, but I know for sure I won't. And the day my friends are gone, when I'll live alone and I'll be far from my family, I'll kill myself. I still don't know how, and I still don't know if it's better for my family if I disappear and don't know what happened to me or if it's better that they know I've killed myself. I guess I'll see then
