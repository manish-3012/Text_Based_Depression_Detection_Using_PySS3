At this point nothing helpsIâ€™ve been suicidal for quite some time now, Iâ€™ve battled depression for years with it climaxjng with my girlfriend of 2 years dumping me. After this incident I swallowed God knows how much Advil and downed it with tequila. Iâ€™ve been fantasizing about suicide for years (how I would do it, who would care, etc.). With the thoughts coming rampant as I face getting expelled from high school. Iâ€™m not looking for someone to tell me life is beautiful or that someone will miss me, I just want to talk. Hopefully the thoughts will go away before I actually get the balls to do something about it.
