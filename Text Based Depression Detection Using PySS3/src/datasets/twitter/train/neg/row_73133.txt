lifehi im 18 and i know way too much about this world and because of that i have no self motivation to live this life anymore. im in my last year of college so in a few months ill be entering a new chapter in my life, which is working full time til my retirement, ill be surprised if i make it to old age without committing. 

i just dont know anymore, my minds a mess, i dont know if i have depression, i havent been to the doctors about it.

i dont know why im posting this tbh, i dont know what answers im looking for, i just want to express myself
