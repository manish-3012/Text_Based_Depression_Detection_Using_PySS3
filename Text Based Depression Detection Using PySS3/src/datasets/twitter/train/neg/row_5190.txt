I hate myself every second of evey day I wish this feeling would just fuck offItâ€™s so exhausting to have these thoughts constantly. I wish I could go at least 1 hour without hating myself &amp; gregretting every shitty thing Iâ€™ve done in my life &amp; overthinking everything. I wish I could remebwr the person I used to be. I do nothing but stay in bed &amp; gain weight. Life is not worth living like this. I feel like Iâ€™ve lost everything
