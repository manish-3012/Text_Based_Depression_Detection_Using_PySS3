Is spirituality necessary for happiness?I like science, and like to use it to explain some weirder ideas I have.  Like the basics of karma, "What goes areound comes around," you know the word.  Energy, gases and liquids move along a pressure gradient; higher concentrations of these move to lower concentrations.  The same kind of idea as to why we have weather and how we are able to breath.  I use to think that when you do something good, that good karma goes to the person you helped and you are now on the lower end on the concentration gradient.

But now that seems so stupid.  We all have this wrinkly, fatty lump in a bone box full of electricity and chemicals.  Most of those chemicals we have are now defined and categorized, and some synthesized into pills.  But even when we know which chemicals make us happy, they don't work enough.

Linear thinking gets us to dark and dangerous places, and I know that's where I'm headed with this stupid train of thought.  But I've been grasping for answers for a  L O N G  f#ck!ng time.  You can only google so much.  I want answers but being paranoid is being dissatisfied with all of them, and the answers I don't get make me think people are hiding things from me.

Sending out this message into a sea of strangers with similar problems that they all heard of is redundant and (again) stupid for me to do, but I feel like convincing myself that there is/are god(s) is the only other option besides drinking until my mother finds me dead, which despite living on the floor above her would take a day or two.

TLDR:  I'm a sad piece of shit who can't find god (Christian or otherwise)
