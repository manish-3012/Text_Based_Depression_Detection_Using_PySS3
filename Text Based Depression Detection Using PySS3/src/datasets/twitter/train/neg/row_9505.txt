I just wish I could come up with a reason whySeeing a lot of the posts on here and elsewhere, most suicidal people atleast seem to have some sort of reason for their suffering and suicidal thoughts. In comparison, I couldn't point to a single thing about me that causes me to feel the way I feel.
When your mind itself I rotten, no change in circumstances feels like it will help. I can't even come up with a single scenario in which I could envision myself being happy or lacking suicidal thoughts long-term.
