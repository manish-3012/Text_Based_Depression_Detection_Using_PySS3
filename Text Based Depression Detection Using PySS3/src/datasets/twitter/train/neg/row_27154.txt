Help me.So I've been suicidal for a while now. Like, about two years? I don't know. I'm thirteen right now, but I swear, I'm mature enough to make this decision. I want to stop the pain, and I want to end it all.

My mom tells me I do all of this for attention. That I'll never actually do anything. She's seen my scars, and she thinks I'm just a hypochondriac. The sad part is, I let her believe this.

My dad's a psychiatrist. He tries to help me, but I'm too scared of telling him I cut. He'll cut me out of his lifeâ€”he's threatened me with that multiple times. I wear long sleeves around him.

Sometimes, I cut off from reality. It's like I'm not sure what's hapenning around me anymore, and even if I'm alive. Then I just start going dizzy and sobbing and curling up. It's not a panic attackâ€”I think I'm insane.

I tried hitting myself on the head with a hammer to kill myself when I was five years old, and got a concussion. A few months ago, I tried to hang myself, and that failed. I've also tried smothering and compressing my carotid arteries.

So here's how I'll do it. I'll take an OD of my dad's Rampiril, and then wait for the magic to happen. Everything around me will go black, and I'll fly, fly away from all the shit that's happening to me right now. It'll be awesome.

I just can't take things anymore.

Please help.
