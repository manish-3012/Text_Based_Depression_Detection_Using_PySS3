18(M) A Means To An EndI'm done with feeling this heart wrenching feeling of despair, pain, anger. I've tried therapy, medications, and meditation. I'm only 18 with 2 shit jobs barely scraping by while trying desperately to pass nursing at 17 credit hours. My Ex broke up with me a while ago so she could go off to college at St. Bona and party. While I work myself to near exhaustion  to push myself through a state college. I'm so miserably unhappy with everything. Central New York is nothing but a cesspit of despair. Im fucking done, I have a bottle of fioricet in front of me. I feel so alone I feel like a disapointment to everyone around me. I told must people to go Fuck off and burn. I've tired but nothing matters, at first I thought it would resolve on its own I went to a therapist she diagnosed me with clinical depression anxiety and moderate ptsd I am constantly reminded of my past as it forever haunts me. I tried being optimistic only to have my face shoved into the ground. Good night and let peace take me.
