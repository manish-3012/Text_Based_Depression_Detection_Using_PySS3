Disconnected from everythingCan you imagine the feeling of there being nobody in the world left who cares whether you live or die? Just nobody who you're close enough to to make any difference in their lives. Nobody you can do anything of value for. Nobody you can really believe is happy to see you. Maybe there are people you happen to care about, but you somehow can't reach out to them or touch them in any way. And if you try you just end up being a negative influence and a burden on their lives.

Just imagine standing there in the middle of everything realizing that you're not connected to any of it. You're a completely irrelevant and superfluous part of the machine that might as well not exist. What were the engineers thinking when they put you there? Maybe they knew something you don't know but maybe it was just a really comic mistake. You might as well disappear right now and all traces of your existence might be erased from history and for all you know nobody in the world would be any worse off.

I'm really trying to break out of this depression I've been suffering from for decades. Sometimes making it just through the next 5 minutes, just through the next hour, just through the next day. But I just keep stumbling and falling again and again and I'm doing worse and worse. Supposedly people have beaten this but I've also seen ones who try much harder than me and they still fail and get nowhere.

I've reached a new low point now and I can't really imagine how I'm going to make it out of there. I still really think the world can be a nice place to live in, there are so many amazing people and things around. And I'm often in awe of humanity and what we've managed to build. And I would so much like to be a small part of it all again.

But how is one supposed to live with this feeling indefinitely? Just how is that possible?
