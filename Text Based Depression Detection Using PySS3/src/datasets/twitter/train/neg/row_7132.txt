This world isn't right for meLots of people brush life off and tough it out. I can't do it. School is unbearable. The anxiety, the arbitrary and time-wasting work, even more work once I get home to ~~relax~~, an anxious couple hours laying in my bad thinking about how shitty life is, and waking up tired to do it all over again. How the fuck anyone gets through this is beyond me.

This is needless suffering. I don't believe anyone saying it gets better. I've been waiting for 5 years and the day hasn't come, and I can't wait any more. I get no enjoyment from living or being with people, and I'm harassed daily by family who can't do anything to help. Counselors and psychiatrists haven't done anything either. I don't care about the pain I would bring to others by ending my life; they deserve it.
