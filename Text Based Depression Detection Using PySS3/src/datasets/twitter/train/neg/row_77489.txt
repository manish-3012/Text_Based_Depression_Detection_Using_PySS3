LonerI know this is an ask Reddit section where I ask people certain questions, but I need answers. Here it goes
For my whole life I've been socially awkward and quiet, I do not really go out so often due to the strict nature of my parents. But that doesn't mean I don't have good friends who were always there for me when I needed help...well that was what I thought.
Just a few weeks ago, I broke up with my girlfriend (yes I did get a girlfriend, for some reason), I was feeling like shit and devasted, I wanted my friends to be by my side( I guess shit don't go the way we want to even at hard times like this). 
I've got this one friend, let's just name her uhh X.
X was my best friend, she was like an older sister to me(secretly I have a crush on her but not to the point of liking at the moment), after my break up with my girlfriend, I was feeling devasted and just sad, tried going to X for help, but for some reason I feel like she's avoiding me, whenever I message her, I will not even get a reply from her like 5 hours later or more, whenever I try to ask her to meet and just chill, she'd alw say smth like she's not free, sometimes when we are about to meet, she'd alw give shitty excuses to why she had to postpone our meeting, overall I feel like she's avoiding me for someone reason, not just her but my other friends as well. Funny thing is they said they will always be there for me, but whr were they when I needed help? Where? When they always needed someone to talk to I was always there. Overall I'm just really disappointed in my friends, if they really actually are my friends, I just wanted a friend I can count on to rant to.
I wonder what did I do to deserve this, why can't they just be there for me, why do I feel alone? I'm done being the nice guy helping out, really I am, I'm slowly edging towards self destruction, many days I always thought of jumping off level 10, I really want to, whats the point of living when no one's there for you?
