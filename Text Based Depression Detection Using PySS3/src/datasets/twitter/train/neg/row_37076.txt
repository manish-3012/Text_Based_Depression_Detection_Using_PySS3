I need helpI donâ€™t think I can go on anymore. My family despises me and wishes I were dead. My father even admitted Iâ€™m his least favorite and heâ€™s even said he wishes I was never born at random. My grandma hates me and just dislikes me in general, she usual tries to make me feel like a horrible human being. I never really feel happy with life and every moment I wish I could just end it all
