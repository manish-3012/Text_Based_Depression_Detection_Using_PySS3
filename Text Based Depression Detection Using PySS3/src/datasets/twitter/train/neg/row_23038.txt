I'm always going to be poorI hate my life and stopped believing in the American Dream. Too many folks in LA work shit jobs and have to do it for survival. I would do it too if I ever lost complete hope in my life but I'd rather jump into the LA river head first than to be a wage slave, not shit talking those of you with jobs it would just make my life worse and money made wouldn't make me any happier. I though about joining the army since more access to guns and I'm going to a recruitment center tomorrow.
