I feel dead inside and it's getting worseI don't know where to begin, but I'll just start about half a year ago. I fell in love with a girl that was like a therapist that actually cared about me, as I was the same with her.
However, she became a lot more distant, and hasn't talked to me anywhere near as much as before.
Now that she's pretty much gone, I have nobody to trust with my feelings and I have no advice from anyone. I have this empty feeling inside me and I always feel drowsy.
I'm starting to feel hopeless and feel like suicide is the only answer aside from taking cough syrup to sleep all day. I don't know what to do. I just want to feel better again. I'm tired of being dependent on someone who's "too busy to talk". What do I do?
