Everyday its harder to deal with this. Please help?I dont want to go on another day living like this. Dealing with my anxiety is torture. I cant do anything right. Recently ive been trying to improve on my social skills but i always fuck up. Everyday I tell myself im confident, and todays gonna different, and not to worry, and god is watching over me. I just cant take it anymore. Ive been having nightmares and panic attacks through the night recently. I jsut cant get a break whether im at home or in public. I used to be able to be happy everyday by saying "today will be different" but lately its been harder to say that. Ive tried everything to get over my anxiety. Ive tried to "man up", ive been to several therapists, taken plenty of different pills, and tried every drug i can get my hands but nothing works. Everyday i fuck up on something and make myself look pathetic and retarded. Im either disappointing those around me with my inability to talk or i disappointing myself by not trying to talk. I cant deal with this stupid shyness any longer but i dont know whether or not killing myself would be right.
