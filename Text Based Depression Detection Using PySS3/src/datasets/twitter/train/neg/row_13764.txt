Everyone thinks I'm deadAround 2 weeks ago, I told my online friends that I was going to kill myself and I went offline. I took a ton of pills and went to sleep, but I didn't die. I woke up feeling sick and I took more but it just made me throw up. I decided to take a little bit to recover so I stayed offline for like three days, and when I came back I remembered I was still dead to them. I didn't know how to say that I wasn't dead so I told myself I would do it later, but I never did and I feel so guilty. I feel like I just hurt everyone for no reason and it makes me want to actually commit even more.
