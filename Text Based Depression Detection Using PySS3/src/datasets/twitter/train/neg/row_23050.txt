When the time comes, I'll be ready...to die21 years old "man" living home with his family. Never worked a day in my life, and I have no intention in starting soon. My plan is to just keep living like this, without studying or working for the rest of my life, and when the time comes to for me and life will force me to take my responsibility, I'll just jump under a train. My mother says it's ok for me to live here and not working until "I'm ready", as if I'll ever be, until I'll be at most 30. So it will happen no later than 9 years, which is pretty long I must say.

I've been considering this for weeks and it honestly relaxes me, knowing that I could just go and die as soon as things get tough, it fits me pretty well.

And no, I don't want to be loved, I already get tons of love from my family.

No, I don't care about making them sad, I won't mind when I'll be dead.

No, I don't care about being called or remembered as a pussy, I grew used to it.

And no, I don't expect or hope things to magically get better, they won't and hope is more dangerous than anything.
