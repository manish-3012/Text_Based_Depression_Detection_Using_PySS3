I need help I don't know how to get itThings aren't getting better I never thought in a million years I would go so far I would cut my own face. In the most obvious spot ever. Me being already insecure about my face I am now going to have two huge more like four deep scars and does it look like an accident? Heck no. I made them into x's because I am the dumbest person ever. Anyways while I was at it my thighs, my stomach, arms, almost my neck, and now I am just in tears and so disappointed with what I have done to myself. I suffer with bipolar disorder/bipolar depression, many things really. Especially I am a schizophrenic. But my anger issues and my delusions of not knowing what is really fantasy is getting in the way of how I have been treating others. I am lashing out majorly where I have even wrote "f\*ck you" on a piece of paper with my own blood and sent it to someone. I am not doing okay but all of those I have cared for are slowly hating me one by one because I can't control my emotions and I don't trust myself around anyone I feel if not myself I will seriously hurt someone. I have many times thought about doing it this week in hopes I will be happy. I will have a new life I might even change into something quite beautiful like a butterfly who knows. I just don't want to go down like this hated. But, I can't help it this blade isn't doing justice for me like it used to. I have passed out and just been feeling woozy but the relief really has left I now feel even more empty. I don't trust myself with myself. But how can I be alright if I can't even escape my own self. And everyday just a repeated skew of voices they sound so so real but everyone finds me crazy. "JUST GO KILL URSELF ALREADY SMASH UR HEAD INTO THAT WALL SO HARD SO SO HARD" and i do i hit myself over and over and i can't stop I WAS TOLD TO. I CANT FREAKING STOP.  I was told im a waste of time so now im also an unmedicated freak. I don't have much time left.
