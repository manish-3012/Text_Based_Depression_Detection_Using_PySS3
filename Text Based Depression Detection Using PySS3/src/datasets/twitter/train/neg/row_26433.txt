WhyAs a nurse I had many patients that came in threatening suicide. We managed but I never understood. Out of nowhere my brother died by suicide. Shocked us all. So now my question is what I thought it was when I was nursing,....what level of seriousness do people have when they threaten suicice. Moreover, do people understand how much hurt they leave behind when they take these actions? You wbat to know how to cause depression, kill your self and donâ€™t tell anyone what that is about. The work I had to do to help my parents....... yep I get it, suicide is result of unbearable pain and depression, just please think about what that means for the people (often shocked and confused) after the fact.
