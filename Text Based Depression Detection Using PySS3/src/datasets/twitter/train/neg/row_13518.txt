A cry for helpAll my life i have been suffering from depression, anxiety and depersonalization disorder. I had one thing left that kept me alive, one dream that could become true one day and today i found out it was almost impossible to accomplish. Without that, i have nothing to live for. Nothing makes me happy. I dont have enough money for a private psychiatrist, and ones public hospitals dont give a crap about their patients. Two of my siblings died, when they were children, i have no right to make my family go through that pain again,  thats the only thing that keeps my from killing myself. And i suffer. I see no way out of this.
