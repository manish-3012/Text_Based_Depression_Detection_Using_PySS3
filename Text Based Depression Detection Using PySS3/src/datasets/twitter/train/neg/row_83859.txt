A very close friend of mine is terrified of life.My ex and I are still friends after the breakup. She has SEVERE anxiety problems and the issues going on in Syria and Turkey right now are causing her to flare up. I want to help her, but I have absolutely no experience dealing with anxiety, does anyone have any advice, I'm really really concerned for her well being.

Edit: I have linked the thread to her, and she will be reading it, any advice to help her help herself would be appreciated as well.
