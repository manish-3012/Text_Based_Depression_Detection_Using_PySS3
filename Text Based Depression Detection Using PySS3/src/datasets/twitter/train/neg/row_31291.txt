My compromiseIn 2017 I made a compromise with myself saying that I would not voluntarily kill myself as long as I have a friend that needs my help. My Brain being as messed up it is, I became more daring and more likely to do things that could get me killed, last year I couldâ€™ve died when I was skiing and I accidentally tumbled all the way down a mountain. I do however have a hidden note so when my room is eventually searched everyone knows that it was what I wanted in the end, for now, thereâ€™s always more friends to help.
