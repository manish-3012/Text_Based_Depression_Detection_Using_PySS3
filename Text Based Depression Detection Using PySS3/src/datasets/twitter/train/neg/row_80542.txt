Second semester and I feel like Iâ€™m in a time loopI got pretty used to being alone at the end of my first semester of college. I had â€œfriendsâ€ but they were mostly people in my clubs or who Iâ€™d say hi to passing by. I knew a lot of people, but there wasnâ€™t really anybody Iâ€™d hang out with. Iâ€™d go to class, my room, lunch, class, my room, etc. with club meetings and stuff thrown in. Iâ€™m at a tiny school, so I see everybody all the time. Everyone has their group of friends, and I barely know anybody in my hall, who mostly seem like jerks anyway. The end of last semester wasnâ€™t bad, but now that Iâ€™m back itâ€™s horrible again.

All of my classmate friends are in different classes now, and really donâ€™t give a shit about being friends with me. Even the people Iâ€™ll occasionally get food with feel fake as hell, but Iâ€™ve got no one else. I feel like any time Iâ€™m with someone theyâ€™re just being polite. I know that itâ€™s my own fault that I havenâ€™t gotten far, but it still sucks. I donâ€™t have the excuse of it being the first semester now, people are cemented in their ways somewhat. I donâ€™t like college. I almost transferred, but I decided to at least finish out the year. I donâ€™t even know if transferring would help me at all. I feel like I canâ€™t even function as a human being.
