I'm so done with everythingI want to be alive, but nothing I want to ever accomplish is actually do able. I'm 16 and everyone in my life is just fucking it up beyond relief. I've been bullied all my life and was forced to go to a smaller school, I've never had actual friends. My one true friend is gone. My dad mentally abused me for all I know, my parents are divorced. My dad is forcing me to get a fucking job, and if I dont oblige to anything he says he takes anyone my phone, or my playstaion which all and all makes me more fucking depressed than I already am, they today he fucking says you have no dreams and no ambitions in life. But if I fucking told him my true dreams he would just fucking laugh at me (like he always does), And force me to go into something else.. I want to become some sort of entertainer, I like making people laugh, i like to make people happy, but if I tell him this he will say go into theater in school it's the only way for that lifestyle, which I dont want to fucking do, then he goes behind his back talking to his girlfriend about me behind my back, they hes saying the same shit to my mom, so now my mom is beliving everything he fucking says. Now my dad is doing this "online help" thing for me and if I dont oblige hes gonna take away every electronic thing I have, which is will totally fix my depression. What the fuck do I do I cant live like this anymore.
