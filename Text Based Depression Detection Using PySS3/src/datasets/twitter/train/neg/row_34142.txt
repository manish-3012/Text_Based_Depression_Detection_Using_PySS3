Thank youA message from the bottom if my heart


A few months ago I was dying. On the inside I felt a big aching empty hole, as if all the abuse I endured in my life had just hit me. Sexual, verbal, mental abuse, I had had it all in my family but when even my gf started to act verbally abusive to me, using my story of sexuall abusive and the death of my bio parents, and left me, which meant I also lost her family; Ilost it.


I started smoking, drinking, just laying in bed. I went from straight A student to never attending classes anymore, everytime I took the train I would remind me which stations we passed without stopping. And at which hour, so I knew when I had to go there to kill myself.

I was close, a few times, I searched for help but it went slowly. Remembering those appointments at my psychologist were small pieces of light in a world that was totally dark and seemed to have abanddoned me.

There were times I couldn't be alone at my house cause it was too dangerous, I would have done something impulsive and died.

We are now almost 6 months later since the break-up that caused this shitstorm of grief and sadness. I  passed all my exams minus one, I started playing soccer again and learned how to cook. I made lots of new friends and even people who are interested in dating me, although I don't rush things, and I saw my ex for a 2nd time on a party and it hurt me less.


The road to happiness is still long. Maybe one day I will fall in love again, be happy and think of this period as life-changing, it really was.


To everyone who is struggeling: "Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light."


I want thank everyone on this subreddit (and on others),  who helped me, since I basically use this as my guide in life. Your help and advise were really helpfull and gave me the feeling I was not alone, I was drowing but you guys told me to keep on swimming. I will never forget that.

Thank you
