I wish I was dead.But I'm too afraid of what comes next, if anything comes next. I also don't want to hurt those closest to me. These are the only things that have kept me here thus far. Yet the will to end it all grows stronger everyday. I wish I wasn't like this, half the time I feel as though I'm going insane. I'm on a waiting list for therapy, have been for near enough 2 months but my patience for everything wears thinner each day. I'm so conflicted with everything I don't even know what to do with myself.
