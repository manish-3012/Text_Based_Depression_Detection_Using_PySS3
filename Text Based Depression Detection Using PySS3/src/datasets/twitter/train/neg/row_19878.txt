All I can think about is suicide.I haven't done anything in the past 2 weeks. All I have been able to do is play video games and watch anime. It's not because I'm enjoying it. It just takes me out of my shitty reality. I have no job. My suicidal thoughts are starting to spill over into my social life, I can no longer function in a conversation. I am uninteresting, and I have nothing to say to my friends. I don't really know what to do besides doing what I'm doing now. I'm tired of not feeling anything. My sex drive is completely gone. How can I be happy?
