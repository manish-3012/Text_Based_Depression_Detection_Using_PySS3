Life is truly pointlessHi, I'm 22 and I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts. I've been lonely forever, No friends and Only one family member i actually don't hate my, my mom. I've never had love in my life, I feel maybe because I'm ugly and useless. The really bad thing is I don't know how to talk to people, my social anxiety I feel won't allow it. I just want someone other than my mother to love me,  if isn't wasn't for her don't think I'd be alive. I need help
