Vent/Explanation I guessSo this may be my first and last post on here and Im not sure what to say, guess I should just  get right to the point. Im thinking about downing three bottles of antidepressants with a mickey of rye tonight. The intent is obvious. Ive just come to the realisation of how useless I am, I cant do anything, I have no talents, I cant even get into collage for fucks sake. Im just so fucking lazy and I've disappointed everyone one to many times and im just so damn lost in my own life. 

Of course Im afraid to kill myself, but im not sure what else to do. My father hates me, my mother abandoned me and I dont have any friends. I guess I just want to make some sort of note, make sure people know how sorry I am and to know that this is my own fault.  Im just so sorry that i wasted 18 years of everyones life and that I couldnt make them proud. Hell for all I know, im going to be too scared to do this anyways or its just not going to work
