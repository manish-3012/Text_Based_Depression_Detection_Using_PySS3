Depression is a tease.Depression. Itâ€™s such a tease. You get these highs. It comes back with ease. 

You wake up everyday. You beg and you beg. Let today be the day. I turn my life around please. 

As the money gets lower. The debts get higher. The oxygen runs out. And so does the fire. 

Youâ€™re left there. Thinking of all the moments you wish you could fix. The rooms silent. The clock ticks. There you go again. Wishing you had super powers. I mean you day dream about the shit for hours and hours. 

Truth is. I canâ€™t fix the past. Itâ€™ll never get better. These highs theyâ€™re light like a feather but these lows could rip leather and this life is the worst weather itâ€™s cold and warm never I just. Want. To be. Better. 

Itâ€™s hard not to feel like I have a curse. It gets better. And immediately worse. Than ever before. I mean honestly. In my heart. In my mind. I know where happiness I find. Itâ€™s me. Who makes me blind. I know exactly how to ease my mind. Some need meds. Some need someone to call. I. Just need to end it all. 

But tomorrow Iâ€™ll wake up and continue with this disease. Because depression is such a tease.
