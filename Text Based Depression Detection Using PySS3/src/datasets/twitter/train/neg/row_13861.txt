Looking back...Iâ€™ve looked back at some old accounts of mine. The suicidal posts... remembering those times... I was such a mess. 

I still am. Iâ€™m possibly even worst these days. Yet I still live... Iâ€™m still here... 

My suicide  would destroy those I love. I feel so alone. Even when Iâ€™m surrounded by those who love me. I know they love me, and I love them too. But this feeling isolates what I am.

These thoughts make me someone else....

I donâ€™t know how to come back to reality.

The biggest problem I have is the fact that I donâ€™t think these episodes will ever go away. Iâ€™m going to live like this for the rest of my life. Itâ€™s a matter of finding the strength to accept that reality...


I honestly donâ€™t think I can live battling addiction for the rest of my life... Iâ€™ll stay here for now. But I know that soon my time will come. Iâ€™m okay with that.
