I want to die because I couldn't decorate the first ever Christmas tree in my life cause my cousin sister decided to do it instead of me.Growing up, christmas wasn't a big deal in our family. due to poverty we could never buy or decorate Christmas tree. As life went on, I grew up and lost interest in buying or 'decorating' any Christmas tree...coz my life is fucked up with mood disorder and severe depression. Now after two years of loosing my father, and few therapy sessions, I decided to try celebrating festival as it's time to celebrate the living and make my mom happy, according to my therapist advice. I probably should have reminded myself that all my wishes are going to left as wishes. And high expectations always end up as big disappointments. Turns out my cousin, whom I specifically informed that I'll decorate the tree, by mistake brought and 'decorated' it without mine/my mom involvement. She is sweet and actually meant good, but sadly, the only one joy I was looking for after a long fcking time, got robbed off. I felt extremely cheated. Now all I'm left with are very dark thoughts. My hand now looks like some butchered meat, and all the blood that came out isn't sufficient to sooth me anymore. nor my favourite chocolate icecream or pizza is comforting me. I wish I can just cut little more deeper enough to end this pathetic life for once and all.
