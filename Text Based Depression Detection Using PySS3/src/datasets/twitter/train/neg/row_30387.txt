I have absolutely no self worthIt's been a while since I've felt like this, but everything is coming to a head. I'm about to fail out of college (not a question of if but when), I have no job opportunities or experience, no passions, no friends, and nothing to live for. All I've done for 4 fucking years is almost bankrupt my parents who were paying for my college and now I won't even have a basic degree to show for it. Every time I see people work hard for my sake I just want to disappear more and more. I don't know what to do. Everything is my fault, no question, so I have to be angry at myself.
