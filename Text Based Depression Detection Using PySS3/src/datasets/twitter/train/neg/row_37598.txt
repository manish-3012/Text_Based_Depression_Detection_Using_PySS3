Another rejection todayGot another rejection today from an interview I had a couple weeks ago. Iâ€™ve learned that these rejections take a lot out of you. I usually take a day and try to process what I did wrong and how I can improve myself and move forward but this one hurt me pretty badly. On the verge of tears all day since I got the email. What makes matters worse is that the job market for my industry in this area is basically nil and I have exhausted all my local options and had 4 interviews in the last few weeks but they all lead to rejections. 

Feeling pretty hopeless about finding work in my field in this area. I gave up and applied to McDonaldâ€™s but havenâ€™t called them back to set up the interview because I was hoping Iâ€™d hear about one of these job by the end of this week and sure enough I did, a nice rejection email. Guess Iâ€™ll be calling McDonaldâ€™s up soon.

Really at the end of my rope and feeling more and more hopeless everyday. Depression sucks all joy out of my life. I only get some moderate enjoyment from movies and tv and video games. Since I am also on probation for a year I am not drinking or smoking weed anymore. Being sober is extra difficult in this time. The only advantage I keep trying to tell myself is how much weight Iâ€™ll lose from not drinking and how much money Iâ€™ll save from not buying weed every week or two.

I also lost my license for two months due to the weed DUI so dealing with the next two months having to rely on other people for rides is extra demoralising.

I just wish there was a way out. I wish I didnâ€™t feel so unhappy all the time. I wish I had more time to do the things I love, which are mainly making music. 

I am not going to last much longer this way. It is no way to live.
