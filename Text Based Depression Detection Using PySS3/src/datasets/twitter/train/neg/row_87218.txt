Thinking about committing suicide almost daily at this pointi hate myself and i hate where i am, i have very little friends who donâ€™t seem to care most of the time and they donâ€™t seem to want to help either.

i feel like telling them about my problems would make them not want to talk to me anymore or that they would be needlessly worrying.

i donâ€™t want to be around anymore.
