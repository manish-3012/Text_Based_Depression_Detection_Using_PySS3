Overdriven emptinessIâ€™m not one to make my feelings public. I realized after countless ignored social media posts that no one really cared about what I had to say. But this is something I canâ€™t keep inside anymore. 
The past two years have been very hard on me. My depression went into overdrive. Though I never really considered myself suicidal before, Iâ€™m sure I am now.  
I donâ€™t know much of anything so I wonâ€™t â€œself-diagnose.â€ But everyday is getting harder. 
I know I have countless people who love me and who would be devastated is anything happened to me. That has been the one thing I have been able to hold on to. 
But recently it just isnâ€™t enough anymore.  I donâ€™t have a desire to continue on and live out my future.
I guess I canâ€™t explain it very well. I think waking up and getting ready for the day is the worst part. I just donâ€™t want to do it anymore. 
If you decided to sit through my entire pity party then I thank you. I know all of us are struggling and I am completely aware that others have it worse than me, so Iâ€™m sorry for being so self-centered.
