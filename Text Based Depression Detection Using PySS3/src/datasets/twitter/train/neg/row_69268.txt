Update - my experience with text hotlines, crisis call centers and "211 help - Still Here UnfortunatelyThis is all over a weeks time, sometimes multiple calls a day.
Been told to kill myself 8 times.
Hung up on 34 times (estimate)
Told by almost all agents (once I figured it out) they're not a help center they're a talk line and provide no real service at all but someone to talk to, and they're rarely empathetic at that.

Finally moved to the help lines.  (Mind you I have enough money and income to pay basic bills).

Most just ring and ring.  They're closed outside of business hours, and only help families get on a waiting list.  Waiting for what I don't know.

Is money no longer exchangeable for goods and services?  I need to start work soon and can't do that without a place to lay my head.
