The Convenience of DyingIt's just easier to die isn't it?? No longer need to think about eating, waking up, and thinking about how to live. To live is to struggle while death promises peace. Depression whispers these sweet lies of comfort disregarding the reality of what lies ahead when I do actually kill myself. Decisions, decisions. Death just looks so nice it's getting harder and harder to resist.
