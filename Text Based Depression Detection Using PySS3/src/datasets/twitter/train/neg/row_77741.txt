I slept after days and dreamt of waking up next to the girl of my dreams.I don't wanna sleep anymore.

I don't want my brain constantly reminding me how fucking miserable my life is all the time.

I puked as soon as I woke up because that's how disgusting I felt.

I haven't eaten anything since I woke up (12 hours since I'm writing this). For days now, I've just survived on red bull and cigarettes.

I can't live like this.

I have my finals soon.

I can't live like this.

Why do I have a noose in my room for a few weeks now ready to go and I still haven't used it?
