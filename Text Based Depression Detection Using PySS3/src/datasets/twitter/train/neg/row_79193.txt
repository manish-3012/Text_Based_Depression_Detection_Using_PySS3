Fucking done!!!!!!!!Iâ€™m more done with it than Iâ€™ve ever been in my whole life. I took a tab of lsd that fucked me up to the worst possible extent. I had a bad trip and all throughout the trip my penis felt totally numb and turtling in. After the trip symptoms persisted and I figured it might just go away with time. 2 weeks later I start seeing hallucinations again and I search up what that could be and turns out I have hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. And my penis has never been the same either I have something called hard flaccid syndrome meaning my penis stays hard while at flaccid length. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m gonna do when school starts again. I donâ€™t wanna go outside. My familyâ€™s given up on me and so have my friends. I have nowhere else to go and vent about how depressed I am. Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts for a while now and I just really need a friend Iâ€™m only 15 years old I donâ€™t deserve this shit
