Im pretty sure my mom just found my suicide notesI'm 16 years old ,my mom is aware I have really bad anxiety and in the past I've had issues with an eating disorder and that's about all she knows,I've had multiple impulsive thoughts about ending my life and As they got worse I thought that it might be a good idea to write these thoughts down in a diary to help.A few weeks ago I wrote in my diary again and I planned everything ,what people were going to wear to my funeral, how and where I would do it.I Can't really describe how much I just wanted my life to end just there and then.So I wrote it all down in my journal I wrote at least 10 pages on it telling everyone how sorry I was and how I couldn't cope with it and that I would give myself until my holiday was over.

I've never told anyone else about it and I'm  really confused on why I could be having these feelings and I'm scared that if I tell anyone in my life they will say that  I'm being dramatic and that no one will believe me and I'm terrified that if they say that I will be shamed for it and I will get worse.

At the moment I'm away with my grandparents in Florida and my mom is at home in Chicago.Last night I face timed my mom for the first time in a few days and she said that she had cleaned my room and moved my desk to a different place.I keep my diary under there and this is the diary I have kept since I was 7 with all my notes and feelings in she is bound to have read it and I'm really scared to what she will say when I get back.it would explain her wanting to have "girly"trips out when I get home and wanting to know what my favourite movie to watch with her is.

What should I say to her if she asks? And do I need help?
