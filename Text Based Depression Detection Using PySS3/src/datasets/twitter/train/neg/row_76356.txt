i just want to diei cant bring myself to type anything. I typed some stuff to my friend earlier so i'll just copy paste that and hope you understand.  


 

the problem is that my parents are way too controlling  
i cant go outside without their permission even its gotten that bad, they make me feel like things are always my fault and that im a failure and im lazy and a nuisance  
but then they switch up and they act all nice for like a week  
then its back to the usual  
i wanted to go to my girlfriends place on monday cause its a public holiday here, texted my mom about it a couple days ago and she didnt respond (this is maybe the third time ive asked her to go out) and every time is the same  
she ignores me till i fully confront her and ask her because thats what she wants and then she just says no  
it just makes me feel hopeless and im letting my girlfriend down and its just decreasing everything except for my misery  
is it too much to ask to not be so fucking sad all the time and just spend time with my fucking girlfriend  
i just want to live \[redacted\] but i cant this is my third fucking breakdown today  
i cant even see my keyboard there are too many tears i just wanna fucking die  
ive tried running away but they just found me again  
i dont even have the energy to run again, i just want to kill myself  
ive tried talking to them but its always the same thing  
"you dont get it youre only 15" "youre too lazy and stupid" "you'll undertstand when youre a parent"  
WHAT THE FUCK AM I MEANT TO BE UNDERSTANDING? HOW TO RUN A PRISON?  


 

i cant do this anymore \[redacted\]  
my dad just makes me feel like i dont fit in and that im not good enough  
my mom makes me feel like im stupid and lazy  
they both make me feel like a failure  
 i tried to tell them how i feel and they responded by just being worse   


please help. I just want to end it
