iâ€™m thinking of killing myself.i attempted last september and i survived. i got on antidepressants and in january i started feeling normal. then the pandemic thing happened and i havenâ€™t seen my therapist since maybe march. i havenâ€™t also been taking my antidepressants often so yeah. i feel this intense depression. itâ€™s impossible to do stuff. i spend half the day sleeping and i just nap and nap. i canâ€™t bring myself to face my friends. my family is sort of dysfunctional so i canâ€™t really tell them. i canâ€™t tell my friends because they all have their own problems and iâ€™ve already worried them enough. itâ€™s been like this for maybe 3 months now i guess. iâ€™ve felt sad before but itâ€™s never been this awful. i feel like this is the real deal. itâ€™s hard to get up. i feel this awful tension in my throat all the time and it makes me want to vomit. i feel so fucking awful all the time i hate it so much. itâ€™s so hard. i donâ€™t even know how iâ€™m feeling most of the time. i donâ€™t know what i want or what i need or what help i want. so itâ€™s so hard to reach out. i donâ€™t know anything about anything. about myself or my emotions. i just wanna die. thereâ€™s a bottle of gin that got discontinued because of high methanol levels downstairs. iâ€™ve been thinking about drinking it. but i donâ€™t know if i can finish the whole thing quick enough, and if i only drink a little, the my family would still know because the seal would be broken. itâ€™s so hard. everythingâ€™s so hard. i hate this. i hate myself. iâ€™m so awful. all i do is hurt everyone. if i tell anyone this then iâ€™ll end up hurting them. i love helping people but ever since i reached out to my friends, they havenâ€™t let me help them because they know iâ€™m hurting too. and the fact that i canâ€™t help them with their own battles is hurting both me and them. i wanna die. i wanna drink the gin. i donâ€™t know. maybe i want to be normal. but i donâ€™t like the person i am when iâ€™m normal. this depressed me is so comforting in a way because iâ€™ve gotten so used to myself. i hate myself when iâ€™m happy. the only solution is to die. because even if i get better, iâ€™ll still hate myself. god. i hate this.
