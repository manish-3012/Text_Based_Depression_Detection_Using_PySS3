My son isn't mineI just found out through a paternity test. I was taking his mother to court for custody. It's all over now, I'll never get to see him again. I've never felt so low in my life and I don't know what to do. The last time I saw him was at the lab and now it's over forever. My heart has been ripped out. He's only two and he's not even gonna remember me, it's just all gone now, I have nothing anymore.
