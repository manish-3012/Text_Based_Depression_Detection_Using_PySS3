Itâ€™s over...My life is absolutely mundane. My life is the worst. I am not loved, have no friends, bullied and judged.

You know what Iâ€™m done with this. The time is here. The time has come to END. MY. LIFE. NOW.

Iâ€™m sorry for existing, I didnâ€™t think I can be a problem. I am going to kill myself soon. Thanks for helping me, but I think my life is at the end of the line.

If I no longer existed here, Iâ€™ll one problem less for people to deal with. They are going to be more happier if I am gone.

Goodbye, everyone...   ðŸ‘‹
