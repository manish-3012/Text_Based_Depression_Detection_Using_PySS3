I donâ€™t get it, what is wrong with me?Iâ€™ll get straight to the point, I want to die. Iâ€™m a 13 year old female artist (I use that term loosely) I hate school to the point of wanting to literally bang my head as hard as possible into a locker and hope to all hell that I die if I just keep hitting it. But obviously I didnâ€™t do that nor will I most likely, I have been depressed probably since I was about 8 or younger and I have always thought of suicide and I donâ€™t really know why. I probably having things mentally wrong with me but I have gotten extremely good at hiding my depression and suicidal thoughts for over 5 years now, and I only keep getting better. I have broken down in school recently because of extreme anxiety around people and especially when someone takes my things (someone I called a friend stole my bag and thought of it as a joke which this only made everything worse) I donâ€™t know why I can get extreme anxiety from this but I do. I have never really had a want to live to be completely honest. Until a few days ago, so this is where Iâ€™m like â€œwhat the fuck is wrong with me?â€ Because I met someone on a game they were nice and it was just enjoyable to be with them we ended up playing later that day and overall spent 9 hours together that day. But he was in a bad relationship (long distance) and when I heard him literally crying in the voice chat I was so extremely worried and scared I didnâ€™t know what to do so I stayed with him for at least an hour trying to make sure he was ok. He was nice and never wanted me to be upset and I didnâ€™t want that for him either and we both ended up having a crush on each other. For a little I was happy but that didnt last. It all went away so fast I didnâ€™t even get a chance to hold onto it. Because when the weekend started I started to feel depressed and later into the night when I was going to bed (yesterday) I started to think of suicide. Now today Iâ€™m acting like Iâ€™m ok and for a little while I was with him I truly was ok, he keeps me calm and I canâ€™t deny that. But I still think of cutting myself hurting myself doing anything to harm myself and for the past few months Iâ€™ve been on the edge of cutting myself etc. and Iâ€™m just here thinking â€œwhatâ€™s wrong with me?â€ â€œWhy am I shaking so much and crying?â€ â€œWhy does he like me? Iâ€™m just a freakâ€ I have these thoughts so so much and I canâ€™t help it, itâ€™s becoming harder to hide this, mainly from him and its kind of driving me mad because I donâ€™t want to bother him I just want him to be happy.

Because to be completely honest no matter how stupid this sounds, heâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m here looking for some help
