I didn't do itI was planning on Suicide yesterday but I procrastinated and wasn't able to do it before my birthday. Now it's too late and I'm a 22 year old virgin. I'm not really going to do it any time soon because it doesn't make a difference for the next year until I turn 23. I'm posting here more for support so I understand if this post is deleted but please give me some kind of indication so that I know that it isn't just people not giving a shit about me and not replying. I feel so bad about having had been a failure in highschool and not being able to get over having lost then is why I want to do it
