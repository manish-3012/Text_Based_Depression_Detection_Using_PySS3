Feeling empty and hollow.I feel as if I have no purpose. I feel empty. I try to find a hobby to preoccupy my suicidal thoughts. But something positive turns negative. I feel like I can't do anything right and feel that I don't have any skills or redeeming qualities. And the negative thoughts just spin out of control.

Honestly, I think my family wouldn't care if I was dead. I try to spend time with them but they are always busy. No one calls me just to say "hey". When I call them asking for help (sometimes financially) that's all they remember. They proceed to tell me I only come around when I need something. One of my step parents let it slip that my brother is the favorite (that hurt). Growing up, I always thought it. And my parents would tell me I'm jealous. Pretty much exist because my mom couldn't go through with an abortion. I was not wanted. My brother was. 

My whole life, I was pretty much treated like a mistake. 

I guess I'm just a burden or too much of a mess to deal with. I have OCD so that may be another reason they can't stand me.  If I didn't have kids I don't think they would have anything to do with me. 

I'm trying to stay strong. Because my last suicide attempt, my family tried taking my kids away from me and giving sole custody to my ex. And now I feel that if I ask for help or have to be admitted to a psych unit for treatment my kids will be taken from me. And if i don't ask for help, and bottle everything inside, and attempt suicide (and fail) it would be the same outcome. It's a lose-lose situation.

I'm pretty much worthless. I accept it. I just don't know why I'm hanging on and having a wait and see approach to life. My soul is restless and not content. My life is dull. I'm trying to be happy and I can't. Maybe my happiness is when I can finally rest in a dark void. I'm sorry for the self pity. I don't have anyone that will listen and talk to me.
