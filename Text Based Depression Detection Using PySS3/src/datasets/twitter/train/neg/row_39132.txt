Almost did it todayI went to sleep last night with a weird feeling in my stomach. The feeling ive got when a loved one passed away. I woke up this morning with the same feeling. And a voice inside my head telling me toray is the day. Everytime I'd walk past a set of knifes or a bottle of pills. Something in my body told me to reach out and grab them. After pacing back and forth in my brother's house for what felt like 10 hours I picked the knife up and held it to my wrist. And then my phone chimed, it was my brother in law. Wanting to talk to me. My brother in law saved mh life today.
