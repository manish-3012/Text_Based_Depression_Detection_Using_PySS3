Itâ€™s getting harder and harderI keep having to remind myself that suicide isnâ€™t the option, that I canâ€™t kill myself over my boyfriends accident. Itâ€™s just getting so hard. I feel pathetic, I donâ€™t feel strong at all. I donâ€™t know what to do or really how to cope. College starts soon and there are new opportunities and what not for me but I just donâ€™t think I can mentally cope with it.
