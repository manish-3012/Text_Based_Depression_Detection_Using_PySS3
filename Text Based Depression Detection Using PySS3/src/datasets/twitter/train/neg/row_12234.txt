My note before I leave tonight.I like to picture what things will be like when I am gone. I wonder what will happen to him, good and bad. The beauty of it is that I get to shape my own future, in my mind. Pretend that certain things will happen after I pass, even a part of me knows they won't. It's freeing. 

I don't like to think about my family, because I can not think about the depth of pain my actions will bring them. If they ever read this, I want you to know that I am so sorry for what I have done to you. If I could write down words to assuage the pain, I would. But I know nothing I can say can help. Try not to think about me too much. I am sorry. But please know that I am in a better place than I ever was. I am no longer in any pain. For years, I used to stare at the bottle, the pills, the knife. Know that if it had not happened now, it will have happened later.

I think some people were not meant for this world. I have always believed myself to be one of them. This is what I want, and I hope you can take solace in that. Forgive me, and please forgive yourselves too.

I am closer to death than ever before. This is my choice. I believe that I will see you all again. Maybe not in the same form, but I am always with you. I will always be around you. I love you guys. I am sorry.
