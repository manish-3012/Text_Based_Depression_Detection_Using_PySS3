People like me need to die.People like me need to die. Im wasting air that good people breathe. People waste money on me. I'm a loser. My parents think so. Everything thinks so.

I've gained weight so I m a fat, kissless virgin loser whos so dumb that I took a shit college major but can't job a job. Even if I did. It's a job that pays just enough so I'm.not in "poverty _ I have no social skills. Never talked to people in college zero friends. I have , "friends" but they all hate me. I can't blame them.

It's my fault though. I have literally zero good qualities. I'm better off dead but of course I'm not brave enough to kill myself so like every thing else I hope someone else does it for me
