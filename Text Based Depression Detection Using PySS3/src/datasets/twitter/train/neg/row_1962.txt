Doing it togetherI want to start a suicide cult. I feel like a lot of people back out for a lot of reasons and then, later on in life when shit continues to be fucking miserable for them, they regret not ending it earlier. Me included.
So I think if we got a hivemind of likeminded people and gave the tools + plans necessary, we could all drive to the forest or mountains or whatever and do it at at once. The chances of backing out would be significantly lessened when surrounded with other people that are determined to die just as much as you want to. A herd mentality could be the encouragement people need. There's a lot of holes in the idea but I'm just throwing it out there.
