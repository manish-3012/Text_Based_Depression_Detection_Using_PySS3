I told the counselor, wish I could go back in timeI think it was the biggest mistake of my life, but oh well. Yesterday I tried to commit suicide, I failed because I was too scared. I also self-harm. After telling her a million times that I didnâ€™t want them to know, she told my parents, and I got out of school for today. My mother picked me up and well, it wasnâ€™t as bad as I thought it would be? I think itâ€™s good they care about me and doubt I will attempt again (at least not in a long time) but... I still think this was a mistake. I shouldnâ€™t have told them. This feels like one of my nightmares honestly. Theyâ€™re are debating if they should bring me to a psych ward or something, and honestly Iâ€™d like to because I think I need some time for myself right now. Itâ€™s being very hard to handle. I just hope this doesnâ€™t stick into their minds and one day Iâ€™ll be able to return to my normal life, live alone, then do whatever I want with myself, even if that means I start self-harming again or making new plans. I just want my life back and I feel like now itâ€™s not going to happen anytime soon. I wish I could go back in time
