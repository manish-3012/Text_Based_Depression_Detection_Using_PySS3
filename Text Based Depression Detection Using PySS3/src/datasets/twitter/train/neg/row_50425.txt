Fuck it, buying a gun todayI live in a state with no waiting period, besides no matter when i buy it, i'll still be feeling like this. there is no good in the world. even with supportive family and friends, it doesnt matter. i dont matter. maybe to them, but to me, life is no longer worth it. too much pain, anger, and hate. my depression, i feel lets me see realities and the truth is, life is awful. this is hell.   
im not sure if i was ever happy. i didnt know what it was then, but i clearly remember feeling empty, worthless, and numb at the age of 8. almost 3 decades later and its still here, but the stresses of life have made it more pronounced, more visable to the people around me. my boss came to me today and asked if i was okay since i was making multiple major mistakes lately. during the lockdown they even split my job into 2 roles since i was unable to keep up. now im doing half of what i used to and i cant for the life of me focus enough to do it right. my job is easy, just not for some one who has been going through a mental breakdown for the last month. and no, a month ago, things werent rosy. they sucked then but at least i could go a day without a complete breakdown of sobbing uncontrollably.   
i plan on getting shit in order so my wife won't be so burdened. any tips on things people usually overlook when getting their affairs in order?  
doing it friday. lates, yall
