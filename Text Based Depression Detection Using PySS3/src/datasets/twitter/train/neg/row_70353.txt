Today was the dayIâ€™ve loved the number 8 since I first learned how to draw it. Today was going to be the day because of that. Seemed like the thing to do. Go out on 8 day like I shouldâ€™ve 10 years ago but I havenâ€™t. Iâ€™m still here, still fighting. 

Iâ€™m not sure why but I am sure and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s killing me. The duality of it all. The constant one thing or another but never the middle. Iâ€™m trying to live in the middle these days. Iâ€™m trying to be better, to get better while knowing that I never really will. 

My mental illness is not going away. Thereâ€™s treatment but no cure. That alone makes me wish for oblivion. But Iâ€™ve only been diagnosed and  in treatment for a short while. Mere months, not years. That keeps me going. Always curious about the future. Always curious about what lasting contentment feels like while I wonder if Iâ€™ll ever be able to have that at all. I guess not knowing keeps me here. 

Today was supposed to be the day. Iâ€™m honestly glad it wasnâ€™t. Itâ€™s a muggy early evening as I write this. The sun is setting casting its waxing light behind the rain clouds on the horizon. Insects call to each other from trees that sway in the cooling breeze. Cars pass by playing music I remember from my youth. Dogs pull leashes across pavement looking for a place to call heir own while followed by their owners. There is life happening all around me. 

And Iâ€™m here. Alive. Smiling.
