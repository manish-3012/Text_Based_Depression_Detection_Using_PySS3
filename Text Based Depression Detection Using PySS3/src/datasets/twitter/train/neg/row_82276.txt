I feel no emotional attachment to my parents, is it normal?Found this out after a friend pointed it out, I was going through a rough time and they said "well... think about the the last time you genuinly liked hanging out with your parents" after that I kept thinking about it and it kinda explains a lot and why I'm so uncomfortable around them all the time. It kinda feels like I'm just a person they have to take care of, not because they love me but because morally that's the right thing to do. It's weird cause my (younger) sister loves them and she enjoys hanging out with them but I can't stand them? 

Anyways not sure if it's normal and I'm not sure if I should post this here but oh well
