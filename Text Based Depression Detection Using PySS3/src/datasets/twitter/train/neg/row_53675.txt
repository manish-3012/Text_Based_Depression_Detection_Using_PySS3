I've been considering it a lot lately, what are good reasons to continue?Hello everyone.
As the title says, i've been considering dissapearing since few months ago, i can't find any reasons to continue, to be honest. All my life the situation hasn't been easy and i pretty much battled against it, i worked and studied hard for everything i have or used to have but never had that better life that i always wanted, no one ever gave me or put anything in my hands, i've been a hard work person my whole life and achieved some great things like scolarships, recognition, etc..


I used to be the kind of person that always was positive about everything doesn't matter if nothing went right i always though that tomorrow would be a better day but honestly i'm just tired of everything, nothing ever seems to be enough, nothing works out and all those plans and things i wanted to do are just gone. I don't see anything in the future for me, i'm just stuck where i am, i used to be really positive and energic, now i'm just  tired all the time wishing i could sleep, i am not eating well and i have this constant headache that i just want to stop.


I'm not in my city/home, i'm alone and i don't have any friends or family beside my mom but i lie to her and tell her my life is great and everything is wonderful. So i guess it would be somehow easy to just leave everything and finally get some rest.


In the last few months i've been trying to have a reason to live, being positive about everything but day by day i'm running out of ideas and can't find that motivation to continue, at all- and at this point i've completlely lost any interest in everything, i don't really care about dying at all- i'm just tired, hungry, angry, dissapointed, sad- i'm about to get to the point where i'm going to just do it without hesitation, i mean, nothing is stopping me, not a life to live by or anyone or anything. 

Is there something i'm missing? is there a reason to continue?
