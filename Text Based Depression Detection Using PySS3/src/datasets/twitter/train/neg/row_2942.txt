I am going away soonI am ending my life very soon


2020 is going to be the best year ever because I will no longer be suffering or hurting, I will be dead. 

I am a 17 year old girl and I have lost all hope. 
I went to public school for many years and since year 10 I have been homeschooled, in my middle school years I was bullied very bad. I feel so alone, worthless, and like everyone would be better off without me in their life. I have borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety, and my parents are not supportive of it. I show any sign of my mental illness and they do not care about me. There are many trees where I live now, I have thought about hanging myself from one. My dad has multiple guns and I could use one but I donâ€™t think I have enough nerve to pull the trigger. I canâ€™t deal with it anymore. My father is abusive. 

I feel as if I do not exist, my mental health has not gotten better I am getting worse. 


No one checks up on me, my â€œfriendsâ€ do not exist anymore, I truly have no one. I made an Instagram without my parents knowing and I have made a couple of online friends but theyâ€™re not here and I am alone. I am never going to be happy, I will never be enough. I am a burden. I even told my father once that I was feeling down and I felt like suicide was an option for me he offered me his gun. I feel like I have been left out of everything , when my â€œfriendsâ€ meet up and go out I am never invited, I am no ones first choice.  

My mother tells me I want to be sad, I am choosing to be sad, that is not true. when I cry, I am made fun of or mocked by my father. My father calls me names, he called a â€œdummyâ€ today, he has called me many more worse things than that. Before I say anything else, I just do not want you to tell me â€œyouâ€™re so young, you have your whole life ahead of you! You will be 18 this year and things will get better!â€ I have heard it before and I have no hope. All I see is what I do not have, when I was younger I had a â€œboyfriendâ€ but I have never truly experienced love and i feel as if i never will. No one wants me, I am nothing. If a boy talks to me, I am abandoned or they do not talk to me again. 

My cousins, aunts, and other female family members are having children, happy with their significant other and I am so jealous of them I am jealous and it makes me want to peel my skin off. I am suffering, I am hurting, I am crying writing this. Suicide has been on my mind for many months now, it has never been this bad and I know no one will miss me if I go, no one misses me enough now to think of me or message me why would they when I am gone? 


I have so much sadness inside and no one cares no one understands how sad I am. I express myself on the outside to show how I am feeling on the inside, I am scared to go in public now each time i went with makeup people would stare or even giggle at me and that makes me so upset, why am i different than anyone else? 

Growing up my uncle would always whisper in my ear â€œyou need to lose weightâ€ and I remember him telling my mother â€œthere are girls her age that are skinner than herâ€ or he would give me 10 dollars and then have a smile on his face and laugh about it while he told me â€œdonâ€™t go to McDonaldâ€™s and spend thisâ€ 

I was never fat, I am a curvy female now. Things such as this have traumatized me and I canâ€™t stop crying. I had a dream of a family member that raped me, I felt it i am starting to believe it was not a dream. 

I have self harmed since the age of 9, when my father found out he laughed and told me â€œyouâ€™re just trying to fit in with the girls at school that cut themselvesâ€ I have relapsed and after I am finished typing this I am going to cut myself again. Itâ€™s always something I fall back into, my thighs are covered in scars. 

I am suffocated by my thoughts and by my depression. I can not go on like this much longer, life is unbearable for me.
