Suicidal byeThinking about killing myself soon. Reasons don't matter and not trying to get attention or talked out of it. I do have a question. Should I tell my family bye first? I know my wife wouldn't care. I'm not too sure my wife would care. I wouldn't tell them I'm killing myself, just give them a generic bye.
