I was raped 10 months ago, and am male. I'm done.SW, 

I am 13, and in December 2011 I was raped by a 16 year old girl. I lost all my self confidence, and attempted suicide. My school found this out recently, and I am being taunted nonstop.

I just found out that this girl miscarried a kid...my kid. I'm just so torn up.

My grandfather died earlier today, and my father's away on business - I feel jumping out of my 3rd floor window is the only option now.

Help me out?
