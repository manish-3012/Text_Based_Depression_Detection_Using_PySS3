I wish I had succeeded two years ago.I have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. Two years ago I was in probably the worst situation Iâ€™ve ever gotten myself in, and I tried to commit suicide. My attempt was obviously not successful, but I wake up every. single. day. wishing that I had ignored the phone call that saved my life. 
I am so miserable, angry, sad, and lonely. Moments when I feel should feel happy, be happy, I feel nothing. I have managed to cut ties with basically everyone in my life. I never reach out to friends, I donâ€™t answer messages and calls. I donâ€™t think anyone would notice if I slipped away. I can feel myself getting closer to the ledge I was on 2 years ago. It scares me, I donâ€™t know what to do. But on the other hand I welcome it.
