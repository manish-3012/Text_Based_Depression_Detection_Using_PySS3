Social anxiety and depression. Can't do it anymore.I graduated from school in May. I'm 27. I put off school for awhile because of anxiety/depression. I managed to get through with good grades. 

But now I got a job I'm not qualified for which I start next week, and aside from that, the idea of going to a new place where I know nobody, in a town where I know nobody, hours away from home, makes me sick. I'm so isolated and I never make friends because I don't have the guts to make an effort to meet people. I just keep to myself. I don't have the strength to go through with the job. But I don't have the strength to quit either, and face the humiliation and shame from that. I've always quit things out of fear in my life, I can't do it again. 

If I did I'd be totally on my own anyway, unable to get out of my lease  I just signed and pay my student loans. So there's really only one escape from this situation. I know it will hurt my family, but it's not fair to ask me to keep suffering just so other people won't have to experience some pain. In the long run, it's one less burden for them anyway.
