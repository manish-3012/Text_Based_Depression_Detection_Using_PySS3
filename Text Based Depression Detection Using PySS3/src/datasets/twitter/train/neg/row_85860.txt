Not really thinking of killing myself... just really depressed.My parents don't care. My former girlfriend and former friend and now ghosting me, don't care. I have no reason to motivated. I can't prove my skills, there's no one to say "I did this." to. I'm trying so hard to prove myself but no one's listening. I should just let my grades drop and become a recluse. I'm very sad, and suicide may start popping up. I just thought things were getting better.
