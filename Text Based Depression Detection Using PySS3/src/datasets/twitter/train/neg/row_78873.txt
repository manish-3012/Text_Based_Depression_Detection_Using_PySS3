Not very good at writing stuffIâ€™m 19 pretty much 20 in uni


I have no prospects or talent, no friends and a huge problem with anxiety, I struggle even buying stuff from a store, especially if itâ€™s with a cashier

I donâ€™t think itâ€™s worth going on because I read that life only gets worse, and itâ€™s been getting worse for me since 15 and I donâ€™t see anything changing

I donâ€™t know if I deserve to be happy or if I can get anything to make me happy or something, idk

There isnâ€™t really a need or demand for me to be around so itâ€™s probably better if I just go
