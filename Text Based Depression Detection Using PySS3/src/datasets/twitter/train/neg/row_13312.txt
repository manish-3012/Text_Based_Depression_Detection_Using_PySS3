I just want to give everyone a Mery Christmas.I know Christmas can be extra hard sometimes, hearing about people spending time together, spending time with family. "The true Christmas feeling." I Just want everyone to know that a perfect Christmas doesn't have to be with someone or family, do what you like. Do you want to be alone on Christmas and have fun by yourself? Do that! Nobody is going to stop you, be proud of who you are. I know that being "loved" is great, but there is nothing more important then loving yourself.
