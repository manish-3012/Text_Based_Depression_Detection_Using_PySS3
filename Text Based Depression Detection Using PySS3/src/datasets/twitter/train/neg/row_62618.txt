...need someone to talk to.So I usually don't do this sort of thing but I don't know what to do anymore. I suffer from anxiety and depression. I've been/still am on meds and seen councelors but nothing seems to help at all. I just feel empty and like I have no one. Im making bad decisions to keep my self happy and distract me from how i really feel. People say I'm young and it will get better but I really can't carry on living this way any longer. How am I suppose to make new friendships, relationships, get a job, when I'm too scared to even try. I need someone to talk to or some advice, just to get me through the days..

Had to repost on new account as it wouldnt let me log into old one(bethanrose_) /:
