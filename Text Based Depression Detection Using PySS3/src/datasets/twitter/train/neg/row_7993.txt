Death is only hopeNot strong or disciplined. An addictive personality sometimes looks like discipline but is often just an inability to stop digging. I realize that I have just been very lucky twice in my life. Lived off the echoes of that luck until fucking it up. Craziest thing to off yourself because you're too lazy to stage a comeback. But that's what it's going to be. Not young anymore. Fucking tired. Even the roaches seem to gather, they know I'll be dead soon.
