I'm struggling so much and I can't tell my psychologist or even my friends and family why.I wish I could, but I'd be even more depressed in prison. I hate having to keep this to myself and my only outlet being strangers online. I seek advice from religious people, it sure would be nice to truly believe in Jesus and God's grace but it's just so hard to believe. 

I always think about death, probably more than anything else. I wanna know what happens when we die, because no matter what happens i'd have the closure to just do it without the fear of the unknown. I think about how much I wish I wanted to live, but life really has nothing to offer for me and I have nothing to offer to anyone else. I write songs with subtle references to my situation and I draw pictures that symbolizes it too. It helps a little, maybe someone will figure it out some day. I just want help with how I'm feeling. I don't like sympathy or empathy, I want answers, coping strategies, even just a friend to count on, but I can't tell anyone why I've been feeling this way. Ugh, who cares :)
