I'm literally unemployableMy life is beyond repair at this point. I'm 26, never had a job, zero references to use. I have a degree that actually makes my chances of finding work even lower than before (try applying for anything with a 3rd class degree in London and you'll know). Whenever I look at job listings and see their applying criteria I have a panic attack. I think looking for work is going to push me to committing suicide even sooner, so when I'm told by my mum to just keep carrying on and muscle through it I really don't know what to say. I know I have to do it but it'll kill me if i keep going :/

I don't consider myself a suicidal person, the thought of wasting my life like that is beyond depressing. But I have no other choice at this point.
