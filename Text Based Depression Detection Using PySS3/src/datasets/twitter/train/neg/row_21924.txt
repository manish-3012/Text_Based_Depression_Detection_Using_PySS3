I give up completelyIâ€™m done trying with anything. Iâ€™m extremely empty and depressed. I have nobody all of my relationships with everyone are broken and Iâ€™m terribly sick I feel so empty and lost and I canâ€™t get out of this black hole. Everytime Iâ€™m with my friend I end up pushing her away to do some other plans because I suck the life out of her. I told her she might as well ride with her boyfriend last night since she wanted to drink and she wanted to go home but I secretly wanted to go to the trails and take the rest of my pills which ended up not working I fell asleep in my car and ended up driving home. I had my suicide note as my background which is super lame but thatâ€™s all I had. Nobody loves me nobody understands nobody wants to deal with someone with issues and I get that. I donâ€™t want to be around anyone because I bring everyone down and I get into my head and canâ€™t get out. Iâ€™m extremely close to giving up. I donâ€™t want to go to the hospital I want to feel wanted and I want to feel connection, my whole life Iâ€™ve been on the back burner and have been feeling like I have no where to go or turn and Iâ€™m over it. Iâ€™m a burden and I donâ€™t deserve it. I canâ€™t help my mental illness but everyone seems to think that this is me as a person and itâ€™s not. I donâ€™t have insurance so I canâ€™t see a doctor because Iâ€™m too broke for insurance. Iâ€™m suffering.
