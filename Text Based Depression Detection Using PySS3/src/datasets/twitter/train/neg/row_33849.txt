HelpI donâ€™t want to go into too much detail. My roommate told me about this subreddit and this is like my last resource because I think ran out of options, I donâ€™t know what to do. 

I tried to kill myself two months ago or so and Iâ€™ve been seeing a therapist since I was discharged from hospital but itâ€™s not working for me. Iâ€™m not feeling any better. I keep messing things up and pushing people away. 

I just ruined my 4-year relationship and this was the only thing making me feel something, I still thought that my life was going nowhere but at least I had someone who cared. I stepped out of the classroom because I canâ€™t focus, Iâ€™m having the same thoughts I had before.
