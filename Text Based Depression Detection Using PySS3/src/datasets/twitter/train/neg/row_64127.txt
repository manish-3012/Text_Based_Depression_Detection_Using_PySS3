Do they feel any guilt? At all?Anyone else's Parents enable them their whole lives and once we're extremely depressed, anxious, suicidal, useless adults they tell you that you aren't allowed to be sad/suicidal? That it's just an excuse to be lazy? 
My ADHD was untreated for 10 plus years..did you think I'd be a perfectly functional, happy adult? Am I not allowed to blame you? For not caring enough? For not giving me special attention growing up to make sure I was mentally healthy? But no, you, mom, complain about the dirty house, harassing me until I explode. But no, you, dad, sit in your man cave drinking not giving me any attention, not having talks a father and son need to have, until I explode, and then you're back in your room.
You taught me nothing growing up, and now I just focus on not dying. All of my energy goes towards distracting myself. I don't know what to do with myself...ma?...daddy? I miss you.
