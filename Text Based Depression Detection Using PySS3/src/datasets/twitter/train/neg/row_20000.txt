I get cold sweats and goosebumps when I think about killing myselfI canâ€™t wait, my stomach churns with excitement. I canâ€™t wait to slowly drift away and my blood overflows the bathtub. My head will sink below my blood , itâ€™s nice and warm, almost like a goodbye hug. I canâ€™t wait to play slow jazz and I leave this earth. I want to dance around to the music just fade away. I have already experienced enough life but Iâ€™ll just have to wait for the right day, I want to drink my own warm blood I want to say goodbye.
