I need help about how to save my friend NOWMy girlfriend, (we are both 16) and I broke up about a month ago. She is a wrist, and body cutter. She has been trying to get me back, and she is very unstable. Today, she ended up in the hospital because she tried to kill herself through cutting her wrist. She seemed to have thought that by doing that, I would automatically be obligated to come back. Well, I made it clear (yet Tactful)that that was not the case. She is now threatening to kill herself again. She is saying that as soon as she gets out "she will do it right". She is saying that she will hang herself once she gets out. I will not simply promise to date her to stop her from doing this, and am now in a situation where I truthfully simply don't know what I can do. What can I do to save her before it's too late?
