I love life and yet I'm gonna commit suicide by the end of 2018.This morning, I wrote my suicide note. It's the first one I actually finished writing. I love life and how exciting it is but I want to die. I have several ideas, one of which is ideal but not sure how it'll turn out. The other is more gruesome but more likely to work. It's funny...I'm pretty happy now that I know I'm going to kill myself by years end. The world seems to be on my side and yet, it's the inside of me that is urging me to die and that part is going to win. I can put myself in the middle of a crowd, or sit in my room, and the thoughts are there. It's not worth it. I also like the idea of dying young (23), pretty, and peaceful. For the 23 years I lived I know I haven't experienced much compared to most but I've experienced enough in my eyes. This isn't a desperate suicide plea, I don't feel like there's no way out. It's peaceful, I know I'm going to kill myself and I just decided to do it by this years end. 2018 was the best year of my life.
