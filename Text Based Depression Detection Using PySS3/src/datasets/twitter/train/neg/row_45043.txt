A common deterrent is to think of your family and friends. Why am I subject to their feelings?Straight to the point. For myriad reasons I've occasionally thought about killing myself for years. These last few months have made that a daily contemplation. The how mostly. I'd like to spare my family some pain. I've tried to think of accidents, like crashing my car. I would never shoot myself. That would be the worst I could do. 

My real question is the title. It sounds harsh, but when I don't see the point in anything, how can I be forced to stick out the tedium for their sake?

To be clear, I'm not, "On the edge." Like I said earlier, I'm just contemplating.
