How do people make it through their days without a friend hereI really don't get it.

I don't get it at all.

Like sure I'm tending to myself. I journal a lot. I meditate a lot. But how long do I stay here without anyone really hearing me or being there for me. I'm sick of this place. I've tried to leave many times, because it's clear there's no way I'm meant to survive. Idk why people hate engineers in my country so much, it's not like we wanted it. And I'm trying my hardest, even when there's no one watching, or hearing me burst into tears every night. I'm just tired.

Don't want to wake up as me. I have no idea what to do. Pointless making comics cuz there isn't anyone around who likes them. No idea what I should be. Life is hard without a friend
