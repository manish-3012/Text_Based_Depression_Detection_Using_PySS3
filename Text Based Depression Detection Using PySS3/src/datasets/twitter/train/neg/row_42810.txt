Life is deeply unfulfilling - and I donâ€™t know whyIâ€™m so lucky in so many ways: Iâ€™m married have two beautiful children and a home. In spite of this, thereâ€™s a permanent hole, a sense of longing I donâ€™t know how to address. 

Itâ€™s becoming so painful to live with this. Iâ€™ve tried to resolve it for years. Medication and therapy havenâ€™t helped, itâ€™s always there.
