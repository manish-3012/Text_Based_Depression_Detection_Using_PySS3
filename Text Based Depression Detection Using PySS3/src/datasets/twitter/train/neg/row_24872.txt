I'm planning to jump on the freeway?I'm going to commit suicide soon because I just can't handle life anymore. I'm thinking about jumping on the freeway into traffic. The only thing I'm worried about is ending up paralyzed, people stopping in the middle of traffic, someone seeing me and calling the police, or causing a car accident which probably won't happen. I feel like jumping on the freeway into traffic will make me feel free. Just looking down at the traffic, closing my eyes, and jumping. It's like saying f you world and letting them do whatever they want to me at the same time.
