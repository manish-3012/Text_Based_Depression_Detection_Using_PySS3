I'm a worthless, inept person and I wish someone would just come shoot me really fast.All my friends are internet friends. I didn't have many friends in high school, certainly none in my actual school with me until we all graduated and suddenly people granted me small pity hang-outs in the summer. It was a small private school and I was the weird nerdy tomboy who knew too much about microbes, everybody hated me. They were always planning to humiliate me and shit. I wanted to hit everyone who fucked with me over the head with a stapler every day, but I know that's what they wanted. A fucking reaction.

I got into good STEM-based colleges but I bailed out on it like an idiot.

I never had a relationship but I had sex once and the person kept following me and threatening to kill his whole family if I said I didn't love him, effectively ruining my chance at a sexual relationship for the rest of high school.

Oh this is such a clichÃ© and I'm such a stereotypical bitch for it but all of my friends are male because when I have female friends they seem to get insulted really easily and the relationship always feels shallow and then they leave. And all the time I hear that my male friends only want me because I have a viable vagina...and i'm startng to think they're right.

It's me, not anyone else. It's just me. I'm too socially inept to befriend other girls like I'm supposed to. The people who I think are my friends are all pretending in hopes of getting something more. Maybe I should just become a full-blown slut and give them what they want so they won't leave, but then I'll be worth even less. I am the God of sadness doomed to a life devoid of compassion or camaraderie and one of friendlessness.

I'm also a NEET without a plan for life, but i don't think I'll need one.

I hate my peers, in fact, I **hate** humanity- but I've realized something. It is *me*. &gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt; am the worthless person. Everyone else lives just fine. I feel as though life is not worth living for someone like me, someone awkward and weird who likes books and movies better than people. I hate the world, and so maybe it's natural selection that I jettison myself from it. I am an opiate addict, these feelings predate my usage and offer a good escape but I know soon enough that will stop too, I know how it goes.

I know most of you cringe at my entire wall of text and are going to pretend to care/not be repulsed by me. I don't know why I posted here. Maybe I am an attention seeker, eh? Fuck all of this.
