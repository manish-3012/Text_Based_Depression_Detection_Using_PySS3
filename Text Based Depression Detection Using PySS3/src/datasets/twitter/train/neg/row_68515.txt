Very Upset, I Think I'm Ready to Say Goodbye to this WorldI'm thankful that I was able to make it this far, but I don't think I can take it anymore. I don't think I will ever get to a point where I will ever be truly happy with myself. I have too much internal conflict, too unstable, and I am nothing more than an amusement to others. I know I will be causing a lot of pain, but with time they will learn to accept it and move on. They will realize that I just wasn't meant to be in this world. I'm Ready to say Goodbye.
