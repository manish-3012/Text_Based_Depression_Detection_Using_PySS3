there is no circle for mei hear this thing about people having "circles". a word for a group. you are either in a circle or you are excluded from a circle. some people don't fit in certain circles but that's ok because there's always another circle for them. but why am i so special? why do i bear such a unique honor as to suffer this primal desire to be "in" when I'm stuck in a world that has no circle for me? it is perhaps pretentious of me to think this but up until this point in my life I've found no evidence to prove this theory wrong. how long must i go with the constant exclusion before i can deem it true?
