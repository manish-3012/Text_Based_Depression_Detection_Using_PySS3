Reddit, I can't stop thinking about it.I've battled with depression my entire adult life, mostly built around self-worth issues and an inability to deal with failure. I got out of highschool, and things got better. I was in college for a couple of years, but eventually dropped out due to grades (again, crippling fear of trying and failing) and to help support my family after the death of our mother.

But it's all falling apart now. I've been back at home for over a year now, and things seem okay. I have a stable job, an interest, and am slowly saving money. But I don't *feel* okay. Every day I start out happy, and end up borderline in tears, thinking about braining myself. It started as a wayward thought here and there, and now I'm spending hours a day, fantasizing about how if I was dead, I wouldn't be ashamed of myself anymore. My body, my position academically, my relational status.

I'm incapable of being proud of myself. On the rare occasions where I work up the courage to actually try something, I'm ashamed of my work, knowing it could have been better. I've been slowly growing more and more ashamed of myself for years, and the weight of self-hatred is crushing me and leaving no room for any kind of positive thought or emotion. Combine this with the fact that all of my immediate family is either dead or dying, and I've lost the will to cope. I don't want to be the last in my line, wallowing away in my own failure until I croak 50 years from now. I want it over now. I want the pain to stop.
