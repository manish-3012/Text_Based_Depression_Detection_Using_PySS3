I might as well just kill myself, right?I'm so sad and I'm stuck in a place that I'll literally never have a way out from. I'm in a dead end job, did something dumb when I still had hope and got my Bachelor's Degree in Communications so it was already hard enough to find a job. I finally found one but it's not even full time. I live with my dead-beat mother who only makes about $100 a week on her own so I pay all of her bills, meaning that I have no savings for myself, no money for things for myself. I can't even afford the $30 to go take my permit test to try and get out of my fucking situation. Hell, I also can't afford my $56 health insurance cost, and I have a heart disease, so as soon as that goes in a few days I"ll probably end up dead in a few months anyway. Supposed to have open heart surgery this summer, but my health insurance is about to be shut off and there's not a damn thing I can do about it. And even if I had the money to keep my health insurance, I can't afford to take any time off of work so I can't even fucking afford the inconvenience of a heart surgery anyway. And my mother does nothing. I pay rent, electric, cable, food, everything. It's like I'm living by myself without the benefit of actually living by myself because she watches over me like a hawk and I'm 25 fucking years old. 

I'm just so sad and with my heart problems, I'll probably be dead within a year anyway. Really want to just take matters into my own damn hands but I'm too scared to actually do it so I just keep suffering every single day and I'm literally the only one I know in this god damn situation because I'm the only one trapped in this never-ending cycle of poverty around me that I can't fucking escape from. I have the weekend off and my mom's at work all weekend, so I think I'll try to finally end it today or tomorrow. Just don't know how to yet because I can't even afford a pack of razors. Cruel irony.
