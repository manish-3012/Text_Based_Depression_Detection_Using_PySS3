I fucked up my lifeAbout 4k$ in debt after developing a gambling addiction, 20 days late on my rent, failed my studies at uni and I'm starting to look for a way out. I've been depressed for years and suicide have always been an attractive option for me, however I could never do it to my family. All I keep thinking about is my mothers reaction when she hears about my death. But I feel like I don't have another choice.
