Everything hurts and I just want to stop it...Iâ€™ve been suffering from depression for 7 years (Iâ€™m 18f) my father was abusive and my family made me an outcast. I have bad anxiety, eating disorder and self harm to punish myself. I have no job, no money and my mom is kicking me out. The only thing keeping me alive is my amazing boyfriend who has been with me all this time. I really just want to end it, everything is too hard to deal with right now... but I love him, I want to live my life with him.  Iâ€™m so confused and i donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t live with him and his family either. I really have nowhere to stay...
