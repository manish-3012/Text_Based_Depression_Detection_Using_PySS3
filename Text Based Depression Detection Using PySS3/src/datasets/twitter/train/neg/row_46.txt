Just want people to know whatâ€™s happening in my life since I canâ€™t really tell someone irl without them freaking out or something.I really donâ€™t want to, but stuff is going to happen soon resulting in me loosing my family, school, and my long term girlfriend. Iâ€™m really scared, im a coward, and honestly would rather be dead than try fix this mess. Mess is putting it lightly though. If my life was a large puzzle, itâ€™d be like just throwing the entire thing in a fire of shame. Iâ€™m thinking about just cutting an artery, but idt Iâ€™d have the stomach for that, but Iâ€™ll figure something out. I hear it takes a while to bleed out, If you donâ€™t hit an artery, so people are usually discovered and saved. Fortunately, I live alone in a dorm room and no one ever visits so I have a lot of time. I wrote a note in class addressed to my girlfriend. Looking back at it, itâ€™s kinda all over the place, but I donâ€™t feel like fixing it. I hear if you slit your arm it can cause permanent damage if you fuck up, so I got some medical stuff just in case I wake up and decide not to try again right after. I guess Iâ€™m writing this here to make sure people know. I donâ€™t have a history of depression, and havenâ€™t really shown any obvious reasons for something to think Iâ€™d ever kill myself. I feel a certain sense of control and calmness and Iâ€™m actually looking forward to the time I have to make the decision. If I decide to go through with it, Iâ€™ll let you guys know.
