no reasons to live except her, is it then worth living?the only reason I'm still alive is because my ex is still talking with me and she understands completely. She's still my friend and I mean the world to her but I can't bare to not get the love from her that I used to get. I don't see her as just a friend and I'm only living for her so she doesn't suffer if I die. What the fuck should I do because I can't bare to sit next to her without love and I can't bare to lose her because I'll then kill myself.
