How do I tell someone?My suicidal thoughts have been plaguing me lately and I can't deal with them. I want to tell my friend but I have no idea how. Like how do you bring up something like this. It also scares the hell out of me because while I want help I'm scared of what their reaction might be or if other people might find out about this.
