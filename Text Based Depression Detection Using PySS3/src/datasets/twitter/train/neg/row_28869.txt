Would someone give me a reason not to?Please. I'm drunk as hell, and I'm sitting here just trying to find something to connect to.
A failure in every aspect, I feel this might be the night I just say fuck it all. 
I was doomed from my very childhood and onward, I honestly don't think anyone expected otherwise.
