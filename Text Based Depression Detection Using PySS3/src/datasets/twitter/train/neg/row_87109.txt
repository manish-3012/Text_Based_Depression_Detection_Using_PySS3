I'm so, so tired. I just want to die.I can't go on. I've forced myself to be alive for the past ten years. 

Everything is agaonisingy difficult.

I don't think I can work  anymore.

I havnt showered in a week. I can't leave the house.

I hate being alive, I hate constantly having to work at every single aspect of it while my mind is begging for death. Talking to people, going to work, having  hobbies - ive done everything right and it's been for nothing. I'm just even more tired now.
