Why I Don't Care to be Here1.) Childhood trauma and strict parents enforced my anxiety

2.) Growing up as an only child with strict parents hindered my social skills

3.) Getting bullied in school killed my self esteem

4.) Having no one to turn to when things got bad resulted in self loathing

5.) Finally finding someone who loved me only for her to leave me for someone else (with possible cheating months prior) two years down the line shattered my heart, and has left me in pieces. 

6.) Being in uni has killed my confidence even further because I don't know how to make friends, I'm super stressed out, and I procrastinate too much.

7.) My mind allows me to belittle myself at every step, and I don't know how to get out of the cycle.

8.) I can't believe anyone wants me for me, I can't believe that I have value, and when I try, I just feel like I'm lying to myself
