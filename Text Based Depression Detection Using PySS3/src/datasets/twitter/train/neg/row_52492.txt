Right now, I hate myself.I had another horrible fight with my husband, and I feel like I am just an awful, selfish person. I keep hurting him and our son with my selfishness and ego. 
He keeps asking me to get better, to do some work on myself, and I keep failing.  I really feel like they would both be better off without me. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't feel like I deserve to live.  I wish I had never gotten married or had a kid, then I wouldn't be hurting them. 
I wish I could erase the last 20 years of my life and just be alone because I don't think I am healthy enough to be any use to anybody.
I really think my marriage is falling apart. It's my fault, but I don't think I am capable of being a good enough person to fix it.
