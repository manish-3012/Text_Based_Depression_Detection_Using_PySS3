My best friend saved my lifeI have suffered from depression for a while now, and have had thoughts of ending it. But a few days ago, I decided I was going to do it.

I was on my break at work (I'm a cleaner) and I just decided that I was going to go to my cart, take the toilet cleaner from inside, go to the nearest cupboard and drink the whole bottle.

I got out my pen and paper and started to write my note. But, then I got a text from my best friend.

She was just texting to ask how my day was going. She knows I suffer from depression and wanted to make sure I was OK. It's like she knew what I was going to do, even though she had no idea.

And just like that, all thoughts of ending it left me. It's like it just melted away. I realised that I can't kill myself, because I know that she would blame herself. She's that kind of person.

She saved my life, and had absolutely no idea that she did. I really want to thank her for it, but I'm kind of afraid to tell her because I don't want to upset her. I want to tell her how much her friendship means to me. How much I love her.

So, I'm gonna ask you lot a question. Do I tell her?
