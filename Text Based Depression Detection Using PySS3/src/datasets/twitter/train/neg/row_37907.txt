what am i doing with myselfthe name's moogle and i am thinking of killing myself again today. im so sick of falling in love too hard and slipping and falling on my face. i hate porn. i hate camgirls. i hate that he decided it was okay to look at it even though i begged him not to and that it would send me into a hysterical fit. i thought he wouldn't hurt me. i hate that my brain won't leave me alone for one day.
i just recently found out i have a psychotic disorder and im so sick of hearing what's wrong with me. it never gets better. i have no future. my family's sick of living with me, my bf hasn't spoken to me in 3 weeks and it seems like im never going to be happy. fuck bpd, fuck depression, fuck anxiety and most importantly fuck paranoia. i can't even function in society. and im trying so hard to climb out but every day is another day im told im not trying hard enough or that im just lazy. he promised me children. he promised to me he didn't hate me. he told me he cared about me why can't I believe anyone hates me i feel like someone's sick joke
i am obsessed with watching videos about murders. i secretly hope someone would come and murder me in my sleep so it would all be over.


if you've read this far, thank you.
that's probably the most anyone's listened to me in 4 years.
