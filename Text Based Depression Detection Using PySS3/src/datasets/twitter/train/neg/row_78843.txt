Can you choose what happens to your body?Is there a way I can leave instructions of what I want to be done to my body when I kill myself, or will it go automatically to my closest relatives?

I could also leave some cash to cover what I want done.

I want my ashes burnt and thrown into garbage dump or pig farm. I would also want zero funeral or any similar event.

This would be in north america if that matters..

thanks
