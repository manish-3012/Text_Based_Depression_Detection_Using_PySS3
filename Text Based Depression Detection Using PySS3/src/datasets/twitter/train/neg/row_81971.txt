A feeling ...I have a feeling that this year is going to be my last year.

I never had such feelings before. Iâ€™ve been depressed for more than three quarters of a decade, and during this time it kept getting worse and worse. 

Recently I decided that I have had enough and I want to rest. 

Iâ€™m nothing but a failure and i drag everyone around me down. Iâ€™ve never been good at anything, always disappointed everyone around me and I donâ€™t have real life friends. Havenâ€™t had any in many years. 

I had a person I loves but sheâ€™s gone and never coming back (didnâ€™t work out i guess. She never loved me to begin with, but whatever)

You get to a point where you just wonder if its all in your head or if its real. 

I genuinely donâ€™t know if i am crazy or not. 

Fuck it. I feel at peace and happy with my decision. I shanâ€™t be missed or whatever. 

Câ€™est la vie. 

Iâ€™ll be back on the day I do it to say good bye. Not like it matters. 

Iâ€™m a bitter asshole.
