Something wrong with meTheres always this constant lingering feeling that thereâ€™s something wrong with me and I donâ€™t know what it is. I just donâ€™t see the point in life but Iâ€™m not depressed. Sometimes Iâ€™m a bit anxious but ig so are a lot of ppl. I always feel hopeless and Iâ€™m always questioning the purpose of life because I donâ€™t even know what the point is. I think about killing myself a lot. Idk. Itâ€™s just kinda numbing. I just feel disconnected from life. Like Iâ€™m living and itâ€™s okay, but Iâ€™m never completely satisfied, and Iâ€™m just wondering will I ever feel more than this. What does it feel like to be happy or normal or connected to life? I donâ€™t know if this is normal or what.

Im not looking for reaffirmations or whatever I just need to know if this is what itâ€™s meant to feel like.
