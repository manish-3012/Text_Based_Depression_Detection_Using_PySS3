Getting ready to leave this worldI have a booklet with my farewells, the reasons why I did it, post-death instructions, personal confessions, and my outlook on the afterlife. 

Just gotta clean up my room and wait a night where my mom and sister are at work. That way they won't hear the sounds of my convulsing body hitting up against anything while I'm on my way to death.
