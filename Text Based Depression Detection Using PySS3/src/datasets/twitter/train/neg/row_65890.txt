I still need help. I made an appointment with a therapist in two days but I feel like I can't make it till thenI'm so tired and i freaked out at my mom today for not understanding how scary it is to be in my car and think about driving off a bridge. i am a burden to her and my family and I made no progress today. i just fucking flipped out at her again
