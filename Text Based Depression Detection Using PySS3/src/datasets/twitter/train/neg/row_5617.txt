Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ll make it.I had planned to commit suicide in October, but now Iâ€™m not even sure if Iâ€™ll be able to get to the end of April. There are only a few things that are stopping me. 1) Iâ€™m going to be buying a new house with my dad, and I at least want him to have it before I go. I donâ€™t think heâ€™ll have much of a will for anything after Iâ€™m gone. So at least they wouldnâ€™t have to worry about a house. 2) potentially seeing a friend again. That is if they still want to see me.
