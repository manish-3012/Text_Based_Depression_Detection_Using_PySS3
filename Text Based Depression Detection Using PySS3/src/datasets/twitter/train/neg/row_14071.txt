Not a day goes by...Not a day goes by I donâ€™t think about doing it. I once had a plan, I knew what to do. I was physically shaking as I just felt so broken and didnâ€™t wanna live anymore. Growing up in a toxic Christian community you were always told as a teenager, â€œif you commit suicide you will go to hellâ€. I donâ€™t believe it, thatâ€™s why I wanted to do it that Christmas...I thought everyone around me would be better off without my presence. I felt like a disappointment to my family, a terrible friend, and I was just tired of the self hatred I wanted it to be over with it. But I never committed to it...it was so quiet and no one ever knew except strangers Iâ€™ve told and my therapist. 

But still...not a day goes by...because there is that thought in my head that grow and drift...what if I did it...
