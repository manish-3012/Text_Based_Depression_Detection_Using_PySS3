My disorder can't be cured. Dying really is my only optionI'm sexually attracted to animals and have been living with it since puberty. The only reason I had hope in the past was because I thought it would go away once I got older. That's what a bunch of sources said happened to most people who experienced it. But now I'm 21 and I'm still fuckin suffering. 

I used to think that everything would go back to normal, that my sexuality would go back to how it was before I accidentally saw that bestiality video, and that I could eventually have my own family, but none of that is ever going to happen. RN the thought of bestiality is arousing for me while the thought of sex with a man or woman is barely arousing, and the body of a man or woman does absolutely nothing for me. An animal could brush against me and arouse me. I used to never feel things like this. I used to be completely straight and attracted to women's bodies before I saw that video. All I wanted was a normal video, not even hardcore type stuff but for some reason that bestiality vid was on a normal porn site.

I hate myself so much it's honestly unbelievable. People online sometimes say that I should focus on other things because "sex isn't everything," but what they don't realize is how much this affects every other part of my life. How can I be happy and confident if I feel disgusting, predatorial, and ashamed of myself whenever I get aroused? How can I be happy being alone, and having everyone around me able to enjoy their normal sexualities.

I'm just so tired of it. I was going to call a therapist today but what's the point of paraphilias can't be cured anyway? I just don't know if/when it will end.
