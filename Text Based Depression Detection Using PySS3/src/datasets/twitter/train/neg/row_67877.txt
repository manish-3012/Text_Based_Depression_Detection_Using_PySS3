Fuck this shitty worldWhat the fuck is the point? I'm 17, failing school, no friends, no money, a parent I wish I could kill and another whom I hate very much. Nothing makes me happy. It used to be music, maybe video games but now, nothing. I find joy in nothing but pain. I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to be happy. Why can't I be happy? It's this or prison.

I figured I would just tell somebody before I do it. It's time for me to move on.
