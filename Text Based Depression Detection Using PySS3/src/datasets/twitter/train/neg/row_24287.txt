I want to get stabbed or suicideI love animals and i love t help other people i have a big heart but I hate my life,  im a jobless 21 years old  italian, my parents wish i never born, im a burden to everybody all I do is playng videogames all day, im feeling in a cage i always try to help other people but I dont care about myself anymore, i think of suicide but i dont want others to think I am a loser more than i am, also i have a gf from philippines by 4 years and I love her so much i dont want she to be sad but still  wish somebody kill me, everytime I walk outside i try to go close to everybody wishing they end my life.
Plus my dad keep making super annoying noise everything he does i go crazy for that it make me want to kill him, i asked him nicely if he can please stop but he dont care at all, every action he does he do a noise, and when he eat omg.. is the same as listening loud metal music, is first time i open to reddit so i dont know how you guys will react.. please be nice i just want to try to be happy in life but  i dont remember the last time i felt happy but i cry everyday, im more dead than alive...
