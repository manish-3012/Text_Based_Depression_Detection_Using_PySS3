I can't keep doing this everydayThis isn't fun. I don't like having such long periods everyday where I just am angry, sad and annoyed because of how awful I am and how I won't succeed in anything. I can't keep going out and trying to interact with people only to later revaluate how everything I said and did was wrong. I can't keep not interacting with people only to remember how rude and unnecessary I am being to the people around me. I can't call the hotline, because they might call the cops. I can't keep being such a disgrace every single day. 
Why should I live? I'd appreciate a good reason as to why I shouldn't die. I'm not a good person. No one benefits from me being alive. I'm probably too weak to kill myself anyway. I'd wimp out. Either way, I'd appreciate the reason(s).
