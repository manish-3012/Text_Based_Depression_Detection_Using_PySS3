Struggling because I want to die but canâ€™t bear to leave my childrenIâ€™m 26. Iâ€™m married and have two kids. I have endometriosis and every day is excruciating pain. I canâ€™t remember when I wasnâ€™t in pain in 4 years. I can barely have sex. I miss sex so much. I canâ€™t pick up my children. I rocked my son to sleep and threw up from the pain after. I had to leave my job. 

On top of that, I have severe PTSD. I have horrible memory, trust issues, anxiety, and I got frustrated very easily. Iâ€™ve been trying for years to get it under control. I thiught I was doing well but I guess not. My husband is very unhappy. He hates when I forget things, he thinks I just donâ€™t try hard enough to remember. Iâ€™m very hard to deal with but I went to therapy every week for over a year. Iâ€™m out of my Zoloft right now and struggling. 

I have PTSD because my mother abused me my whole life. She also allowed her husband to molest me when I was a toddler and screamed at me when I told her I remembered. The argument culminated in her choking me until I passed out. When I didnâ€™t come to school my teacher, who I shared with, called 911. She knew it was getting bad. My mom blames me and told the cops I had attacjed my little sister. Who was at school at the time. They still took me to a mental facility and treated me for homicidal tendencies for a week before a family member adopted me and took me out of state. My mother signed her rights away when I was 15. 

All of this to say, I want to die. My life is nothing but trying to deal with my pain and my broken mind. But I love my husband and I love my children so so so much. I donâ€™t want to leave them. I feel like Iâ€™m being ripped in half and I donâ€™t know what to do.
