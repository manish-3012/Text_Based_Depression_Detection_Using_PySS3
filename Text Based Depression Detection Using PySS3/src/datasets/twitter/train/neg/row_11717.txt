I just want to survive long enough to move out.Every fiber in my being is crying out for the sweet peace of death, but I'm begging myself to hold on until I'm able to move out of my parents' house, which should be within the month. I'm scared I won't make it, especially since I'll be home alone for a week. Does anyone know about making a safety plan?
