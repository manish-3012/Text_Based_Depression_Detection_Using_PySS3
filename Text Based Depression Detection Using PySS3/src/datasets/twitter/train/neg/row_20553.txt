suicidal femaleUniversity of California 
So I recently made a huge mistake dating a frat boy and now hes doing every petty thing in his power to get me expelled after I dumped him. I currently have an accusation for sexual harassment (interim) &amp; stalking based off of ONE facebook message that wasn't even sent to him. I'm not going to lie, it consisted of some pretty nasty stuff to a girl I felt needed to hear it (still wrong of me, I know). He got wind of the fact that I sent it and filed the complaint. I have an informal meeting on the 12th. Long story short he lied to me about having an std test before we started dating. He had a urine test done but not blood work. So when caught him in a few lies I demanded to see his results, He showed me his hiv one due to a legal obligation (which only applies to a positive result, but clearly dudes an idiot and took my word on the matter) &amp; refused to show me his IGG result. I flipped out and messaged someone about it but was smart about it. I did it from a nameless account that HOPEFULLY can't be traced to me. what should I do? Should I lie about it or come clean and hope for the best. No joke, I'm graduating this spring. I'm pretty upset with the fact that I acted this immature and shot myself in the foot, but if anyone could give me some advice or insight as to how the school will probably handle this? Thanks.

*Oh! This person also has many sexually harassing texts and comments from phone conversations. Should I hire a lawyer to subpoena my phone records. Can you do that with phone conversations? I don't think its fair for him to point the finger when this clearly isn't a one way street. please help?

When we were dating I was suicidal due to medical stuff. I'm feeling that way again now due to this. Back then he just told me I'm being dramatic, but he had a friend kill himself in the frat over being gay and didn't do anything about it when he could. I think he just doesn't have a soul.
