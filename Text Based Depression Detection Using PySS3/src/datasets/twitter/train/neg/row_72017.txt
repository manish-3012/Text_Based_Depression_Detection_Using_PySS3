I cant fucking stand this anymoreLife fucking hates me im honestly starting to think. Im seriously debating suicide. My parents split up a year and a half ago and oh boy has that fucked shit up. When it first happened i was a dumbass and just followed what everybody else thought. And that was to dislike my stepmother. Well i snapped out of shit and matured like hell and said well lifes life. I met my stepmother and she is cool. I get to see my dad more and thats amazing. The problem is, is that my mom hates my stepmom. She is always talking about her. ALWAYS. I CAN NOT STAND IT ANYMORE. It bothers me so much. Me and my mom always argue because of it. And she just goes on and on about how im being manipulated but who the fuck cares. Im seeing my dad more and thats all that matters. But this has taken a serious toll on me. I jist dont know what to do anymore about my mom. Thats not the only thing. Another thing is that i have no fucking friends that care about me. I wish i had that person that asks me how im doing and checks up on me but i dont. I dont know what the fuck i want to do when i get older which is terrible. Im tired of being single. I just want to meet someone. Someone that truly cares about me. I guess this was more of a rant but i wake up everday and im just not excited for anything that is going to happen that day. Tired of everything.
