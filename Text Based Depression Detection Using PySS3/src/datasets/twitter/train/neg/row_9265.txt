Lost mother and other loved ones this year to suicide.Multiple family members of mine have died of suicide this year. It makes me feel guilty for living. Keeping wanting to join them but I'm too much of a coward to go through with it. 20k in debt, evicted from my home and lost everything. I feel so alone. Even asking for help or financial assistance from others seems downright pathetic.
I feel like I can't move on or allowed to be happy.
