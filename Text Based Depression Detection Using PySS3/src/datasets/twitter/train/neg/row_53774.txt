If I hear ONE more person say "You've got to love yourself before others will love you "again I'm going to fucking kill myself.normally, it's ex's of mine that tell me this kind of shit. While I agree a little bit, it's fucking crushing to hear that. Like, wtf man. I'm struggling with depression, and you tell me I have to "Love myself?" It doesn't just happen easily like that overnight. These are the same ex's that told me to basically fuck off when I was suicidal. I was always there for them, and they disappear when trouble sparks up. 

Every relationship I've had in my life ends up in some sort of bullshit argument, and then they end up taking a cop out and giving me cheesy advice. That, or they spread some random rumors about me that seem feasible and get their fucking gang against me. -_-
