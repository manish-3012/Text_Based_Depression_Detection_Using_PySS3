Advice from older peopleI'd like to talk to someone who's older than me. I'm pretty young so someone who's in their 30s or older would be preferable. How's life like? How did life change when you entered your 30s? Why are you on SuicideWatch and since when have you been feeling like this? Have things gotten better or worse? What was your childhood like? And finally, do you think life is worth living or should I kill myself while I'm still young?
