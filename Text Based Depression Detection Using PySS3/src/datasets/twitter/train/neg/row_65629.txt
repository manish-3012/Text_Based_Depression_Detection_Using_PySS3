I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.Iâ€™ve thought about dying for a few years now. It didnâ€™t used to be suicidal thoughts. I just wished I got into a car accident or something. And even when it got more into wanting to end it myself, I would always think of my family and determine I could never hurt them like that. As time goes on, I find it more and more difficult to talk myself out of these thoughts. Thereâ€™s one person in the world who can make me feel better just by being in the same room- my ex. But because he doesnâ€™t understand in mental health and he thinks Iâ€™m just â€œtoo negative,â€ we broke up. A few days ago, we started talking again. When we hung out, every bad feeling I had bottled up inside me just disappeared. Today, I had a bad day. The kind where your depression and anxiety hits you as soon as you open your eyes. The kind where itâ€™s a battle in your head all day long. He told me Iâ€™m crazy and Iâ€™ll never change. I canâ€™t help it. Iâ€™m not even good enough for the one person who can calm me down. I just want to not feel like this anymore. I want to end it.
