Just need to not be scared of dyingI feel like I don't even know how to be normal anymore. Even if I had been happy 5+ years ago.. I feel like my body just won't even remember it again. Recently, I turned to drinking to help cope, and all I did was freak out my boyfriend and break his heart. Had withdrawals for two days. To top off my destruction At one point I drank a bunch of cleaner and ended up throwing it up basically right away, so it certainly wasn't enough to kill me. I missed work and didn't call, and I go back tomorrow after telling them I was in the hospital. I wasn't, but maybe I should have been.
I'm getting so much anxiety and sadness over it: I have a degree and I work retail, and I'm not even good or capable at that. Social anxiety is constantly killing me or making it hard to carry a conversation or be myself around anyone but my boyfriend. My whole life is just one constant fuck up.
I'm honestly just a bother, I'm only going to ever fuck up more, I don't deserve this world. I don't deserve my patient and loving boyfriend. I wish I could I just die, but everytime I overdose I end up getting scared and telling someone. Landed me in a ward twice. Considering just crashing my car next, since that would be something to not come back from.
Even now I'm still too scared. So I'm just waiting. Kinda just wanted to vent, see if anyone feels the same at this point in their lives..
