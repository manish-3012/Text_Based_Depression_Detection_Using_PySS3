Suicide because Iâ€™m lazyIâ€™m not sure if I actually have depression or not but it certainly feels like it. I just feel perpetually stressed out about everything in my life no matter how small or large the issue is. I feel like I have this heavy blanket on sometimes and I just canâ€™t really seem to get it off of me. 

I am lazy, I donâ€™t like doing things I donâ€™t want to do. I procrastinate a shit ton. I absolutely hate the thought of going to work for 40 hours a week for the rest of my life. I cannot stand that thought and it just makes me so sad. 

Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot lately about how I can get around this working for the rest of my life thing and I canâ€™t think of anything. Obviously everyone else does it and that makes me feel weak and then I feel worse about myself. 

Iâ€™ve been having a lot of thoughts about killing myself because thatâ€™s really the only option I see. I donâ€™t want to work, but I donâ€™t want to be seen as a deadbeat or a piece of shit of society. I donâ€™t want handouts and I certainly donâ€™t want people feeling sorry for me. 

Iâ€™m currently living with my parents who are upper middle class and white and my life thus far has been, for all intents and purposes, perfect. Iâ€™ve never gone without. 

I just honestly donâ€™t see how I can go through this life, but I know that killing my self will tear my parents up. 

Anyone else having similar thoughts or have any suggestions on getting through a lifetime of working?
