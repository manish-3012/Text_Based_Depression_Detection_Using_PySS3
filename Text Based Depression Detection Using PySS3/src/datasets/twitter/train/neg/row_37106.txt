i had a gut feeling 2020 was going to be the way it is- i was right.before 2020 i was always thinking "i have got to enjoy my last childhood years before 2020 screws it all up".

i knew it was going to happen. didn't know it was going to be that bad though, but i knew it, technology will ruin the world, privacy will no longer be accepted and spy drones will be everywhere, spying us on the shower, everything. i knew it was going to happen. or something else like a plague, after all it happened and 2020 fucked us all hard. 

2018 was so much better. i look back, and i don't regret anything good i did back then, it was all peaceful, my friends were still friends, i would go to the cafeteria and buy some chewing gum for 3 dollars, sit by a table with some friends and do whatever the hell without worrying about a damn thing. loved my childhood. loved the 2010's.

 i wish i could boot up a videogame, and just see how much of my life i had made, re-live my best moments, thank others and be grateful for what they did to me before plugging it off and sealing it away with a loved one. 2018. time of my life. i was having so much fun. 2 years later and it's all upside down. it will never be the way it used to be again.

i want to cry.

makes me really sad to see it was two years ago.
