An endless cycleAlways starts with boundless energy. Will be able to function with average of 2-4 hours of sleep nightly for week long stretches. First couple of nights of sleeplessness will start with watching TV into the early morning. Next few nights will consist of some sort of organizational task or in-depth research of different topics ( i.e making lists, doing math, cleaning, Google searches and reading multiple articles from different sources on the same subject etcetera....). This devolves into the next set of nights consisting of me laying in bed trying to sleep but unable to because of racing thoughts. First the thoughts are mostly positive ( how I can be more efficient at work, how I should be balancing work and home life etc). Then I start to panic about things (how I don't have time to do the things I want, how I'm being a terrible parent, how I'll never love a man who'd loveÂ me back etc). This spirals into an attack so prolonged and intense that I just wish to stop existing. At this point I'll think about everyone in my life and how I can't leave them and how horrible it would be for them if I was to just disappear. That then leads to me thinking that maybe they'd be better off. These two thoughts cycle in my mind whileÂ IÂ cry andÂ rock back and forth. All my muscles are tensed at this point and I usually have my head down with my arms covering it so I can a) dig my nails into the back of my neck or b) pull at my hair. Can only get myself to stop by taking old insomnia meds that I won't refill because there are currently not enough in the bottle to kill me if I down the whole thing. But I'm running out and I'm afraid of when I do. The only way to make the thoughts stop is to sleep and I can't without something that can possibly kill me if I decide to overdose.Â
