It plays over and over in my head like a movie (and how do I tell my therapist about this)The thought of dying, the different ways it could happen. The imagery of it is always going through my head. I don't do it right now for many reasons. Even though theres many reason why I should, and I know that's how it's going to end. But some days I can deal with the thoughts constantly going through my head, some days are harder than others. It has stopped me from going to work,events, and taking care of myself. All I want to do is just lay in my bed and think about these thoughts. I'm seeing a therapist and I want to talk about this but I don't want to be sent to the hospital. Does anyone know the way to approach a therapist with having thoughts of suicide but no intention to go through with it.
