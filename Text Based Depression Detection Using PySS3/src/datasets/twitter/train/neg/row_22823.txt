How to help someone with suicidal thoughts?Hello everybody. Recently, someone told me that he would be gone soon so I shouldn't worry. After elaborating, I found out he was suicidal again. This is his second time, the first he managed to pull through (suspicions that he just lied to himself telling himself he's ok). He has been to therapy, which he has said it hasn't helped him. I'm hopeless at this, due to the fact that I don't understand suicide, but I can't just ignore this. The reason for suicide is the common one, "the best option argument". He is stuck with his single dad who is abusive, and his mom is not much better, according to him. His school life is not bad at all, but to him, this is insignificant. According to him, his only reason for living is his fear of god as he is a Muslim. I wasn't the person who got him through the first time, it was someone else. Said someone else is very close to him, but does not know of the reappearance of his depression. Would it be the best option to tell said person, as I am quite numb to emotions.
