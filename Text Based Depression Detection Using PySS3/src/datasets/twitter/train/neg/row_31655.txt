All aloneI'm in a terrible spot that I only have to be in for another two weeks, but have to come back to it once the school year starts again. I have been nothing but nice to everyone I meet yet they always judge me and take advantage when my back is turned. This has been happening all my life, and it could just be me but I cannot take it anymore
