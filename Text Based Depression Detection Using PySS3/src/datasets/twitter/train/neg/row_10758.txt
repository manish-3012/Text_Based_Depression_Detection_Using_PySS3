Anyone else stay alive just for the sake of others?Killing myself would absolutely destroy my parents. They are such kind and beautiful people and I could never hurt them like that. I am trying endure this. I'm 25 and I am having a very difficult time seeing myself alive in 5 years. I'm lucky to have loving parents because without them I'd be gone already.
