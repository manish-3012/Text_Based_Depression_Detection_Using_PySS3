Finally Decided To Post HereWhat can I say? Shall I make a 4 paragraph-or-so long story about why I feel like I should end it all? Should I write down everything in my life that sucks, just so that anonymous people can read it and retort with generic phrases that they post probably upwards of 5 times a day on other peoples suicide threads? There's not too much point in that, other than receiving a strangers attention for all of 2 minutes. 

I guess the main problem I've had in the past couple of months that I've felt suicidal for is that I feel like I'm much more intelligent than everyone I communicate with. Can you imagine just wanting to hold a conversation with a human being, but you live with only monkeys? Sometimes, that's what it feels like.

Thinking this way, however, only furthers my depression, because I know that I cannot actually be that much more intelligent than everyone else, but deep down I BELIEVE it. This leads me to believe that I have a HUGE ego, which causes people to not want to interact with me. Kind of a catch 22, huh?
