If I leave this world just know it will be fine.I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing maybe Iâ€™m just begging to hold on, I donâ€™t think my family loves me, I donâ€™t think I can be happy either. I got a really good job in a home and I was fine there, worked 6 days on and Iâ€™m severely exhausted, Iâ€™m 80 pounds, addicted to coke and liquor. 
I donâ€™t have the power to be there all of the time and it makes me hypergilvent and paranoid. 
I just think Iâ€™m really negative, and unintelligent, and I donâ€™t think anything will ever be okay. 
I was hospitalized for bipolar, canâ€™t take my seroqul it makes me worse. 
I love my partner but they call me a bitch and a retard but I can see why. 
I just donâ€™t think anyone can love me, Iâ€™m too emotional, Iâ€™m a addict, and Iâ€™m disgrace to society. I will never emotionally hold it up enough to do anything. My house is in my name, I have enough money to pay the bills but I donâ€™t know if I will, I want to take my life before the end of the week. I donâ€™t know how or where to go yet.
