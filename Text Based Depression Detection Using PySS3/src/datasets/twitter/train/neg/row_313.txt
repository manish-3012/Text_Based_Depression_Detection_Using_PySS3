Eventually I will have to commit suicideBasically my story is about Body dysmoprphia and physical health problems
I am a 23 year old guy, 5 years ago if you asked me, I would never see myself talking like this and being a complainer but everyone have their own different situations and problems

I have a unique physical problem with proportions of my body, a problem I didn't have before I was 18. Now I am 23. For 5 years and counting I can't move that freely, my back and hamstrings are always sore from doing normal things. 
The problem is not only physical but it changed the way my body looks so I have developed severe social anxiety. I feel I look too wierd because of how my femur bone(thighs) look.
Before this I was a decent and good looking guy
I don't see myself getting married and even living an average life because my health gets in the way. I couldn't go to college because of this and this doesn't qualify as a disablity but sure feels like it. I work night shift as a security guard, with almost no human interaction. 
So right now I am living with my parents, it's the culture. They also cry when they see their son like this. Only reason I am still alive is because of them.

I seriously want to live this life and get better but I don't find any solution for my problem. Eventually loneliness and repeated cycle of pain will lead me to suicide.
