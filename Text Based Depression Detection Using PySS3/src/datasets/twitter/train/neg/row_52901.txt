helpi'm in such a dark place. 30. still with parents cand can't find a job. college dropout. i have a girlfriend who thinks the world of me but lives far away. im alone and have no friends. i have a bitter bitter outlook on life. i'm considering breaking up with her to spare her my inadequacies. she's younger and about to hit grad school, a good life ahead of her i would dthink. kl 
i hanve't been hapy in a long time, long as i can really remember. i just spent the last 25 minutes on the bathroom flor, naked, sweating with the heater on, crying and crying. i don not want to go on anymore. i don't.

UPDATE: Well, today is a new day, and I'm feeling much better after everyone's advice. I've made a solid 3-month plan for getting into shape, getting a job, and finding some decent education that doesn't hinder me too much. I'll keep y'all updated with how things go. Thanks again, everyone!
