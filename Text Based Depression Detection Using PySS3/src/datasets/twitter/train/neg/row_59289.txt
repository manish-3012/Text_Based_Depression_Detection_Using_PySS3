I need to release something before I die.I not planning any posthumous releases since my family wonâ€™t do it, so my plan is to release at least one album (maybe two) before I bite it. It honestly doesnâ€™t matter if I do, because nobody will hear the stuff I make. Iâ€™m just not cut out for a normal life.
