Not sureI have been very ill the past 3 years of my life. I am constantly in a ton of pain. I have not been able to eat food in over a year now. I used to be tube fed, but then even that stopped working so now I am on TPN. I am allergic to TPN, but I need it to live. I am constantly itchy and rashy from the allergy. This is miserable. Not being able to eat is miserable. Right now I am many miles from home at Mayo clinic. I have been here for a month and will be here 3 more, it looks like. Did I mention I am 18 years old and a senior in highschool? I had to quit traditional school though, and start virtual school. I had to quit sports (I was captain of tract and xc) which has been very hard on me. I never see anyone my age or any "friends" since I had to step down from school and sports two years ago. My life has been pointless, secluded and miserable. I try to put up a strong front for my parents. They love me a lot, but I am only trouble for them. Their entire world revolves around taking care of me. They spend a shit ton of money on my health care, but I just received word from the doctors that I am never going to get better. I'll never be able to eat again. I will never be normal, or able to do the things I love. 

Never in my life would I have thought that I would consider suicide. But tonight its been heavy on my mind. 

Instead of just saying the usual "stay strong, its not worth it" shit, can someone please tell me a logical way to shake myself from this feeling? Honestly, my parents are the only thing holding me back, but I know that they are better off without me in their lives.
