My Mother is suicidal and has a plan, not sure what to do. My whole life I have been helping my mother battle her depression and PTSD. I have given everything to help keep her going and alive. She has been in and out of Mental hospitals for the last 15 years and has overcome so much.

Recently I moved out of state for work and I haven't been able to help her like I used to. I still pay some of her bills, but I can't afford to pay for everything. She doesn't have a job and is considered "seriously mentally ill" by the state of Arizona. With cuts to the budget she has lost almost all of her state funded assistance in the last year. She is so incredibly depressed she doesn't have the motivation to even look for alternatives. I found out her mother has been sending her money over the last year. Her mother, my grandma, cannot keep sending her money and let her know this last week. My mom does not work, and has been unsuccessful in her attempts at social security and disability. She now has zero income and is about to be evicted and lose what little she has.

She has just informed me that she is going to kill her self next week. She has attempted suicide numerous times through-out my life, but I have always been around to take care of her and the situation. This time I am out of reach and am helpless on what to do. If anyone has any suggestions or is familiar with programs or organizations in Arizona that may help it would be most appreciated. I'm afraid anything I could do at this point may not be enough.
