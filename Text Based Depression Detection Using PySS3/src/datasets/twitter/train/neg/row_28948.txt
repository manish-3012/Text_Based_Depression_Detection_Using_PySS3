At 27, I realized the promise of life getting better is false, and that I have nothing to live for.The past three years have been the hardest. Iâ€™ve grieved a loved, Iâ€™ve been assaulted, Iâ€™ve been traumatized by an abusive relationship which lead me to ruin the best relationship Iâ€™ve had. I feel no passion towards my 12-hour workday job. I feel resentful towards my friends and on a basic level donâ€™t enjoy their company. My relationship with my family is fragile. Iâ€™m incredibly lonely but I know Iâ€™ll never be loved. I have nothing to hold on to, and every time I feel a little optimistic, the disappointment that follows is cruel and agonizing. I canâ€™t do it anymore, so Iâ€™ve chosen next Friday to be my final day. Iâ€™ll have a week to sort out my affairs but Iâ€™m letting go of all false hopes that life might improve.
