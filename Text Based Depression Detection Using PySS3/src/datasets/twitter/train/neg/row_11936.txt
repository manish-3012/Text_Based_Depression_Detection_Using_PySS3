Something is Wrong w/MeMy life is hopeless. I've tried so many things. I've read self help books, but then I turn and twist the advice in a way that haunts me and makes me even more upset about life. I'm seeing a therapist, but now I'm afraid to talk to them about my feelings. Life won't get better, but I can't kill myself. I have little hope, for I know that I'm crazy. I'm crazy and I drive myself insane, yet I must live on because others (family and friends) are attached to me. I can't talk to them either; my friends have heard enough of my drama, and my parents just wouldn't take me seriously. There is no hope for improvement; I'm destined to stay a failure forever because I'm not happy. Why can't I kill myself. The world doesn't need any extra failures and I certainly don't need myself to be a failure. Help!!
