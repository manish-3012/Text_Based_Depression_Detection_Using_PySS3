I feel stupid and i just want to die.I work in fast food and im 22 years old. I have anxiety and depression and i have eye problems and i think im stupid. Everyone at work thinks im stupid and the only thing i can do is hand out food to people everything els i mess up on. Im just ready to die. I really hope theres no after life.
