I am not feeling well...I am tired of going through life like this. I know I am headed towards a bad end.At some point I will do it. It's not going to be tonight or next week but maybe in the next year or so. I can't live with these feelings. I can't live with this constant agony and self-destructive behavior. I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm miserable and need help. I want an actual face to talk to. Not text.
