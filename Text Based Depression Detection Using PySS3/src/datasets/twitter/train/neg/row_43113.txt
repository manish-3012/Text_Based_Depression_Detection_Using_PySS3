Inner (Fulfillment) 

Brothers and Sisters, I want to start with this... I cant possibly feel the pain that your in, but I understand you on a level much deeper than you think. Life never gives us an explanation to why certain things happen in our lives, or why they are the way they are... This alot of the times makes us feel lonely... But I want you to know life is not happening from the outside; our experience happens from within! Dont let the outside factors determine who you are, your worth, happiness, morals or any of that. Thats all determined and manifested into the world from within!!! Things dont change overnight, of course... But you are here for a purpose and your purpose is a lifes work, not season... So bare through the change. Connect with yourself, f\*\*\* the world put it on pause for a second! Figure out what your purpose is here in this lifetime and embrace that, embody it, become comfortable with this feeling. That will help you find inner fulfillment on a level nothing else can.

Peace, love and light!
