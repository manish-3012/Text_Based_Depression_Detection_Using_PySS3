Do I not want to die?I made up my mind to kill myself in few years. Iâ€™m not happy, Iâ€™ve never been in my life, so thereâ€™s just no point continuing this. The only reason Iâ€™m still breathing is cuz Iâ€™m young. I wanna die before I turn 30, so I have like 7 years. I donâ€™t feel bad about it actually. Iâ€™m depressed now, but Iâ€™m really fine because I can finish this soon. Sometimes Iâ€™m even excited about it, so I thought I made a firm decision. But whenever I think about me dying, I cry. I really donâ€™t get it. Iâ€™m not scared, thereâ€™s no regret, but the trars always wear up in my eyes. What the heck does this mean? I wanna die and this shit is rly annoying
