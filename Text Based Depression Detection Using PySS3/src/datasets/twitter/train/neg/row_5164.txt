Could I please have some advice?So basically there is a girl that I have a crush on. I've liked her for a little bit now. She has a nice personality, and she is always positive. I was recently on Instagram, and I saw her profile pull up, so I clicked on it, and was going to follow it (also because I follow a lot of people in my school) but I thought I was being a little odd so I clicked away from the profile and stayed away from it. I know, I'm acting crazy. The issue I'm having is, is that I think she knows I clicked on it, I just got a feeling. I head people whispering my name, and she didn't show up to ass until later. I don't know if I'm just being dumb, but could someone give me advice on what to do? If everyone knows about it and think I'm a stalker, why should I go on living? My life will be over. I don't have a plan to kill myself at the moment, but it crosses my mind. If I could get advice it would be greatly appreciated. I think I have paranoia issues
