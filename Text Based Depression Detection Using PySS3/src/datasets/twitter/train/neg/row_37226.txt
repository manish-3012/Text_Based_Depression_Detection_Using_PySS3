HiI donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m so sad. If you have ever lost a person you love deeply, you know what itâ€™s like to get the news. Your heart shatters and you let out this painful cry, it hurts all over. Thatâ€™s what it feels like everyday when Iâ€™m sad. It hurts so much and I have no idea why I am so sad. But it gets hard to breath and I feel like screaming and gasping and tears flood down my cheeks and I am dry heaving, trying to stop but I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t know what to do. Itâ€™s so painful. And I have no reason to feel this way. Which makes it worse because I am stealing someone elseâ€™s tears, someone elseâ€™s sadness. Why am I here?
