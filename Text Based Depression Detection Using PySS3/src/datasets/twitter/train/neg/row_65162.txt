Tired Two months ago my girlfriend of six years left me. Not only did I lose my best friend but my girlfriend in an instance. I was planning on asking her to marry me after police academy. I'm tired of going through the motions of pretending I'm okay. I'm only functionally okay because I have to be for work and school. It feels like there's no between. All I've been doing lately is crying for the past few months. I feel socially disconnected from everything and everyone. It's weird to be standing in a room full of people who are seemingly happy while I'm imagining my own death.

It's been hard because I have no support network of friends. I feel guilty because I'm killing myself soon. I'm a bit hesitant to post this here but could someone talk to me? It would really mean a bit of difference to me and I hate asking you for that much. I just feel lonely.
