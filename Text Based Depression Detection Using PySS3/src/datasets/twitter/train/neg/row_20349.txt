My Goddamn BrainHow is it possible to start creating a game plan to make it into Harvard and seriously consider downing everything in the medicine cabinet in the same twenty fucking minutes? Seriously. I am so fed up with my messed up head. If it were as easy as opening up my skull and draining off some of the depression juice Iâ€™d start drilling holes in it immediately. As it is I wouldnâ€™t mind just blowing my brains out right now: thatâ€™s how tired I am of the roller coaster. My emotions feel like being strapped to a rocket missing a tail fin. I have no control, it takes practically nothing to send me into a spiral. I am my parentâ€™s only child and whenever I reach out they just donâ€™t give a shit. Iâ€™m pretty sure most of my friendâ€™s lives would be pretty unaffected if I died. Iâ€™m smart, Iâ€™m talented, Iâ€™m reasonably attractive. I have a bunch of really desirable traits and privileges so. Why. The Fuck. Canâ€™t I. Just. Live!?Why canâ€™t I just be ok!? Why does no one take me seriously when I say I need some goddamn help!? Why is it so hard to give me some validation that Iâ€™m not crazy and that just because Iâ€™m functional doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m okay!? I want to die so badly: I just want to curl up outside someplace pretty, fall asleep, and never wake up.
