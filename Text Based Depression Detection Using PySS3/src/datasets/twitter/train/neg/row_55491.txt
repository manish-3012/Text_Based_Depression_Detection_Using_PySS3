I need some help pleaseI have had suicidal thoughts for years. They ruin my day, and I feel they make a self fulfilling prophecy of sorts as they make me feel hopeless and unmotivated, making my feelings of having no future worse.

I donâ€™t have any friends. I donâ€™t think I have never been close to anyone, including my immediate family while they were still around. 

Iâ€™m terribly socially inept, and no matter how prepared I try to be and make my best effort to make good first impressions, I fail and end up falling into my rut eventually. 

I have constant suicidal thoughts all day, and have had serious contemplations close to a dozen times now. I feel I need help. Do any of you have any advice?
