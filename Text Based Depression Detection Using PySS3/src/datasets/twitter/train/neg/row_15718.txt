Iâ€™m running away next week and ending itNot asking for sympathy or any of that BS. Iâ€™ve thought of this for years now and have finally come to the conclusion my situation is never going to improve. 

Iâ€™m 18 and Iâ€™ve got everything booked. Iâ€™ll be travelling 6 hours away from home and then probably jumping off a bridge somewhere and then an OD if Iâ€™m too pussy to jump. I just canâ€™t do it anymore, and so it feels so freeing to know that everyday I wake up Iâ€™m one day closer to not being here anymore, just having free reign with no consequences because Iâ€™m not going to have to face up to them in 7 days time.

The knowledge of knowing I can exit this world whenever I please and just run away from my problems is more freeing than therapy and pills have ever been. See yall on the other side, stay happy
