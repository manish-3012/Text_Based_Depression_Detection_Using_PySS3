why can't i kill myself?wouldn't it all be easier if i did kill myself? i fuck up everything i do, i'm too scared to ask for support, i feel hopeless.

i could literally create a whole power point presentation about why it would be beneficial for the world and those around me if i did just die. i was debating creating it and presenting it to my science teacher, who is also the vice principal and i have previously gone to him for advice and support about how to manage stress and anxiety.

i want to kill myself, but at the same time i want help. i'm in a fucking quantum superposition of wanting help and not wanting it, but like Schrodinger's cat, i wont know if i need help or not until i kill myself. if i try go to my science teacher there is an almost 100% chance my parents will get involved, and they are very stereotypical indian muslim parents who believe LGBT people will go to hell and people who commit suicide go to hell and it is a disgrace to get anything but the top marks in school and will beat their children because it is "good" parenting. i don't want my friends to know either because, as supportive as they are, i don't want to burden them with trying to support me, a worthless cause. i don't want them to be like clay jenson from 13 reasons why, i want them to be like that guy who didn't care and paid no attention to it (minus the sexual harassment and predation)  because it would be no burden to them.

i don't know what to do any more so i would like to maybe leave it up to you guys to poll and decide whether i should kill myself or not. also i will mark  this post as NSFW because it is about me considering suicide as an option.

if it helps, i will give some metadata about me. i am 16 and live in the UK, but am in secondary education still. i am a good student, predicted  to get mainly A's and A\*'s in most subjects, a B in english.
