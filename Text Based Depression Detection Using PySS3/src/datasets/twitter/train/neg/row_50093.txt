finallyI have been feeling shit for months now. Only thinking about death nothing helps I just don't want to live. It never felt like this before, it really feels like my time has come. I met the most beautiful girl at a party yesterday, maybe she doesn't look like a model or something but I've never fell in love with a smile before. Of course, she wasn't interested but other girls were I don't care about. However I got even more drunk and went home and cried myself to sleep. I haven't cried for more than one year because I couldn't. I felt too empty to cry. But this night was different. I cried because I was not only sure that I am going to commit suicide. I now am also sure how. I will make the preparations this week and hopefully end my existence on this planet next week. It feels so weird. But it feels so right.
