I've held on for 8 long years...The first time I felt suicidal.. I was 20. I came from a very poor family and the cycle of poverty seemed to be continuing. I never cared about an education so i cut class and never listened to anyones advice. My family ended up homeless and we had to stay with a friend of the family. No money. Living off what the goverment could provide. Back then I had some hope. I got my GED and by coincidence I found  a part time job. I moved in with my aunt who's financial situation was a little better and we helped each other get up on our feet. I worked really really hard and managed to become a manager. This came at the sacrifice of my social life. I became distant to everyone and only focused on work. After awhile, me and my aunt became tired of each other. One thing lead to another and she kicked me out of her home. By this time I had some money saved so i managed to find a room for rent and that is where I am now as I write this. That was two years ago.

Last week, I made a big mistake at work and now I'm going to loss my job. I worked 8 years to reach this point and none of it mattered. I never thought something like this could happen. Even though I spent so long doing this job, I know that even on a resume, it wont mean anything. I cant find a job where I make as much as I did so from here it's all down hill.

I have been online for days wanting to kill myself. Reading all the reddits and studies and everything I could find. 

I have to die. I really can not do this anymore. 
Spending another 8 years to get back to where I am now fills me with ultimate dread. 

I think that I'm going to hang myself. If not then I will need to find a way to get a gun. I have to end this pain.

I have nothing and no one and I have no one to blame but myself. I'm so sorry mom. So sorry little bro. I gotta go....
