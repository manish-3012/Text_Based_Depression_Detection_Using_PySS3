Please tell me why I shouldnâ€™t try to ODI have now failed all of my goals and expectations that I set for myself when I entered university. I just wanted to do well in school (people told me I had an easy schedule so I shouldâ€™ve done really well), my job, and socially. 

Unfortunately Iâ€™ve failed at everything. I canâ€™t seem to do anything right.
- Iâ€™m doing horrible in two of my classes (I failed a paper and a midterm)
- I had to quit my job due to all of the stress there (it was  a very high pressure job)
- I have no friends here at university. And Iâ€™ve joined clubs to the point that I flew out to a conference that the club I was in was holding. Iâ€™m just a shitty person that people donâ€™t like so Iâ€™m pretty much doomed to be isolated. I also canâ€™t attend half the events at my uni because theyâ€™re 18+ (Iâ€™m 17). Iâ€™m currently on break and Iâ€™ve tried to hang out with a few people. I barely got any replies and no one wanted to hang out at all. 
- Iâ€™ve tried to date around here but Iâ€™m very unattractive so that doesnâ€™t work. I worked out all summer and nothing really changed. 

I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I pulled out some pills and alcohol this morning and I was very close to doing it. I didnâ€™t because Iâ€™m a pussy but I really donâ€™t see a point in doing this anymore. I donâ€™t see any other way other than continuing to be a worthless failure and getting more depressed.
