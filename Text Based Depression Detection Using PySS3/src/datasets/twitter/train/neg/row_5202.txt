I feel like my life peaked a long time ago and I don't really see a reason to keep going.My life peaked when I was 9 years old, sure I was getting bullied in school but I had friends that I'd play Lego Star wars with on the weekends.

I have a hard time making friends nowadays due to my social ineptitude and that I'm afraid to bother other people. It's also because I'm overweight and not athletic. I also have a hard time trusting people because the last person I thought was my friend just talked to me to con me out of steam games.

I just get tired whenever I think of my future, I won't make any friends and I'll therefore live in solitude. I'll work grueling hours at a job I'm not passionate about, only to leave barely no time for things I'm actually passionate about.

Life is already not fun and it's not going to get any better. I've wanted to kill myself for a while but the only reason I haven't yet is because it would break my mum and dad, which are the only people that care about me in this world.
