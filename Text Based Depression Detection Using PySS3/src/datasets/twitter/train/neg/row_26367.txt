Killing myself soonIâ€™m a pretty girl - until I smile then Iâ€™m a disgusting creature from a horror film because I was cursed with a gummy smile. Iâ€™m too poor and do not have insurance to get it fixed. Botox wonâ€™t work. Itâ€™ll just make me have a motionless flat lip with no smile. 

Iâ€™ll never have anyone love me because of this flaw. Every website and every place you can ask men questions have the same outcome. 
â€œItâ€™s a deal breakerâ€- â€œI canâ€™t stand to see girls smile, if their gums show too much.â€ - â€œI left a girl when she opened her mouth and I could see her gums.â€ 


Iâ€™m tired of being the girl you want to fuck - but only fuck because your too embarrassed to have your friends see me.  

So itâ€™s obvious I have no place in this world. I donâ€™t want to spend the rest of my life not being able to smile. Or if I am happy disgust people because Iâ€™m laughing. 

So Iâ€™m out. I wish I wasnâ€™t born with this but I was, itâ€™s out of my hands. 
If I could have chosen to be born with a regular smile I would have. 
But I was cursed so I might as well go to hell where I belong.

Donâ€™t worry guys I wonâ€™t hurt your eyes anymore with my disgusting smile. 

Iâ€™ve created quite a large opiate habit to numb out the pain of being ugly and disgusting, so Iâ€™m getting some fentanyl and Xanax bars and Iâ€™m going to shoot it all up. Itâ€™s going to be beautiful. Iâ€™m doing it for you guys youâ€™ve made it 100% clear I shouldnâ€™t exist. Iâ€™m a dolphin toothed alien that makes you vomit when I smile. Too bad every other part of me is pretty and little. Thank you god for fucking up my smile- I guess you created me to live in hell.
