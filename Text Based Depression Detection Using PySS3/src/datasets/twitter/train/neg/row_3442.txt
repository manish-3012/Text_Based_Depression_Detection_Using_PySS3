Another Existential crisisI am an existentialist 
But i try not to think about it 
Because I donâ€™t want to die
But sometimes i feel I donâ€™t have a purpose
I always tie a rope and hang from the ceiling and wait
And always my girlfriend saves me 
I have already accomplished everything I want in life
I get money for no work
I have a beautiful girlfriend 
I have car, house and everything 
And I am only 27 
I drink a lot of alcohol to hide the pain
But it always comes back 
A rope is tied to the ceiling as I write this 
I donâ€™t know what to fucking do
It keeps coming 
I donâ€™t have a purpose anymore 
I just want to not exist
