I WILL kill myself.a few weeks ago, I stepped before a tram to see if I could. It stopped on time, but it showed me how serious I am about dying. It was so easy watching it approach.

I had sought professional help before and the fact that no one could change my mind, and that drugs didn't make me right, suggests to me I'm right. We'll all die and there's nothing wrong with choosing to die on your own terms. 

An unwanted life isn't worth living.

I should be happy. I've got a well-paid job, I'm married, the works. Screw that. My job means nothing. "My software saves clients millions of dollars per month." But our clients were fine and well without my software before. People built pyramids without my software. On the grand scale, my software means fuck all.

I've got money... that slips through my fingers and does nothing good. I donate about $1000 almost every month to a charity. The charity shallows it all up like a black hole and the world isn't a better place. I buy diversions - games, gadgets, fancy food, books, hobbies - and they don't last. I travel - I've been to England and Portugal this year - but nowhere is better than home.

My wife is cool, but no other person can make me happy. Everyone's alone.

So I'm thinking, why the hell not? It's selfish? It's selfish that someone else would decide whether I live or die for their convenience.

Besides, people die. Life will go on without me. My wife can remary, my daughter will grow up and live her own life, my parents can go to Vegas and stuff their faces at all-you-can-eat buffets.

The world existed before me and will exist after me. I can't escape death anyway. Why not just do it now, finally get some rest, some peace?

So now you know my secret. I just wanted to share with someone who will understand. Tomorrow I'll be crossing the railway tracks with ear buds, and I "won't see" the train. Maybe I'll "freeze" on the tracks. No one will know, no one will be shocked.

Thanks for reading.
