Even my own thoughts scare meFor the past 5 years I've been extremely alone and isolated.  My life totally fell apart and within the last 3 years I've contemplated suicide a lot.  Thing is, I'm 17 and want to live a full happy life but I'm so pinned and trapped that its seeming like suicide is my only option.  The past 3 weeks have been crazy difficult.  I have family (not a good one) but all they do is put me down and prioritize literally everything over me.  I know it could be hard for some of you to understand that don't have family.  The grass is always greener I guess.  But the pain of being completely alone seems easier to take than the people you love telling how you will never amount to anything and that you are worthless.  On my good days I still have suicidal thoughts.  But on my bad days my thoughts tend to get very bad.  I wont go into detail but it consists of me ending more lives than just my own.  I know I need help but because I'm under age I cannot find help that won't get my parents involved.  Which would only make things worse.  My thoughts get really scary and it frightens me.  A couple weeks ago I bought a gun off the streets planning to use it to end my life.  I still have it and I think about it often.
