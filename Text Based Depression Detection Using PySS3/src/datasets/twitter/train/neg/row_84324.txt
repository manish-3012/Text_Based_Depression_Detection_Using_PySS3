I'm brokenI have a one year old daughter and she's my
World. I drove her mother away and now I feel like I have nothing left.

I'm not strong enough to continue living long enough to watch my daughter call someone else "dad". 

My one day a week spent with my daughter is mostly spent with me just in tears and apologising to her. I can't bare to watch her get older and resent me for breaking our family.

I have no will to live this out
