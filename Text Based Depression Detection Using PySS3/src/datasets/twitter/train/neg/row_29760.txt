Total apathyThis starts in a pretty typical spot...I had an incredibly traumatic childhood filled with some pretty horrific things. 

One of the worse things that happened was my mom threw my 2 year old sister down the stairs and blamed it on my dad even though I watched my mom do it. It resulted in my sister being brain damaged and sheâ€™ll never live independently for the rest of her life. My dad had an alibi, and my mom used her sociopathic charm to convince the cops that she was in the bathroom and my sister fell on accident, and she blamed my dad because she was traumatized afraid sheâ€™d get in trouble and all this bullshit that made them feel bad for her and believe her. 

When I told my teacher what actually happened, my teacher told my mom about it, and my moms evil became focused on me more so than my siblings. She would abuse us, and then call the police and tell them I had done it to my siblings and then to myself to frame her. I was 5, so I wasnâ€™t very brave or convincing, and they always believed her. I was treated like a monster, and it even made one of my younger siblings terrified of me. 

Needless to say, until my parents divorce was finalized when I was a teenager, and she was out of the picture, I was involved in a lot of situations where I was desperately trying to convince doctors, police, and other authority figures that not only was I innocent, but I was a victim myself. So you can imagine what that plus years of abuse and gaslighting will do to a kid.

Fast forward to today, Iâ€™m 31. I have decades of therapy and being on meds under my belt. The last 8 years have been a paradoxical time where my life situation has steadily improved but my physical health as drastically gotten worse and worse. I have a laundry list of physical health problems 

- an auto immune disease 
- insomnia, as well as chronic fatigue
- debilitating migraines 
- so much pain. All the time, all over. And since I have a lot of addicts in my family I refuse to take pain meds so itâ€™s basically been untreated for most of that time
- nerve hyperactivity and jumpy legs
- IBS / Gerd
- sciatic pain
- hearing issues 

As well as all the diagnosed mental health stuff

- ADHD
- anxiety / depression combo that some docs have said might be bipolar type 2 but I never got an official diagnosis of that

When I look at the facts about my life on paper.. it went from horror story, to turbulent, to healing as a family, to trying to learn how to function properly after growing up in such a shit situation, to doing fairly decent at that, to meeting my husband and getting married, to being essentially stress free. Itâ€™s been a straight uphill trajectory.

I went through a period of time (probably age 14-18) where I refused to go to any doctor besides my psychiatrist. I pretty much felt like they were all frauds since the ones I had seen in my early years had been able to be convinced by mom that I was a monster when I wasnâ€™t.

Then through college I was in a pretty good place mentally. I decided the entire profession of physicians  werenâ€™t all bad, and had a few years where I did go in for checkups and all that. Starting around the end of college my physical health started to slowly decline. I been told by doctor after doctor that all my physical heath stuff was just â€œdepression manifesting itself physically. And I accepted that. So Iâ€™m on what feels like a million daily medications to manage the symptoms. 

I met my husband in college. We moved around a lot and it was hard to maintain a steady doctor situation, so I stopped going to the doc again for a few years out of laziness. A doc I had seen in school had agreed to continue refilling my prescriptions. Ironically my husband then decided to go to medical school. So our financial situation improved and this brought about a lifestyle that includes many of the list â€œgood thingsâ€ that can be said about my life.

About a year ago my health got to the point where I had to stop working. I still didnâ€™t go in to get a primary care doc. My husband agreed that everything was probably a physical manifestation of depression, and since he sees me every day I figured I didnâ€™t really need a primary doc. 

Although my mind is in an okay place, my body feels like itâ€™s torturing itself. I canâ€™t remember a single day in the past handful of years where I was not in an incredible amount of pain, sickness, or some sort of discomfort. I finally agreed to go in and be seen.

This summer I spent the entire summer bedridden, or at some sort of doctor appointment or lab testing. They figured out I have an auto-immune disease a few weeks ago, but we havenâ€™t started any sort of treatment, just thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of testing. Added 6 more bandaid type pain/symptom relieving meds. That I really did not want to be on. 

None of the pain stuff has even remotely help. I live every single day fighting my body. For the past year or so, the only depression related mental problems Iâ€™ve had relate to this physical stuff. I feel depressed that Iâ€™m 31 in the prime of my life and Iâ€™m sick and bedridden like a god damn grandma. I feel suicidal because this life literally is **not** worthy living. 

People say all the typical shit like it could be worse... and I actually know it could be worse **because Iâ€™ve lived through much worse**. It makes me feel like such a fraud that I have this stress free environment that is a complete 180 from how I started my life, yet I still donâ€™t find life to be worth living. Things are better than I couldâ€™ve ever dreamed for. I think about the little girl version of me, and what she would think of my life now. She wouldâ€™ve thought this was heaven. And it makes me disgusted with myself for taking it all for granted now. Iâ€™m serious in how apathetic I am too. Like in an academic sense, I do comprehend that things are good now and that some day I might feel good. But I do not care. I donâ€™t care abut any of these things that Iâ€™m so lucky to have. I donâ€™t care about the resources and finances I have, that some people are depressed/suicidal *because* they donâ€™t have these things. Thatâ€™s why any sort of group-therapy has been so toxic for me. Hearing how bad others have it, while I have everything they so desperately want, makes me feel like Iâ€™m just as evil as my mom. Because I donâ€™t care about all these things that they want that I have. 


So I understand that my life is â€œperfectâ€ now. But what is the point of living in a stress free bed unable to do anything? 

Itâ€™s crazy but I almost wish for the old days that any rational person would consider to be no where near as good as I have it now. 

At least then I had a reason to fight. My untreated problems were something to conquer. My trauma-related issues presented something to fight against which in a twisted way gave me purpose.

And I have enough experience, maturity, therapy under my belt, education etc to be able to look at all this and see it for what it is. I understand that because I grew up in survival mode, it can be hard to learn to function outside of survival mode. Thatâ€™s the whole underlying issue with needing to â€œfight somethingâ€.

But I am fighting. My body is **literally** fighting itself. Thatâ€™s what an auto immune disorder is. I donâ€™t mean Iâ€™m fighting an existential crisis inside of myself. I mean there are real, physical, actual parts inside of me that have mass and function and they can be seen. These parts are fighting each other. And I feel it. And I canâ€™t will my way out of this. And it feels like itâ€™s killing me, but itâ€™s not, but I wish it would.

I just canâ€™t do it anymore. There might be nothing I can complain about except the invisible war my body is raging on itself. But Iâ€™ve done all the fuckin positive thinking in the world... willing this shit away doesnâ€™t work. I feel like my soul is trapped inside of a broken machine and Iâ€™m sorry but itâ€™s just not worth it. Iâ€™m fatigued of caring, if giving a shit. Iâ€™m fatigued of being positive. Iâ€™m fatigued of telling myself itâ€™ll be over soon.

In this life, I either get 1.) and unstable abusive environment and mental health problems, 2.) or I get an easy life with physical problems. They both suck. 

Iâ€™m sick waiting for the flowers to come after the rain. Iâ€™ve been alive for over 3 decade because Iâ€™ve fought to be alive. Iâ€™ve fought with patience and hope that things will get better. Well let me just tell you.. what society tells us is a perfect situation, it doesnâ€™t fix a fucked up mind or a fucked up body. Iâ€™m still the same broken person just in a pretty environment.

I just want to lay here and be done fighting. Iâ€™m so over this stupid life. Iâ€™m done waiting because the goalposts will just keep moving. Theyâ€™ll fix my physical problems and then Iâ€™ll have a new set of problems. Iâ€™m sick of trying. Iâ€™m just... done.
