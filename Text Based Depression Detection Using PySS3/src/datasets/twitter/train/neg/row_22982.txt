Iâ€™m grateful for what I have; yet ultimately nobody cares wether or not I exist and I hate how it feels.20m here. I just had a birthday a couple days ago, and I got wishes from 3 people total, one of which being the Snapchat default birthday vid caption. I cried playing Animal Crossing and getting birthday wishes from all the villagers. Treated myself to some food, and then thatâ€™s it. Back to quarantine. Just another day, another day. Iâ€™ve destroyed or pushed away the people I truly care about. Iâ€™ve made the attempt to apologize, but understandably theyâ€™ve shunned me on every platform, so here I am sitting with my guilt at nearly 4AM as per usual. Iâ€™m too pussy to kill myself, but too loathsome of my existence to keep going and I just hate it. It never seems like it gets any easier. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. The people I used to care about are doing so much better without me, which just makes me further think of myself like an anchor that doesnâ€™t matter, just weighing them down. Just like an anchor, the weight becomes too much to bear and I get cast off, onto another person to guilt trip until they understandably fail to put up with my bullshit any longer. Iâ€™ve failed my brothers, Iâ€™ve failed my father, and Iâ€™ve most certainly failed my mother. I just wish I knew what to do next.
