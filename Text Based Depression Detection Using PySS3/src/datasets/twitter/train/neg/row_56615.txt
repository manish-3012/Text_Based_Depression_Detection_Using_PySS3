Seeking some kind words to give me some sort of purpose.Recently I've made some pretty big life choices. I've decided to stay home and go to community college after going to a big university for a year. I didn't get kicked out or anything I just did it to save myself from the debt. I don't have a job. I don't have anything to do. All of this boredom has forced me to think a lot to myself about how worthless I am. It feels like I will never be enough.. Never pretty enough, smart enough, nice enough. For the past few days all I've been thinking about is how nice it would be to just go to sleep and never wake up. I have a boyfriend of three years who loves me, a family who loves me but I feel like a constant disappointment.  I can't tell if I have serious mental health issues or if I'm just an overdramatic bitch. It feels like my life is headed nowhere and I will never feel full-filled. All I've been able to do lately is read about suicide or cry all day.
