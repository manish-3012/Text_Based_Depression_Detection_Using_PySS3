I am going to work and sincerely hope that I get killed in accident midwayLife's getting hard to continue day by day. I am surviving on anti-depressants just to perform daily activities. 
I am basically friendless and have never been in relationship. I am started being numb about everything and don't see any hope of light nor could find any motivation to continue it.

Just hoping to get T-boned by some truck before I reach to office
