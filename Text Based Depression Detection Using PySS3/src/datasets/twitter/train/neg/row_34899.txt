TrappedTried to jump off a bridge, survived. Tried to jump from same bridge and got detained. Iâ€™m in hospital so I can be treated but I just wanna die. I feel like itâ€™s either kill myself in hospital or sink lower and be in hospital long term. Like Iâ€™m sorry for being suicidal for having injuries that donâ€™t heal?,???????? Every day here is agony and a constant cycle of thinking about killing myself but never doing it. Hell is a place on earth and itâ€™s here
