UghThis isn't the typical my life sucks kind of cry for help. I have a beautiful fiance, amazing career that pays  better than it should. Penthouse apartment overlooking the city skyline, a few very close friends who look up to me. 

But now what?

there is nowhere to go from here, and getting here hasn't made me any happier. My fiance is starting to doubt "us" because 3 years of pretending I'm not depressed has caused her to expect me to be fine all the time. But now that I have accomplished everything I ever wanted to It's harder to cover up my thoughts of just tapping out by distracting myself with work/school/gym...

The problem with friends that look up to you, is they don't like to talk about your weaknesses. 

So I'm sitting here, alone, wondering why I bother. This is the culmination of 35 years of striving to be a better person than I actually am. Alone and not understood.
