How do you describe how bad you feel? (xpost from r/getting_over_itI am AWFUL at putting how I feel into words. A lifetime of trying to hide my mental illness from others and distract myself from how terrible I feel has left me with an inability to explain it to others, and a skewed idea of what "normal" is. 

&amp;nbsp;

Long story short, I was diagnosed with Major Depression and General Anxiety disorder at 14 (I'm now 29), and was later diagnosed with Chronic Major Depression. Recently I was rediagnosed with Cyclothymia (like bipolar lite I guess?) which I had never even heard of. My new psychiatrist said that the S.S.R.I.'s I've beem taking most of my life are like "fighting fire with gasoline". Shit. I think this could have been avoided if I knew how to identify my symptoms and talk about the specifics of how I feel.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, the main reason I'm asking is because I had to bail on *another* social thing this weekend because I was having a can't-even-get-out-of-bed-to-feed-myself kind of day. My boyfriend was concerned and a little upset that I didn't go with him. He stopped by and could see that I obviously wasn't going to be able to go, but assumed I was sick. Like, not mentally sick, but the kind of sick that makes sense to people who haven't had a mental illness.

&amp;nbsp;

When he was asking what was wrong, I was at a total loss about how to explain it to him. I've had some really intense suicidal urges lately, but I've chosen not to tell him about that for a number of reasons. I've only told my therapist and psychologist. Once someone knows my dark secret it will color how they see me as a person for the rest of our relationship. I don't want any of that, and I also don't want people to walk on eggshells around me. Also, I just don't think I have the courage to say "Oh, I've just had a nonstop loop of intrusive suicidal thoughts for the past 3 months that has left me beyond exhausted and hanging on to my sanity by a thread" out loud.

&amp;nbsp;

However, feeling suicidal isn't the only thing I'm feeling right now that hurts. I just don't know how to explain it in a way that other people will understand, or in a way that doesn't make me sound completely nuts. 

&amp;nbsp;

When I try to put words to how a rough day with depression/cyclothymic/whatever-the-fuck-i-really-have feels it ends up sounding really weird and vague, and not something I'd want to tell other people who don't get it (a.k.a. basically everyone).

&amp;nbsp;

It kind of feels like a constant stream of painful disgust that is welling up in my chest and neck and head. The only way I can think of to describe this feeling (sorry this is about to sound super weird) is like imagining there are worms, thousands of them, churning inside my chest and throat. It's beyond gross, it's *inside* me/part of me, I can feel them wriggling, but there is absolutely nothing I can do about them. So I have two choices: ignore them the best I can and distract myself somehow (by getting high as fuck, unconscious, or sometimes games or movies will work short-term), or think about them and completely lose my shit because it's so confusing and horrible.

&amp;nbsp;

If I choose the distraction route everything gets foggy, it's basically impossible to think deeply about anything. I either get "monkey mind" and feverishly flit from one superficial thought to the next, or get really dissociative and spaced out. Everything aches and feels heavy, moving feels like trying to walk upstream in a strong, fast current. I feel ugly and angry and worthless and like a genuinely bad person who needs stay hidden. I want everyone to just fuck off and leave me alone because it's impossible to explain how I'm feeling while I'm feeling this way. Not being able to convincingly tell people that I can't handle anything outside of my bedroom today without lying just adds another layer of shit to deal with.

&amp;nbsp;

So, anyway, if you're willing to share, I'd love to hear how you describe how you feel. It can be how you describe it to yourself, or your therapist (if you have one), your friends, significant other, whoever. Don't worry about sounding weird, you might end up striking a chord with someone else or coming to a new realization if you're brutally honest. I really think being able to put words to how we feel will help us feel less alone and help gain insight into our symptoms. 

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: Words are hard, especially when you're mentally/emotionally/whateverly compromised. How do you explain how you feel?
