Fiancee says she doesn't want to live anymore, and she has to leave town this weekend.  I'm worried about her.I was recently laid off which has made things hard for my fiancee and me.  She's in grad school and has been finding it hard to work with me in the apt lately because I'm always around and I haven't heard back from any jobs.

Needless to say this Valentine's Day was a wash and she told me she didn't want to live anymore. She said that there's nothing in her life right now worth living for. She has to leave this weekend for a conference in KY and I'm really worried she might do something.  What do I do?
