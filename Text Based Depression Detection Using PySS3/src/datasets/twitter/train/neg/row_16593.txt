I can't do this anymore.I need to die. I'm a 21 years old girl who had to leave her country due to war and start new somewhere completely different. I don't have any friends here, I can't go back home and i can't handle staying, the language is impossible and i just feel so alone and pointless, I'm stuck and i feel that there is no way out. This will never get better, but I'm too scared to actually do it, how do i find the courage to actually go through with it.
