I dont know if this belongs here.I really dont know. I dont know whats wrong. Im only 14 years old and recently my friend attempted suicide and I myself saved him, But I have been thinking about suicide myself. I dont feel depressed, I just feel lonely and sad. Can anyone give me some light? Im not in any danger of comiting suicide. I just need someone to talk to, I dont know what to talk about but I just need someone. Please?
