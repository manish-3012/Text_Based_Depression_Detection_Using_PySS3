Suddenly the bullying/gaslighting stopped, but I can't get it out of my headEver since I was 16 I experienced intense ostracism, gaslighting and bullying.Out of the blue people began to treat me like a human being for the first time in 3 and a half years.I have a memory problem that wasn't being taken seriously, whenever people would lie and say that brain diseases don't exist and that I am delusional, I would lash out and call them stupid, and explain how incredibly dumb they were to deny a possibly serious illness just for the thrill of abuse. Because people my age do get brain illnesses. Everyone knew a brain disease was possible but I guess they enjoyed abusing me just too much so it never stopped. I hate how I need to pretend that I like them after all they did to me, things are getting better now I have evidence of a memory deficit on a neuro-psychological exam, and I am learning biology at college just to show them I'm better than they think.I hate how I have to dress in a certain way fake being nice or pretend just to be treated like a human, It hurts me to know there are other people being intensely bullied by medical professionals and family, these are things that shouldn't be joked about, I know there is so much suffering in the world that occurs just for others to enjoy it.
