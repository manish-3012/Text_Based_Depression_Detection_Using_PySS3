I feel empty, betrayed, just tired.2 weeks ago I posted here, I was at my all time low. Here I am again. Few days after the post my girlfriend of two years dumped me because I thought she was cheating on me. 

We stayed friends still talking and hanging out. She knew about my problems. Depression, anxiety, low self esteem, all my insecurities, she knew everything about me and I could talk to her whenever I was down. I was feeling down in the dumps earlier and tried talking to her about it as I normally would have in the past.

She wouldn't respond to that though, anything else she would. I asked her if she still cared about my problems. She told me she stopped caring about me since she dumped me. She talked and hung out with me out of pity. So here I am and I'm just fucking tired.
