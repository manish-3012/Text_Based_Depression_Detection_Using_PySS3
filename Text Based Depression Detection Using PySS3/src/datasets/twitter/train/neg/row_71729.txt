Tell parents? [29 M]Given my age maybe the question is a little surprising. 

I live on my own and while I'm not an utter fuckup, I'm a major disappointment given the expectations that were put on me. I'm a disappointment to myself, too. Trying to explain what happened would just sound like a bunch of excuses, but basically I've spent years alone accomplishing nothing, despite having many things I'm interested in and want to do.

Recently I felt the time pressure of age and tried to see what it would take to actually do those things I wanted to do. The more I've looked into it, the more despondent I get, as I see how many ships have sailed. I'm just not that interested in living a life full of regrets. I'm being sort of lazy with the descriptions because I don't really "just need to talk." I put myself into a corner where I'll never be who I thought I would be. Nobody can turn back time for me.

The question is just, should I tell my parents about it in advance? Would that be really inappropriate? I don't want it to sound like I'm trying to manipulate them into bailing me out or something, but if they have time to process it, maybe that would help.
