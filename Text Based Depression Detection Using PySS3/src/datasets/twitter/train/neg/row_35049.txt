Going to ring the doctors tomorrowI donâ€™t know what to say but Iâ€™ve had enough. Itâ€™s not even sadness itâ€™s just emptiness at this point.

I have thoughts about ending it daily, but Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to pull through. Going to ring up and hopefully get help. Itâ€™s not healthy to feel this bad all the time
