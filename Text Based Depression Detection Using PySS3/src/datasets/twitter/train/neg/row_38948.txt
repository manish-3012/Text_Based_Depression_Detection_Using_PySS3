I can't take it anymoreI'm really pissed. You have no idea how pissed I am. I can't seem to sober up. I've thrown up so much. I don't know what to do. I just wanna die. I'm sick of life. I should never drink again. I'm tired of everything. Nobody cares about me. I don't know what to do. I just want it to be over.
