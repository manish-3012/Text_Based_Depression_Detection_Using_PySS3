i feel so guilty.my family knows iâ€™m very suicidal so theyâ€™re doing their best to keep me happy and busy, theyâ€™re doing nice things like buying me things and taking me to the beach and buying me a brand new phone and all of these amazing things that i am so incredibly grateful for, but i feel like i donâ€™t deserve it because iâ€™m just going to end up killing myself or something so their time and money and effort is being wasted on me. i love them so much but they shouldnâ€™t keep doing things for me, i feel like itâ€™s a waste and i feel so so guilty.
