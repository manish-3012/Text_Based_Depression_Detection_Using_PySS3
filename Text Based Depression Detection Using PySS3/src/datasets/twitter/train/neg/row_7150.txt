Let's try to help this guy from r/chemistry!I was just casually browsing r/chemistry as I do every day and came across [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/v0s8n/whats_a_lethal_dose_of_an_over_the_counter_med/) post. Not a typical post for the chem sub. I hope we can help him out a bit! It doesn't look too good :/
