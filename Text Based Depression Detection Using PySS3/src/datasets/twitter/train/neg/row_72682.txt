So itâ€™s a lot but thank you for reading.
I moved from Florida to New York City to Massachusetts 
I moved in with my boyfriend and we got married. Iâ€™m very far away from my family and my parents arenâ€™t that pleasant at times and can be kind of hard on me. I miss my animals at my grandmas house and I miss my grandma so much. Iâ€™m pregnant and the prenatal appointment went to shit and the doctor over complicated everything and now I have to wait till Tuesday to see if Iâ€™m still pregnant. The frustration with the doctor and how everything went I was venting to my husband and he kinda snapped at me that everything was okay and Iâ€™m being a worry wort but the gyno said thereâ€™s no heartbeat at 10 weeks even though she used a baby Doppler. So she didnâ€™t communicate she didnâ€™t answer my questions and I was pretty upset. I start looking at all the options off stuff to get this thing out of me and I was absolutely scared. My husband got off of work and we started to fight because I kept telling him everythingâ€™s difficult I canâ€™t wait three more weeks to schedule another appointment if thereâ€™s something dead inside me. He started to snap saying all I do is make excuses and all that but these are serious logical obstacles as Iâ€™m under my husbands last name and insurance but couldnâ€™t update my ID so the offices keep giving me shit saying itâ€™s fraud and what Iâ€™m doing is illegal and itâ€™s not I just can transfer licenses. After my husband telling me Iâ€™m not trying hard enough and that I have a list of excuses like his sister I ran off and I started crying. I just left the house turned my phone off and cried. I came back and 5 minutes after my husband comes in screaming calling me a stupid fuck, dumb bitch, ungrateful bitch, all these names and Iâ€™m just sitting at the bottom of the shower. He then snatches my phone and starts cursing me out and said I hope you cry dumb bitch so I just broke down and started sobbing. Heâ€™s trying to be nice to me today and been asking for a kiss Iâ€™m just extremely depressed again and I just donâ€™t wanna be here. I took the rope out of his car and I want to tie a noose and just end it all. I have no one to talk to about my suicidal thoughts but life is so hard and nothings working out for me. Living literally hurts and itâ€™s not getting better. I miss my animals so so so much and Iâ€™m just so sad. He said if I cut myself heâ€™s bringing me to crisis but I wanted to go to the hospital to get my pregnancy confirmed again and he told me Iâ€™m being dramatic :(
