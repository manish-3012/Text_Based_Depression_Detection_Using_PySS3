Whatâ€™s my fault?I will never be able to fit in with people. All Iâ€™ve ever done is be a nice person to others. And they always put me with shit like this. I always get the feeling of being alone and isolated even with other people around.

Iâ€™ve attempted to kill myself last October and even if how optimistic I am but when others let me down Iâ€™d rather kill myself.

I wish i rather had hanged myself successfully. I feel itâ€™s my fault I can never fit in. All I ever wanted is to be accepted and when the world cannot accept me Iâ€™d rather deserve to not live.
