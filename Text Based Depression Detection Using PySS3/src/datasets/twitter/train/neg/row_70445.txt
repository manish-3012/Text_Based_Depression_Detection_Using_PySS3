Finally freeFinally, things seem far more simple. I guess once everything is in order, it is. Tried to sort things out after what happened, as usual shot down. There's only so many times you can get shot down before it just becomes not worth it any more. I'm now certain nobody would give a damn if I was gone. Their actions while I needed help have clearly shown that.

Only thing left for me to do is hand in my notice, and every single obligation that was in my life is gone. Fuck this pain, fuck this life. Just feels good to finally be able to state outright, this is it.
