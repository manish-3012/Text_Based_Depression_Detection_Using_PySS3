Running out of options.For the past 3 years I've been thinking about suicide every day. Before, it was easy to beat back my depression and suicidal thoughts. I thought I had great friends, and a great family. My days have gotten progressively worse since then. My dad showed his truly awful alcoholic, lying, greedy, prick side. All of my friends either fucked me over or ignored me. I was diagnosed with depression, ADD and anxiety. I don't talk to people anymore or go out. I drag my body and mind through the days and It's beginning to be too much to carry. I remember my past and feel awful. When I try and look towards the future all I come up with is me dead. I am always weighed down by my depression, recently so much so I sit down all day, cry, and think about how much I want to be dead. My heart feels as if it's pumping acid through my body. I used to do a lot of scarring on my arms, I don't even have the strength to do that anymore. I'm planning on getting a nice suit for my birthday coming up in 2 weeks, and ending it all. I would like to know if you went through a situation as bad or worse as mine, and how you managed to get through it. I have so much more to say, but for now I'll leave it as this.
