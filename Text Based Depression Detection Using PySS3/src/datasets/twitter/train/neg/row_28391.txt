If you could go back and tell your younger self something, what would it be?Tl;dr: Life sucks but could be worth it. And if you canâ€™t handle any of the following just kill yourself, the earlier the better. Preferably middle school would be a good time.

(wasnâ€™t expecting to ramble like this)


For me it would be no one will ever respect you bc youâ€™re quiet and small. They will try to walk over you. Your dad is a narcissist. People will be jealous of you bc of things that are out of your control and will sabotage and lie to you. Stay away from the internet (ex:porn). Focus on school, not being cool. The cool kids are only cool not, wonâ€™t be later. Donâ€™t be afraid to try even if people laugh. Donâ€™t post personal things on social media. Rumors spread about you will be out of your control and people will believe any bad story about you especially if they donâ€™t like you. People will really not like you bc of lies from others. Insults arenâ€™t personal itâ€™s okay to laugh you donâ€™t have to be perfect no matter what ppl tell you. Donâ€™t do relationships or drugs. Take care of your body. Youâ€™re ahead of your peers now but they will catch-up and maybe even surpass and thatâ€™s okay. You lack empathy because of your dad and you think something is wrong with you for not feeling the same way others feel about things. Youâ€™ve never felt love, itâ€™s okay to show emotion. Even if something doesnâ€™t affect you directly doesnâ€™t make it unimportant. To help try to place yourself in another personâ€™s shoes. Donâ€™t bully or laugh at people. Youâ€™re gay thatâ€™s why youâ€™ve been acting out, itâ€™s okay. Those girls who canâ€™t seem to like you no matter what just have a crush on you and donâ€™t know it yet. Donâ€™t let anyone tell you that you canâ€™t do something. Donâ€™t let them steal your dreams. You wonâ€™t have the same reputation everywhere, people donâ€™t know you. Learn to stand up for yourself, donâ€™t be afraid of confrontation. Not EVERYONE is out to get you but donâ€™t trust shit. Some people were raised differently and donâ€™t understand certain behaviors or concepts and they cannot be changed by you. Life isnâ€™t fair and equality does not exist. Just be the best version of yourself donâ€™t compare yourself to others.
