Tired and ready to quitI'm 26 and have had depression since approximately age 13. I have come to accept that I will never overcome it. I've been on every med, tried ECT, and run through over a full course of TMS therapy. Nothing works enough to bring me above a base level of general depression, but I had stabilized out enough to where suicide was a passive constant thought rather than an active one.

Today, I feel like I'm sinking. I feel like a failure career-wise, as I can't get a decent paying job and am applying to go back to school yet again. My car is giving me problems. I just got diagnosed with lupus. I left my gym bag at home. My landlord is stopping by my home and is going to find illegal drugs and a cat not disclosed in my lease, which will mean eviction at a minimum and arrest as worst case scenario. 

I feel like today is just beating me down and I can't breathe. I'm at work and just want to quit life. :(
