Another Push Against The TidesI made this post [Another grain of sand, blowing in the wind.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g6px0/another_grain_of_sand_blowing_in_the_wind/) yesterday, thanks for all the replys. I thought I'd share a bit more, bullet points usually work for me.

* Have been to about 3 councilors, 1 life coach (once) and 1 voice coach (also once). 
* Don't like the idea of having prozac, dr told me to when I went to see him a few years ago. 
* I'm the son of an Imam, well he used to be, now he teaches.
* Even the things that used to intrest me don't anymore, or at least its becoming less and less intresting. 
* I seem to get angry quicker, now that I am older.
* Have only 1 friend that I haven't seen in like 6 months or more.
* The social anxiety, coupled with a very low voice has been awful.
* I've planed (well slightly planned) how I might comit suicide in the past.
* Emotions almost wash over me sometimes, very strong, anger, sadness, lonelyness and go over to almost the total oposit on other occasions, where I feel almost nothing, like whatever happens i'm .. like meh.
* Obviously never had a girlfriend.
* Hate crowded places or just talking to people beyong a few words. 

I might regret posting this later and I've proberbly missed stuff, but go and ask me whatever you like, if you want.
