I harassed another boy in school and the guilt makes me want to dieI donâ€™t know what got into me. We were just 13. I never had any ill will towards him and even considered him a friend. Hormones, being closeted, all this confusion. Others thought I was funny and trying to be friendly, but now I know that I was a fucking disgusting asshole for several months for no reason. I tried reaching out to him several times in high school (he moved across the country by that point), but no response. Itâ€™s still weighing on me today and I have no idea what to do other than to just let myself die. I have no future because Iâ€™m just a dirty creepy bully and no one will ever respect me.
