Fed up with everythingThat's it. I'm done. Tomorrow I'm being thrown out of my parents house by my psychotic bitch of a mother, and I can't do homelessness. Why? I don't have a job and I haven't been doing enough to try and find a new one, according to her. My father knows nothing about this. I'm too scared to ask him to talk her down. I can't put 40 hours a week into one singular task like she wants me to. Especially not when she wants me to also do most of the work around the house. And yet somehow she thinks that taking away literally the only resources I have to get a job and get to said job will somehow be enough to make me get one, and not be completely and utterly detrimental to me being able to find and hold a job.

I don't think she'd be so anti-me if I was able to be open with her though. But how is an asexual transgirl supposed to connect with the bigoted "anything not cishet is evil and leads straight to hell" mentality of her mother? I'm too scared of what she'd try to do to me if I ever told her that I'm not the son she thinks I am. I just want her to be able to accept the daughter he raised for a son, though I know she never will, so what's the point in trying. I'm only ever going to get hurt letting my true self out, and so I have to shove her deeper and deeper down to try to survive while she fights back and tears me apart from the inside.

The one thing that was keeping me back from killing myself before this was my boyfriend. He made me promise not to do anything to harm myself. But now he's gone and left me without so much as a goodbye and spit on everything we were. All the promises were ever just words. He never cared. Nobody ever has. I have nothing left, and no reason to stay. So goodbye reddit. Goodbye world. It's time for me to go.
