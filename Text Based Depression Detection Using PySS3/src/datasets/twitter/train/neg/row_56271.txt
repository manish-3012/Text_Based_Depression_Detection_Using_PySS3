What options are available for my sister?My sister has been in a bad place for a while and has had several suicide attempts. Sheâ€™s usually released after a few days at the hospital but me and my family believe she needs long term help. Sheâ€™s over 21 and we live in Illinois. Iâ€™m curious as to what our options for her are?
