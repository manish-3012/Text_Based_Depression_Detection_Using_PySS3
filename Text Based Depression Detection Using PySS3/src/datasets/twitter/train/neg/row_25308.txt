Hey I'm backI'm still going and I've been trying to keep myself motivated and happy. I started working out to distract myself from thoughts of suicide.

I was just informed that they plan to have quarantine last for three more months in my country (Canada) and I don't know if I can make it through that. I honestly feel like shit thinking about it, I can't stay here for three months and doing nothing. I need to see people, in person, and feel human contact. 

Tbh I really miss my girlfriend, she's the main thing that's keeping me afloat, and I don't have a way to see her, I can text her and call her but I just need to see her and I need to be held. I can't stay in this house for three months, it hurts
