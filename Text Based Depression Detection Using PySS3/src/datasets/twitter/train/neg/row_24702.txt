Please help meI lost my best friend last year, an unexpected death, and of natural causes.  I was destroyed.  Not even 6 months after, my brother, the light of my life, committed suicide.  My whole world collapsed.  I've been struggling to keep going, but somehow I did... I managed to get myself out of bed each day, and to go to work.  It's been so hard, but I was getting there.

&amp;nbsp;

Last night my partner of 3 years walked out on me.  He told me this has been too hard on him, and he has become depressed, and so he was leaving.

&amp;nbsp;

I have nobody, other than my parents.  None of my friends care, they text occasionally, maybe once per month... I live in a city over an hour away from my family, and until last night, I lived with my partner.

&amp;nbsp;

I blame myself.  I have been distant, I haven't been able to be intimate, I rarely leave the house and my weekends are spent travelling to check my parents are okay.  Recently, I'd been making a huge effort to grieve in front of my partner less, to be happier around him, to try harder.  But it wasn't enough.  I didn't think my heart could break any more after my brother, but I was wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

My life has absolutely no purpose, other than to keep breathing for my mum and dad.  I don't want to be alive, I want to be with my brother; but I can't, purely because I couldn't put my parents through this again.  The level of pain I'm feeling is too much, I'm on antidepressants and I have to take Valium when it gets really bad... nothing is working.

&amp;nbsp;

The thought of a life without my partner is just too much, I love him with every part of me.  I don't have my best friend or my brother (who I would turn to in times like this) to help me.  Counselling didn't help.  I needed my partner to be my strength through this, but he left me.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't know where else to go, or what else to do.  I feel trapped in a nightmare, and I just want it all to end.  I am feeling a level of pain I just can't cope with.  Please somebody help me.
