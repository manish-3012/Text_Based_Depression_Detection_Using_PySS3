Treatment resistant depression. I am too broken to fix.I'm on my fourth antidepressant in three years, along with four years of therapy. My life has progressively gotten worse and worse, with every antidepressant not working or failing. It's absolutely my fault for not doing ANYTHING my therapist or psych says to do. I don't think any medicine will ever work because I am the problem, a problem that will never go away. 
 
I think about suicide constantly. I can't do it any time soon because it would hurt my family too much. Even after doing years of prep like I want to do they'll still be hurt. I wish they could understand that I am done living. Absolutely and hopelessly done.
