Body dysmorphiaHello, Iâ€™m 18 and I think I want to end my life at the end of this year, Iâ€™ve tried for so long to deal with my body dysmorphia but itâ€™s getting worse Iâ€™ve tried to get help from a physiatrist but I was told it will be a long wait itâ€™s been since may last year and now with this pandemic Iâ€™m afraid it will be pushed further ðŸ˜­I canâ€™t live like this every night I cry to myself to sleep wishing Iâ€™d just pass away, I look in the mirror at myself over 50 times a day it could be mirrors, reflections or a phone camera if I catch a glimpse of something I dislike Iâ€™ll spiral down a hole, it might sound stupid but my biggest reason for wanting to end my life is my weight I was bullied growing up for being skinny Iâ€™ve tried for years and years to gain weight and guess what? Out of all those years I only gained 1 STONE I force myself to eat so much as my mind keeps telling me Iâ€™m disgusting for being skinny and that Iâ€™m anorexic, I started my main weight gain journey at 15 Iâ€™m now 19 and Iâ€™m only 1 stone heavier, how can someone only gain 1 stone within 4 years I feel like a failure, I donâ€™t deserve to be alive, I feel like my mind is right I need to die, when I die I want a closed casket so nobody can see me at all I donâ€™t want to be a embarrassment to society.  Iâ€™m sick of this ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
