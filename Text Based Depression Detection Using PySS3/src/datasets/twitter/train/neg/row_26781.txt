Can't do this anymoreI have no friends, no family, no job, no money, and my fiance (that I live with) just dumped me. And I mean, I literally have none of that. Nothing. 

Life has just been too hard. Rejection after rejection after rejection. I am a piece of shit. It's the only logical conclusion I can draw. It just gets worse and worse. Gotta be my fault. No matter how hard I try to make things better, it always ends up worse. I know this is all textbook bullshit, but whatevs. It's the truth.

'm pretty sure the break-up (which involves another girl) hasn't hit me yet and I'm definitely going to completely lose my shit when it does.

On top of all this, I have PTSD, which I've been dealing with for over 10 years with limited success (hence, no job). 

It's just over. I've never felt like I've deserved anything good and now, I have about as much proof as anyone needs. 

Reddit, you've been an awesome escape for the time being. Thanks.
