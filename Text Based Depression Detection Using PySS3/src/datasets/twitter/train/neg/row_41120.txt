I'm hanging myself tonightI was released from hospital after an overdose so pathetic that they stopped treatment half way through and let me leave alone without seeing a mental health team. Nobody seems to care, my family are downstairs acting like nothing happened. 

I've been watching a lot of hanging videos on /r/watchpeopledie and honestly I'm pretty scared by the jerk reaction but I suppose I wont be in the position to care.

I'm not even sure why I'm writing this, I guess I have nobody else to tell and I want to leave with an empty mind.
