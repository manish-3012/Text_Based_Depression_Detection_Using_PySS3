To All: I Am So SorryIt hurts when you realize that the net influence of your life is negative, that on a whole you've brought down the entire world with your life.  I've envisioned my funeral and the only attendees are blood relatives.  My coworkers think I'm a lazy piece of shit; I don't disavow them of this notion, as I'd rather be a piece of shit then a pathetic asshole.

Mom, I'm so sorry.  You sacrificed so much for me.  You turned down relationships, better jobs, and lost so much so that I could succeed.  I'm sorry I wasted that.  I wish I could tell you this, but I know it would just cause you more pain, so I won't.  But, I will follow you shortly into whatever follows this life.

Folks, I'm aware that depression is a treatable disease, but that doesn't change the fact that my existence is a burden to EVERYONE.  Seven years this has gone on and I've proven myself incapable of changing this.  It is an objective fact that no one benefits from my presence.

I am a remarkably healthy 29 year old man.  I see myself living a very, very long time, all while remaining very, very alone.  No thanks.  I fully intend to off myself before I become that smelly homeless man no one even wants to deal with, disavowed by any and all relations, anonymously cremated and interred in a city cemetary.

But, I deserve this.  I earned it.  Some lives are just unworthy lives.  I just wish I hadn't hindered the progression of better lives.  

At the very least, I will make my death clean.  I don't want to stress any paramedics or police with a grisly shotgun wound.  My chosen method is carbon monoxide poisoning.  There's little chance of that failing, since no one ever visits my apartment and no one ever calls.

I just wanted to matter to someone who didn't have a biologic requirement to do so.  Instead, people roll their eyes and grumble whenever they have to work with me.

I'm so sorry, Mom.  I'm so sorry, everyone.
