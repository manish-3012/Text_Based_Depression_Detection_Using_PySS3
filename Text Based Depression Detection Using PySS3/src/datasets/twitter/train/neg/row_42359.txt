So I tried to talk to my family about depressionIt went as well as you expected it to be. A lot of screaming, feeling blame for the issues, not getting any understanding regarding going to a medical professional and if that wasn't enough,  my sister tried to give me a religious speech because in her words "you won't be able to solve your problems without god". I don't know my dudes, I was just expecting to get some support, but it turned into a big fight were I was the bad guy. 

I've been contemplating offing myself a little recently but today made it a lot worse. Gonna get that therapy regardless of what my family thinks.
