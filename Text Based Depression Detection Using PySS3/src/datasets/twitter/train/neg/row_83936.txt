Iâ€™m done with thisIâ€™m just venting rn, because Iâ€™m seriously angry. Iâ€™m a 17M, and I donâ€™t think that Iâ€™m ugly or anything. I work out a lot, and I donâ€™t seem unattractive in most pictures. But, I am still constantly alone. Looking back on life, Iâ€™ve always been a pretty lonely kid, and not by choice. All my â€œfriendsâ€ hated me growing up, because I was annoying and desperate to please everyone. High school has been no different, though Iâ€™m more introverted I still try extremely hard to get attention and appreciation. There are a few people who I talk to, but most of them are only associating with me to be nice. I cut most of these kids out of my life before quarantine, but a lot of guys were only nice to me so they could use me, to mess with teachers and laugh at me and such. Currently, I have just been getting so depressed from seeing all these other people that I know going out on road trips, hikes, parties, etc. and now it just feels like Iâ€™ll never get to experience anything like that now. Some kids allowed me to hang out with them, and both times were spent in almost complete silence on my part, from a desire not to annoy them. My romantic life has fared even worse, somehow. The few times I summoned up the courage to ask a girl out, it ended in me pondering suicide and the like. I ended up somehow getting my ass on a date with this girl, and it went great. She flirted with me heavily, and even put her leg on my thigh, which caused me to get uncomfortable, in a good way. I really liked her, and she kind of liked me. Well, I ruined it like I ruin everything. I was convinced that she was the one for me, and I ended up constantly texting her until she cut me loose, and ended up blocking me on all accounts. I used my old meme page(it got banned) to text her and she told me off, called me a freak and a fucking weirdo for liking her a lot and after she texted me that I tried to kill myself. I drank bleach and threw it all up, and I realized that Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to end it all. That was around January, and for the past few months Iâ€™ve still been lonely, even after taking the ham fisted advice of my dad to â€œbe more social.â€ No one really desires to associate with me. I have, however been talking to a few girls online, but they all eventually fizzle away. I matched with this one beautiful girl on tinder, but she unmatched with me for some reason. I think it was because I said I liked Pearl Jam or something along those lines. Idk, summers in general are terrible for me. I donâ€™t really get any social interaction besides the gym, which are all closed because of covid, and school. I canâ€™t stand being alone, Iâ€™m tired of it. I donâ€™t want to continue living if this is all life will grant me. Sad lonely days and depressing lonely nights. Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide more and more, almost as much as I did during the school year, and Iâ€™ve had trouble thinking of reasons to live. The only reasons I can really think of are my parents, dogs, and books if Iâ€™m being honest, and Iâ€™ll eventually run out of books to read. I usually spend most nights berating myself in my head, mentally abusing myself. I canâ€™t take it anymore, and Iâ€™ve found myself wishing and hoping for school to reopen in September. At least I wonâ€™t be as lonely there, even if I am an outcast again. This just wasnâ€™t how my life was supposed to go. It doesnâ€™t matter how strong my body is, I canâ€™t take this.
