Fuck other peopleI want to be the only person left on earth just so I can have the satisfaction of knowing every single other person died in some way or another before I finally end my life.

It's just one shitty situation after another, the only commonality being how fucking miserable I am no matter what happens, even if its objectively good.

I don't have the nerve to kill myself because it would lock in without a doubt how much of a disappointment and failure I am in all regards, which is why I desperately want everything and everyone out of my life before I do it. 

If I go on living, I know I'm going to be fucking miserable. Doesn't matter where, when, who or any circumstance, it's just how I am.
