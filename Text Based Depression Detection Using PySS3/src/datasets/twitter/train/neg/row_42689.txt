I just wanna fuckin diePLEASE GOD if there even is a god. I can't go through another day of this shit people are so fake and don't realise the shit they do that they think is a joke actually hits because it's true abd every second that I'm alive it feels like I'm a bubble stuck under a container just trying to join the rest of everyone else but I'm just stuck drowning everyday. I think about suicide every fucking second of my worthless life, all i do is fuck everything up and then people always make jokes about how i mess up not knowing that it's actually true and that shit fuckin hits hard i just wanna end the pain. life=pain and I'm sick of the pain, I'd rather have a second of pain of me putting a gun in my mouth and blowing my brains out then a lifetime of misery and drowning in an ocean of tears. All I've ever wanted is someone to love and to love me back but i always seem to mess things up all the girls I've been with only stayed for 2 weeks and then bailed for another guy, only telling me they lost interest in me. I'm i that fuckin ugly and useless.
So here i am laying in bed waiting for the perfect moment to leave this place people call home.
