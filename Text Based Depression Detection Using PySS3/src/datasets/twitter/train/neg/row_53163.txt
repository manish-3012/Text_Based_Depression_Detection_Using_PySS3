I just like drugsThere is no end goal to life. I don't know what the point is of being alive. I have autism. no job. no friends. people want to beat me up. Only thing I enjoy in life is doing drugs. Really can't see a point in living. I'm not going to kill myself though. I'm too much of a pussy, and I couldn't let my mom go through that. I just hope there is an afterlife, because there has to be somewhere better than this
