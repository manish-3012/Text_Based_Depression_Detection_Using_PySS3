Shit or get off the pot...In May I made a deal with myself. I've been suicidal since the age of nine, when I decided that if I had one wish, it would be to reverse my own existence. I am 35 and that would still be my one wish. I have hated every job I've ever had. It is nearly impossible for me to be employed in the field about which I'm passionate, so I just settle for doing shit I hate so I can pay the bills. When Sunday comes, I'm depressed that I have to go to whatever job I have on Monday. I just got fired from a second job in a row, which is bad for my clearance, a usual necessity since I'm in an area where most high-paying jobs are DoD/NASA. I've also tried working in different fields and hated them all. I got 3 STEM degrees and now have a debt I'll never get out of, just to have a career I hate. I'm not going to spend every waking hour doing shit I don't want to do. 

Additionally, I really, really hate getting up early, putting on clothes I hate, to see people I don't like, to do things I hate, while submerged in the insufferable government culture. But it's still the best environment I've worked in. I keep fucking up and pissing off people around me. I can never be happy. Im stuck in Alabama and I hate it. I can't find a job to get out. Everything lacks color and inspiration. Im also just tired in general. 

...so I decided that if things don't change by June 1, 2016, I'm done. Ive never asked for help before, but I figured "what the hell" since I'm gonna die soon anyway. I am considering taking out what little retirement my surgeries haven't wiped out and pedaling across the US on a bicycle, which is scary because I'm a woman and can be easily overpowered by questionable characters. It would give me a taste of freedom at least just once. Any thoughts?
