hello againhi, i posted in this sub a few months ago. during those months, i thought that for the first time in my life, happiness could be a permanent thing. i was very wrong. iâ€™m contemplating ending things soon, and have been for the past few weeks.

my boyfriend and mother keep urging me to go to school. it angers me because iâ€™m clearly not in a stable mindset. iâ€™ve been having panic attacks the past few days and iâ€™ve been sobbing nonstop. no one asks me whatâ€™s wrong and instead choose to badger me into going to school. they think iâ€™m giving up on myself.

i hate that people view depression as an excuse for laziness. do they not realize that the last thing i want to do is be lazy? i would give everything to be a motivated, active participant in society. i miss my younger self so much, back when i worked as hard as i could and tried my best in everything.

iâ€™m so tired and done with life. iâ€™ve been dependent on others for emotional stability since i was a child and iâ€™ve realized that i canâ€™t live without that dependency. iâ€™m basically an emotional leech. scum.

iâ€™d rather end it all so people can stop wasting their time and energy on a useless piece of shit. iâ€™m not worth anything to anyone and death seems like a relief to me.
