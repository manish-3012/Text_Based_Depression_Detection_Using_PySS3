What is the point?I saw a post on here about being tired of life but too scared to die and it strongly resonated with me.

What is the fucking point of anything? Iâ€™m never gonna find happiness and I used to use my family as a reason not to kill myself but not even that is deterring me anymore. Aside from fear I've absolutely nothing to lose from killing myself.

I mean I want to turn my life around but I have unfortunately accepted that I canâ€™t.
