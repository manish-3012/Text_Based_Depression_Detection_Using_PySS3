I think Iâ€™m going to give upI think Iâ€™m going to kill my self Iâ€™m done with being stressed everyday Iâ€™m over 400 assignments behind in school I have no friends the only family I have are the ones I live with Iâ€™ve never had a relationship my family constantly mocks me the things my dad did to me i think about it all the time I hear him in my head screaming at me and itâ€™s forcing me over the edge I know I need help but I feel no reason to get it.
