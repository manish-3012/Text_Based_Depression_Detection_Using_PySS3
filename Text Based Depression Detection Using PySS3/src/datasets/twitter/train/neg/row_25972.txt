I'm tired of being treated like a side character.No one ever treats me like I matter in their lives. So called friends never want to hang out, people ghosting me, women never like me, and everyone forgetting I exist. I'm so fucking lonely but I can't ever find a way to dig myself out of this dark depressing hole. I just want friends! I want a relationship! I want someone to act like they actually give a fuck if I live or die! I'm tired of being an after thought to everyone. I just want to feel important to someone. Not even killing myself could get their attention.
