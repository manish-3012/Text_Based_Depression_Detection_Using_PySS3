does it get better?i didnâ€™t know until today that 1 in 3 people who are abused as a child grow up to abuse other people. and i hate myself for being the 1 in 3.

i guess this is a cry for help because i donâ€™t know what to do anymore

someone tell me it gets better, that i can get better. 

waking up is hard. i donâ€™t want to exist anymore
