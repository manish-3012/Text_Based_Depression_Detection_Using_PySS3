Just really lonelySorry if my issues donâ€™t seem as big as others, just never really felt as alone as I am right now and Iâ€™ve always been a pretty introverted and isolated person to begin with. Kind of just want to vent I suppose.

Both of my parents died before I turned 21 from alcohol addiction. The rest of my family I donâ€™t feel close at all with anymore even though Iâ€™m now less than 6 hours away from them all (used to live across the country). I go to college but Iâ€™m older and feel so out of place. Nothing here feels genuine and I often feel like I have to hide my intense anxiety and discomfort here. I often ask myself why the fuck I should even bother anymore. I feel like dropping out and just giving up on trying to be normal and finding some labor job thatâ€™s enough for me to live.

Been getting just creeping thoughts of killing myself even though Iâ€™d be too afraid to act. Iâ€™ve been talking to a counselor but I honestly donâ€™t know if I need to go further than that. Mental illness runs in my family but I donâ€™t want to be put on pills or reveal my suicidal thoughts. Iâ€™ve just been claiming anxiety which Iâ€™ve struggled with since I was 15, but it feels much more intense since Iâ€™ve started college. I get crying fits because I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ve dealt with the shitty things in my life, and then I feel guilty since people have much more fucked up lives than me.  So yeah, dunno if I should risk being pulled out or referred if I say Iâ€™m suicidal and throwing my life into a rabbit hole.
