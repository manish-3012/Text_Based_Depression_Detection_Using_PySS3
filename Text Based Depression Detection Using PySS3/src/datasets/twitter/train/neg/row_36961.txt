The real reason for â€œSuicide Preventionâ€ is your $When you really think about it, our society is all about business and money. The more people that buy products, that go to doctors, that go to the dentists, that have jobs, etc, the more $ that goes into everyoneâ€™s pockets. However, when someone wants to willingly die, companies view this as â€œbut if they kill themselves, I canâ€™t make money off of that person anymoreâ€. Your doctor has one less patient. Your psychiatrist has one less patient, and the pharmaceutical company has lost a customer. Your job has lost an employee. These business/companies, they need our $, and therefore they need us to be alive. If nobody intervened with suicide, if everyone just let whoever wanted to die, kill themselves, do you know how many millions of people would kill themselves? And therefore, how much $ these businesses/companies would be losing?  Think about it. They need you here, they need your money.
