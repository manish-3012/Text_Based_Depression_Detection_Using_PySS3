The main reason I haven't is the stigma.I wish people were brought up to think of suicide as a person's respectable decision that they have a right to. The culture seems to have the majority opinion that it is a weak thing to do that someone should feel guilty about because of the suffering it will cause other people.

I know that if I killed myself there would be so many people that would judge me and think that something was wrong with me. I hate to give them the power to judge me like that.
