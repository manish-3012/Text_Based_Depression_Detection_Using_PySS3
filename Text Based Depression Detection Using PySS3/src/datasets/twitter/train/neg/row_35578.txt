Wife said she's happier with someone that she's been with for two months.I've been struggling with depression since I was 12, I'm 27 now. My wife and I have been together since December of 2009 and been married since September of 2012. We have separated and gotten back together twice in the past year and I told her that I want her to be happy and that maybe she should find someone else who can give her what she wants. We're still married and they have been dating for about two months now and she moved in with him about a month ago and he wants her to cut contact with me because I've been miserable and begging her to come back. I don't know what to do anymore,she's my best friend but she told me she was happy with him. I haven't been able to sleep the past few days and I can hardly keep any food down when I am hungry. He's already telling her how he wants to spend the rest of his life with her and they're already talking about having sex. I feel like i'm losing my mind..
