I am killing myself tommorrowI will go to work and then i will take my mothers car and drive to the tallest bridge in my area and jump off and die. I am tired of being a sexless, worthless loser. I've tried so many times to cope with the idea of being a virgin. Saying things like "i should be looking for a relationship" or "confidence matters" but it doesnt. I used to convince myself i was merely gay, asexual or that sex is nothing and its completely stupid to want sex. I realized a week ago i was wrong. Looks matter a lot. Your personality IS your looks. If you have shit looks you have a shit personality. sex does matter, people cannot ignore their biological urge to fuck. I want to have a boring death because i am a boring person who doesnt deserve anything better. I am also worthless. I failed out of community college and i have no skills that make me valuable. My cousins are ivy league students, my stepbrothers work in the NSA and i work at a gas station after having no job for 2 years. I am fat and ugly. People assume i am 20 years old than i actually am and i feel that i never had a prime like other people.
