Thank YouWe really gave it all we got for over 10 years now, didn't we? Today marks the decade of my first attempt to kill myself and look at me, functional on the surface and everything. Woo. 

I know you meant well when you pushed me the way you did while raising me. I was your only kid, you wanted the best, and your mother suffocated you the same way you did to me. I know you feel guilty about hurting me, and not being able to protect me from all those sadistic men who hurt me too. You have been feeling guilty for years, since you realized what you were doing, but you only started listening after the damage was already done and I just can't do this anymore. 

12 years in therapy. 2 years alcohol free. I went from being a high school dropout to a PhD student in a great university. A PhD dropout as of last week, actually, because I shouldn't have even made it this far but that one was for you to be proud of your daughter for once. I heard the disappointment in your voice when I told you what I had done but that's exactly the issue, I'm an individual and I get to choose what I do. Not you. 

Thank you, I absolutely would not have lived to see 25 if it wasn't for you. I just know I'm too far gone and I'd rather disappear completely. 

What hurts me the most is knowing that I could have been something. I know I could have been because I had so much potential, and it's not arrogance speaking. (cue linkin park) I'm just way too fucking tired and numb for it.

Life is beautiful but I'm just about done with it.
