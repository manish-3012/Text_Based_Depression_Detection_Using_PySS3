Don't think I'll make it to the end of the yearAt first I thought I would never make it to my graduation in May but then I started taking medication and it got better, not any more, I'm back to feeling like a failed piece of crap. Struggling to get a job or even figure out what I want in life while everyone I know that have graduated or dropped out have instantly succeeded in work and love and are now traveling the world.

All this failure, my depression rearing its head back into my life is getting too painful and too much for my life. 

I most likely won't go anytime soon but I will go by the end of the year.
