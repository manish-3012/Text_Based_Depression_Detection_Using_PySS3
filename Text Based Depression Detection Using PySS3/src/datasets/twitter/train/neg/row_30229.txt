I just want to go away foreverI wanna shoot myself. I want this pain to go away. I want this sadness to go away. I've given up. I've given up on trying to get help. Nothing ever works. I'll feel better for a while, then I won't. I don't want to live anymore. I'm 25 and my life is over. I am hopeless. I don't even have the initiative to buy a gun and end it.
