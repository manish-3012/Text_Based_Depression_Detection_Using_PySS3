What's the point?My dad. Stage 4 metastasized prostate cancer. He has a 29% survival rate. I dont know what to do. I feel like I'm dying. My mom told me today. She took me to a coffee place. I think she new I wouldn't start crying if I was in public. 55 years old. I just need people to tell me he is ok. Please tell me your stories about lovesld ones who survived. I need to know he won't die. I am drunk right now. I just chugged a bottle of gin to try and not feel but I can still feel I need some one to tell me it's ok. I'll know it's a lie but I need it anyway. Please I need it. I cant I've been  suicidal because I am always but now I dont know what do do. People wonder why people want to die. Its cause they feel.like this it hurts  I dont want to be here anymore. Why am I alive
