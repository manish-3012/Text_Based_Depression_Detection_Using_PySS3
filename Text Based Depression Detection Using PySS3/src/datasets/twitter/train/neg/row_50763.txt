RejectionI wasnâ€™t lying when I muttered I wish I was never born
I should have said, why the fuck am I even here? Iâ€™m not good enough for you, you will want me to disappear, you canâ€™t stand or be attracted to me at all
I wish I could have stood up then and slammed my car against the wall

It wonâ€™t matter if you hear my quiver when I say I miss you, so believably 
It doesnâ€™t matter what I did or how I cared, it wonâ€™t make you take back your hatred 
Now Iâ€™m alone very much alone as I expected it would be
There is no we itâ€™s only me and thatâ€™s how itâ€™ll be forever
What a fool I am to think we could be together 

I wish you understood, god I wish you could
Why did you have to get so heated when all I wanted was to be held like you
You did it before? Now Iâ€™m worth being ignored
When you did allure, as I did adore
But you donâ€™t want to see my face anymore

I wasnâ€™t lying when I muttered I wish I was never born
I should have said, why the fuck am I even here? Iâ€™m not good enough for you, you will want me to disappear, you canâ€™t stand or be attracted to me at all
I wish I could have stood up then and slammed my car against the wall

You see everybody has died on me or moved away
Gone are the dreams of being super girl in the old days
You say to get it together and leave you alone
You win, I just wish you believed me.

You could have brought me back to life
I could have been that very light
But you donâ€™t want me and I feel so empty
Iâ€™m worthless Iâ€™m nothing 
Thatâ€™s at least how your rejection made me

I donâ€™t care about much left in the world
But if I were to live again I would be a good girl
That wouldnâ€™t  happen because you arenâ€™t calling me up
Youâ€™re probably with someone better, my heart was never good at giving up
But I have no say, so Iâ€™ll just stay
Far far away, I hope youâ€™re happy, that makes one of us

I wasnâ€™t lying when I muttered I wish I was never born
I should have said, why the fuck am I even here? Iâ€™m not good enough for you, you will want me to disappear, you canâ€™t stand or be attracted to me at all
I wish I could have stood up then and slammed my car against the wall

Time goes by I have no concept of it
Reality is so fucked, I want more drugs
I was on my way to receiving a toe tag anyway
I shouldnâ€™t find it funny that when I die
You wonâ€™t care, you wonâ€™t flintch, you might laugh
