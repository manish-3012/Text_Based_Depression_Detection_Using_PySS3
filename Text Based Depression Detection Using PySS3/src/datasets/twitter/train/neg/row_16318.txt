I literallly have just lost all will to liveI just donâ€™t care to live anymore. I donâ€™t know what kind of depression this is, if it even is, but Iâ€™m on meds, Iâ€™ve been to therapy, I have good relationships, but I still donâ€™t care to care anymore. If I could just rot away in my bed, I would. I have no motivation outside of the need for money, but whenever I think of my financially fucked situation Iâ€™m just so overwhelmed and want to end it immediately. I just feel itâ€™s in the cards for me to be miserable and die by suicide. Idk. Iâ€™m tired of being told â€œone dayâ€ or â€œyouâ€™ll eventually..â€ like Iâ€™ve been waiting for something worthwhile. I donâ€™t have anymore patience.
