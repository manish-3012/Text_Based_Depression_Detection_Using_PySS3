I am going home tonight, I am writing a letter. I am all done. I'll make this quick. I have been miserable my whole life. rough childhood etc. I met a girl once. I married her. She was the only thing that had ever given me happiness. A decade later she has divorced me. I mean nothing to her. I can't do this anymore. I say good bye to you reddit, you helped me (under my real account) a number of times, and I thank you. But, I am all done now. Goodbye.
