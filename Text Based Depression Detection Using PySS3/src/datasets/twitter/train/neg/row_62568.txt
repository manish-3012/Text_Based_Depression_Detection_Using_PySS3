My mental issues are backI was taking treatment from a psychiatrist for severe anxiety, Ocd, depression and suicidal thoughts since January 2020 and I kinda stopped at the end of March cause I felt like I was a  normal person and now today my all my mental issues hit me at once altogether and I don't know what to do. I've had 6 anxiety attacks since morning and I'm constantly thinking of killing myself by overdosing on painkillers or slitting my throat
