I got a rope and I'm finally going to kill myselfI will kill myself in a few days and I really need to vent so here we go.. This will be a bit long I think.

So, even my existence is actually an accident. I'm just the result of a quick fuck that happened when my parents were too horny to buy a condom. My father was cheating on my mom even before I was born so they got divorced when I was 7 and I was left alone with mom in our small house and that didn't go very well because she would shout at me until I cry and just grab my hair and pull my around the house. She wasn't a good mother but she would always try to convince me that she is. 

My life actually got better in 3rd grade because my mom kind of got over her traumas about my father so she stopped bullying me so much. I made some friends and my life was pretty good until 8th grade. I mean until 8th grade I could study, I could eat, I could make friends (although I was always a bit socially awkward and had social anxiety it wasn't as bad) I couldn't do any of these in 8th grade. Everything in my life got fucked up. I became a lazy shit, I hated everybody and I got really bad depression and anxiety. I was really suicidal and almost failed all my classes.

Then it got better over the summer and when 9th grade started it slowly started to get bad again because I was still going to fail some of my classes because I'm a lazy piece of shit and I can't get anything done. So I started homeschool and things got even worse. I wasn't studying at all and just sitting in my room watching youtube all day. After a few months I finally realized that I can't live like this because I'm very lazy and have no social skills. No one can survive on earth like this. So yes I got a rope now and I'm finally going to kill myself.

I'm sorry if I made any grammar mistakes english isn't my first language.
