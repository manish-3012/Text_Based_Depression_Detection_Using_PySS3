I'm depressed since i'm 12 years old. It gets worse.Hi, i'm not a native english speaker so excuse my faults.

I was diagnosed with depressions when i was 12 years old, i'm 26 now. I never learned a job, still living with my mom.

Winter last year my girlfriend cheated on me, i tried to forgive her but she ended our relationship 2 months later. Each of us made mistakes. She lived with me for a year, january she moved out and in march she stopped contacting me. I tried to contact her a few times that day. Since then - nothing. I thought it would be ok but to be honest i didn't went outside for a half year except to buy food. I had no contact with my friends during last half year either. But it felt "fine". I'm depressed for such a long time and kinda felt "good" in my terms. 

Today i tried to check her Facebook, she deleted it. Now i feel like she died. I had no contact with her for 6 months and didn't try to but now... she is gone. I had conversations with her, like in the good days when we were happy, every day since she broke up with me. Thats not healthy i know. 
I consider suicide more than normal now. I got nothing in my life, no real friends, no job, not even the chance to get my own home. I will go to a mental hospital in 1 or 2 weeks, i'm on their waitlist for 2 months now... i don't know what to do until the admission to this hospital. 

I don't really need someone to talk.. just a few new thoughts in my head...
