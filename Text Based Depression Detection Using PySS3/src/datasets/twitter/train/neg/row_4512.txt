I go to sleep every night thinking of drinking rat poisonI've even become immune to what my family and fiance will feel. My family will slowly get over it. My sister might find it difficult to deal with it, but who will miss me past a year, tops?

Pretty sure my fiance will find someone new and move on.

People at work won't care. I'm mostly dumb and invisible anyway. In fact they might even laugh about what a waste of a life I am. It's sad because it was a job in my dream area. But I sucked at it.

I am tired of being this extremely dumb, physically defective, absolute failure with a lack of cognitive function and creative ability. I wish I could die in my sleep. The world needs smart people and I'm just a waste of space.
