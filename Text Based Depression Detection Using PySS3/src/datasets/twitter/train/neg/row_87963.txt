It's coming backThe feeling is coming back...... The pain and simultaneous hollowness in my chest is here again. I'm still taking my sad little pill, but the thoughts are stronger and the anger, the sadness and the hurt are slowly making their way back to my head. Now I remember why I sometimes feel like this is how I'm going to go.
