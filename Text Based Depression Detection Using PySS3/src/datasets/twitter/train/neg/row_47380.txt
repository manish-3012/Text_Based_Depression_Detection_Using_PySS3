No point in living anymore.I have bipolar disorder and my medication hasnt worked for a while. It also makes my head cloudy so i usually dont talk very often. I had gotten my dream job only to realize that i cant move up or get a raise not because i dont do my job but because i have no relationships with anyone at work. I try to make small talk but quickly run out of things to talk about because my brain is so cloudy. I am the lowest paid out of all of the employees even though i get perfect work performance reviews. My wife wants a divorce and i dont blame her im not much fun to be around. I also have a wage garnishment so i have to work 2 jobs in order to pay my bills and never get enough sleep. I also drowned myself in student loan debt and my payments keep going up because im working more because i cant afford my payments. Its a vicious cycle. I feel like the only person that would even show up at my funeral is my mom and shes on her death bed right now. I think this is it for me goodbye cruel world, i hope i get another chance because my brain is so screwed up it just doesn't seem right for this to be my only go.
