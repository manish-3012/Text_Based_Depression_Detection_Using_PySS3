Want to kill myself for two reasons1. Dad forced me to study in a degree I really don't want to do.

2.Dad had married and lives with a family that I don't want to be in. 

As you can see I'm over  30 and feel it's too late to change anything now. I have to die it's the only way. I don't Wana study what he wants me to and I don't Wana live with them. No other options but being homeless or dead.
