im differentmost ppl follow the program. listen to teachers, obey the law, get a job. im not like that. i woke up with a nightmare, i can't even get a good night sleep. 

best way to describe how im feeling, i feel trapped. i always felt trapped my entire life. i just don't wanna live anymore. one day, im just gonna snap and hang myself
