The thought that all this will be over one day is so fucking comfortingSeriously i never understand why people are so scared of death, i understand the survival instinct that you get when you are in a near death situation. But when you sit there and think logically, death should sound pretty fucking great.

When i see people in r/askreddit superpower threads and religious people wanting to be immortal, i feel they are not really thinking clearly about this. Why  would you want to be immortal? Are people really so happy and content with their lives that they could live forever? Is it just that i'm miserable and it's clouding my reasoning or are they so happy it's clouding their reasoning?
