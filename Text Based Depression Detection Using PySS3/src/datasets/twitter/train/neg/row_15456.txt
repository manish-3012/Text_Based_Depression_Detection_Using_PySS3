So tired, too tired...Ah, I don't even know what to say. I'm just so f'ing tired. I've battled suicidal thoughts since I was 11 or so, sometimes stronger and with me every day, every waking hour; sometimes less so, maybe only popping up a few times per week, but never really leaving me alone.

I want to get better, I just don't know if it's going to actually happen, it's been so many years, I don't know of any other sort of life. I'm 29 now, it must be around 15 years since I have been able to get through one day without finding some excuse why I would be better off dead.

This is so tiring, I can't find any reason why a "life" like this is worth living, I am not truly alive. I try to cling onto things I still want to see and experience, but I really do not know why I even try, most of them are entirely unreachable for someone like me.

I want to experience life so badly, but it all just seems like a ridiculous dream, so far out of my reach and league, I know I will never have a chance.

I know I was born a sickly baby, and my parents experiences way too many frustrations with me, so maybe I just never was meant to really survive and that's why I can't find a place in life. Or that's the best explanation I can come up with. (No, I'm not religious or of any specific faith, but I guess I believe that some sort of karma/fate system might exist...?)

I just want some peace and quiet...
