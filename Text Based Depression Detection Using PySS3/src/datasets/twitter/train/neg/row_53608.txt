why do i even tryI'm watching all my friends from high school and cousins around my age getting married having kids and a generally good life.  While i'm just a worthless waste of space that can't hold a job and am only a few days away from most likely getting kicked out of my house.  

I am beyond help.   I can't trust anyone anymore and I cant talk to my family about anything.  I was disowned about 2 years ago and have no friends to go to.  I can't get things i need due to no job therefore no money.

I either want to kill everyone i see and then get the cops to kill me or just go to the train tracks behind the house and let it take my head off.  There is no point to the useless existence i live
