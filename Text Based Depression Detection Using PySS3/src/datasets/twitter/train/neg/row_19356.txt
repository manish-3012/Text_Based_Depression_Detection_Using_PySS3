Suicide in Vegas: Final chapterI know it's lame for an OP not to deliver.

Especially when I know that there are those out there right now just begging me to pull the figurative trigger. 

I've seen a beautiful cross-section of humanity in the last 18 hours. But I'm in a hopeless position.

I'm at the end of my resources. I've tried positive thinking, reaching out to friends, and the like and nothing is helping. 

I came back here because you guys (sorry about the gender specific pronoun) actually helped last night. But now I wrestle with the fact that you still just think this is  desperate plea for  attention, or even worse, an attempt at guerrilla marketing from a struggling writer, and that the lack of success of my intentions last night paints me in an unfavorable light. I get that. That shit bothers me too.

What gets me down right now is that even if I solve all the problems listed in my previous entry I'm still pretty doomed. 

So here's another desperate cast into the sea of lowliness I feel, struggling to find a reason to keep going.

If you responded to my previous post, please don't take this personally. I'm really hoping that you don't see your efforts as wasted because I'm here again asking for help, but the situation tonight is just as dire as before, though I'd not fault you if you now equate me with the boy who cried wolf.

Help.
