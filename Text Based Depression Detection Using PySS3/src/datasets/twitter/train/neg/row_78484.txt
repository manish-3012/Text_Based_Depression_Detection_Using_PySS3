Everyone uses me and I simply have nothing left.I recently took in a homeless friend (or a friend who would be homeless without me) and was super stoked about hanging out and stuff. AS SOON as they moved in they revealed they had a new girlfriend and said girlfriend is over ALL THE TIME. I've told him numerous times that the girlfriend can't live here, but he doesn't care. He always tells me to "grit my teeth and bear it" and I'm like....YOU ARE A GUEST IN MY HOME. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? 

Today I tried to impose a time limit on their visits. "no more then 18 hours a day" and they both ganged up on me and more or less called me not a friend. What kind of friend does this?! What kind of friend moves in and then moves a completely second person in?!

I'm so at my witts end that I tried to kill myself. I took the pills, I wrote the note, the only thing that saved me was how uncomfortable the bathtub became. I moved locations and then swiftly fell asleep. 

I don't want this person in my home anymore. He scoffs at my rules and his girlfriend openly mocks me. But I can't get rid of them because every time I try they convince me I'm overreacting.
