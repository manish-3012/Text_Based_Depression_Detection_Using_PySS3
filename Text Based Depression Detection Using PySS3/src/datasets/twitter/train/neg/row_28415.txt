Told my sister I was on a suicide site (didn't say which one). She said to get off of it.Well, I'm not going to stay off of it. I have made up my mind. I just accepted a job, that pays less than welfare, had a job interview today, hoping it would be "the one" to get me out of the other one. I can't afford not to work, so still going to the first one on Monday. I should hear something by Friday, if I get hired, if I don't hear anything, then they went with someone else. Most likely they'll go with someone else, seems to be the norm. 
I'm tired of getting my hopes up, only to be turned down, time and time again. This has been my life. And every time I get turned down, I come to the realization, that my life isn't worth living. I have lost so much, and still losing. So I'm going to take matters into my own hands. No one else can tell me not to kill myself, but me. I am in control. And fuck the rest of the world.
