I'm not the protagonist.what even is the point of trying when there will always be someone better ? someone who's smarter, more creative, more successful. I'm not the main character who achieves its goal at the end, I'm just watching, a non special NPC, who am I even kidding when I think I'm gonna be successful, everyone says that to themselves, but no one eventually makes it, why think I will be any different ? I will just fail life lile like everyone before me who thought they are something special while staying in their bubble.
