I Need A Friend.I'm 21 and severely depressed. I keep staying up for days at a time because of my anxiety. I don't have a happy life. I honestly don't even want to live. My viewpoint on my own life is miserable and spirals out of control, and it accelerates the longer that I remain isolated.

I try to adopt a positive mentality, but it's nearly impossible for me. I've tried to be nice and make friends. I just can't. I feel like everyone hates me. People are just repelled away for me because I just have such a negative aura about me. For the longest time, I've felt I have had no chance at living any sort of happy life... and the longer that I live the stronger that feeling becomes.

All my insecurities, anxiety, stress issues become more solidified the longer I live, and the less and less hope I have. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm not interested in hearing about doctors or medication or therapy. I just want a friend. Someone that actually wants to spend time with me for who I am. That's all. And I can't even do that. Pretty pathetic.
