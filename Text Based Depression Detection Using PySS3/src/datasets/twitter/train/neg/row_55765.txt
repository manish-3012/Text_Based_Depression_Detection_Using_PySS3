fuck lifeIm 18 yrs old, im currently on my third year on college, im a virgin, im fat. And i am considering committing suicide.
Â It just feels like my life has been so hard. I took up a course which was basically forced on me by my parents. I finally realized what i wanted to study or to do after wasting 2 years of my life on this course. And it really is tough suffering on something you really dont want. 

High school is very easy compared to college and i really felt that last semester when iÂ  failed a subject. That was the first time i felt so depressed and it was one of my biggest failures in life up to date. i didnt know how to tell my parents.. eventually i told them and they seemed quite disappointed. I have friends but i never really told them this thought of mine committing suicide. I feel that you really cant tell a close friend even family this matter i dont know maybe its just me. Or im just a big pussy. 

Basically my first reason for committing suicide is the course i took and my failures with it. The second one is this girl i like. We've been classmates for four semester now. We were best buds until i told her i liked her. She said she was fine with it but i noticed she was drifting away from me. So i decidee to move on from her.. you see this is the problem. I confessed to her when we were 2nd yr college now we're third year. And we've been sitmates til now. I've been trying to act strangers with her since then. Everyday, for the past year until now, i feel im dying inside.

I hope you can help me. This is where i can only vent my thoughts, where no one knows me.

Ps. Fuck you AMV
