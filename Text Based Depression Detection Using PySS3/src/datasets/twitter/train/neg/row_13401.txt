I Feel Iâ€™m At A Low Point In My LifeFor four years of my life Iâ€™ve had depressing thoughts and thoughts of taking my own life. Two tragic life events (both deaths) that occurred around the same time brought these feelings up and they have stayed with me my whole life. I lost my faith in religion for a long time because of these two events. For a while I could deal with my feelings and in a way keep them suppressed I even had someone close to me who I would speak about these things to, but she has since left and is happy in her new life and I donâ€™t want to burden her with my problems. Iâ€™m a loner, anti-social type, who gets anxiety from meeting new people or experiencing new situations. The few friends that I have see me as the guy who is always happy and upbeat, the guy always willing to help them if they need a helping hand. However, itâ€™s just an act for them because I donâ€™t want them to see me in the shape Iâ€™m in now. Everyday I wake up I always have a thought that brings my spirit down for the day and itâ€™s occurring more and more. I feel as if I have been spiraling down for a while with no pick me up in sight.
