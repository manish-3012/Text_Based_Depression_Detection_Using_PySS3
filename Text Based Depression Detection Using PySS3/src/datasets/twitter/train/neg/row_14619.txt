Is this it?Today has to be the worst day ever. I never knew i would have the capability to feel this bad. Or that anything in the world would have the capability to let me feel this bad. I cant do this shit. I cant. The whole world is against me, im sure. Fuck this. I am done. I want to leave. My urge to die has never been this high.
