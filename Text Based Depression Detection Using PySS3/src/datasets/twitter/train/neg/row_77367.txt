I don't think it's worth it to live.Since i live in such a shitty country where we'll get nuked or forced into war before i get a chance at a good life I'll probably die anyway. Or some fucking brain dead decides to drink and drive. I wish that there was a room where nothing was a worry and i could just sleep and not get hungry or thirsty. The best way to suicide would be where you go far way so they dont know you suicided but kidnapped or something . I'd also like to trip on lsds just to have the experience or heroin and shit. I wish i never looked at reddit or the internet as a whole since i was a teenager when i found about the lifes of others. maybe that's influencing my decisions. but ehat if this was just a test? not where you go to heaven or hell but maybe me in the "real" world is in a vr and if i live a good life they'll sort me into a good job in the real world. but if i suicide then I'll just get "eliminated". I wish there was solid proof of a religion.
