My mother says I am drag everybody down with meAnd I do my best to hide or isolate myself from her and some other people she mentioned. She treats me like she is angry at me all the time. I don't even seek help from her. She just hears me crying 5% of the time. I'm not 16. I'm 25 and still living at home because of a catastrophe in my life. Unable to work. Unable to stop crying.
