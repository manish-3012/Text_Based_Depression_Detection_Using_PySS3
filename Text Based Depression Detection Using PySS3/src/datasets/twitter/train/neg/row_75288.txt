I think it's time for me to be committed but I have no insuranceI don't know what to do. I can feel my depression grab me and pull reality away. I've been able to fight it before but it sinks deeper every time. I need help, now. I need to go to hospital. I'm in the USA though and I do not have insurance. I'm 27 so I can't use my parents. I wish it wasn't so hard to get professional help. Maybe I'll just let me depression drag me all the way down this time.
