I can't deal with being a male anymoreI can't deal with being a male and having every single emotion I have shot down and invalidated. I can't deal with having no fucking rights to my body and having my genitals destroyed at birth and getting mocked when I say I am upset about it. Every single day I am suicidal for at least 5 hours over all the problems that have been inflicted on me solely because I am a male. I cry every fucking day at how backwards this world is and how all my problems are not caused by me. There is so much I could write but last time I did it got deleted probably because it's politically incorrect to say women have a far more privileged life in america than a man.
