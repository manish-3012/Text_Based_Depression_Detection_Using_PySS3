Thinking of overdosing myself to escape from the tremendous stress I get from school and relationshipBecause of COVID-19, our classes have been conducted online and somehow the assignment load has also increased. For these few months, I literally had to spend 16-18 hours every day just do work on these projects. Itâ€™s really stressing me out because Iâ€™m just stuck at home and couldnâ€™t do much. 

To make the matter worse, my boyfriend is currently working overseas (7 hours difference) and who knows when will he be able to return due to the prevailing situation. Recently, I feel like he has been emotionally distanced and it can take him 1.5 days to reply before I have to wait for another day. Just attempted to call him twice because I miss his company but he didnâ€™t pick up or call me back. Now I feel shitty about myself that I could be too overbearing with communication. Maybe thatâ€™s why he has been avoiding me. If I loss him, I donâ€™t know if I can take another hit especially when he was the one that made me believe in love again. My exes were trashes. 

Now Iâ€™m just feel like I have messed up my life and really seek to want to end my life by overdosing with sedatives. Painless and swift. However, the cowardice in me also makes me worry how my death would affect my loved ones. I really need help...
