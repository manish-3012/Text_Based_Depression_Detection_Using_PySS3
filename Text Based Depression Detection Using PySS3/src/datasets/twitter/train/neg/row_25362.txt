I self harmed after three years of being cleanThis is my first post on here... I didnâ€™t really know this existed, nor do I know how to post on here

I really really really wish I had the guts to actually go through with suic*de but Iâ€™m just not ready to die, like even if I go through with it Iâ€™m gonna be hoping someone saves me and that makes me feel even more pathetic 

I find myself on the edge often, I do want to die but thereâ€™s also so much that Iâ€™d like to live for. But the pain is too much. Iâ€™ve tried so hard and for so long and Iâ€™m just tired.
