Will I ever feel better? Feeling so hopelessI've posted here before with my entire life history if you are interested here it is http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/10ljma/will_the_pain_ever_end_im_getting_tired_of_this/.

I'm still struggling though. It's as if my mind is always being bombarded by feelings of frustration with myself, guilt, and panic. I can't concentrate or think right. I just want to hold onto my head and scream and make it all stop,

And now I'm getting to feeling really low about my appearance. I hate that I am getting older (25 now) and have gained quite a bit of weight. I've spent the past few hours looking at pictures of girls on 4chan and other sites comparing myself to them... Also looking up surgeries like liposuction, boob job, etc.  Feeling bad about my physical appearance is really bad for me... especially since it was a huge reason for the problems in my relationship

I keep having this desire to want to be falling, like jumping off of something. I had a dream I could fly and loved it. I just want my problems to end...

I just feel like there is no way out. I'm going to keep feeling this way and not be able to get over it. I tried out a new counselor this week and she was awful, so back to the drawing board with that....

 Rarely a few minutes goes by that I don't think about killing myself...I just want to hurt myself so much. I feel so hopeless about everything...I just don't want to feel this way anymore. I just want to be me again...
