Don't know if my life will be a failureI'm highly considering going into music education or music performance or both. I will admit I am a very skilled musician but when it comes to academics not anymore. I had a solid 4.0 gpa as a High school freshman. As a sophomore I earned two Ds in chemistry and a 3 Cs in algebra. Currently I'm a junior and I've earned 1 D and potentially an F if I don't bring that up in a few months. I participate in music group and bands outside of school all the time and take private lessons from two different people. But I feel like when it comes to academics colleges won't even look at me. In my defense I am taking 4 Ap classes this year (junior year) so it is rough I guess and i work 20 hours a week but I feel like such shit. I honestly will kill myself if I can't get into a college just because of some bad grades (in classes unrelated to music) please someone try to reassure that I have a chance ahead of me. Or tell me if I should stop trying because it's too late. Please. Would a college take a good musocian even if they were shit at school? I hope I have a chance.
