My struggles with Self-Esteem, reaching out for help.Firstly, I don't know where to post this if here isn't the right place so forgive me. Also I don't want to sound like the kind of dude that complains about not being able to get a girlfriend, but I'm going to for the sake of clearing my mind.
I'm 19, 5'10", 250 lbs, and not too attractive in the whole body region. However, physical appearance can be altered, be it through vigorous work and hardcore determination (Both things I have a 0% motivation to do.) The focus on this post is my Self-Esteem. I know that low self-esteem and depression are different things, and one can lead to the other. 
Now, from a lot of posts I've been reading on this sub-reddit, people seem to say that showing low self-esteem is a HUGE turn off for women, but my question to you is, how do you change how you view yourself when you feel so pathetic and hopeless about yourself already?
I've been trying to wrap my head around this for a long time, like a couple years..
I've hated myself for so long, something needs to change.
I really do want to change my appearance, and mental health, not only to hopefully gain the love of a wonderful woman someday, but also the love of myself. However I find it extremely difficult to improve both physical and mental health, I'm just looking for some guidance and advice..

Thanks for the read.
