The hotline is a fucking jokeI called the other night after finally psyching myself up. Idk what I expected but the lady just asked about a safety plan and if I was actively planning. We made a shit plan, I said I wasnâ€™t active and she kept trying to hang up on me. Maybe I used it wrong for not being half a pill bottle deep. But no one gives a fuck.

If someoneâ€™s job is to care and they keep trying to hang up on me doesnâ€™t give a fuck. Then itâ€™s not even worth it. Itâ€™s their job and they didnâ€™t care. Itâ€™s been two days and the ideals have gotten worse. If no one gives a damn, I donâ€™t see any more reason to keep fighting. The hotline was my last chance and it failed.
