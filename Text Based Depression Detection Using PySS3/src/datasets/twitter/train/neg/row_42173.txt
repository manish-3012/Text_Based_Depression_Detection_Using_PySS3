I Want To Stop Trying To Reach OutIt seems like every time I ask for help itâ€™s just a waste of time for the people I love. I feel so guilty because I still want to die no matter how many times I try to talk it out of my system and take care of myself, and at some point theyâ€™re bound to get as exhausted as I am from having to help me stay afloat. Seems like it would be a better idea to just stop trying and give in to the urge.
