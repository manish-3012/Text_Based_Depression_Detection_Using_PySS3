Things are going badlyWell the person I spent ten years loving married me and has since decided to cheat on me and lie about it. We talked and argued and tried and I'm tired of trying. I quit my job to move where he wanted and now I've moved out. He won't divorce me, he just flat out refuses, I don't have money to file for it on my own anyways so I feel stuck. The only reason I haven't offed myself yet is because my room is a mess. Everything is half packed half unpacked, laundry not done, nothing where it should be. I've actually not cleaned because I know once I start, I'll probably start throwing things away, and once I start that it'll be all to easy to just throw it all away. I don't want to leave a mess for my family to have to sort through. A big part of me is so angry that I couldn't make it on my own, that I made the wrong choices, picked the wrong man, didn't do life correctly, I just want to go back to start.
