GuiltIn order to live in this world, one must accept the good and bad, yes? I have trouble with that. I think many people aren't entirely aware of the bad they're accepting. Maybe they don't care. Maybe I only care because I know I'm guilty of it too.

&amp;nbsp;

As a child my father and a family friend sexually abused me. Pimped me out, really, for cam shows and sold pictures of me. I myself saw children, animals, and corpses being sexually abused. All kinds of bizarre degradation purely for the entertainment of truly careless individuals. I can't describe them as any less than crimes against humanity and all of humankind was indicted, complicit by the mere act of existing. That was the cost it seemed, of living and being in the world.

&amp;nbsp;

I left my family eventually. I did therapy and tried various medications for over a decade. It was all a temporary distraction from a truth I can't seem to escape: that the sum good of the world is not worth the sum bad. I don't discount the good in the world. I've seen it, I've felt it, I've been a part of it. There's sunsets and symphonies, laughter, kisses, music, art, friendship, love. I don't deny it. I understand its significance. But I don't think it's worth it. 

&amp;nbsp;

All the good in the world doesn't blot out the evil. It doesn't 'balance out.' It doesn't 'make up' for anything.

&amp;nbsp;

I went to therapy (several kinds, in fact, CBT, DBT, transpersonal, psychodynamic, Gestalt, trauma based, schema, etc.) and took my pills as prescribed, I listened to my therapist's advice and did my homework. I exercised, ate well, engaged in my community and made friends, read and said hopeful little affirmations, was forgiving and gentle with myself and others. For a time, at least.

&amp;nbsp;

It was frustrating to do all the 'right' things and still feel the way I do. I realized it was because all the while I was denying what I know to be true: I don't want to live in this world. I don't want to breathe the same air as others, I don't want community, I don't want relationships, I don't want happiness, I don't want to be well, I don't want to be saved. I want to be alone. I want to die alone.

&amp;nbsp;

All that good I mentioned? I would trade every happy memory, every kindness, every moment of peace simply not to remember, to be ignorant of man's cruelty. But that would be false too. Because it exists whether or not one is aware of it, all over the world, in greater magnitude than is fathomable. It has always been and will always be. Cruelty is as much in human nature as kindness. That's the 'duality of man,' that's the 'rich tapestry.'

&amp;nbsp;

I want no part of it, but it's too late. I don't hate the people who hurt me or anyone else because they are evil or monstrous or Other. I hate myself because they and me are exactly the same.

&amp;nbsp;

I go on in my cowardly way about longing for death when it feels like I died many years ago when I was a young child. It makes sense in a way because this world is nothing less than hell.
