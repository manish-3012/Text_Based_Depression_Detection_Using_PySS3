Just want to be alright for oncetonight i realized how little my life really meant to me and to others so i went to apply to make something of myself and apply to my local emt squad turns out that a mistake i made a year ago now may come back to say fuck you to any and all hopes of that. I'm feeling really low right now and don't really have anyone to talk to about it =[ it just would be nice to have a person to talk to right now.....feeling really pathetic right now too
