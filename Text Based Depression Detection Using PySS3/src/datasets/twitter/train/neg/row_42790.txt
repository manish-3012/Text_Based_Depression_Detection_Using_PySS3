My mind is fucking down...Hi, thank you for reading this.
First, let me say that I am 20 year old and I'm struggling with depression for about 5 years. It all got even worse because my girlfriend broke up with me. I told her about my suicidal thoughts and she never really seem to be interested in my problems and only said it would go over...
I have no one that I can talk to, no one that want's to hear my problems and thoughts that are stuck in my head for too long... I'm alone and I feel like no one would care if I would kill myself.
I had to give my Ex a promise that I won't do anything stupid to myself, that's the only reason why I am alive since then.
Now, I just don't see any point in life anymore... I don't know if I want to kill myself or not but the thought of it is stuck in my head and it gets me calm that there would be a way out if I just can't go any further, but on the other side, I'm afraid of that day when I say 'Fuck it' and going to do it... because I want to live, but not like this...
I don't know what my specific problem is, but the fact that my Ex broke up with me and me having no real friends is killing my mind...

I'm completely destroyed right now and don't know what to do...
