Failing to lose weightUp until last year, I was always at a decent weight, sliding between 150 and 160 pounds at 5'6 for years. I loved my body, I loved myself for my personality too, and had great confidence.

I had a nervous breakdown during school in the fall of 2015, was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts, and ended up withdrawing that semester. That break I took fucked up so much stuff. I felt worthless for dropping out, and tried to actually kill myself because of it. So of course, when you pull that shit, the psychiatrist gives you anti depressants. And I ate more. And began to gain.

I cycled through different anti depressants for months, even when I was back in school. I was still horribly depressed, and began smoking pot everyday. More weight was gained. 

I am now doing well in school, able to cope with those stressors, and have given up smoking pot to deal with existing. I am on a good mix of meds that actually help. Since January, I have decided to lose weight. I have lost only 5 lbs. Because I am disgusting and overeat. I weight 230 now. My body disgusts me. Whenever I overeat, I sob, and do shit like pull my hair out or slap myself in the face. I am doing a couch to 5K as well, but that doesnt exactly pull the pounds off when I still go over my calorie limit. 

I have been considering suicide seriously for the time in months. I hate being fat. Sure, people who know me love me. I'm funny as hell and know how to talk to people. But I am still morbidly obese and I hate it. Nobody looks at me twice anymore, except people who think of me as a fetish. I don't want to live anymore. I want to be beautiful.
