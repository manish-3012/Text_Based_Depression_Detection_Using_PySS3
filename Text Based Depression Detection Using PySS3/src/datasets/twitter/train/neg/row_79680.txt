Holding on for the little things, but I feel like everything is falling apart.I wish I did more soul searching and listened to myself (rather than everyone around me) before going to college. Now I've dropped out from a major university with $5k in debt under my belt and I'm flunking out of the community college I joined. I look at all these careers and occupations and I just don't feel like I belong in any of them. The only thing I really can do and really like doing is writing and making music, but I can't start doing that until I have a significant amount of money to get it started, and I have negative money now!

I tried to make a list of reasons to hang on VS reasons to let go (of life).

Reasons to hang on:

* My little brothers who look up to me. But I've become such a loser, a failure at life. How could they be proud of a big sister like that?
* My parents who love me. I know my mom loves me and she tells me she will always love me no matter what. I'm sure my dad loves me too but I know for a fact once he finds out that I'm dropping out of college again, he will be so ashamed of me. We've always been really distant and he has very high expectations. He talked trash about my sister when she dropped out due to anxiety. I'm next, I guess.
* My cats. They are all rescues, 2 of which I've raised since kittenhood. One of my cats has horrible anxiety from having an abusive household and she's clung to me ever since I got her. When I'm gone, my mom tells me she cries all day until I come back. I'm very protective of them and only I really know their personalities well enough to handle them. Without me, they won't get the specific care they need.
* Might sound stupid, but that next videogame, that next book, that next season of whatever show...
* Food is pretty good, I guess.
* This one might be morbid, I'm 1/3 way to reaching my goal weight in my weight loss and if I die too soon, I'll never enjoy my hard work. I know it seems like a vain reason to hang on, but it's there...
* My best friend. She is going through depression too and my death might be her breaking point. I can't do that to her.
* It might get better one day.

Things I'm struggling with:

* I'm probably going to get kicked out very soon (once they found out I flunked) and I don't have anywhere to really go. My parents were helping me financially through college, but after this, they most likely won't anymore, so I don't have the option of going back to college and I probably will end up struggling in poverty (or living paycheck to paycheck) for life.
* I have horrible social skills and I think I might have ADHD but I never got to see a psychiatrist for a full evaluation. All of these things make it hard to make new friends, keep a job, or even consider the possibility of a relationship. I feel like my life is going to be nothing but struggle and it's going to go nowhere.
* I just feel like a loser, a failure, and a let-down. I feel like this world, especially my family, would be better off without me. I'm just deadweight, an anchor keeping them back from moving forward. My mom told me she poured over $10k into my education (helping pay my bills, etc.) and even more when I came back home after dropping out of the first university. The last thing I want is for them to waste even more money and time on me when it's obvious that I was just born stupid. I just can't be good for anything.

I guess I just needed someone to read this because even though my friend deals with depression, she and I experience depression differently (which is fine) so I can't really go to her with this (also fine). I just need someone to tell me that it'll be okay, I guess? Has anyone else failed this hard at life and recovered?
