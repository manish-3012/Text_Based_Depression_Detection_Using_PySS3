I donâ€™t know what to doI canâ€™t live but I canâ€™t die and itâ€™s so frustrating. Iâ€™ve never seen a professional but I believe I have depression and some sort of anxiety(I donâ€™t want to be one of those girls who diagnoses themselves with every mental illness they can so Iâ€™m not going to state for a fact that I have anything) I try reaching out to my friends and family but I can never find the right words. Itâ€™s honestly so debilitating not being able to tell people that Iâ€™m hurting. I did tell my friend but I made it seem like I wasnâ€™t serious so she wouldnâ€™t think Iâ€™m trying to get attention or anything. I feel like the only way I can get out of this situation is to hurt myself and let the hospital staff take care of the rest. So I donâ€™t have to face my family and friends directly. I know if I actually went through with it then Iâ€™d hurt my parents a lot. Theyâ€™ve lost and given so much to have me. My mother had three miscarriages and my older brother died just six weeks after he was born to brain cancer. Even though I never met him because I wasnâ€™t born yet he still plays a big role in my life. I love him with all my heart and talk to him everyday(call me weird but it soothes me) heâ€™s helped me through so much and stopped me from hurting myself multiple times. I didnâ€™t think I could ever do that to my parents but as the months drag on and on so does my desperation. I cant deal with living and the responsibilities that come with it anymore. Iâ€™m losing hope.
