I have nightmares every night and they won't stop. [trigger warning]So not only do I have to live in the nightmare that is my life when I'm awake, I have to apparently live in them when I sleep too. I've been experiencing horrifying and violent nightmares for the past two months consistently. I have them every time I sleep and it's very disturbing. Thus, I try not to sleep which has led me to suffer from the effects of sleep deprivation and now I also have the flu.

The content of my nightmares relates heavily to my life when I'm awake. They're very realistic and I often wake up believing a few moments that it was real, when I realize it  was just a dream, but it still affects my life. The violence is very graphic as well in my dreams. I dream that i have hands like edward scissorhands and as I'm running away, my arms flail and I slash myself with my hands. In my dreams I'm also terrorized by my parents (they do this in real life), dragged and stabbed (not like real life in a literal sense, but metaphorically). I hear piercing screams that cause me to wake up in the middle of the night. I also see other acts of violence that involve other people either inflicting harm on each other or themselves. 

It's really very disturbing for me and I can't escape it. As if I'm not suicidal enough, I have to dream about it too. I try everything to prevent them like watching comedies before bed or looking at cute animals. I'm not on any medication, so the nightmares aren't induced by that. Nothing helps and I'm really scared.
