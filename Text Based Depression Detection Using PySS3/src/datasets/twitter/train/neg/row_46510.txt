I wish I had the courage to end my life and the fact that I donâ€™t is making me even more suicidal.You know how everyone talks about how everyone cares when youâ€™re dead? Iâ€™d like that. I wish they would. Even if half of them didnâ€™t care when I was alive.

Maybe it would drum it into people in my life that things are temporary. Nothing I do whilst Iâ€™m alive makes them realise this.

Iâ€™ve tried killing myself before but it was 4 years ago and I donâ€™t know where I got that courage from. Iâ€™d need to just get in to that mindset and stay there. Something bad would need to happen.

When something goes wrong, it seems like everything else goes with it, too.

Everyone in my life only wants me for personal gain. So much bad stuff has happened and I donâ€™t want any more to happen but it seems as though killing myself is just too much of a move to make. I wish I could do it but I just canâ€™t bring myself to.

How would I ever? How could I leave my young siblings behind, forgetting about me as they grow up? Maybe thatâ€™s the only thing holding me back.

Maybe Iâ€™m just waiting for everything to get better like I always do. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s stopping me but I wish it wasnâ€™t. I wish I could just throw myself a path of self-destruction and ruin everything that could ever be good in my life but Iâ€™m too scared of hurting anyone that I love and care about. More than they are scared of hurting me considering they do it all of the time.

This was just rambling but I really just needed somewhere to say that I wish I could successfully kill myself and thatâ€™s all. Why canâ€™t I kill myself?

Why do I live to please others? Is that all my life has become? I canâ€™t even end my own life like I want to because Iâ€™m too scared of hurting everyone else? Not because I want to fulfil dreams and ambitions. Just for everyone else. Thatâ€™s how it will always be.
