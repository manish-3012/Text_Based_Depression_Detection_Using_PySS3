Iâ€™m so exhaustedIt been knock down after knock down since October and I just donâ€™t think I can bear it anymore. Everyday is constant pain. My dad died in September (in a rather horrific way while I had to watch and be useless) my family only care about me when it suits them, I got rejected from the only college I wanted to go to. The biggest kick was my girlfriend dumped me out of the blue and told me that she lost feelings a month ago and she was just faking it, and I canâ€™t do it anymore. I loved her with all my heart and just luck everyone else in my life, she left me. They say it gets better but does it really? I somehow managed to lose so much more than what I started with and they always say it will get better but it just keeps getting worse. If this is what life is then I think Iâ€™ll take the cowards way out.
