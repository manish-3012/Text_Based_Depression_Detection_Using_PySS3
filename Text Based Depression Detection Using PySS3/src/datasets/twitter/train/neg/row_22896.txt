My goals and dreams are lost...Iâ€™ve officially given up on my goals and dreams. Itâ€™s like they were not intended for me. I had the potential at one point but I feel like I blew it all away from all the pressure and stress. Iâ€™m afraid that I will live a boring and unproductive way. For the past couple of years, Iâ€™ve tried to have the time of my life but I feel like i made a big mistake. I have become more miserable since then. Iâ€™ve lost count of having suicidal thoughts daily. Toxicity and fake love from my parents destroy me each and every day. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m not mean to be loved by anyone.
