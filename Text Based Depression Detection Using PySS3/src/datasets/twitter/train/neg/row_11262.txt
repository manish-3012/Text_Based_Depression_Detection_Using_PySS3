I wish time passed faster, this is unbearableI wish timed pass faster so less people will get hurt when I die. I'll make sure that by then I won't have any close friends by then. I think about this everyday and this is unbearable. The only reason I am still here is not hurt my mother. I just want to be at peace with myself.
