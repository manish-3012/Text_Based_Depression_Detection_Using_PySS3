I don't know what's wrong with meNothing makes sense anymore. I have parents who want nothing to do with me, friends who don't give a shit about me, and a wife who doesn't understand me in the slightest. My heart is a black hole and for some reason nothing is ever enough and I'm never satisfied. There's too many people in my life who don't care about me for me to think its not my problem. 

I'm the common factor in all this and I just can't stop hurting. I'm loving and kind but it seems that it doesn't matter in the end. If I wasn't such a coward about it I'd be dead already instead of posting here. I've tried being strong but I just can't go on anymore. No matter what path I take I'm stuck. Damned no matter what road I walk down. I never wanted this for my life and can't believe my life has come to this. The only solace from this living nightmare is in my dreams or death. I wish I could fall asleep in sweet bliss and never wake up ðŸ˜¢

Even now I can't stop crying and nobody cares or knows how to talk to me. I suffer from being too smart and aware of too many things and it's killing me. I just can't go on anymore.
