Not sure if I wanna kill myself or fall in to a permanent comaIâ€™m scared to hurt other people. But honestly I feel like I need it. Itâ€™s the only thing that can make me â€˜truly happyâ€™. But Iâ€™ve attempted multiple times before and I saw how it broke my mother. Sheâ€™s depressed now after finding her nearly dead daughter 3 times. 
I love my boyfriend and I have some small goals atm. A few good things going for me but this mentality i have and always had where Iâ€™m actually obsessed with dying will probably never go away and I feel like itâ€™s inevitable.
