.I feel like Iâ€™ve spent the last few weeks accepting Iâ€™d kill myself tomorrow. Planned it out, gave up on school work and just stopped caring about everything. Now Iâ€™m just scared of the future because I feel that I donâ€™t really have any other choice now but to do it but to be honest Iâ€™m scared of it.
