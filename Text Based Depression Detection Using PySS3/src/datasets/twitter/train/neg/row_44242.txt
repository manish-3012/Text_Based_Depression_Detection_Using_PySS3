Im sick of being such a shut-in loser. fuck life. After playing skyrim on 360 for 40 hours so far, i have come to realize how pathetic my existence has become.  I dropped out of high school at age 16, because i was severely bullied for being fat. Since then, i've become so crippled by anxiety that i have rarely left my house since then.   

I am so ashamed of myself that i'd rather no one see me.  I really feel like I'm a waste of space, just thinking about what kind of life i have makes me cringe.  I really have no one to blame but myself,  i let social anxiety rule my life for years,  and i've done nothing about it.  

its just finally wearing me down, it's so fucking lonely.  i can't remember the last time i had friends,  hell i don't even have online friends.  I'm so fucking isolated from everything, i might have well just dropped off the face of the earth.   Every year i keep telling myself. "this is the year you will change"  and i manage to motivate myself, i even manage to keep it up for a month or two, then ultimately i fail and lose all motivation.  

Im at the point where i can't keep deluding myself into thinking i can change who i am,  i really don't see myself getting better.   I really don't want to live like this anymore,  i don't really want to live at all.

Honestly, I feel like the best thing I can do end it.  My parents would be sad, but they are already sad, ive brought them nothing but stress, and I donâ€™t want to burden them anymore.  Iâ€™m an uneducated parasite to society,  and I really donâ€™t deserve to exist.
