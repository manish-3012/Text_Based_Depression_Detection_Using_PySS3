24 years of almost constant sufferI'm so fucking sick of it.

24 years of it. A life that's shadowed by childhood abuse. Inability to create meaningful connections. Betrayals.

I just want a couple years of happiness. I'm already fucking 24. In 6 years I'll be 30. I feel like I haven't done anything really worth remembering. 

I want it to end. I'm fucking 24. I'll never have a second childhood.
