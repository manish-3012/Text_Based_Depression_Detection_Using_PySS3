I've been a scared human beingI think a lot of my problems started when I felt out as a child. Ever since then I never really lived fully and wasted so much time by being scared and filling the void with addiction.  In other words I filled the void with a void and morphed into a zombie. Plus I have all these regrets of not enjoying my youth. I'm nearing 30 and my 20s and teens have been riddled with me being a scared man. 

Know what's sad, I'm too afraid to kill myself too. I've been taking forever with my studies and I just struggle to feel. I'm disconnected and I know the first step is overcoming my addiction. I just stay stuck in a loop of doing unhealthy habits and I don't have the motivation to change. I know exactly what I need to do though.

I'm in a weird spot, probably in a comfort zone of feeling meh. I have moments of laughter and feeling ok, I won't call myself severely depressed. My lifestyle just needs to change and I need to man up and start doing shit. Self sabotaging seems to be my super power, a part of me is so used to feeling meh that I continue my bad habits to stay stagnant.

The fact is bad habits are extremely diffciult to break, but that is the first step to feeling better. Time to escape Zombie Town and if that doesn't work I may off myself. For now I still have a bit of hope.
