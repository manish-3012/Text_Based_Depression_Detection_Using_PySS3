I just realized how lonely I amI know a lot of people, but maybe three of them I can call real friends one of them is my boyfriend, everybody else don't really care about me and I try to be strong for those 3 people and pretend I'm okay when in reality I cry a lot and want to die. When those 3 people don't pay attention to me I feel like I don't matter and nothing would change if I disappear, I really low key thing it's true, but at the same time my boyfriend says the same to me, and I have to tell him it's not true, I would really suffer if he died why am I like this
