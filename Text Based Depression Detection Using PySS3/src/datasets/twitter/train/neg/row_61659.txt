Why can't I kill myself?I want nothing more than to die. I hate my life, I hate myself, I wish I had never existed. But no matter how much I want out, I can't seem to grow the lady-balls to end it. Why? This is some kind of awful limbo, wanting to die *so much* and being too much of a fucking coward to do it. I don't understand how to do this.
