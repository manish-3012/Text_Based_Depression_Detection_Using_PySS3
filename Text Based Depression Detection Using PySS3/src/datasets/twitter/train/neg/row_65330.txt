Military member struggling..  I'm a 21 year old active duty military member that'd struggling terribly. About six weeks ago, I was released after a 38 day impatient stay in San Antonio, TX. Being diagnosed with PTSD after a sexual assault, I am failing to rebuild my life. The people around me don't understand. I am in a perpetual state of walking on eggshells at home.  I care for my 19 year old sister and my fiancÃ© lives with us. It feels as if my symptoms of PTSD and past abuse are a game. My finance thinks it's entertainment to make me flinch away when he pretends he is going to hit me, although he never had, and makes sure that I am aware he never has. He holds an incident over my head where I had a flashback working on an overnight call in and my ex-boyfriend, who also works with me, had to take care of me during the episode to prevent me hurting myself. My ex-boyfriend lied to my current fiancÃ© and me, not knowing the actual situation, was forced between a rock and a hard place.  I am doubting my own sanity.  My fiancÃ©'s ex-wife has been texting me non-stop with abusive messages, putting me down, threatening to keep the kids away from us. But because she texts on fake numbers, my fiancÃ© borderline blames me, and uses that incident as fire to fuel that claim.  I have not contacted her in months, and still this continues. Tonight, while we dropped the kids off, she came to the car and started an argument. My fiancÃ© froze and she stood there and belittled me in front of his children.  He did nothing. After an abusive failed marriage, the sexual assault, and the mental health issues I am facing, the military has came to the conclusion that I am not fit for service anymore. I am currently going though a medical board for potential separation from the service.  My life is falling apart.  I don't know what to do. I do not feel safe reaching out to anyone. I hurt people or my fiancÃ© says that I am manipulative. My therapist team is constantly changing, and my new therapist has only had me for two sessions. I am terrified to go impatient again, as it only fucked me up more being away from my support group. I feel alone but can't bring myself to burden anyone else with my issues. Mostly, I just want to find the strength in myself to end my life. I can't keep living this way and after months of this stagnant state, even after all my struggles, living is exhausting.  I can't even hardly pull myself out of bed in the morning. The happiness I feel is tinged with guilt.  I doubt this is ever going to get better. It's too painful to keep holding on.
