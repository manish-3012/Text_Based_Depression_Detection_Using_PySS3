I hate thisThe song sail says it perfectly; "maybe I should cry for help, maybe I should kill myself" 

I don't want to do it anymore. I struggle to get up, go to work, go to school, eat, sleep, repeat. I don't feel anything but guilt for being alive and for being jealous of people for things they can't help. I can't talk to my friends about my problems because they'll just get tired of how repetitive they are and how burdensome I am, so I lamely rant on the internet which is embarrassing and sad. I'm fucking pathetic really, and a waste of space. I genuinely deserve to die for being such a shitty excuse for a human being.
