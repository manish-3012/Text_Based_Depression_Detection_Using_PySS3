I'm so tiredI'm just so tired. I will be 18 in less than a week. I don't want to see the day. 
My mom recently found out that me and my boyfriend have had sex. Her disappointment in me is crushing.

My sister is verbally, and occasionally physically abusive. She constantly screams at me, she threatens me as a way to break me down. She calls me names and it really hurts inside.

I'm failing college, cause I'm in a program I wasn't prepared for.

I can't talk to anyone cause my mom would tell me to suck it up if i wanted to get psychiatric help. 

This pressure isn't making me a diamond, it's crushing me. I don't know what to do. I'm just so tired of everyone and everything. I have no friends. My boyfriend is the only one who really cares about me and I'm just falling apart. I work two jobs, go to school everyday and it's still not enough for anyone. I don't know what to do.... I just want to end it. I'm sorry for the rant, wouldn't be surprised if you stopped reading before this. Maybe I'm just looking for attention, I don't want people to tell me it'll be ok. I've heard that enough, it doesn't help. 

Just... Please tell me that this decision is ok, please...
