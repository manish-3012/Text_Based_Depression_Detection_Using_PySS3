Not urgent but i really want to talkI'm not going to die. Im not going to commit suicide. Im lower priority than everyone else here. 
But if you some how still have the time, i wanlt to talk. 
I want to be able to say i want to die without regretting it without making tje other person feel bad without thinking i ruined my image with this person for being so heavy so overdramatic so annoying.
i want to die. So bad. I want to disappear from everyones memories. I want to have never existed. 
I hate myself so bad. So bad. Part of me knows im having a bad day today that my meds are doing rheir job usually and ill feel okay in the morning nd i should be grateful for that.

But it doesnt feel like that roght now and right now i want to talk to someonw and know they wonlt hate me. 

I dont know you you dont know me you canlt hate me. So please give me some words. Any words and i can be so grateful i was able to talk with someone who doesnlt hate me.
