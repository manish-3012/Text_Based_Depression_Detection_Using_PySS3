I'm tired of life.Hi...first of all, sorry if my english suck....so yea, i'm a 20 years old man, Nobody cares about me, I never had a real friend or a  girlfriend, my family think i'm a loser, no one loves me. I'm alone. I think about suicide all the time, I dont see the point of being alive. Everyday i look myself in the mirror and i Hate what I see. I tried to speak with a lot of psy but it did not work.  Deep inside I know I want to believe in  life, but I feel so alone and broken .Is it so selfish to want to end my miserable life when nobody really cares. When u are completely alone. I just...I dont want to be a bad person , I just want the pain to go away! i cant deal with it anymore!
