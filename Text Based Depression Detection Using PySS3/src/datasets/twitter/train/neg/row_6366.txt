Think I have finally mentally snappedThis week has strangely been the one to push me over...I finally got a chance to hear from my biological family. Donâ€™t expect anyone to understand how it felt to see and hear them for the first time in a year. When I left they had no idea of the real reasons. My mother tainted them all with vile lies about me. This week they all head and saw the truth but Iâ€™m not sure if they can realise the whole truth.

Been in quarantine since early March, before the official lock down. It has destroyed and torn my mental health apart. Every inch of progress I made has gone. The darkness has won and consumed me by now...

I canâ€™t keep wearing a mask. Itâ€™s full of cracks, holes and crumbling away. 

Even a simple disagreement lead to a massive break down for me. Ended in tears I couldnâ€™t control nor feel. I want to honestly say fuck this! Give me a gun so I can end myself. Give me anything to end this. I donâ€™t want to fight anymore. Iâ€™m done with this bullshit of a life. All Iâ€™m doing is ruining everyone elseâ€™s lives. 

I donâ€™t want to drink, eat or sleep...itâ€™s a waste of time and resources. I canâ€™t see myself living till the end of the year. Itâ€™s shit how whenever I feel anything I mindlessly cry. I want this hell to end.
