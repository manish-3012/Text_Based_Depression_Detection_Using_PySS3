I wonder if anyone would actually care even if I kill myselfI was sitting in class today, and I thought about what would happen if I killed myself. Would my seat be decorated with flowers, or would the school just get rid of my desk altogether? Would people remember me even after years pass, or will they just forget?

I feel like no one really cares in the end. People may start to â€˜careâ€™ after Iâ€™m dead, but ... well, I wonâ€™t be here to see it.

I know I sound needy, but all I want is for someone to actually care and ask if Iâ€™m okay.
