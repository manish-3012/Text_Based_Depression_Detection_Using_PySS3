Well, this might be it for me.I've been thinking about this for a really long time. I've been dealing with depression for years now and have been seeking treatment for it, but honestly I'm not sure if I really want to get better anymore. Tonight I've hit a point where I have realized I really don't have any motivation to keep going. The one person that was keeping me motivated just left and they aren't coming back. Not too sure how I'm going to do it yet, but I honestly believe this is going to happen.
I don't even know why I'm posting this. I don't know what my goal is here. Who knows? Maybe I'll actually live and realized how stupid this is. Idk.
