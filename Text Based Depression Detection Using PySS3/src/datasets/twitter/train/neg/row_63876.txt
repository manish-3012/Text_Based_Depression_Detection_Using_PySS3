It's my birthday and this is all I can think about.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pyBB7y8fDU

I've lost everything, I've even lost myself.  I can't stop crying.  I don't want to die, I just don't want to keep living like this.

[EDIT] Thanks to everyone who commented.  I decided to watch The Royal Tenenbaums on netflix on demand.  It is my favorite movie, and watching it in its entirety, instead of only Richies suicide, has reminded me that it is a movie about working through your problems and fighting to achieve what you want.

Thanks again.
