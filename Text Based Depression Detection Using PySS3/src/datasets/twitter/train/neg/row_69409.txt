Miserable.22yo male. Haven't had a real job or any form of relationship in years. I live with my parents since I dropped out of university and don't even have the motivation to seriously look for work. I feel like a pathetic manchild and too depressed to do anything about it. I don't want to talk to anyone. I don't want to see anyone but I feel so alone and miserable at the same time. I want to love and feel some form of reciprocated affection. I think about suicide frequently but am too cowardly to go through with it, I don't care at all about the people I'd leave behind, part of me even wants them to suffer just so I'd have some effect on people even if I wouldn't experience it. None of these feels like "real problems" and I'm disgusted at myself but I want to be understood by someone at the same time. I don't know, am I just crying for sympathy/ attention? The idea of reaching out just makes me feel weak.
