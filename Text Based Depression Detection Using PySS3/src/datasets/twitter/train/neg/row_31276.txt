Doesn't anyone deserve better?I tried to kill myself on friday night because no-one has/does/will ever love me and my friends don't want anything to do with me either. I haven't done anything wrong inparticular, I just seem to be repellent to other human beings and it has always been that way. I love being with other people and feel lonely when I am not. I am 27 now. I can't go into why the attempt failed.

I told a female friend (used to be with benefits, but not for a couple of months when I said how depressed I was). She got the message  first thing saturday morning but didn't do anything with it till lunchtime when I got a couple of messages saying "thank god you didn't" and then that she had told one of my colleagues despite my request to never tell anyone. I do understand her thinking though.

Next... nothing. No-one round to check up on me or stay and make sure I am ok. In fact, she turned her phone off. Now they say neither of them will talk to me and if I want to talk to someone I should go to a professional. They know exactly why I am suicidal, so this and the complete lack of caring seem like a big 'fuck you, just go and finish the job'.

They did set officialdom on me, sending police round to check on me. As far as I am concerned that is caring about doing the right thing, not caring.

If the roles were reversed I would be at their side making sure they knew how important they are to me and not leaving them to their demons.

Sorry for the ramble... Waiting for my phone, hard drives etc to wipe.
