I want to kill myself because of my exDuring those 3,5 years weâ€™ve lived so intensely, traveled abroad, lived together. Weâ€™ve gone through highs and lows, but suddenly, due to COVID, we had to be apart for a while as she moved back to her parents. She came asking for time, and after a while said that sheâ€™s happier that way. I cannot comprehend why she would decide to finish things like after everything we went through. I am obsessing over this for the past 5 months and I canâ€™t take it anymore. It corrupted my mind and I canâ€™t focus on anything else. I couldnâ€™t find a job, so I spent the entire day walking in circles rehearsing what I shouldâ€™ve said in a conversation with her. I wanted to die for so long, but this was final nail on my coffin.
