Abusive father dictates my clothingI'm 19F. My father has been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive for most of my life. He would always tell me I looked ugly in dresses and skirts and that I should get changed into "pants and a top".

My parents and I are going out tonight. I wore a formal, somewhat conservative dress (long sleeves, hem past my knees) and I felt very beautiful. 5 minutes before we were about to walk out the door, he told me I look ugly and should wear pants and a top. He also said only size 6's should wear dresses (I'm between a 14 and 18 and I suffer from an eating disorder so his comments really didn't help).

I feel heartbroken and extremely upset. I don't even want to go out anymore. I've spent my entire life in f**king pants and a top. ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜­
