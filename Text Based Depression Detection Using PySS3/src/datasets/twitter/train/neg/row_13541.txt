I can't shake these gruesome thoughts. I've been suffering from depression lately. Some months ago, I started having these queer obsessive thoughts. I would be taking a shower, and I picture myself violently disemboweling myself with a knife. Sometimes I'm driving, and I just get this urge to get a knife and slit my throat. I would be cooking in the kitchen and I picture myself, in great detail, puncturing my thighs with a kitchen knife. There are much worse ones, too graphic to go into detail, but the common theme is that they are all obsessive thoughts/visualizations of me hurting/mutilating/ending myself with a blade of some sort. 

The thing that scares me is that these thoughts come unbidden, and they somehow alleviate anxiety or stress. They are exceedingly unpleasant but at the same time they give me some kind of relief. Recently, I was in the kitchen cutting up boiled eggs for a salad, and my mind started racing. I felt that doing it for real would be such a relief. I've never been suicidal but now I am very scared. I can't control my thoughts and I'm scared that soon I won't be able to control my person. 

If anyone has experienced anything like this, maybe you can give me some insight. I would totally appreciate any advice. Thank you kind people.
