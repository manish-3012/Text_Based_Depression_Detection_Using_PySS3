I can't even bring myself to get out of bed.So I had a horrible mental breakdown today. Later I felt suicidal and had texted my best friend a suicide text thing for a cry for help. And he responded with "Chloe, I don't have time for this right now. I have to go to work in an hour and my nerves are already shot. Please can you be selfish another time?"

...i dont know how to respond to that. So I didnt. I understand he's kinda going through something right now, and I'm always there for him. Like..he snuck out of the house around midnight last night because I said that I'd smoke the rest of my weed with him and talk about what was bothering him. 
And when I need him the most, he says things like that.

Is he right? Am I just being selfish? And I overreacting? And I being over sensitive? I dont know what to think... It's causing me to overthink and Im thinking the worst...

I just need a second opinion. Open to any questions that need answered for better clearity.
