I'm not gonna even be missedEveryone in my life hates me, and the people who say they don't treat me the worst. Very day I'm ridiculed by they're looks and jokes. I hate being ugly and stupid. And then my girlfriend who had literally just said she loved me broke up with me because her friend didn't like me. (Her friend had never met or talked to me, just heard I was dating her and said she hated me) so if this isn't a sign I should just end everything I don't know what is... I just want someone to hang out with and feel appreciated by but that never happens
