I think Iâ€™m going down this road too... wish I wasnâ€™t.I miss my last girlfriend. I am too lonely. I just donâ€™t think I can keep going. I feel less and less like a somebody and more like a thing. I donâ€™t want to keep going. I donâ€™t want to go to work... Iâ€™m worried about myself, yet never listen to my reasonable side.

What do I do? Iâ€™ve got an appointment for a therapist but thatâ€™s ages away.
