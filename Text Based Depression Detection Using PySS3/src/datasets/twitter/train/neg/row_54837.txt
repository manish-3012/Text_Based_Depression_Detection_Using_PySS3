Why?I am not good at life.

I do not get along well with people, I am terribly awkward and I loathe myself. I wish I didn't feel this way. Sometime soon, I will finally do it. I will end it all, because it's too hard.

I can't drive, I'm terrified of it.

I tell people it's because I'm a bad driver or that it's just a scary concept. That's half true, but the reality is that I'm terrified that I will purposefully crash. I will drive into a tree or off a bridge or into oncoming traffic so that I will die.

Why do I get these thoughts in my head? Why am I constently telling myself that I am awful, and ugly and that nobody loves me? Why do I sit in front of the mirror for hours crying at my reflection, clutching on to a bottle of pills before remembering that's a terrible way to go? Why? 

I wish I understood. I wish I could tell someone. A mind is not meant to think this way.
