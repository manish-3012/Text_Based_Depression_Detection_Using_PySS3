Can't make life workSober 2 days after a 2 week binge. But, I don't know what it's all for. I can't seem to do my work at the office. I can't seem to get out my shell. I can't seem to get back on the exercise train.

Where is the logical end? If I start drinking, everything will surely get worse in the long run. But, I don't think I can make it better even if I stay sober. So what's the point. Either way is misery.

I want to drink til I have the courage to permanently end the misery. But, I get so optimistic when I drink. I always feel like I can get sober and turn everything around. But, when I'm sober I can't. FUCK. I'm so fucked, I wish I could disappear.
