I can't deal with my emotionsOne day I am happy. Another day I'm angry then the next day maybe I'll be depressed. Sometimes I'm completely calm and empty with no emotions. It's so stressful because I can't rely on myself. I am diagnosed with bipolar and I have been treated to the extent that modern psychology is capable of. There is no cure. 

One thing that helps is talking/being with girls I like, it completely overrides how I feel. Well I can't count on that because I can't be around a nice girl all the time and I'm a loser and they eventually realize that then they stop paying attention to me. I never actually found that out until recently in my life because I was so bad before treatment that girls didn't want to be around me at all. Then after treatment and medication I improved and I can get a little attention but I haven't improved enough. 

Mood swings can make me intolerable, hard to figure out, and sometimes I become an asshole and run my mouth. I still have moods where I am happy and make people laugh but I guess not enough to offset the negative. I'm lonely and I'm tired of all this conflict. I will never know inner peace except for the brief moments where I'm empty and calm. I actually long for those moments all the time. It's almost like not existing at all which is perfect.
