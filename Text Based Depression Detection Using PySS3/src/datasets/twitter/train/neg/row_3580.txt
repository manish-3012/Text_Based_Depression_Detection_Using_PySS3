I need your help with helping out a friendI've been friends with a guy for about 3 years and we live in a huge city. After 10th grade, he moved to another neighborhood and switched schools.  Turns out the place isn't really treating him well and I only found out recently through a Reddit post linked to a another social media account. He talks about his depression and that he wants to commit suicide but doesn't have the strength. I've asked him to hang out tomorrow but I'm not really sure what to say to make him feel better. 

I also happen to have 2 different friends at the same school as he is but they don't know him.  Would be okay if I told them about his problems?
