Lost in the matrixI donâ€™t know whatâ€™s real anymore, I feel like everyone around me is just an experiment to fuck my life up even more. Growing connections has only left me destroyed and empty when they eventually fade away. Nobody in my life can relate to any of these feelings so I canâ€™t talk about it without sounding like Iâ€™m crazy.
