They only care when youâ€™re goneI think about all the time people will miss me when Iâ€™m not around to hear about their problems or give shit advice when Iâ€™m dead. When I was MIA for months none of my friends cared or bothered to check on me. People only care once youâ€™re dead. I am depressed and who cares? My friends donâ€™t, not really. They never call me back but expect me to. I feel so low.
