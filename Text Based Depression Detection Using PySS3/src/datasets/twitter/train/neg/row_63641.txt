I spend all my time researching suicide methodsI'm unemployed and I refuse to work a job that will amplify my depression.

I don't want to work for Walmart, although I'm being pressured by family to take any job so that I don't become a leech on my brother, who would be covering next month's rent.

But I can't live with this shame...But perhaps the people who didn't believe in me might be able to.

I'm tired of running around, doing things for the best interest of others. I'm tired of listening to the advice of others, taking it, and realizing it was never what **I** wanted at all!

And so I instead use my researching abilities, you know, the things I'm good at, to find the most effective way of completely obliterating any form of consciousness this person called myself ever possessed. People will hate me, probably, but I can't feel hate on the other side. I don't have to feel anything. Not anymore.
