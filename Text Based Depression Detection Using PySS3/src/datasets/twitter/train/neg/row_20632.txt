More than a year ago I tried to kill myself and I wish I had fucking succeeded.This earth is a beautiful place but I can't stand being on it any longer. I just want be ground up into dust. I am all out of energy. I wasn't meant to exist and it is clear to me now. The only problem is that I no longer have access to what I need to kill myself ON MY TERMS. IF I AM GOING TO LEAVE THIS WORLD, I JUST WANT IT TO BE PAINLESS. I HAD EVERYTHING I NEEDED AND FUCKED IT UP BY DRINKING TOO MUCH BEFORE HAND.
