Dealing with the fact my biological mother was alcoholic, abused my sister and gave us up for adoption. Dealing with guilt it wasnâ€™t me who went through the hardships.For context, Iâ€™m 16 years of age, my sister, who is 23 was born in Russia to an alcoholic mother who was never sober, ended up beating her up and traumatizing her. Luckily, she put her for adoption where she got lucky and got a good family to live with. She now has a husband and a child of her own. 


I, am 16 years of age. And just recently my sister just got introduced to me. Weâ€™ve been good friends, and I love her. But, Iâ€™ve been feeling guilty it wasnâ€™t I who went through with what she dealt with. I just feel super down, and want to die. Please help me.
