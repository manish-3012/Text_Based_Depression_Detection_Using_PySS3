reoccurring feeling makes me question if it's worth fighting at allthe thoughts just keep coming back. it's like I'll never move on. I'm sick of it. it's me and my brain fucking up and I'm sick of it. I wish I had no one I cared about because then I'd be free to do it and free myself from this feeling. honestly the fact that I feel better then feel like this again and again and again is worse than the feeling itself. the fact that I keep on running in circles is what tires me. at this point I just want to give up and let it consume me because no matter how hard I try I'm always back here and I don't love not care about myself enough to keep going or hope for different results. I'm so done. I'm not broken but I'm probably terminally corrupted and I fucking hate myself for it.
