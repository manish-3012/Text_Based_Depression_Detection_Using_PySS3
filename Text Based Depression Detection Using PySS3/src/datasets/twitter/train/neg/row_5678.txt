I think I'm almost ready to commit suicideWith each passing day I feel myself growing stronger. The fear isn't as strong as it used to be. I don't whether I want help anymore. I hate when I don't get help and I hate when people want to help. I'm all mixed up and just don't understand what I want anymore.
