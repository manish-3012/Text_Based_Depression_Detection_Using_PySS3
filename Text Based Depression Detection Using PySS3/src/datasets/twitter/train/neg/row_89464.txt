Trapped, mother is losing her mind. I think this is the end.I live in a hotel with my mother, sibling and father. We have lived in a hotel for a year because my mother is controlling and has crippling anxiety, and she won't move into any houses because none are good enough for her. We only have one car, but I go to work, she goes to work, my dad works and my brother goes to college. We all agree that my mom is continuing to destroy us but we have no money to move out. Even if we did, I would need a car to get to and from work and school and I have no money for that. Actually, I don't even think I'll be able to afford school. My brother doesn't have a job, and I don't know if he'll be able to get one. I also have a chronic illness and spend all of my work money on copays for doctors and medication.

We are trapped because of my mother. And there is no way out. I think I'm going to end it tonight because I've had it. She has made my life absolutely miserable.
