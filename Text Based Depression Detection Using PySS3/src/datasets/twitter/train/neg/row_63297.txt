I can't go on living anymore.. herpes?First off I lost the love of my life.. she's already moved on so fast and I'm sulking in bed emotional as hell. I can't workout , I can't get out of bed, I can't eat. Then I get a phone call from the doc.. it's my STD test results I have herpes.. now I have to tell my ex about it. If I've given them to her I'll never be able to live with myself. I didn't know.. I've been suicidal for a while but this last thing pushed me over the edge. I'm hopeless.
