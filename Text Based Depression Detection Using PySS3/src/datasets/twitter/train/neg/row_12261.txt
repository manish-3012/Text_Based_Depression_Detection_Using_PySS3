Earlier today I was told "I wouldn't care if you went and killed yourself."I just really feel like shit, even as I'm outraged at how heartless my boyfriends mother is (She's the one who told me that). But on the bright side, I found out why she's been so hateful towards me for the last 4 years. I could use a distraction from the direction my mind is heading, so if anyone want to talk about anything, I'm open for that.
