what am I supposed to doI want to die so bad... Well maybe it's more like I want to have a new life maybe. Yeah, I want to kill myself and be reborn as the person I wish to be.

My only fear is what if there is nothing? What if it's just oblivion. Once you die there nothing at all, no feeling, just dead. I mean I guess if that were true I wouldn't be aware when I die but to be honestly I believe that there's such an extremely slim chance of there being nothing. I feel like there's an outside force, other universes, things I couldn't even dreannod seeing here.

I still can't bring myself to kill myself, I don't even know why. Maybe it's because there's stuff I love still, but why can't I just plan to love it in my next life? I don't understand at all.If I could release myself from my unhappy life into a new, possibly better one, why can't I bring myself to do it? I've gotten so close before so why can't I do it this time?
