I hate who I amI have had depression for so long I feel like it's hollowed out who I am. I put on a facade everyday to "fake it til you make it". I've tried eating better, exercise, depression meds, counseling, etc. Nothing helps. I'm just surviving day to day, struggling to get out of bed and put on the next show. I get my work done, but nothing feels meaningful. Even things I used to like. I feel like I just infect people with negativity if I'm my true self and tell people how I feel. Depression is who I AM now. I don't want to live like this anymore.
