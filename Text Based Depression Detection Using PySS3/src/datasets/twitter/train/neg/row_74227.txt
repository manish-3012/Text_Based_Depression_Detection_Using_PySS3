TomorrowI've confirmed that I cannot trust anyone in my life. My first attempt, ten years ago, failed. I've done enough research to have a better chance this time. I am afraid of the physical pain but am done wondering why no one loves me enough to treat me with respect. They say they love me and then they lie to me and talk about me behind my back. The thought that people would care if I died was the only thing keeping me alive. My mom will be sad but she is dying from stage 4 pancreatic cancer so not for long. I wish anyone would know the impact they've had on me but I know that 13-reasons-why bullshit is unrealistic. I could do it tonight but I don't want my boyfriend to wake up next to a dead body and I don't want my roommates to have to deal with one, either. So tomorrow morning I will wake up, drive to my destination, and take my own life. I will not leave a note because if I did leave one it would mostly just be telling people how shitty they are and how I shouldn't have wasted my time with them. They don't need to read that. 

I hope y'all are having a better night than me.
