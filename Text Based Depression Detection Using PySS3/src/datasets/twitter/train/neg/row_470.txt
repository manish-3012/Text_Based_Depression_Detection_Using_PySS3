Im confusedI'm confused with my suicidality because at want one point I feel suicide is inevitable but then it lowers down a little and I seem to be a little fine

And small things like Some people on the internet saying the average black persons IQ is 85 and it pisses me off because i know a shit ton of black people with the IQ of 130-150  

Another thing Is small stuff like being late to school
In the middle of taking the bus to school Its already 8:00 I just think stuff like

"God why was I made at all what is my purpose and why can't I die"

I dunno just a stupid rant that's all thanks for reading if you got past the third paragraph hah
