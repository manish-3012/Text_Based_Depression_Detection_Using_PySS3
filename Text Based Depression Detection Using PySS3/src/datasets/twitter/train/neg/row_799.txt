Don't know what to doOver the past week my mind has been in turmoil, I just can't seem to shake the idea that I would be so much better off not existing. I don't sleep because my mind is so active trying to think of the best way to kill myself, and when I manage to get a bit of sleep my dreams are all horribly violent scenes of my death. 
I keep wanting to talk to someone but I know I'm a burden to everyone around me so there's no way they'd want to hear what I have to say. Every day I have to force myself to get out of bed and go about the day but my thoughts leech into everything I do. 
I looked into counselling at my university but it has at least a 5 day wait until they get back to you and I'm scared of what will happen between now and then. I really don't know what to do.
