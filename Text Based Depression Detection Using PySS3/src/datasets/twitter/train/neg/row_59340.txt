Iâ€™m in pain, confused...I donâ€™t think I want to kill myself. I just think about wanting to die.

I have so many feelings but i still feel empty. 

I am really confused about who i am, i really donâ€™t know. And it makes it even worse, my lack of identity.

I donâ€™t know what to do, i feel like i just want to vent
