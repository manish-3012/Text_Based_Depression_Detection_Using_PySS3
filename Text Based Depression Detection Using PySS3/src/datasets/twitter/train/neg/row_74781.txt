My best friend just left me...He literally meant everything to me. I have no one else but him. He's my whole world, he's my soulmate, my person, my very best friend in the whole world and I loved him with every bit of my heart...

And he left, and I think he never really cared about me in the first place.

i give up.

i'm going to end it soon
