I wish I could give up my life for someone else.I was watching some dumb documentary about hostages, like long term ones and it got me thinking how I'd like it if I was in a position to swap places with someone who really wanted to live but was sick or in some other peril. Or like be in a mass shooting and save a bunch of people by drawing the fire or something. 

Something so that I could feel useful. Not just be a body for the coroner to collect.
