PainThe pain of being unloved and lonely is not measurable... 

My depression ruined my life
 I wanted to higher study but due to bad performance I couldn't make it...

Living a life I hardly  deserve...

Just pain.... no one even out there to support me emotionally...JUST WAITING FOR DEATH TO EMBRACE ME... Can't bear the pain anymore....

People are so judgemental here on the web... I couldn't even share my feelings freely.  Someone out there always to judge me wrong... PAIN


I just wanted some human support, care, love... ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­

Emotionally exhausted and can't breathe
