Feeling anxious, worthless and scared...I have only a few hours to try and calm myself down before a very important day for mine and my small family's future. If it goes badly, I'm surely done with life. 

I have a daughter, who isn't even 6 months old yet, and I am going to court to get a custody battle over with. 

My ex is an abuser, makes me feel small, psychologically damaged my already fragile mind. And psychically abused me. I was scared, so I ddint document most of what happened.

I'm scared I will share my daughter with him, and yet I know I couldn't avoid contact with him if I have to have a 50/50 deal it still is sealing the deal of my much awaited suicide...I knew it would happen sooner or later. 

He's a good dad, but he just resents me for the person I am. An Anorexic drunk who can't function is all I am. Never going to be loved by a man, I will never trust one ever again.

I love my daughter and I can't leave her behind, but I feel like she will be better off without me...sitting here with tears in my eyes and just filled with pain. I hope I can keep my mouth shut in court and let my lawyer help me out. I can say what I want about him but no definitive proof of the damage he's done. I have no idea what he will say about me....I'm not excited...

If I end up leaving this world, I hope he knows that he's the sole purpose for it. I can only be torn down so much. And I'm at my wits end.
