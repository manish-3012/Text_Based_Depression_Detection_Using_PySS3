Trying to decide whether to kill myselfTitle says it all.

I'm a failure at everything I want, and I'm a burden on everybody in my life.

I'm extremely tempted to kill myself, so that I can finally stop suffering. The *problem* is that I'm terrified of the permanency of my actions. If I kill myself, then that's it. There's no more anything forever and I don't get another chance. But on the other hand, living is horrible, so wouldn't non-existence be preferable? It's so difficult to make up my mind.

I know that nobody here would ever act as a *truly* unbiased party in this kind of thing, but I don't know. If I tell anybody in real life that I'm really considering suicide, they'll send me back to the psych ward on a legal hold. I just don't know what to do.
