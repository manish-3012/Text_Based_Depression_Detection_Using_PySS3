I donâ€™t know if I can do it anymore, you know? If itâ€™s worth it?Hey... I found this through raised by narcissists if that tells you anything.
The longer Iâ€™m stuck here, living with them, trapped by this pandemic but more broadly by money and fear... the worse itâ€™s getting inside my head. Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t even recognize myself.
The last couple months Iâ€™ve been struggling on top of that with some traumatic sexual abuse memories from a prior â€œrelationshipâ€. I buried that shit deep, and now under the stress, itâ€™s like the box I had it cramped into has broken. Last week, my partner of 3 years who has been my rock, been there through alot of shit... well, I started crying while we were intimate and then later kinda lashed out at them because I was freaking out, confused and scared as fuck. I regret it. Theyâ€™d never hurt me. It feels like sometimes the past and present are getting tangled up.  They, from my poorly worded words, think that Iâ€™m accusing *them* of rape... I feel like weâ€™ve had a big misunderstanding. 
This week... I just. Iâ€™m not sure where it goes from here. The idealization has been getting so much worse these last few months; lately it seems like itâ€™s daily or hourly. Iâ€™ve been gathering up medications. The needle Iâ€™ve been scratching my arms lightly as to not leave noticeable marks isnâ€™t enough anymore. I deserve more pain.  Iâ€™ve been thinking about how to do it; take all that medication at once? Drink as many shots of hard liquor as I can and hope I donâ€™t wake up? A knife? Or scissors, they seem more accessible. 
It seems like all I do is hurt people. And maybe this would hurt people too, but one last hurt? Then itâ€™d stop and I wouldnâ€™t be an issue anymore, you know? 
My fucked up brain has managed to push away one of the last few, few people that gave a damn about me.
My parents havenâ€™t noticed; theyâ€™re too wrapped up in themselves. Theyâ€™re mostly mad that Iâ€™m sleeping more and eating less. Pushing food past my lips makes me cringe a bit.
Maybe theyâ€™re right you know? Maybe *I* am indeed the crazy/ disfunctional one. Am I bipolar? Manaic depressive? The result of my environment?

It doesnâ€™t seem to matter anymore. Life feels like a burden I donâ€™t want to carry much longer. 

I didnâ€™t know where else to get this out.. so.. there.   Sorry for the swearing..
