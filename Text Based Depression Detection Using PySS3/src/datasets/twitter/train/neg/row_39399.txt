Hope For The Day
Iâ€™m in a different place now.
A one where I know Iâ€™m not totally okay.
A one where I know that Iâ€™m still healing.
But thatâ€™s just it.
I am healing.
And Iâ€™m getting better each day.
Even if I donâ€™t realise it at the time.
I am.
And Iâ€™m starting to become grateful for everything in my life.
And Iâ€™m not going to lie.
There are still days where I feel like I canâ€™t cope anymore.
Days where I just want to end it all.
But then I go into work.
And I see all the amazing people around me.
And I see how lucky I am.
Because at the end of the day people have it worse than me.
And Iâ€™m so grateful for everything I have at this moment in time.
And I will cherish it forever.
Because I know at some point in the future.
I can look back and say.
Yeah I was having a shitty time.
But I still found love and friendship.
And joy.
In the smallest things.
And itâ€™s those moments that count the most.
Those moments that will stick with you forever.
So to everyone around me.
I am forever grateful.
And I hope I have the courage to share this all with you some day.
