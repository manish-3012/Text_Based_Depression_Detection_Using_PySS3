I had this idea last week to kill myself on my birthday.Iâ€™m having another anxiety attack. I donâ€™t why but I seem to be having this more often.

I had this idea last week to kill myself on my birthday (this coming Sunday). Iâ€™ve reached the point wherein Iâ€™m 50% sure Iâ€™m gonna do it. Iâ€™m glad that thereâ€™s the remaining 50% to talk me out of it.

I have no one to talk to. I donâ€™t want to become a burden to my friends. Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re tired of hearing my rants. I need to pretend to be strong for someone special to me who is also not okay. I need to keep this facade that Iâ€™m okay.

But reality is slowly creeping back to me and Iâ€™m not sure I can handle it this time.
