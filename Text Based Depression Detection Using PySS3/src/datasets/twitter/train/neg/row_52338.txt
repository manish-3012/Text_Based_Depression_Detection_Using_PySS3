Aboriginal Canadian Date 5/16/2019Current Living with my mother after having two suicide attempts, last year.
I have no real job experience, i'm socially introvert.
Being terrified of people because of the past has lead me to committing suicide
I was severely tortured when I was 5-6 years the bastard used to chain me up in the basement, poured hot/cold water on me while was naked, burned cigs on me if I looked at him. later he would punch me in areas.
After my mom would leave he would do that.
Tried telling her she just wouldn't listen or I was just to afraid.
After that everything just spiraled down
school was just the same.
bullied by my peers and bullied by my family members.
After that I finally realized I didn't belong anywhere .


I'll be living by myself next month.
I have no real compassion or real hobbies.
The only thing that really kept me interested is climbing.
But I can't afford that lifestyle.
Sometimes It takes awhile to convey how I feel, or think.
 Anyways Have fun in the rat race.
