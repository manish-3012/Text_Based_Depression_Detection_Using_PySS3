Kind of suicidal, but not really if that makes any senseI hate myself because I'm lazy and unmotivated. I dont think I suffer from actual depression because I have friends and family who care about me, and I dont really have any real problems in my life aside from the fact that I feel like I'm wasting my life, and yet I can't help but think about how much easier it would be if I just offed myself almost every day, but at the same time when I think about it I also think about the people I would be hurting in doing so, so I don't go any further than thinking about it. Has anyone else felt like this, and does it ever go away?

PS. Sorry if I'm using up space on this subreddit that could be used by people with more substantial issues, if so I'll delete this post
