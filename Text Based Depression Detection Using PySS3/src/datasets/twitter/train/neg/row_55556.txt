its time*hello, its me again. i did not end my life on the date previously mentioned. thank you all for your words of comfort and wisdom. however it is now my time. my time to move on from what i consider my life now. im ready to transition my state to whatever lies ahead. this might come as sadness to those who were rooting for me, but please find solace in the fact that i will be free. i will be able to take a deep breath and never suffer again. the date is set and my plan is drafted, this is well thought out and meticulous to the last second. i hope you can all understand my choice and accept my movement to a new state. have a good day.*
