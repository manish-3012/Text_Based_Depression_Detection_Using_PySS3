My girlfriend is Suicidal and I'm the only one that knows about it. What do I do?A month ago I found out my girlfriend(age 17) was suicidal. I knew about her depression but I didn't know she was actually suicidal. I had plans for a while to see her today. She had a really bad breakdown last night, she felt helpless and couldn't breathe. She had really bad suicidal thoughts and didn't want to be alive. When I saw her today she was really out of it. She didn't talk at all, wasn't able to smile or anything. When her other friend showed up, she put on a fake smile right away and started smiling. I also noticed that she had fresh cuts on her wrist (she used to be addicted to cutting). Later on when I talked to her she told me she was going to attempt it but I stopped her because I forced her to see me today even though she didn't want to leave her house. I don't know what to do anymore. I fell like i'm just waiting for her to do it, I feel helpless and I feel like I can't do anything about it

**Before anyone says anything, I can't go to her parents they are the cause of everything. She refuses to let me tell anyone. I've offered to take her and pay for therapy. Telling school about it isn't an option**
