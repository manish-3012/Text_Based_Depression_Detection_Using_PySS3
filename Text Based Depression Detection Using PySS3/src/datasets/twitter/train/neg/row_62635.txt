iâ€™m so alone i donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to get betteri feel like no matter where i go i canâ€™t keep friends. i canâ€™t be happy no matter what and nobody will truly love me. itâ€™s hard to convince myself itâ€™s going to get better at this point and all i can think about is how iâ€™m going to kill myself
