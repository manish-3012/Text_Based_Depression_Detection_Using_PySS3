Well, I'm ill, but I'm not dead. And I don't know which one I'd prefer..Yeah, I just quoted a song because I'm too uncreative and shit to come up with a title. Also, I'm so tired, and I can't really type properly.

Really, though, I'm not exactly an imminent suicide threat. It's just, 8 months ago, I was in hell, and I attempted suicide and was addicted to shit. Then I got a beautiful girlfriend who was also my best friend. And now my girlfriend and I broke up and now I want to die. I mean, I wanted to die during our relationship too. But I had a reason not to. Now i don't. And I'm so tired I just want to sleep forever. I'm sorry for wasting your time.

Edit: I may have driven people away by saying I'm tired. I'm still here. I'm going to be for at least 3 more hours. I really don't want to relapse 3 times this week I've been doing so well. I know I'll go too deep.

Edit Two: Do you ever have those nights where you're alone in bed and yore thinking about everything that's ever happened I your life and how its shapped and molded you? I used to think people that had depression were melodramatic. Then when I had depression I thought people that threatened suicide over girls were dumb. Now I'm here. I don't want to be. I don't even want to be alive. It's not even losing her its losing everything. I can't keep doing this.
