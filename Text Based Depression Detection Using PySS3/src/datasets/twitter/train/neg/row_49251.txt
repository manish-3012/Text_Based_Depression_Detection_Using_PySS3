I've been thinking about... It... All night but I'm 100% certain I'm to chicken to actually do itI've been having strong thoughts about it but I know without a doubt that I won't actually do anything to hurt myself. I'll sit for hours picturing the different methods, the results of those messages. Weather or not to take my secrets with me or to let them all out in hopes I won't be missed... But that's all they are is thoughts. Even looking at an item that I once played with the idea of makes me uncomfortable... My question is, are thoughts something that I should go to the hospital about or. Find comfort in my own cowardice and let the hospitals deal with those in actual danger I don't want to go to one... But I don't want to let things get worse
