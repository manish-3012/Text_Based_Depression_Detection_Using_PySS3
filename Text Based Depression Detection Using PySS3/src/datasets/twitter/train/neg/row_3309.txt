Goodbyes are differentIf I was dying of physical cancer or a microbial disease my few goodbye notes would be cherished and appreciated. There would be comforting and supportive responses. Compassionate feedback and mutual appreciation for each other. 

But saying a respectful appreciative goodby when leaving early by choice? Silence or actual insults. 
Its fine. Once you reach a certain mindset- its just curious that people judge suffering and can be so thrown by the stigma programmed mostly by hypocritical religions since childhood. It is my life, my suffering. I am not weak nor am I a coward nor reaching out to for attention nor intervention. 

Ultimately their opinions dont matter and I am just being polite and appreciative and honest. Perhaps they will remember me kindly since I cared enough to transition them to avoid a shock and to resolve anything. The dichotomy is bizarre.
