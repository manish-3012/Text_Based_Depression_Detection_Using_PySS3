I just need to write this outI have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm so upset I don't know what to do or who to talk to. So I'm on the internet. I'm a piece of shit and affected people so negatively, I don't even know how to deal with it. That's never what I wanted or intended and somehow it still happened. I don't think I could ever do anything to myself because that would be even more selfish and stupid and cause so many more problems, but honestly the fact that I know it's not even an option is somehow worse to me and makes me wish I could do it even more. There's really no answer.  

I don't even want some happy amazing life at this point. I just want a normal boring life. Every day I wake up feeling sick and terrified and I have to live with the fact that it's my fault. Even posting this feels selfish but I just don't know what to do with myself.
