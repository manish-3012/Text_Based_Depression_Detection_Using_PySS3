just adviceThis is very random post ok? I'm not thinking about suicide seriously yet but I consider that option.
I've lost my job 3rd time in last 2 years (in IT) so that means I'm just shit. Ok fine. I'm working in IT for over 20 years and thats it. Top of my capacity. I'm not able to be better than others so probably I'm not able to work in IT anymore. I have no idea what else I can do. Dog walking? Burger selling?

Have mortgage and family to feed up (and rly good insurance). How can I save their future and resolve my problems?

(I'm IT on untraceable connection so my insurance company will never find this post)
Sorry for spelling and gramma mistakes English is my second language.
