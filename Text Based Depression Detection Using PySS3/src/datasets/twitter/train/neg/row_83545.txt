I'm done...I give up, I'm done with life. I'm being overwhelmed by sadness and the feelings of futility. My GF won't see me because I'm an essential employee and have to go to my government job every day, while she hides at home with her kid, fearing that the Covid will kill them. My brother and sister-in-law each make more on unemployment than I do going to work every day. I can't do anything because nothing is open, so I have no way to blow off any steam and unwind. There is no point anymore. I have an appointment on Saturday at a gun shop to go look at and hopefully purchase a fine new weapon so I can fire it just once... Right into my open mouth. This world's stupidity amazes me. I'm glad I won't be around to see how bad the next 30 years are.
