Suicide prevention hotlineAlright so hello world, 
my brain doesnâ€™t work like yours does most likely.
Almost two weeks ago I hit my head on a chair repeatedly trying to cause excessive brain damage or death; clearly didnâ€™t work. Tonight I tried to hang myself. I used an old apron I had from work and tied it around my ceiling fan after a terrible encounter with a former lover.  

It wasnâ€™t that that set me off.

What set me off is me reliving my past that has hurt me many times and all I do is try to relive it. As if I wanted to feel it again; feel anything again; even if itâ€™s painful. And trust me, it was. 

I got on the phone with the suicide prevention hotline and the woman who answered was clearly over it before I got a whole sentence out.

â€œOk, so whatâ€™s wrong with youâ€ 

She said in an aggressive, agitated tone.

I understand, we all work a lot, were tired. But this is a suicide prevention hotline and I didnâ€™t feel comfortable telling you the time of day.

Thank GOD my friend was up and talked me through it. Iâ€™m not ok, who knows if I will be. But god damn, 

fuck you too.
