It's back and UnwelcomedIt was two days... it lasted two days of being fine but now the thoughts are back. It's turning me into a bitter person. Like idk why. I just don't want to die but I don't want to exist and I am dying inside. My head is like a prison. I don't want to end it but I can't help fantasize it.. it's sick and I really don't have anyone to talk to about it. No one knows and if I told them (friends and family) they wouldn't be able to handle it. I am the rock.
