Bound to happen eventually?I don't feel an urgent need to kill myself, but lately I keep getting the feeling that one of these days I'm just gonna have to do it.  Like it's pre-determined.  

Does anyone else ever feel this way?

I hope I can fight it off but I feel that ultimately I will lose this battle with my mental illness.
