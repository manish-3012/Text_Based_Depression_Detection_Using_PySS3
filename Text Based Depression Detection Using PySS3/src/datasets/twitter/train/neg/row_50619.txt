I can't take it anymoreI am unable to do this anymore. Everything that has happened during my life has just been a slippery slope leading to more and more suffering. The medication that I'm on is not working, I'm still bipolar as all hell, and it's just getting worse and worse. Like it is actually fucking horrible, one week I might be gazing at the stars, drawing, studying, playing guitar and functioning like a human being, and the other I'm stuck in bed for the week. I have friends but they all mostly ignore me and hang out with other people so I only have a few people who I regularly hangout with.

The main reasons for my suffering are the fact that I was bullied for 10 years straight, I had abusive parents (their divorce hurt aswell). Also the fact that I've lost a few close friends, one way or another. One of my friends committed suicide a month ago, that's been painful too.

I want to end my life, but I'm unable to do so. Maybe it's because I'm too much of a pussy, maybe it's because I had to see the suffering caused by my friends death, maybe it's because I still have those weeks where everything shines and life feels okay. I really don't know anymore. I guess the results of my exams will tell me whether I keep trying to survive or just jump off a building.
