17yr old High School drop outI'm too stupid to get a GED and both my parents have told me i'm a failure. I don't see the point in staying at my parents home after 18 because i'm not capable of going to school and I am starting to dislike certain family members. However my mom said if i move out at 18 she'll see me as even more of a failure. My job sucks i'm single i dont have a car and i'm too scared to start dating again cause i dont want people to find out im a dropout... Lately i've been planning on ending it.I am reminded everyday that i'm the family fuck up, and that i am too stupid to know what i want
