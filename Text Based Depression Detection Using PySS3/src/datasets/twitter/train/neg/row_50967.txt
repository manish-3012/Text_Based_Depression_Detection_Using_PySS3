I've been behaving really recklesslyI know it's fucked up and it's one of a billion reasons why I hate myself but I do things like close my eyes while driving or turn the headlights off of it's dark out, or drive way too fast, drive in the wrong lane etc.


It's "only" ever for a few seconds until I snap back to reality (mom's spaghetti) but I've found it happening more frequently
