I honestly don't feel that suicide has to be this abhorrent, pinnacle of despair type thing.Why can't it just be viewed as "logging out"? My character sucks and I'm bad at the game, therefore why play? 

I grew up Christian and have even been on numerous missions all over the world, preaching, baptizing, you name it. I'm 24 now and about to finish college however I'm realizing that I don't believe there is any life after death. The more this has been settling in my mind, the more it seems like a viable choice. Like the memes I see however, I cannot go until my mom does. She's the sweetest, most loving person I've ever met and it would ruin her unfortunately.
