I just want to be loved...more.  By strangers.  I am loved by a ton of people.  But I am selfish, and I want to be loved MORE.  From newer DIFFERENT people.  I can't stop it.  So in my 20's, I used to fill that void on the internet, meeting girls and having these fake online relationships where they would "fall in love with me", and it was the biggest ego boost ever blah blah blah. One of those girls I fell madly in love with and she broke my heart and I haven't been the same since.  Oh by the way, I was (and am) married with children during this entire time.  Now, in my 30's, I don't have the desire, drive or even ability to facilitate those types of ego boosts anymore.  I've lost it.  My mating dances don't work anymore, I'm used goods.  So now I don't have the influx of love and admiration and affection and desire from NEW people who DIDN'T already know me who were STRICKEN by something about me that they really liked.  And it really helped.  Waahhh wahhh, I know poooooor me.  Trust me, from the outside looking in, I'm like wahh wahh poor me too - it's all RIDICULOUS!  It's immoral, it's selfish, it's everything bad.  It's dishonest, I'm a liar, I am a cheater, I am a self-centered hedonistic PLEASE ME AND PLEASE ME NOW OR I WONT BE HAPPY piece of shit.  And so it's beCAUSE of this that now, more than ever before, the thought of taking my 12-gauge out to...I don't even know where..somewhere with meaning...is appealing with increasing and alarming frequency.  Why don't I do it?  Mainly the kids.  And I'm a pussy.  And I feel guilty enough as it is being the failure of a husband and father already, that giving my kids the badge of "OH AND HE ALSO KILLED HIMSELF" would be just too much.  But entropy insists that my grip weakens...

TLDR: Wahhh wahhh I have a wife and kids and people that love me but its not good enough I want strangers to adore me and they dont so I want to kill myself
