Under alot of stress and pain and could use some help.Over the past 2 months I've been feeling really shit. Not sad just shit. I've never related to the lyric, "I feel so goddamn empty." More. 

I dont understand where it's coming from but it's most likely that I'm 17 and my whole family is now emigrating from South Africa, where I live to the UK. although I feel no resentment towards this and I'm fine with moving in my head I must be disliking it or something cause recently it became very real and it's making me spiral mentally.

I have no friends cause once they learned I was moving to the UK they all carried on with their school lives and forgot about me cause I'm not attending due to the move. I originally told my one friend I'm depressed and my eating has gone out the window to a point where I'm lucky if I eat 2 sandwiches in a day. I'm not insecure, I'm not sad, I'm not angry and I'm not vengeful or spiteful towards my parents. I know I'm loved but I just feel so empty. As if nothing matters, not even my life.

My friend I originally told said to tell her if I got suicidal which I have had many I dont want to be here thoughts and done some dumb things like swallowing lots of pills like mybulen and stealing my moms antidepressants and taking them in excess but I did it just to feel something. Not to die. I dont want to take my life but I dont want to exist. I feel like I'll never amount to anything and nothing matters or ever will.

I'm sure I could find more to write about but it's not coming to mind right now, just looking for some advice other than it will get better cause that's what everyone says so I guess I have no choice but to believe it. Thanks bye.
