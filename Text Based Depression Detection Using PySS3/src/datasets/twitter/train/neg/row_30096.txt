Dearest....To my hero,
   When you found me again after I was taken from you and I was sexually abused I was 3 and you rescued me, when I was 10 you returned me and I was abused again and again you came and got me. When I was 16 I was abused again and this time you told people it didn't happen I was liar. It hurt so bad and I wondered if you thought I wanted to be tied up for 3 days and left for dead...but I carried on and I tried to prove to you that I was not the kind of person who would anything like that....I went to school and was getting A's and you told me how proud you were of me and then while I tried to support my friend and go to a play to see her cousin be in we were hit by car...I woke up and they told me I wouldn't walk again and you were there by my bed..... but when it was time for me to come home you said there is no wheelchair room in my house and you made me go and stay with my friend who was also a victim in the crash and for months she changed my diapers, showered me I tuned 18 at her house, and 3 months latter I was pregnant with my first son.... you said you would support me when he came but as soon as i learned to walk again i came to your house and 1 month latter you threw me out just to give me the money to get my place...when you told me maybe i wasn't ready to be a mom i said ok and gave you my son, who you told me I need to take care of my responsibilities when he started kindergarten because he was a bad kid.....but he was only four years old. And now here we are you and i and i have two sons now, and i went to school, and i think i found my dream job and i thought yes now i will make you, my hero, so proud of me.....but you are not you say about time you did it, we're you gonna just live on well fair your life? aren't you ashmed if you were able to do this all this time that you didn't already.....and i thought well actually until now i was really proud of myself....so happy father's day dad it is obvious you don't need me so I think I'll go now. I love you. Bye.
