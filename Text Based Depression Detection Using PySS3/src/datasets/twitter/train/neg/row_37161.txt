What the fuck am I doing?Thoughts of suicide have been in my head for ta while. Hell, I've made plans, preparations, I even wrote a note. I don't really want to live, but apparently don't have the fucking balls to kill myself either. Then there is this friend of mine who is also suicidal and also everything planned out. Only difference between me and him is that he actually has the balls to do it. Why the fuck am I trying to talk him out of it? It's hypocritical of me to do so in the first place, and second of all he goes through shit that makes my problems look trivial as hell. Just what the hell, nothing makes sense anymore.
