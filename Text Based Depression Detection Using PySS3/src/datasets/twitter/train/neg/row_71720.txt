How can i help my best friebd?So my best friend called me today and he said to me that I shouldn't be surprised if I heard that he have commited suicide. Well I don't think he was that serious to actually do it but sure he is thinking about it. I tried to talk to him and make him feel better and asked him to meet tomorrow to talk more since I'm not good at these things I'm not sure what lm gonna say to him. He have many problems,  he lost his girl friend recently,  he failed in his very big exam and so he got kiked out of collage and since he also don't have a job he have a very bad financial situations. 

Please help me how I should make him feel better. And sorry for bad English.
