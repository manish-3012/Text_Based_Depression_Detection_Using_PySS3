Iâ€™m alone. I have no friends. And I want to die, bc I just canâ€™t take this pain anymore.Iâ€™ve always tried to be positive and see the bright side of things but Iâ€™ve taken beating after beating and my life is just shit. I live in a basement. I am unemployed. And I have nothing going for me. Iâ€™m broke and I canâ€™t get myself out of this situation. I hate my life and I just want it to be over. I donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore. It hurts. I no longer have the motivation to even get out of bed.
My relationship with my family is horrible and my parents are getting a divorce. My boyfriend and I just stay in his basement doing nothing for weeks and weeks and my life is just passing by. I canâ€™t take this anymore. I want this all to end.
