A good steak.I have been struggling these past few weeks with the pandemics, but my depression and school are still the worst things in my life. Now Iâ€™m being threatened by my mom and dad to be thrown into a mental hospital for a few weeks till I can get my grades back up(2.1 GPA). But I have finally came up with an explanation as to why my grades suck, and why I spend so much time in my room alone. Here it is:

Thereâ€™s a restaurant that serves a steak that people say is the best in the world. People talk about the texture, the flavor, and it seems that everyone has these great steaks, so I decide to go get one. I sit down at the restaurant and order a steak. While the steak is being cooked I see people eating theirs and falling apart for it, some are eating the burnt sides, and the fat, and still loving it. Once it is delivered I take a piece off and eat it, excited for the flavors everyone has been talking about. There is nothing, no texture, no flavor, feels like Iâ€™m eating wadded you paper. I spit it out and request some sauces. I try all the sauces I can and still the steak tastes the same. My parents tell me to enjoy the steak because mine is better than thereâ€™s but that only adds to my guilt that I still canâ€™t taste this steak. Eventually I discretely go to throw away the steak, but I stop myself and tell myself to chew down one more awful piece to see if itâ€™s changed, it never does and that trash looks so much more tempting now. I want to give up on it... and so far it seems like one day I will prematurely throw away my life, and give up on trying to fix a broken mess. 

Does that make sense now? My life has no meaning and no matter what I try it always seems to just get worse. Ive given up, so please give me a reason to stay before Iâ€™m not even here.
