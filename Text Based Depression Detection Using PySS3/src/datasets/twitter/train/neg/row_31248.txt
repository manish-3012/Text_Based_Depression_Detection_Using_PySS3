Sick and tired of everything.I don't know if I'll ever be able to make myself end it all, but I'm running out of options.

The Wellbutrin makes me feel not so worthless all the time, but the anxiety is still there full force. I don't want to tell my parents how I feel anymore because it doesn't help anything. They know how I feel, my mom worries especially after my admittance to the mental hospital (never ever want to go back there, either). If they could magically find me a job they would. McDonald's doesn't even seem to want to hire me. I know I'm not unhireable because I had a job up at school. Just had to fuck that opportunity up, thanks depression, sickness and unbearably cold weather.

I'm tired of sitting around my parents' house all day. There's nothing for me in this shit small town. I try to keep myself busy through creativity but all my creativity is gone, I don't have the imagination I did when I was a kid. Or even if I think of something to make, my limited programming skills stop me from progressing. It feels like every time I try to learn it just goes right through me or I'm unable to apply it.

Furthermore, every little thing sets me off now. I hate seeing shit about people in relationships. Even if something is only tangentially related. Like I'll see something about birth control and immediately the invasive thoughts come: "Yeah, like I'll ever need to worry about that." Stuff like that.

I'm living in constant pain, which my medicine makes me forget about every once in a while. Everything seems cloudy, I spent an hour the other day convincing myself to take a shower. I don't want to do anything because nothing seems worth the effort.

I'm going to end it soon if nothing changes.
