Done living for other people and in general igIâ€™m so tired of living my life so other people can use it all the time. I have no control over what I can and canâ€™t do, itâ€™s built up to the point where the only choices I have with my life is to run away or kill myself. Otherwise everything else is â€œplanned out.â€ I canâ€™t wear sweaters because I should be â€œproud of my bodyâ€, despite only looking how I am as a byproduct of my depression. I like sweaters because theyâ€™re comfortable. I hate my family and canâ€™t get any help from them, especially with mentally abusive teachers and coaches, because they want me to tough it out. Iâ€™ve been toughing it out for 3 years now and Iâ€™m fucking sick of it. Call me a pussy if you want, I quit.
