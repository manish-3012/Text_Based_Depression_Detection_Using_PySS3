No moreHi
So my entire life has been one screw up after another. I steal and I drink, take drugs and commit fraud. I do not know why though. I've been brought up right and have a lovely and caring family, but for some reason I get in this fuck everything mode I will do absolutely anything without a second thought of consequences. And now finally, or after two failed suicide attempts, the shit has hit the fan once more. I managed to get myself involved in a telephone fraud in which I went around different electronics stores and.took out 7Iphones and a mac book pro on credit, all in my name and the bills are just raining down on me, I do not know why I did it, just the fuck it mode raping my life over and over, and I am calling it quits now
