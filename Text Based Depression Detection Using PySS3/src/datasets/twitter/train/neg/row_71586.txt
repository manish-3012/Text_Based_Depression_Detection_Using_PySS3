What can I do about hopelessness?I think my biggest problem is that I can't find a single thing to be hopeful about. 

The experience I have of life is that I will never have anything I care about or work for. I will fail and lose out on everything. 

All I ever wanted was to be cared about. No one cares. 

I need help, but no one listens. 

Life is impossible without hope, but there's no reason for me to hope. Hope has been useless. Nothing I ever wished for, wanted, or hoped for ever came to pass.
