I donâ€™t know what do anymoreItâ€™s been awhile since Iâ€™ve felt this shit. Iâ€™m a 21 year old college student and I canâ€™t take living anymore. I entered college as a health science major in the hopes of one day becoming a doctor to maybe try and help people anyway I can. Iâ€™ve had some terrible depression for a few years now but during my freshman year of college my life felt pretty good. Everything was new and I could reinvent myself but I fucked it all up. Within half a year into my freshman year I cut out almost everything, social life, personal life, personal health, pretty much everything so I could focus on studying hard and trying to get good grades. It didnâ€™t work, no matter how much I try I do terrible in my classes and I have nothing to show for it. These last few weeks have been even more stressful then normal and I canâ€™t take it anymore. I gave up my friends and relationship with my family, my personal health as Iâ€™ve gained almost 50 pounds and no longer exercise or eat anything aside from shit food. I feel like Iâ€™m slowly dying from the stress of class and work along with my worsening physical and mental health. I feel so trapped in life and I just see that the only way Iâ€™ll ever get out is by just dying. No matter how hard I try I can never shack the depression and suicidial thoughts. Iâ€™ve tried both medication and therapy to little avail. Iâ€™ve wasted my life and just want this all to stop now.
