Tried to walk in front of a bus today.I've been feeling this way for well over a year. Knowing that I could end it all at any minute is the only thing that has kept me from going insane. Today I tried to walk in front of a bus, but someone pulled be back on the the foot path and told me to be more careful. I can't stand it any more. It's all slowly overwhelming me, and the rumblings of each passing truck tempt me.
