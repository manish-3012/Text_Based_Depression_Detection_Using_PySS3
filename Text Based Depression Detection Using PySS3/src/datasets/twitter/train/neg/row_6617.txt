What to do when it all failsI've been toying with suicide for along time now it started out more sarcastic but it's gotten more and more as I've gotten older. I have a dog who is my ultimate best friend, my bestest bud and well my only will to live. So sometimes when I get dark my mind wanders and goes to what will happen when my little buddy dies.

Hes been the only thing keeping me alive for so long, I've come so close times before but the thought of what'll happen to him always makes me double think what I'm doing.

I'm scared for when I am alone and wont have that safety net to potentially stop me
