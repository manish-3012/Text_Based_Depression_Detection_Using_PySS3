Approaching the endI can't hold out much longer I really wish there is a reset button and I could just redo my life. I'm sorry for being a waste of space.
Ha who am I kidding I'll just almost do it or not do it well enough and post on here again in a couple weeks I'm such a piece of crap I'm not even able to kill myself. how pathetic can someone be? I just want to be happy that's it I don't need money, friends, power, sex, love,etc I just want to be happy how can I not be happy it's the one thing in the world I want and it's the one thing I cant seem to have.
I would continue but I don't want to hit the readers with too many words. That last for reading.
