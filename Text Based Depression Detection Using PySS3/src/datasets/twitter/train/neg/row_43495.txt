I think i am a killerhere is my story

I am freshman in collage. I use to call my friend everyday to check up on him since he had suicide thoughts. I use to help every day ,talking to him on a call for 4-5 hours (we lived different countries)but one nights I was tired and went to sleep early and he committed suicide. I killed him. I always end up hurting everyone in my life, I just bring pain to everyone who cares about me. my room doesn't have any thing to hang my self so pls give good suggestions pls I cant live anymore, the pain is to much to bare.
