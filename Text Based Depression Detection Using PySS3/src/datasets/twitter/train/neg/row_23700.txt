Guns are expensive!I mean, who knew? For some reason I figured that the Land of the Free (TM) came with plentiful and cheap guns to finish the job. Turns out that while they may be plentiful, they're hardly cheap. How does anyone afford to kill themselves in America, anyway?

Came home feeling even more sad and useless than before.
