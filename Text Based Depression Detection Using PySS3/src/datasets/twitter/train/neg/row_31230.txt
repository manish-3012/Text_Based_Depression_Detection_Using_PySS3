I'm signing out todayI feel like I should have taken advantage of so many different resources while I had the chance. While I had a chance. only recently decided to make a reddit account to maybe try to get support from some of the subreddits I turn to for help, but as soon as I did I realized it was too little too late for me.

anyways I think it's time to stop prolonging the inevitable. I might stick around until evening, I might not. either way, I hope you all find peace in your lives and keep supporting each other
