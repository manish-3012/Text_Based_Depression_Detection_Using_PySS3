Each year I lost more and more reasons to live and people to live for - I'm about to run outAt this point I'm just someone who is meant to disappear. Suffering so much for the sake of someone else being sad for some time isn't worth all the pain I have to go through. They have multiple people around them, I almost have nothing to lose at this point. It's not a matter of ''if'', it's a matter of ''when'' at this point.
