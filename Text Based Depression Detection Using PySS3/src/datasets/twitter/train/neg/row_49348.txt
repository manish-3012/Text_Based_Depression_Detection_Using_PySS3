I hate being do behind everyone elseI made the serious mistake of being indecisive about what i wanted to do. Because of this i am now 27 and just graduated with an engineering degree. I still do not have a real job lined up. Most people start their real jobs as 21 or 22 year olds. I am a full 5-6 years behind everyone else in terms of career advancement. I am sick of hearing about the Mark Zuckerburgs, Hope Hicks, or Elizabeth Holmes of the world who are highly successful at a young age. 

I know those are outliers but your average 27 year old is doing a lot better than I am. They aren't struggling to find real jobs. They already had them before their 25th birthdays. 

What's even worse is that I am behind with women as well. Not only are most successful guys my age making close to 6 figures, they also are either already married, engaged to their long term GFs or they are having sex/have had sex with dozens of girls. I only had 2 short term girlfriends. Socially I was behind and thus weirded out too many people. 

All of the above had tons of great memories with their buddies. The thing is I barely have anything and by the time I get my social skills up to par it will he too late because I will either be with 30 somethings who are done with the scene or look like that desperate 30 year old trying to relive his youth. 

At this rate I may have to settle for the post-wall sluts of the third set of guys. Most girls over 24 are either engaged, taken, fat, sluts, retarded, mentally ill, or combination of the above. And calling me a misogynist or a redpill piece of shit will just make things worse. 

Hopefully God will give me another chance. I come back as someone else and learn my lessons from this disgusting previous life.
