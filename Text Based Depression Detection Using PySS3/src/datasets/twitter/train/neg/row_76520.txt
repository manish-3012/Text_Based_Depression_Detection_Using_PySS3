Both undesirable choices.Death has never scared me. I find it refreshing and sobering actually, but perhaps that is my inner sociopath/psychopath speaking.

I have lots of anger, the things I found relaxing are no longer relaxing thanks to punishments from my parents, so it just accumulates, things like lies, the fact that my autism won't allow me to pursue the career i wanted, people ignoring me.

I have almost killed people.

I have almost killed myself.

Which do I choose?
