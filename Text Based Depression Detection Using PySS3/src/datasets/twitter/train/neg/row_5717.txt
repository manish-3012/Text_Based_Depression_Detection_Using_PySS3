In between choosing life or death.Hi guys, I'll try to keep this short and simple.

I'm constantly struggling wether to choose to feel sad, anxious, lonely and hopeless or strong and positive.

Sometimes I'm strong enough to choose life but most of the time I'm not, and once I choose to feel down it just goes in a downward spiral that is really hard to run out of.

I need to remind myself to be strong but it's hard, it really is. But I **need** to remember. I don't feel like my time to go is just yet, even when I want to. So that's why I need to help myself to chose life... And it's hard...

Sometimes I caught myself staring at a knife wondering how I would use it to kill myself and in those moments I have two options to either go for it by inertia or shake the thought off. I need to be able to choose the latter but sometimes it's _so hard_. My thoughts take complete control over me like if I was possessed by something and I'm no longer here.

Anyways, I don't know if this is the right sub to post this but I need to keep this straight in my mind. I *need* to live.
