It's funny how life just treats you like shit.22 years old, I have nothing, or so it feels. I know deep down I do have some things, but I am just not happy. I wake up, wanting to die, and this year I finally found someone who understood me and talked me through tough times. Was always there for me. I found some hope.

This week, she just ghosted me. Blocked me everywhere. No reason. No explanation, no goodbye, nothing. After being depressed for a year, finding hope again and having it crushed again for no apparent reason, yeah, I have decided life is not worth it. I wake up, go to the gym, smoke a pack, browse youtube and be sad.

I like people that encourage you by saying; 'it is never too late', truth is, there comes a point where it is. Everybody that supposedly cares leaves after a while, and I do not know why. Just feels like I've always been misunderstood and mistreated.

I can keep going on, eating medicine as candy, wanting to die everyday, but what is the point?  Smoking to reduce stress, bills just keep coming, I am just not happy and will not be happy. Why live in this agony for another 40-60 years?

I hope I have the balls to go through with it, this week. Just for once do something that matters and makes a difference.
