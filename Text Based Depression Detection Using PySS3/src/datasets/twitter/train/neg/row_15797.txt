I have no ReasonI have no reason to kill my self but I still feel the need. Iâ€™m going to school to be a teacher but I feel so dumb and worthless. I live with a family that loves and supports me but I feel alone. My boyfriend is 2,000 miles away but itâ€™s feels still so far. I want to see what happens after we all die. I wish I knew so I wasnâ€™t so alone. I just drink to feel alive. Please let me know that there is something more.
