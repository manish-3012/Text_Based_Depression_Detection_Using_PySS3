Really bad time with break-up and no friends.My boyfriend broke up with me - this was the best relationship I've ever had, except when we had an argument he'd gaslight and he ended things when I pointed out his behavior. This is DEVASTATING and I'm struggling.   


I have no friends at all which means no support to help me through this.   


I am long-term unemployed (I can't see this changing any time soon as I need support due to disabilities, I do volunteer) so I have a lot of time but no money to do things like find new hobbies or meet new people - I actually met my ex via meetup, so even trying to meet new people that way is difficult as he's an active member with lots of friends in one of the best meetup groups and right now going to meetup groups would likely just upset me. To add salt to the wound an old ex from eight years ago, the second best relationship I ever had (I ended it because it went stale and we weren't moving forward after five years together), has just announced he's getting married to the woman he met after me.  


So...

* Bad break-up
* No job.
* No hobbies.
* No friends at all. 
* No future/stuck in the same place in life.
* No job or partner means no children and time is running out.

The break-up is the big factor, everything else just means no way of dealing with that and I'm now sat focused on how bad my life is as well as how incapable I am of making any progress in life after about a decade in a similar situation. 

I am on a waiting list for therapy but it'll be a while yet, I don't find things like suicide helplines etc. helpful, I really need to be around people and to have support to help me actively do something to make positive changes in my life. 

  
I need help but I'm completely on my own in this.
