EmptyNothing in life matters to me anymore. The only people I could ever open up to either are done with me (for good reason because I just ruin everything) or they're too busy making it so if I want to talk I'm basically just butting into their lives and disrupting everything. 

In addition to not having anyone to truly confide it, I hate my job, I have zero prospects, and everything I once found fun is nothing now. No job appeals to me, no hobby works (I've tried to start many). I'm just empty. 

I don't see a fulfilling life for me. Hell I don't even see a decent one. And the best way to make sure those other people, my family and friends, don't have to deal with my constant negative attitude is to leave.
