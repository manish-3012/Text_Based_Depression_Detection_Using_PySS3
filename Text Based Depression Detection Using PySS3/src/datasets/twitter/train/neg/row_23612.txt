Lizard brainHonestly idk why Im writing this. Maybe as a last cry for help and to satisfy my lizard brain for finding reasons to stay alive or whatever. At this point i dont even feel the heat anymore when i press the hot lighter against my skin so it sticks on it. I dont feel shit. My husband left me for the mundane reason that he thought I laughed at him. There is no joy left anymore. I cant even get a psychiatrist in this shithole country. I havent slept in 4 days. Havent eaten. Nothing. My antidepressants dont work anynmore. All my life I have just been used and abused. They finally broke me. Im done.
