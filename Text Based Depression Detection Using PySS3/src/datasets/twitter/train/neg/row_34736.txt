I can't let go of the past.I've had a turbulent relationship with a close friend of mine who was also once my romantic partner. I was a close friend of them once, but I had romantic feelings towards them. They didn't return them, and I was so hurt I ended the friendship. After five months of being angry and afraid of them, I realized that holding onto my anger and anxiety was not good for my health. I apologized to them for acting on my anger, and we forgave each other, in the hopes that we could finally find peace.
To my horror, a few days later, I realized that my romantic interest in them was returning with a vengeance. After gauging their reactions to seeing relationships with two females, I asked them out. (This was before I decided to call them by their preferred pronouns.) They said yes.
We dated for a while, but then something happened. We broke up because we were both afraid of our parents finding out about us. We agreed to end our relationship.
During this whole debacle, I've been feeling suicidal. When they were with their asshole of a boyfriend who even they admit it was a mistake to get with, to when we were walking on eggshells after they broke up, to after our own breakup...
I just want to die. I feel like I'm in their way. I'm only hindering them.
The thing is, I can never bring myself to do it. I've come close, but I've either stopped myself or have been stopped by others.
I don't deserve to live if I can't let go of the past, so why can't I just end it?
