My first post on anythingI have been following several subs daily for a while now. I also wanted to die for many years. I'm 18 now and feel like nothing is worth living for. Spent many days being drunk and wanting to die. I know I won't be able to die with the equipment I have right now. I tried getting help but every feeling I have has stopped me from it. How do I live and is there hope?  (Very sorry for the poor English, I'm from Europe and still learning)
