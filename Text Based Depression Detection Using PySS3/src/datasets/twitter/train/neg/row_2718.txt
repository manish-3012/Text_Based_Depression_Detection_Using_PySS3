Iâ€™ve never thought so strongly about doing it before. I looked up methods and seriously thought about writing a note, sticking it on my door, and locking myself in my room. The only thing holding me back is the thought of how my parents would react.I couldnâ€™t bear to let my parents down like Iâ€™ve let everyone else down but I donâ€™t want to deal with any of this anymore. Iâ€™ve made too many wrong decisions thatâ€™ve hurt me and others and I donâ€™t think I want to live with myself knowing that Iâ€™ve fucked up this much. The one person I want to tell everything to doesnâ€™t care about me and canâ€™t make time for me. I just donâ€™t want this anymore.
