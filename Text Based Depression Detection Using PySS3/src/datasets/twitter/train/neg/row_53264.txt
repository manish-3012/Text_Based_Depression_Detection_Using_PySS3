I'm done.I've spent the past few years fighting depression, I had close family members attempt and springboard me into it. Now at work I'm being told to pretty well ignore everyone that I talk to and have gotten into trouble for it. Then I got into trouble for avoiding everyone. I'm so done and tired of being the worthless piece of shit that I am.
