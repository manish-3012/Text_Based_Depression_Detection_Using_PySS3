URGENT: please help!My good friend is in conversation with his old teenage acquaintance on facebook, and he's saying he wants to kill himself imminently, he has apparently already taken a bunch of liquor and valium. We know what city he lives in, but we don't even have mutual friends that know where he lives. We've notified local police with all the info we know (facebook name, full name, and obviously city), but have absolutely no further information than what I've just provided. Does anyone have ANY ideas?!

My friend is in his mid 20s, and this is an acquaintance from early teen years. He says he has medical problems, and has palpatations/heart issues every night.  He has been dealing with it for 7 years and has given up.


PLEASE PM ME IF YOU CAN HELP OR EVEN BRAINSTORM!
