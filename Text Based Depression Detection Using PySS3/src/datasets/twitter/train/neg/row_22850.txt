Is there really a future to look forward to?My life sucks now. My life will suck later.

People always say to me I'm too young. I should look forward to the future. I have so much potential in this world. If I wasn't so quiet, so nice, I would ask

"What future? What world?"

What world is there to look forward to?

A world where I live in constant fear of being killed or hated on just for the sole reason that I am black? Where I'm constantly berated for being LGBT? Where I'm afraid to go outside of the house while I await the next mass shooting? Where I have to feel and witness the deveststing effects of climate change?

And what about when I _really_ grow up? 

When I have to deal with bills and taxes and politics and even more hate and insurance and jobs and debt and all the other "fun" stuff that comes with being an adult. 

Is that the kind of future you'd want to live in? Is that the kind of world you'd want to look forward to?

And sure, you could say that maybe I'll be the person to change all that. But, be real. I'm not her for optimism. Thousands of people have tried before me, thousands will try after me. Most of them have or will fail miserably.

My life sucks now. Depression... Anxiety... Why would I ever want to continue to live on into the future?
