Thinking about itThrowaway for obvious reasons. I don't even now where to begin. I don''t even
know if this'll make sense becasue my social anxiety disorder prevents me
from making coherent sentences. I'm not sporty/creative and have no
distinct personality. It's like when I think, there's a cloud in
my brain preventing me from being a real person. Why can't I be one of those
people who has a group of friends and can just easily mingle without constantly thinking of the right thing to say.
I have a severe fear of being adversely judged, so as a result, I tried to make everyone happy by adapting
to their personality and now I don't have my own.
I do have friends, but I don't like them, they're all judgemental assholes, and it's not like I can just easily make new ones.
They all agree that I'm a liar becasue sometimes I tell them I'll do something when I don't, even though I changed my
mind last minute, becasue I'd rather do nothing.
I wouldn't even say I'm depressed. I'm just apathetic about pretty much everything, so I stay on the computer all day,
and as a result, I failed ALL my finals because I was too lazy to study. I hate the fact that I'm so lazy.
I have to repeat the entire year now of a course I don't like, and instead of having 2 years left, I'll have 3.
I didn't even bother going to the repeat exams because I knew I'd fail. It's either that or drop out
and work in McDonalds. My mom hates me becasue I'm not the son she expected to bring up. She wanted someone
who was out-going and hard-working. I have literally not felt happiness in years, I don't think
I'm capable anymore. I can only feel apathy and sadness.

Don't bother reading, I just wanted to get that shit off my chest.
