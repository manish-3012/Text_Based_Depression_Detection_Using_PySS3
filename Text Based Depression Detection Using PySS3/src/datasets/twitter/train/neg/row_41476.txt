They are not worth it..THIS IS MY REALM.I slit my wrist 30 days ago.
I've been an alcoholic for 37 years.
I have given them MY ENTIRE LIFE....to make myself try and be happy.

I deserve better than them!

I used to look at the world and feel ALL the fucking pain and suffering.....

Now I realise....they are trying to get me dead....trying to kill me.

I don't WANT to kill myself...I want THEM to go away....but it's not that easy is it?....not like that Dr. Phil....bullshit.

I have to make a choice...it's either their world...or it's mine.

Fuckers....it's my world....

Ask this question.....Who are they?....
