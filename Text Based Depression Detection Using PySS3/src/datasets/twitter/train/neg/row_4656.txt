im so tirediâ€™m tired. living has drained me beyond belief. everything is draining. i feel completely empty and no matter what i do i stay empty. I am always so sad and confused. Im so fucking confused and jts so fucking draining. The people in my life are awesome and they try to help me but i feel bad because it doesnt do anything at all. Nothing works and i stay so bad. I pretend my mood fluctuates but in reality im always in such a bad place. I constantly surround myself with people but feel so alone. Im so stuck , so static. I feel like white noise and i hate it and am so sick of it. Im so disgusted by myself. I feel so inadequate and i just want this end so much. this is a cry for help. I dont know what to do. i want to stop living. i wish i could just stop consciousness
