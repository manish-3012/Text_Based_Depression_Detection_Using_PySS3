Iâ€™m slippingEveryday I feel worse no matter how hard I try I feel so numb to everything but still have extreme panic attacks I donâ€™t know if I can take it anymore. Iâ€™m at a point where I want to try acid and if that doesnâ€™t change my life end it. Iâ€™ve been on every antidepressant that exists, 3 therapists, and anxiety meds. Itâ€™s so stressful to just function I have a 3.9 gpa and every day at school is hell. I miss one day of online school (I havenâ€™t missed a day since freshman year) and my dad goes on about how Iâ€™m never gonna make it and Iâ€™m gonna end up being a mechanic. Idk what to do anymore online school is fucking me up.
