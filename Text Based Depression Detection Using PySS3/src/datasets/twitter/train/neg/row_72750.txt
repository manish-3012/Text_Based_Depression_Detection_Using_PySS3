I want to dieI feel like I am not worthy of living. I just want to curl up and die. My parents just found me crying on my bed and asked me whats wrong. I have lied to them so many times I can't even fathom telling them. I want to but I just can't. I have wanted to kill myself since 5th hrade because I am a lazy sack of shit who can't do fucking schoolwork. I have made my parents cry on multiple occasions. I wish my dad would hit me. I deserve it. I disappoint them over and over and they still care about me. I wish they could catch me doing something that would let them know I want to kill myself. But then I remeber. I am just making a big deal of all of this. I just feel sorry for myself
