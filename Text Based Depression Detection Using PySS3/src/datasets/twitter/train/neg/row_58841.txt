I was always joking about suicide at first.Weather it be joking or not you know that people can take it the wrong way. It's moved from joking to actually tanking my health purposely or cutting deeper than I should. Ya know for results, it started with my first relationship when she cheated on me. Now Its all I can think about, I'm not happy anymore nothing is exciting in my eyes. None of my family checks in on me and it feels like no one cares or can even see the pain I'm going through. Would anyone notice? Would anyone come looking? Who knows, who cares.
