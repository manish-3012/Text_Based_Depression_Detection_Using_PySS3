Just took Prozac and Tylenol PMI took about 15 or so 20mg Prozac pills and like 6.5 Tylenol PMs. I wash it down with a little bit of Capriccio Sangria. This was like 15 minutes ago. I donâ€™t feel anything? Maybe itâ€™s cuz Iâ€™m fat and it wasnâ€™t enough? I have a brand new bottle of Prozac that I could take but I just donâ€™t want to take it all right now.
