Nothing will ever be good enoughYou struggle infinitely and none of it means shit. Only to end in disappointment. I donâ€™t crave external validation or pats on the back, Iâ€™m just fucking tired of inhuman toiling for zero returns. 

My lung disease has robbed me of all joy or rest quite literally, every aspect of my life is dominated by an incurable disease. 

Iâ€™m tired of progress being a worthless, meaningless concept for me. Iâ€™m tired of sacrificing everything to get nothing.
