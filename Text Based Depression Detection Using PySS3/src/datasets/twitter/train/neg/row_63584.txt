Wow nothingness sounds niceIt took drinking a bottle of wine to prevent an actual, full scale, mental breakdown to realize that no one cares as much as they say they do. Like seriously, it took my unfiltered and drunken mind to REALIZE. FULLY REALIZE. THAT NO ONE CARES. 

Like I could actually kill myself and no one would know right now because no one even cares enough to check up on me and ask me how Iâ€™m really doing. Oh, she has a therapist now? She much be magically fine! Her boyfriend dumped her because sheâ€™s a fucking mess and ruined every positive thing in the relationship??? No! Lets just NOT check up on her!! Lets all, collectively as her only support group, pacify every concerning behavior of hers because WE DONâ€™T WANT TO DEAL WITH IT.

Itâ€™s such a joke at this point, and it isnâ€™t even a funny joke. Itâ€™s just a sad joke without a punchline. My therapist doesnâ€™t even think I have a chemical imbalance anymore. That just means Iâ€™m stuck in a horrible life with my horrible self.

Iâ€™m probably just waiting for someone to help fix my shitty life but what else am I supposed to do when Im out of energy, acting like iâ€™m fine.
