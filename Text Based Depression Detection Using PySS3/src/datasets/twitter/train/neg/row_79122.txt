Feeling down. Quit School. Quit work. Court Case in June. I cant go on knowing I will never see her again.I was at a day hospital last week for extreme depression and they asked me about stressors and read out a list of things and I had them all.

I will be homeless at the end of may, I have a court case in the beginning of june which I am guilty of (just in time for my birthday), my father is dying of cancer and liver failure, I failed all of my classes and quit university and I dont want to go back, my anxiety have made me miss work many times and I quit because I cant do my job anymore, my friends have left me because they are tired of my inappropriate and reckless behavior (because I dont care about consequences anymore).

However, the main thing is that I will never see or speak to the girl I love anymore. She hates me. This is all I think about all day long and it feels like a punch in the stomach, all day long without getting better.

How can anyone function under those circumstances?

I plan on walking into the wilderness and never coming back. Come what come may.
