My girlfriend just left me.title pretty much.  Woke up from a nap with her telling me in tears that she was leaving me. Her parents were there to help her pack and leave. She told me it was to hard to be away from family despite loving me (3hrs away)

Having a rough time trying to be strong but my house is just so empty now...
