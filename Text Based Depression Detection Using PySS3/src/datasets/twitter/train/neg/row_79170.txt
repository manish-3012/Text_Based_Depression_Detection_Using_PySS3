I Want to Die and People Are the Problem!Omg! People are the worse! I want to kill myself, right now! I can't stand this bullshit!



Unless you share every brainless opinion as everyone use you get isolated and I'm so fucking tired of it! I'm tired of people getting so fucking offended or mocking me or making me a joke. And then when I defend myself they make me look like the asshole! I can't! I can't fucking do this anymore! I am the way I am because of people! Because of all the shit they've done to me, and yet I'm trapped and stuck while their enjoying life! I want to kill these people. I want to make them suffer! Why! Why the fuck does it have to be this way? I'm so fucking tired of this shit! I'm sick of being singled out! I'm sick of doing everything to be a part of something only to be kicked to the curb or made fun of or ostracized!



We do everything we can to feel included, to feel like we matter, but most people don't give a shit. They say and do whatever the fuck they want with no problem to them, and completely oblivious and uncaring about how other people are affected!
