What is my therapist allowed to do? I don't want to be locked up in a hospitalI really need help with this, my appointment is tomorrow. If I tell her I'm suicidal, is she allowed to tell anyone else in order to protect me? For example my mom or the police. Or can she only do that if I really do have a plan I'm willing to carry out? Even if I don't feel like it will get better by talking to her, I want to at least be able to tell myself I tried. Sorry if something like this doesn't belong here.
