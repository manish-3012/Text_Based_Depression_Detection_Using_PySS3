I can't fix myself. Why keep something broken around?I don't eat, I don't sleep, I can't talk to people. Every day I feel like my anxiety and depression are crushing me more and more. I don't want to go on. I'm sick of being isolated.

If you had a toaster that didn't make toast would you keep it? No. You throw it away and get something that works.

Everything I do in my shit life can be done better by somebody else. I think I'm finally going to go start the process of buying a pistol after work. Hopefully have it by the weekend. I can go out in the mountains, nobody will find me. I can finally stop being a burden.
