Iâ€™m ready to take the forever napI have no reasons to continue to hold onto the bullshit that is life. I canâ€™t be myself, my family is fucking garbage and nobody would believe me if I tried to escape them... Itâ€™s all a fucking mess. Not to mention the fact Iâ€™ve been so fucking down that I just havenâ€™t been able to do online school resulting in myself having (from what i heard last time) 27+ days of truancy. Iâ€™m ready to just fucking give up. Why even try?
