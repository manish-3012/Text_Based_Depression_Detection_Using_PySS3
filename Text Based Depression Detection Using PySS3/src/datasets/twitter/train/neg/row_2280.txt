Just don't want to try anymoreI'm just full of groans. All of my words could better be translated through a groan. All of my efforts end up in smoke. Too many personal losses have happened this year so far. I really don't want another one. I really can't take another one. I feel sick. All I do is love. All I ever did was love. Maybe some people are just meant to give more love than any single person could ever begin to reciprocate. that at least makes it feel better to me.
