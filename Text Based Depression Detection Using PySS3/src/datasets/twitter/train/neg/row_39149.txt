talk to me anyone?pretty much nothing is happening all night here. it's past 6am here. did not say a word for like 3 days. nothing but me in the room. long since i slept that my arms hurt. i tried last august and october, survived both. after those i do not really belong anywhere. i thought i was ready for a new start, but all i feel now is horribly weakened self. i used to be a bright, fun and smart kind of person they say. lost clues how it all came to this. 

so talk to me please, if you do not mind. anything is fine i guess. like any friend or family would. i will try to answer.
