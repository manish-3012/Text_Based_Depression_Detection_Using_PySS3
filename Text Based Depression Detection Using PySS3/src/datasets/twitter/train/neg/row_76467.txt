Unrequited loveIâ€™m always an option or a second choice. Thereâ€™s always somebody better then me. Iâ€™ve been in love with him for years and I canâ€™t take it anymore.   He claims he loves me but weâ€™ll never get married. Never build a life tighter. Itâ€™s not the same kind of love. It makes me want to die. Iâ€™m almost 30. How could we spend years taking care of each other and he doesnâ€™t love me back. I know Iâ€™m probably co-dependent at this point. It feels like Iâ€™m never going to be able to love someone else like this. It makes me wonder what other people have thatâ€™s so special that Iâ€™m missing. That I have to be alone. I donâ€™t want to feel anything anymore. I scrutinize everything I do like maybe thatâ€™s the reason Iâ€™m so fucking awful Iâ€™m not worth anything to anyone. Iâ€™m anxious 24/7 Iâ€™m exhausted, Iâ€™m depressed. I feel disgusting and I just want the hurt to stop. My last serious lover up and disappeared on me, and now this. What is so terrible about me that I deserve this. It makes me scratch at my skin until I bleed trying to control myself because I feel like I deserve to go in a slow horribly painful way.
