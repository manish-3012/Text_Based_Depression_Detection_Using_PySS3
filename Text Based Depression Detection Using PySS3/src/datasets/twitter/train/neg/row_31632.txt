I'm sorry if this is the wrong place.The past few nights been much harder for me than normal. Usually I just push through the night and ignore what I'm feeling but tonight the thoughts have really been taking over. I don't have anyone to talk to about what's going on. I'm a sensible person, I know I need help, but I'm afraid to reach out to anyone. I don't think I can fight this fight much longer. I can feel my mind deteriorating. I'm sorry.
