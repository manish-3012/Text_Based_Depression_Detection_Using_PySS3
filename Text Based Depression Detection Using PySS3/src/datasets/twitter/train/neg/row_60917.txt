I'm slowly losing hope in lifeI did something unforgivable to my classmate. I took a picture under her skirt and she found out and now everyone in my class hates me for it. The guilt and the fear of what i've done is slowly killing me and is getting worse every time i see her in the classroom.I tried apologizing to her but she didin't accept it . I want to end this agony. What should i do?
