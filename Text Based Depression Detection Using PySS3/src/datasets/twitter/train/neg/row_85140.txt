I already have a plan, but I'm too weak to actually do itI have already found pills in my cabinet and researched each type, and have found the best ones to overdose on (least amount of painful side effects, I plan on using some heavy pain meds). I feel like life is honestly just pointless. I don't get why I have to or would want to achieve anything when it's so futile. I'm so fucking done. I don't know if trying to overdose is a cry for help so I can be put in a psych ward or so I can actually die. I'm so done, and I honestly just want some support or something
