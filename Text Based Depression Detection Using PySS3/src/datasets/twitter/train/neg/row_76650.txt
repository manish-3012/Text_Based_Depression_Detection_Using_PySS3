Idk anymoreSo I tried taking my life twice. Since my first attempt I have been living with a couple. This couple is so dysfunctional and the woman is so delusional she wont acknowledge what she has done to me or her S.O . Its actually psychopathic. She wont admit fault even though she is 5 years older and she wont reconcile with her husband. I have had sexual relations with her because I wanted to and because I think if I didn't she would have kicked me out otherwise. I have told her this and she argues that she was confused and that if I wont get "better" she will kick me out. I am seriously so scared I think I might try again and idk if I want to. Tbh I want to live, but not like this, and not like what I've experienced in the past. I have never been so lost in my life. I am scared and I am almost ready...
