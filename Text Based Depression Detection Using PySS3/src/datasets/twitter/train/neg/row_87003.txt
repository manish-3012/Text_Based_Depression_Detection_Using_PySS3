Crisis line not even answering :/I tried to call the crisis line because I'm exhausted and I can't do this anymore and I'm completely alone. They didn't even answer. I know they're busy with people who need them more than me but it made me feel so much more alone and triggered my abandonment issues.

I thought about calling a different one but the number I called was the one for the mental health team, they've been terrible in the past but at least they have some of my medical history. My CPTSD is so easily triggered by the normal suggestions (breathing exercises, mindfulness, gratitude, etc) that trying to get help from anywhere that doesn't get that would be massively unhelpful.

I'm just so tired, I don't have the energy for any kind of grand gesture of jumping or hanging, I'll probably just work my way through my medicine box until I'm physically incapable of swallowing any more pills. I don't even know why I'm posting this tbh, nobody cares, I guess maybe I just wanted to shout into a semi-void about how much it hurts?
