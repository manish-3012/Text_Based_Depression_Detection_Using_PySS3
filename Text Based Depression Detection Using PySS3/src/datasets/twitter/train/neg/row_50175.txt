[T/W] Why is that people only care about you when you say you want to kill yourself or actually try to?They never reach out beforehand. Itâ€™s always when you say you want to or actually try to go through with it. And then itâ€™s considered selfish. But is it really? When you think people would be better off without you? Itâ€™s not like I bring any value to this world, anyway.
