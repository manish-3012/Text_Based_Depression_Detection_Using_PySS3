I made a post a few minutes ago, I didn't want to edit it so I'm just starting over.I just took a concoction of prescription/non prescription meds and washed it down with liquid melatonin and cough syrup not to die, but just because I'm so used to being suicidal, that I don't know how else to respond to the massive amounts of depression I've been feeling lately. It's manifesting physically and it's really really hard to cope with. I can't go back to work because it's so bad. Someone I needed disregarded me because someone else wanted them and I'm just sick of being 2nd to everyone. I'm never 1st. Even when I truly need them the most, when I'm struggling to leave my bed, when I can't find a reason to keep living, when I just want someone to talk to-- I'm 2nd. No matter what happens. I've never been 1st in anyone's life and I'm used to it by now, but this was the one person I thought I could talk to and confide in. Now what? I might die because I have no one left? This is so completely ridiculous and I can barely keep my eyes open.
