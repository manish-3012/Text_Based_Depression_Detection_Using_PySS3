I have been contemplating suicide lately and I am struggling with reasons not to do it.I am a trans woman who will likely never be able to afford gcs. I am in a relationship with someone who keeps demonstrating that the want a caregiver instead of a partner and who I now doubt I can ever be happy with but I love them despite this. They have explicitly stated that they would hurt them self if I left. Even if I could bring myself to leave who could love an aging, ugly trans woman who can't afford to be complete. 

I am lost I feel like my only choices in life are as a miserable glorified caregiver to a helpless man-child or a spinster freak. I'll be miserable or alone and Its hard to see a reason to keep going. I just feel hopeless.
