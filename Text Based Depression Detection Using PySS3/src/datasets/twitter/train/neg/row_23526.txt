idk anymore...idk if this is the place for me to post this but i just donâ€™t know what to do. i feel like i keep ruining every single good thing that happens to me, and itâ€™s not like i get many good things. i feel like the worst person in the world and i take advantage of everything and everyone, iâ€™m rude, iâ€™m jealous of everyone and honestly this list could go on for ages. i just donâ€™t know what to do with myself anymore iâ€™m really not going anywhere in life and iâ€™m causing so many people to dislike me because my depression comes out in anger and hostility. i really wish i had a â€œnormalâ€ brain or even just didnâ€™t think about ending myself all day long. idk what to do it seems like itâ€™d be better for everyone if i was just gone...
