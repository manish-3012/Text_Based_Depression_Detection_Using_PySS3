1 year since best friend diedI feel like joining her. I don't feel much incentive to stick around considering the world is on fire at the moment and the future isn't looking so bright. The only "person" I'm really concerned about is my cat. I'm parked next to the river, just thinking about all of the people who have jumped in before. I feel like nobody cares about how much today really hurts. I feel so alone. Thinking about ending it all honestly sounds like such a massive relief.
