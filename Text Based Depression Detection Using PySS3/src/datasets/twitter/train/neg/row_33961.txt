in my experience, there's an exhilarating feeling to almost dyingthere's a backstory, a premise to this post, but i won't talk about that today. it's long and i'll save it for another day. 

in short, i find an odd sort of joy in almost being hit by cars. the first two times were completely accidental. one time i was jogging, and a drunk driver swerved a bit too close to the wrong side of the road. i could feel the rush of air pass me, the roar of the engine, and after a brief moment of shock, i found that i enjoyed it. i fantasized about it hitting me.

the other time i was biking with friends. we needed to cross a road and a car almost came out of nowhere, almost got hit again. i wasn't hit, the driver didn't look back, and my friends freaked out but all i could think about was how exhilarating it felt. since these two days, i've been a bit too careless with streets whenever i'm a pedestrian. i like the feeling of danger. i want to get hit. 

if i were in a pedestrian vehicle accident and ended up dying, no one could say i was suicidal. it would be labeled an accident, my parents would get money, and i finally would have stopped thinking about the thousand things that haunt my existence. 

i just want to stop existing, and if a car accident worked for him, why wouldn't it work for me as well?
