I'm going to leave nowSometimes I feel like a burden... Sometimes I say things as a joke and people get serious about that, and then I end up feeling like a jerk. Sometimes I feel like it would be better if I was dead. I would be selfish and die for myself.. I don't feel like caring about my family's greif cause without knowing it, they all hurt me. 
I hate being alive. I began to hate my self in every possible way now, I don't love a single being of myself. I wouldn't feel guilty if 	I killed myself. But I feel guilty when I cut myself. I'm slowly looseing hope, I attempted suicide before, but I couldn't, my dad is the only one in the world who I love. He hurts me with his words sometimes, I know it's not his fault cause he grew up with that, he's began to be like his family, saying hurtful things, I don't consider it verbal abuse, in fact the words he says aren't severe, but anyways it still stings to hear them. I hate being alive. I just want to to die. I can't help myself cause THEY keep dragging me down again. It'd just be better if I died.
I hate being alive it's so tedious and unrewarding. It fucking sucks. I fucking loathe it.
