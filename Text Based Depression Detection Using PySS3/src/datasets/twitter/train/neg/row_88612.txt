I'll go with the stereotypical "I'm so tired."Heyyyyyy Im currently sitting next to my car waiting for a decent moment to kill myself. Ive had depression since I was 10, and diagnosed with schizophrenia since I was 15. I posted a little while ago on this subreddit, but things got better for a while, so I guess I feel silly posting here again. I'm trying to keep this short.

When I posted before, my schizophrenia had gotten really bad. I couldn't think or type very well, I was self harming, I was depressed, all that nice stuff. But things had gotten better and I'm able to function a lot better since then.

But recently, through an assult, a lot of repressed memories have appeared and holy shit, I feel lIke death all the time. I'm full blown with hallucinations, delusions, and suicidal thoughts. I've been isolated from people in general and have tried so hard, but people just don't want to see me (that's probably why I'm drawing this out, I haven't talked to anyone in a couple days.)

I'm still young and I know things can get better for a little while, but for years, things have always come back to me sobbing with a gun in my mouth hearing from hallucinations how worthless I am, which doesn't help with my nonexistent self esteem.

Im a weak, sensitive person that can't handle all of this stuff. Not to brag, but apparently my story is kind of fucked up, and people find it really facinating, but I'm so tired of it and I can't handle these things anymore. For people who go through this, you know that it's a whole lot harder than it looks.

I think to sum this all up, I wasn't meant to have a full, normal life. And I'd rather die than cry one more time in the shower.
