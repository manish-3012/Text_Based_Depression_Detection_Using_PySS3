Whats the point if youre always in pain?I have alot of medical problems and recently a tooth infection throughout my already weak body. I just wanna know what the point is to staying in this life if im gonna be hurting the whole time i live it, im only 19. Obviously medical problems arent my only reason but they really make me ask, what the fuck am i still doing here?
