I hate myself, I hate my life, I hate the world, and I want to die.So why havenâ€™t I yet?! I donâ€™t know
I just want friends who wonâ€™t leave me when I act up or shut myself away
I need people who care enough not to give up on me
I need to feel loved
But if I canâ€™t love myself, will being loved ever be enough for me? How can I love myself like this? How can ANYONE? I keep on ruminating like this and the only easy option seems to be death. But I donâ€™t want to be cowardly either. Iâ€™m driving myself insane. I need to get out of my own head. I suppose thatâ€™s why I post here instead of keeping it inside. Itâ€™s somehow better to vent to strangers than people I know.
Funny how I only meant to type a little bit and it all came spilling out. Fucking hell. Feels like Iâ€™m going mad.
