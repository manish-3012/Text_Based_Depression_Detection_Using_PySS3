Troubling Facebook posts, what should I do?One of my Facebook friends, someone I do not know well at all, recently posted two troubling messages on his wall:

First - "Suscide is always a option..."

This was a few days ago.  The quotation marks and spelling mistakes were his.  He "liked" the post.

Secondly, about an hour ago:

Tonight will be the night I go down in the books! I'm done!

I have sent messages to him asking if he's ok.  He's quite young, I think about 17 years old and gay.  I've never met him in real life, but spoken to him on the phone once and exchanged a few pleasant Facebook messages.  

I'm halfway tempted to take a look through his Facebook wall to see if I can find someone who might be one of his good friends and send them a message to check on him, but perhaps that's a bit stalkerish and over the line.  

I could use some advice.

UPDATE #1 - I messaged one person who seems to be a friend.  

UPDATE #2 - Still nothing.  From him or the friend.  I'll have to get into bed soon... Very hard to do anything else I'm so worried.  He's a kid...

UPDATE #3 - I just woke up about an hour ago.  Still nothing from him or his friend.  I googled his name and hometown and found a missing persons report for him that had been issued in September.  They eventually canceled it as they apparently found him.  After your suggestions I called the police and they are going to "make contact" but it's been 19 hours since the last message, so I'm very worried.

UPDATE #4 - I haven't heard from him directly, but I followed up with the police and they assure me that they sent someone out to check on him and that he's ok.
