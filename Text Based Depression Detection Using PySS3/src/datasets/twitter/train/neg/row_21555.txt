How do you live with the knowledge that nobody cares and you can't care about them?When you've been suicidal for so long, nobody believes in you anymore and don't expect anything out of you in the future. They've given up and look at you like at a dead man.

And when you can barely feel a whiff of emotions inside because you're so numb. Can't let anyone in and can't care about anyone because they could be your murderer (metaphorical or real) in disguise.
