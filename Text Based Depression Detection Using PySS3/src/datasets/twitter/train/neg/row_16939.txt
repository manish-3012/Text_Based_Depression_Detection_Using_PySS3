WTF is wrong with this worldWe were all forced to participate in this experience without our consent.  Society presents itself as a caring organization.  It seems to me that if it actually was then assisted suicide would be made available for anyone who desired to finally have a choice and decided they wanted to leave.  NO ONE should have to resort to dying alone with a gun in their mouth, jumping from a building, head on the traintracks, etc.  You would go to a doctor and say I've been living in a private hell for a decade and I want out.  They would shoot your full of drugs and you get to peacefully exit with a kind nurse holding your hand or something to that effect.

Now of course you would have a rigorous confirmation process to ensure it wasn't a heat of the moment decision, but at the end of day it would still be available.  There is NO SUCH PLACE anywhere on the planet, this is bullshit!  A person is just expected to keep suffering year after year after year after year.  You can't even put up an ad on Craigslist saying "hey I have money and I want to die, someone please help me make sure I don't fuck it up and I'll pay you" without the cops kicking down your door.

When people say they fear a dystopia, they don't realize they're only speaking to a further progression down the path we already exist on.  This is a dystopia right now.

I hope a 50 mile wide asteroid slams into the shithole planet and exterminates every last bit of life here so no one ever has to suffer on this level again.
