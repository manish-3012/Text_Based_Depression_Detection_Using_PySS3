Does Kindness Mean Anything Anymore?: No.In my last post to this subreddit, I asked that question. It is becoming ever so clear that the answer is no. No matter how nice you are to a person, they will still hurt you. No matter how hard you work, you can still be slammed down. No matter how hard you try, you can still fail. No matter how much you love, you can still remain unloved. My depression medication is probably just a placebo. I'll probably be alone my entire life despite my efforts to show kindness. I'll probably never find a place to stay or someone to be with. I'll probably continue to be used and thrown away. I'll probably never get to see the world. I'll probably never make and keep a true friend. All those years of excelling in school will amount to nothing. All those efforts to get better will probably just put me back in the hospital. I'm tired. I'm depressed.

I'm done...
