Even at suicide Iâ€™m a failure.2 failed suicide attempts. Iâ€™m a fucking daft loser. And please donâ€™t tell me there must be a divine purpose as to why Iâ€™m still here. Iâ€™m currently at work right now and Iâ€™m about to lose it. Iâ€™ve been staring at the screen for 2 fuckin hours and I canâ€™t make myself do anything except to post some nonsense here on reddit. Why am I still here. Someone shoot me, holy shit.
