Just about done.I could never ever explain to any of you what I have endured in my life no matter how hard I tried. 

I just want to say that the only thing that has truly stopped me from killing myself so far is the fact that I actually do want to live very badly, and that I am terrified of what might happen afterward if I did.

All I ever tried to do was a be a good person. 

I wish I could explain more why my situation is so bad I really do, I just wouldnt even know how or where to start.
