Very, very tired of everything. I just want it all to end.99% of people disgust me. Yeah, I suppose I could stop reading the news and learn how to braid rugs or some such nonsense, but that feels (to me) more cowardly and selfish than trying to know what is going on. 

We have a terrible situation on our hands on so many levels, and I am not certain that I can take it much longer. I was in an unhealthy, non resilient place long before everything got this bad. Now, I just want the end. 

I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone. I have beautiful people in my life who I donâ€™t want to inflict any amount of pain upon. But I spend an inordinate amount of time just wishing I would die.
