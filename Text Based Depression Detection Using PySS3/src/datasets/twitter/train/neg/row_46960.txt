Don't know what to doI've been staring at this page for a while now and i once posted something but i got too scared and removed it right away.

I'll just do it, sorry for my bad english.

I've veen depressed for like 4 years, and it got worse and worse and worse.. terrible anxiety, panic attacks, no self esteem, suicidal and idk what.. 
a while ago my mom sort of found out, and i went to see a psyhologist. He didn't take me serious but in the end he did sent me to a psychiatrist. Now i'm going to this woman, who prescribed me some atidepressants. 
I've been taking them for 2 weeks now. My mom is constantly worried about me and asking me how i am doing but at the same time she assumes i am not that bad and that i'm nowhere near suicide.. while i am thinking about it every day. While i almost did it last night.

my psychiatrist wants me to go back to a psychologist to talk about it, and get help... but i hate talking. I just can't say it out loud. Because i will burst out into tears and i will not do that in front of people.. i just can't. 
she keeps pushing me, my parents too. I just don't want to talk about it.

i barely sleep, school sucks and i suck at it. Every lunch i sit alone, barely say anything. Waiting untill i can go home all day. Every day all i do is do my homework and study. but i still fail. I'm just done.

I can't stand this. It's not that i want to stop trying because of school. I just can't live with myself. How can you live with yourself when you're fat, ugly, stupid, dumb, pathetic, weak, mean, and so many more things.. it is simply not possible..

I want it to stop... so much.. it has to stop.. 
those pills won't help, talking won't help. Time doesn't help. Cuts don't help. Nothings helps.
i just hurt people,make them worry. I bother them. I shouldn't be alive.

It's been 4 years  and i am done.i don't know what keeps convincing me to stay. I wish i could just do it. I want to stop so much...so much
